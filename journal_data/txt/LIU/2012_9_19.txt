In about one year from now, Long Island University will welcome its 10th President. After 27 years as University President, Dr. David J. Steinberg has announced his plan to retire at the end of the 2012-2013 academic year. 
During his tenure, Steinberg oversaw all five LIU campuses, 24,000 students, 630 full-time faculty members and many more administrators and staff employed by the university. Stein¬berg has awarded “approximately 150,000 degrees,” he said during an interview with the Pioneer’s News Editor and Assistant News Editor on Wednesday, September 12th, and has provided his campuses for a variety of faculty and student activities. 
Now, as he is gearing up for retirement, Steinberg reflected on his career. He shared his proud¬est moments and his thoughts on the rebranding initiative, which aimed to unite and integrate the university as one entity. He ex¬pressed his regrets and comments on faculty strikes, the most recent one occurring September 2011. 
The Pioneer: You’ve been President of Long Island University since 1985. How difficult was it for you to decide to retire?
Dr. David Steinberg: It’s the time. It was difficult; it’s still difficult. I loved the 27 years. I loved the opportunity and I love this place. 
TP: After such a long career with highs like the increase in enrollment and lows like faculty strikes, what made you decide to retire?
DS: Age; I still think of myself as 17, but I am not. It’s partially that, it’s partially that this is a time for someone else to take it on. While I think I still have all my marbles and my energy; I think it’s healthy for the university.
TP: What will be your role in finding the next president of LIU?
DS: None.
TP: What has been the most rewarding change you have witnessed during your time with the University?
DS: The most rewarding change…the recovery of Brooklyn. The fact that when I came there were 3,400 Brooklyn students and now they have 11,000 students. It’s a very exciting campus, as is Post. 
TP: What else has made you proud?
DS: The new rebranding and integration of the University, a process which I hope will continue after me; the development of Doctoral education at both major residential campuses; the trans¬formation of the University into one which is a full participant in the 21st century. What do I mean? Students now have iPads and if you go into the library, books are no longer nearly as important as the databases. We’ve spent $100 million in the last 10 years making this university connected to world, to itself, to each student; LIU online.
TP: Is there anything you felt you were unable to accomplish?
DS: I was unable to find the matching key that would have permitted us to keep Southhampton, which was primarily financial. I had hoped to be able to find donors who could and would give massive gifts to transform it to give more scholarship dollars to the students. 
I think those two more than any other would be on the debit side. We have been very successful; we have the Pratt Gym and the Kahn Discovery Hall. We spent a quarter of a billion dollars rebuilding Brooklyn and about $150 to $200 million here at Post. So, it’s not that a lot of things haven’t happened, but I could never find that individual who would put his name or her name on the University. 
TP: What are your thoughts on the open forum process regarding the presidential search? 
DS: I think it’s right-on. Go and speak up. 
TP: What are plans for retirement?
DS: Uncertain. I have to have shoulder surgery, so I will go through the bubble by having to have my shoulder taken care of…I don’t know yet.
TP: You live on campus. How did you like that? How do you feel about moving off campus?
DS: I’m very sad; it’s a beautiful house. We built it for the university and we use it a great deal.
TP: How will you be involved with the University after you retire?
DS: Unclear; it depends on who my successor is. 
TP: How would you describe yourself to students who don’t know who you are?
DS: Talkative, energetic, committed, and hopefully caring. I’ll leave it to others to go most of the way; they may say noisy. 
TP: You said in your letter to Edward Travaglianti, “I have given Long Island University every fiber of my being.” What examples can you give to put this statement into perspective?
DS: Being a college president is to be on 24/7. There’s a Tilles concert on a Friday night, home¬coming on Saturday, Father Ted has something going on; I’m in Brooklyn because we are at the Barclay Center. You either really marry the job or you can’t do the job. There are 185,000 or more alums, there are 24,000 students; you can’t meet them all, but you do your best. I’ve been on call and if you ask my secretary, she’ll probably say, “He busts his chops.” 
TP: The press release announcing your retirement attributes a 19,000 to 24,000-enrollment rise. Information the Pioneer has reported has indicated enrollment has dropped recently. Can you explain whether there has truly been a rise? 
DS: There has been enrollment contraction; a lot of students can’t afford to come. We are struggling because the world outside is a complicated and difficult place. 
TP: How have you tried to “make a quality private education affordable”? 
DS: Over the last four years since the economic crisis the amount of University money put into scholarships has gone from $60 to $100 million and that has been done at the expense of a lot of other things; salary increases, new equipment, better dorms. Our goal is to raise money to create an endowed scholarship programs. 
TP: What will you miss the most about being President of the University? What won’t you miss?
DS: I’ll miss the people—you work intensely with a lot of people here. I’ll guess there will be a certain relief that the obligation of managing is over. Giving it up means some of the burden off your back. 
TP: What are some things people would be surprised to know about the job of the LIU President?
DS: How diverse it is. How constantly the problems, opportunities and rewards change. 
TP: What do you hope students carry with them while attending LIU and even after graduating?
DS: An excitement for learning, an opportunity to find out who they really are, a chance to explore what’s beautiful in life, a chance to respect other, basic values, a capacity to write and speak well and to become thoughtful people. 
TP: There have been faculty strikes during your time as President. What do you think is the current state of the faculty?
DS: Well, I think they would have preferred to get a raise… and they didn’t this time. There is an argument, and I was a member of the faculty, so I understand that argument. The faculty is the University. 
The faculty is critical and they are central to the mission of delivering education. However, there’s another part: there’s this $450 million business that has to go on and the students need to eat 21 meals if they are living here and have clean bedrooms. 
To use a phrase I often use with the faculty; the students are the subject of the sentence of this university, the rest of us are in the predicate. 
TP: The rebranding seems to have been your final big initiative. What are your thoughts on the cost and effectiveness of the University’s new identity?
DS: I think it’s wonderful. It’s been years in the coming and I’m pleased it has been able to be done on my watch. First of all, the tag¬line is exactly our mission—“Find out how good you really are.”
The rebranding is part of the long-term mission, which is to bring the University together. We are one university, one president, one board of trustees, and one budget.
TP: What have you done to improve relations between Post and the community?
DS: We’ve given a lot of time and effort to it. The Tilles Center is one; allowing the local community to use the Pratt Center is another; Hutton House is the third. We give not-for-credit courses, continuing education. All of these are designed to say to the community, “we are a part of you, we’re a contribution to you.” 
We’ve had a major ongoing multi-year effort with the West¬bury School District. Taking ideas of a remarkable black psychiatrist at Yale, who is the one who originally coined the phrase, “It takes a village to educate a child.” In his class was Hillary Clinton, who gives him credit for the idea. We have been using his theories to try to improve the quality of education at the Westbury School District, which was one of the lowest and now is much, much better. 
TP: What type of successor do you envision for the university?
DS: Better than me, I hope…I don’t know. These open forums are directly related to try to find the skills that are more impor¬tant than other skills. What are we looking for? Okay, so you start with a description no one can meet. You got to be good at this and good at that, and then low-and-behold you find some-one who can’t walk on water. 
So, what do you trade away to get at something else? What do you think is most important in the successor? Then you go and look for it and try to get as close as possible to that goal. 
TP: Tuition has risen during your tenure. Why has that been?
DS: How else are we going to pay the increases that the faculty demand, that our employees that give 70 hours a week to run the admissions office, counsel or cut the grass? Tuition has risen; financial aid has risen. Seventy percent of the University’s budget is people. 
TP: What does the future hold for you?
DS: Good health and long life. A chance to be with a lot of grand¬children, spend time with my wife…I don’t know. 
TP: Will you visit the University often?
DS: I think it’s very important for my successor to have a lot of room. The last thing that I would want and she or he would want is me in the way. So, will I be here? I hope so. Will I feel comfortable coming back? I hope so. So, I hope I will be welcomed back and that people will be pleased to see me and that would be sufficient.

Each academic year, LIU Post student organizations hand the torch over to a new set of officers. The Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA), the student version of The Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), the nation’s largest network of public relations and communications professionals, is no exception. 
This year, for the first time, the PRSSA will be taking members on field trips and unifying the look and recognition of the organization through social media. 
“The PRSA is an organization to be a part of if you want to become an accomplished professional in the industry,” said senior and PRSSA President Bernie Fabig, “So it makes perfect sense to become part of the PRSSA and have that competitive edge when applying for jobs after graduation. [Membership] is regarded highly by the industry and will help you stand out because the organization upholds ethical values, provides training, and advocates for public relations services.” 
On November 16, the PRSSA will be taking a day trip to New York City to visit Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations and integrated marketing agency, through the courtesy of Professor Edward Lansdale, the former deputy director of the New York office’s Corporate Group. 
“I was teaching a course on the business-side of public relations this spring,” said Lansdale, “I wondered if my students would have any interest in getting a bit of a first-hand look at a PR business operation, namely a PR agency office. Out of that, this upcoming visit was born.” 
Students are scheduled to tour the offices and be given brief overviews from the professionals of each department. 
“I am incredibly excited for the trip to Fleishman-Hillard because it is the perfect way to gain a real world insight,” said senior Public Relations major Ashley Abney, “I expect to learn a tremendous amount of information from the young associates who spend their days working hard on projects I hope to work on some day.” 
“I took Business of Public Relations last spring,” said junior Public Relations major Christine Sammarco, “Professor Lansdale’s real world experience from when he worked at Fleishman-Hillard was a big part of the course. I enjoyed the refreshing advice from his professional background.”
For the spring, a trip to Business Wire, the global market leader in commercial press release distribution, is planned. Scheduled to launch this year is an official PRSSA Facebook page where members plan to post photos from chapter activities and notify members of events. 
“Communication via social media sites like Facebook and Twitter has become increasingly prevalent and even necessary for public relations professionals,” said senior and PRSSA Co-Publicity Director Marisa Anziano. “It is such a simple, yet effective way to deliver a message directly to your audience.” 
Each semester, open lunches are held during Common Hour for PRSSA members to speak with a variety of public relations professionals. This fall, guest speakers include Rita Langdon, Associate Provost of LIU Post on October 10, Jacqueline Mink Cooper, Marketing Director of FM Brush Company on October 24, Sherry Goldman, President of Goldman Communications on November 7, and Theresa Jacobellis, Director of Public and External Affairs of Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center, on November 14. 
“Being an active member of the PRSSA and listening to alumni speak at our open lunches about their experiences finding work in the real world has opened my eyes,” said senior and PRSSA Co-Vice President Lindsay Quinn.
Open to all majors, minors and other LIU Post students who have taken at least one public relations course, PRSSA membership according to the PRSSA.org provides access to internships, jobs, and scholarships. The organization’s first meeting is on Wednesday, September 26, during Common Hour in Hillwood 106. For more information, students may contact the PRSSA at LIU PostPRSSA@gmail.com or follow the PRSSA on Twitter at @LIUPostPRSSA

Before entering college, some students may have certain expectations of campus nightlife and partying all night in dorm rooms. Do these expectations meet reality? Many freshmen are aware that a lot of partying goes on, but maybe did not expect the parties to be never-ending. “Dorm life my freshman year was worse than I expected. I didn’t think that there would be parties all the time, on the weekdays and weekend,” said Cara Frank, a sophomore broadcasting major. Frank lived in Riggs Hall her freshman year, then moved to Brookville Hall after she could not take the constant noise and partying. The reality for others is different. “I always see wild, out of control college frat parties on T.V. and movies but I never experienced that (at Post),” said Matt Mason, a senior criminal justice major. Maybe the reason Mason has never seen this is because he lived in Suffolk Hall, the cam¬pus quiet dorm for four years. Many residents feel the amount of parties varies depending on what dorm building they live in at LIU Post. 
If you live at LIU Post, you may have noticed that there are much fewer people on campus during the weekend. Many people who live nearby go home. There are several different reasons why. Immanelle Roma, a senior music education major, says he goes home every weekend for a better food selection and to spend time with his family. “I stayed home one weekend and I was losing my mind, I was really bored,” said Roma. He said he spent most of the weekend in his dorm room in Suffolk Hall doing homework and watching T.V. “No one I know stays on the weekend, only international and out of state students do,” said Roma.
Some feel that students are not taking advantage of the college atmosphere. “I wonder if the freshmen today are still in awe, or appreciate everything that their exposed to,” said Chris Kwozko, a graduate student studying English education. 
Kwozko lived on campus for five years and was a resident assistant for three of them. He says he thinks a student’s experience living at LIU Post depends on what dorm building you are in. Kwozko has lived in Brookville Hall, Nassau Hall and Riggs Hall. “The frequency and quality of parties are now inconsistent. “When I was a freshman, we knew who to expect to throw parties,” said Kwozko. 
Some residents say there weren’t many parties the first week of the semester. “The first weekend of school I didn’t see any parties in my dorm building, but during the next few weeks there will be more parties,” said Frank. She says she thinks that it was quiet in her dorm building, Brookville, because people recently moved in and are still adjusting. Frank says she didn’t expect so many people to go home the first weekend after school started. She said her roommate and friends all left campus. This seems to be a reoccurring trend at LIU Post.
Maethinee Koonvisal, a senior biology major, says she goes home to Jackson Heights, New York about every two weeks, mostly so she can cook for herself and eat anytime she wants. Winnick, the school cafeteria, is open fewer hours on the weekends than during the week. “It’s not always boring on the weekends because sometimes there are campus events but all my friends usually go home,” said Koonvisal. Ken Zhou, a senior psychology major, says he goes home if there are no campus events or activities going on. He says it is quick and easy for him to go to his house in Brooklyn. 
LIU Post has several events on campus. However, not many of them are during the weekend. “I think if they had more events on campus it would keep people here on the weekends,” said Koonvisal. She says she would like to see more trips off campus and in the city as well. Mason and Zhou agree, saying that they would like to see more activities and events during the weekend.
Students occasionally get bored on other college campuses as well. Mason transferred from Mitchell College in New London, Connecticut. Mason said the college was located in a small town with hardly anything around it. People mostly hung out in their rooms and threw parties in the dorm building, he said. Zhou transferred from St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. St. Lawrence has a quiet campus and is located in a small town. However, anything else is a half an hour drive away, said Zhou. It is very difficult for any college campus to be exciting twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. 
“LIU has a lot more activities, events and clubs on campus than my previous school,” said Mason. He says he is involved on campus by being part of the Newmen Club and went to campus events such as the Back to School BBQ on September 4th and the movie in Hillwood Cinema on September 6th. Association for Campus Programming advertises recent events on posters and fliers in Hillwood and all over campus.
Zhou feels differently. “If I had to choose between the two schools for graduate school, I would choose St. Lawrence because it has more campus events and more of a variety of food and dorm buildings,” Zhou said. He says he would like to see more activities on the weekends and a better selection of food at LIU Post.
Others see LIU Post as a highlight in their lives. “I have a sense of pride for this college, it has taken me on the journey I wanted to go on,” said Kwozko. Mason also feels grateful to be at LIU Post. He said he decided to go to LIU Post since he was familiar with the area and it was about a half an hour away from home. “Overall, I think that LIU is the better college experience (compared to Mitchell College) and I would recommend it,” said Mason. 
Many students feel that some do not appreciate what is right in front of them. “I feel like students take their experience here for granted by thinking it’s boring,” said Kwozko.
Whether students decide to stay on campus or go home for the weekend, the reality is they are only in college once, so everyone should enjoy it! Students should experience as much as they can while they are here, so they can leave with happy memories, good friends and a well-earned college degree. 
To find out about events happening this week on campus, check out page 2 of this week’s Pioneer. There are events listed each week and the Pioneer comes out every Wednesday.

On September 12, Apple announced the arrival of iPhone 5, the thinnest and lightest iPhone completely redesigned to feature a 4-inch Retina display, an A6 chip for fast performance, ultrafast wireless technology, and better battery life.
According to a press release from Apple, the iPhone 5 comes with iOS 6, the world’s most advanced mobile operating system with over 200 new features including the all new Maps app, Facebook integration, Passbook organization, and more Siri features and languages. The new body is 18 percent thinner and 20 percent lighter than the iPhone 4S. The taller 4-inch Retina display delivers more pixels than the iPhone 4S allowing one hand to tap, type, and scroll. The 8 megapixel iSight camera is 25 percent smaller than the cam-era in iPhone 4S. The new panorama feature lets you capture panorama images of up to 28 megapixels by simply moving the camera across a scene in one smooth motion. New video features include improved stabilization, video face detection for up to 10 faces, and the ability to take still photos as you record. 
One of the major drawbacks to the new iPhone is its Lightning connector that is smaller than the previous connector. The all-digital connector features an adaptive interface that uses only the signals that each accessory requires. This means all Apple accessories such as the iDock are no longer compatible with the new iPhone. However, a Lightning-to-30-pin Adapter is available to connect the iPhone 5 to legacy 30-pin accessories. This adapter will set you back an extra $39 because it is not included in the box. It may pose a problem working and fitting in with all other accessories. The iPhone 4S will now be available for just $99 and iPhone 4 will be available for free with a two-year contract for those who do not want to upgrade their entire Apple collection. The iOS 6 software will be available on September 19th as a free software update for current users. 
The iPhone 5 comes in either white & silver or black & slate, and will be available in the US on September 28th on the AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon Wireless networks for a suggested re-tail price of $199 for the 16GB model, $299 for the 32GB model, and $399 for the 64GB model. Pre-orders began on September 14th.

If you hear a foreign language on campus, there is a good chance that it is Scandinavian. Vikings, IKEA, and the guy who plays Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones all may come to mind when you think of Scandinavia, but there is a sprawling culture behind your classmates and their homelands that may be worth a visit. 
Denmark is widely considered to be one of the happiest places in the world. When visiting the small coastal country, which sits right above Germany, neighboring Sweden and Norway, lots of deep questions rattled in my jet-lagged head. Why are the Danes so happy? What is so different from the United States? Are Americans consuming too many Big Macs and Red Bulls to just relax for a bit and smell the metaphorical cup of coffee in the morning?
I was sipping a real-life cappuccino at one of the quaint coffeehouses in Copenhagen when I found my answer. Maybe it was just the caffeine rush, but the city around me was very much alive and well. There is a word in Danish that does not have a real English definition other than “a feeling of coziness, well-being, or contentment” called hygge that sums up how I felt. The populace of Denmark and other parts of Scandinavia are reserved in a positive way. They generally don’t feel like they are better than anyone else. This attitude (along with bushels of attractive people, but we won’t get into that) creates a feeling of well being. It was this feeling that exuded a sense of happiness. 
Of course, there were many less abstract things to experience in Denmark. Copenhagen is the larg¬est city and capital where, centuries ago, fishermen established a major trade outpost. In modern times, Copenhagen has a mix of sleek minimalist architecture and Dutch Baroque styled brick buildings with pastel colors. You can take a tour around the city and see Alalienborg Palace at the city center, the huge dome of Frederik’s Church, Christiansborg Palace on the island of Slotsholmen, or the National Museum. If you can book a bed and breakfast arrangement or stay with a host family like I did, make sure to have a home cooked meal. The Danes enjoy local flavors such as frikadeller (pork meatballs) and open faced sandwiches called Smørrebrød. For breakfast, the Danes typically eat a healthy bowl of muesli (oats often served with milk or yogurt) and fruit. 
You may want to strap on your training wheels and get ready for some biking to try out the Danish lifestyle. The Danes are very eco-friendly, utilizing alternative energy for their electricity, especially in Copenhagen, where wind turbines graze the horizon and a large part of the workforce takes a bike to work instead of a car. People who enjoy the outdoors will delight in the Tivoli Gardens, an amusement park that opened in the mid-19th century. Built in 1843, Tivoli is the second oldest amusement park in the world influencing the likes of Walt Disney. Street festivals are common in the summer months while the nearby town of Roskilde is home to the renowned Roskilde Festival held in June or July. The festival has run since the 1970’s and has had guests such as Pearl Jam, Band of Horses, Kanye West, and Coldplay. If you fill up your days with the many activities in the city of Copenhagen and the near vicinity, you may find yourself feeling as content, or hygge, as the Danes would say. I highly recommend a visit to the city of Copenhagen, the country of Denmark and the Scandinavian region!

The LIU Post football team won its second consecutive game of the 2012 season on Saturday, September 15, when it beat the Cheyney University Wolves (1-2) by a score of 45-10. With this win, the Pioneers are now 1-0 within the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC). 
Pioneers sophomore quarter¬back Steven Laurino gave an excel¬lent follow-up performance against Cheyney, a week after putting on a show both through the air and on the ground against Clarion University. Against the Wolves, in addition to rushing for one touchdown, Laurino went 27-35 and threw for 239 yards and two touchdowns. Through the first two games of the season, Laurino has rushed for four touchdowns and thrown for five, all while not having a single turnover. 
The Pioneers got off to a bit of slow start, as the score at the end of the first quarter was 8-3 in favor of LIU Post. The Laurino brothers connected for the first score of the game as quarterback, Steven, aired it out 17 yards to senior wide receiver, Grayson. Last week, the brothers were unable to get on the same page, and Grayson was held without a catch against Clarion. However, Grayson bounced back and had six catches for 77 yards and one touch¬down against Cheyney. 
The Pioneers tacked on two scores in the second quarter to move ahead of the Wolves 22-3 entering halftime. Following a nine play, 53-yard drive, Steven Laurino rushed for a touchdown from two yards out to give the Pioneers a 15-3 lead. After that, the Pioneers added seven more points capped off by a seven-yard scamper by senior running back Thomas Beverly. 
In the third quarter, the Pioneers would add on 10 more points, highlighted by a five-yard touchdown run by junior running back Jeff Mack. With just over one minute left in the third quarter, the Wolves got its only taste of the end zone when freshman quarterback Blaze Wasserleben broke away from the Pioneers defense and ran 70 yards for a touch-down. With that score, the Pioneers led 32-10 heading into the fourth quarter. 
Laurino would tack on another passing touchdown to start the fourth quarter of play. The beneficiary this time was senior wide receiver Ryan Derham on a five-yard completion. After backup sophomore quarterback Tyler Heuer’s 14-yard rushing touchdown made the score 45-10, neither team would score for the remainder of the game. 
The Pioneers, once again, won the turnover battle. The Pioneers defense forced four turnovers, while the offense did not lose the ball once throughout the duration of the game. “You’re going to win foot¬ball games if you create turnovers and win the turnover battle,” said Pioneers head coach Bryan Collins. Also, the Pioneers were efficient on third downs for the afternoon going 8-14. 
The Pioneers defense was superb on Saturday making it almost impossible for the Wolves to find any offensive rhythm. Senior defensive back Antonio Powell-Fields had one interception and seven tackles. On the defensive line, sophomore defensive linemen Joe Thompson and David Sumter were constantly around the ball causing havoc. Thompson recorded at least one sack in back-to-back games, while Sumter notched seven tackles. Also, junior linebacker Rob Bright had six tackles for the second game in a row. 
“We’re athletic up front. Joe Thompson has a great get-off. He’s got some good moves. He’s long and lean. He’s athletic and I think he’s going to create problems at the tackle position as well as David Sumter,” said Collins. “I think those two are going to be athletic ends that are going to continue to get pressure up front.” 
The Pioneers next game is on Saturday, September 22, at 1 p.m. at Hickox Field against the 3-0 Bloomsburg University Huskies. The Huskies are coming off a 44-37 victory over Kutztown University. The Pioneers won the most recent matchup against the Huskies last year on October 29 by a score of 24-21. On the road and in a blizzard, the Pioneers upset the second-ranked Huskies to snap a four-game losing streak against the team. 
Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org to hear all the coverage for the game. Pregame starts at 12:30 p.m. and kickoff is scheduled for 1:00 p.m.

The LIU Post Women’s soccer team is off to a good start for the 2012 season. Freshman Susanne Vistnes scored two goals to knock off the Holy Family University Tigers, on Wednesday, September 12. 
Vistnes and junior Alexa Niciforo led the Pioneers to the win on Wednesday, by linking up on both goals. Niciforo found Vistnes in the box four minutes into the game and the freshman striker one-timed the ball into the net. However, the Tigers got on the board just four minutes later, tying the game at 1-1.
With ten minutes remaining in the first half, Vistnes scored again, giving the Pioneers the lead with a shot from 10 yards out. Niciforo assisted on this goal as well. The second half was even, but the Pioneers managed to play strong defensively and claim the 2-1 win.
“A great team performance,” said Vistnes after the game, “We bought into the game plan, and therefore we came away with the win.” 
She stands with four goals and one assist after the first five games of the season. It seems like the link between Vistnes and last year’s top scorer Niciforo will lead to many goals for the Pioneers this season.
“It is so easy to play with Alexa,” Vistnes explained, “We have a great understanding, and hopefully it will lead us to more good results” 
On Saturday, September 15, the Pioneers undefeated streak came to an end after falling to the Caldwell College Cougars 3-2 in heart¬breaking fashion. The Pioneers jumped to an early lead just five minutes into the game off a goal from freshman Hanna Westerling. In the 43rd minute senior Prudence Rystrom extended the Pioneers’ lead to 2-0. However, in the second half, three unanswered goals by the Cougars would lead to the Pioneers first loss of the season. 
Despite the loss, the Pioneers move to 4-1-1 for the season, and have gotten off to a better start than last year, when the team started with a 3-2 record after five games. 
The women’s soccer team is looking to redeem themselves after last season. The team lost to Dowling College in the conference semi-finals and finished the season with a 9-5-2 record. Head Coach Marc Dawson has brought in a good recruiting class before this season, including aforementioned Vistnes and Swedish midfielder Hanna Westerling, who both seem to be making a big impact on this year’s squad.
Westerling has scored three goals in her first five games, and is off to a great start in her collegiate career. “Hanna has been amazing, and if she keeps using her speed and technique, she will be a very important player for us,” said Vistnes.
The Pioneers’ will host the Dowling College Golden Lions on Wednesday, September 19, at 4 p.m.

The LIU Post Pioneers men’s soccer team remains undefeated after the first six games of the season. Led by the performance of freshman midfielder Per Forgaard on Wednesday, September 12, LIU Post defeat¬ed Nyack College 3-0 and then followed that up with a 3-1 win over the University of the District of Columbia. 
In Wednesday’s victory over Nyack, Forgaard put the Pioneers ahead early in the contest. In the 23rd minute the Norwegian midfielder headed the ball off a cross from freshman back Johan Wallin. LIU Post would get a second goal before the half ended, but it would not come off the foot of a Pioneer player. With seven minutes left in the half, Nyack scored on its own goal to give the Pioneers a 2-0 advantage going into halftime. 
The Pioneers would tack on another goal in the second half. Sophomore forward Eivind Aus¬tboe one-touched the ball into the net off a cross from Forgaard to seal the victory for LIU Post.
On Saturday, September 15, the Pioneers had its first conference victory when the team defeated UDC 4-2. LIU Post scored the game’s first goal in the 30th minute off a rebound shot from Austboe. Five minutes later, UDC tied the game at one as freshman forward Moussa Traore headed the ball past the Pioneer keeper. Austboe put his team back in the lead after he was awarded a penalty kick in the 43rd minute and converted to make it 2-1 Pioneers. 
LIU Post managed to cushion its lead midway into the second half. Senior forward Andreas Olson scored in the 60th minute on a breakaway to make it 3-1. But UDC would respond in the 70th minute cutting the Pioneers two-goal lead to just one. However, freshman mid-fielder Matias Ruiz would give the Pioneers a two-goal advantage once again after he scored his first collegiate goal in the 89th minute to secure the win for LIU Post. 
The Pioneers held the shots advantage 21-11 against UDC and a 7-1 differential in corner kicks. Junior keeper Marco Jorgensen made just one save for the Pioneers in the win, while his UDC counterpart turned away six shots. 
LIU Post’s next game is at home on Wednesday, September 19, at 4:30 p.m., when it hosts Dowling College.

The LIU Post women’s field hockey team had a strong second half effort to come back and beat number 10 East Stroudsburg University by a score of 5-4 in the PSAC opener on Tuesday, September 11, at Whitenight Field.
The eighth-ranked Pioneers went on the road with the hopes of starting PSAC division play with a win. However, the game started out in the worst possible way for the Pioneers as the Warriors of East Stroudsburg scored the game’s first goal only four minutes into the contest. The Pioneers were able to answer back, with freshman defender Heidi Schaffner and freshman forward Keliann Margiotta both scoring to put the Pioneers in front by the 30-minute mark. The Warriors were able to turn the game around yet again, as they scored two goals before halftime. 
In the second half, the Warriors continued to control the game, but the Pioneers found the back of the net on three occasions as sophomore forward Lyn Marie Wilson, Margiotta, and junior forward Carlee Dragon scored one each to give the Pioneers the 5-3 lead. The Warriors managed to get another goal with one minute remaining, but the Pioneers took home a strong 5-4 win on the road.
Senior Ashley Oracewski said that the Pioneers showed the biggest heart and desire, and therefore, they won the tight game. She also pointed out another factor for the win saying, “We were able to score goals when we needed to and that was the key component to winning that game.” 
The Pioneers did suffer its first loss of the season on Friday, September 14, when it fell to Shippensburg University by a score of 3-2. Dragon accounted for the only two goals for the Pioneers in the loss. 
The Pioneers quickly forgot the loss the following day when the team defeated Mansfield University by a score of 7-1. Margiotta and Dragon each had three goals and fresh¬man forward Claire Steijn added her first goal of the year in the victory. Margiotta now has eight goals for the year and Dragon has scored a goal in every game of the year, giving her a total of nine goals for the season so far. 
Oracewski is positive when looking for¬ward to the rest of the season: “If we continue to work hard and improve our skills every day at practice, we can continue to be victorious this season.”

The Sims franchise, over the last several expansions, has been met with mixed reviews mainly because of its content and retail price. After the Sims 3 Ambitions and the Late Night expansion in 2010, the developers have been giving players light expansions with limited content to make it worthwhile. Though some of the expansions such as becoming a master magician are fun and all, you have to pay full price, around $40, to get this kind of content. 
However, the developers have brought us a new magic-based expansion called Sims 3 Super-natural. There are so many new items, customization of the houses, and even a new magic-based zone where you find secret ingredients for potions and have mini quests to learn new potions and spells. You could even have a pet dragon! 
In Sims Supernatural, you can choose to be five different otherworldly beings, a werewolf, a witch, a fairy, a vampire, and a ghost. Each character has its own special abilities and powers which makes playing either one a different overall experience. First, the witch obviously casts spells and makes potions. You start off and as you level up, you learn more complicated spells and a potion to turn other Sims into zombies. The werewolf and vampire are pretty much what you would expect because both can bite other Sims to turn them into creatures of the night. The werewolf turns into his or her wolf form during the full moon which happens every three days in game time. The most unique character in the game has to be the fairy that has wings which are customizable to a degree. The fairy also has interesting powers to prank other Sims or gives out blessings, such as beauty. Finally, the ghost basically acts like a normal Sims character but can terrify other Sims and cause mayhem. 
There are also neat things to do like flying a broom to work or becoming a fortune teller as a career. When the full moon rises, all the were¬wolves turn into their alter egos and zombies randomly come out of the ground. It’s pretty fun but it gets a little old. 
The new in-game clothing options are pretty poor. Some of it was cool like torn tee-shirts and a witch’s hat but none of the clothing really stood out as being “supernatural” and weird which I was hoping it would be. The new items and furniture absolutely are barren. Sure there are wands, brooms, a crafting table for potions, and an alter bed for the vampire, but there is no gothic looking furniture at all. You get 50’s style furnishing like a mint-green refrigerator. What’s supernatural about tacky 50’s furniture? The worst part is that there are no supernatural wallpaper or floor options. So you’ll have an average looking house with a randomly placed potion lab. 
The zombie option is interesting and adds a little more flavor to the overall supernatural experience but it’s like this idea was slapped into the game for marketing purposes. All the zombies do is walk around and try to attack other Sims, but they can’t even break into houses or swarm the town. It felt so anti-climatic to finally make a potion to turn someone into a zombie, and then see it wasn’t what you were hoping. To stop the zombies, all you have to do is make a potion to turn them back into humans. It could have been so much more like a real apocalyptic scenario and you and other supernaturals would have to stop it using magic and strategy. Instead it’s like, “Oh look, there are zombies around and biting people. Let’s get inside the house and wait for them to leave.” It’s so lazy and boring that I felt cheated. 
The Sims 3 Supernatural once again suffers from giving us cool mechanics and characters but poor items and content. Without any real reward or cool things to do after you level up your character, you’ll get tired of this game pretty quickly. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a fun addition to the Sims 3 series, especially for huge fans. It’s merely an average game that adds some good content but unfortunately fails in living up to expectations for a 6.2/10.

Many students have abandoned voting because of the current economic crisis, according to an article in The New York Times by Susan Saulny in July of 2012 entitled ‘Stung by Recession, Young Voters Shed Image as Obama Brigade.’ The votes of college students and other first time voters are crucial to the Presidential election because we are a large percentage of the population with the ability to change to vote. In 2008, the vote of college students significantly impacted Barack Obama’s bid for office ac-cording to USA Today’s article in January of 2012 ‘Economy, New Voting Laws Will Impact Youth Vote in 2012 Elections.’ We have the power to do the same in November, but many students seem to have given up on political leaders.
Their doubts are understandable. Why vote? Why bother if things aren’t going to change? These are the questions on the minds of some young voters. 
The truth is, only four years have passed since Obama took over our dramatic economic decline. Even though we are still going through tough times, our nation has improved. In October 2009, the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent, now it has decreased to approximately 8.1 percent ac¬cording to the Bureau of Labor statistics. In his article ‘Swift Rescue in U.S. Provides Lessons for Europe,’ Lee Sachs, an investment banking writer for the New York Times, stated, “Policy makers here still have more work to do to strengthen the economy and promote job growth.” He also stated that in 2008 and 2009 politicians got to work quickly on the economy, and if they wouldn’t have done so, America could have suffered greater losses and unemployment rates. Hence, it was due to voters coming together in the election of 2008 that ultimately changed the direction of the U.S. 
However, only three years have passed since the peak of the recession, which some would say is not enough time to resolve the economic crisis we still face today. This is a component driving the importance for students to take initiative and vote. The economic direction of the U.S. is in the hands of its citizens. 
In essence, we need to make a decision. Voting, believe it or not, gives us a stronger voice. There are approximately 30 million college students in America, according to the National Center for Labor Statistics, Presidential candidates see the demographic of those who vote, and if they see a strong number of college students, they will consider policies in our favor because we were the ones who potentially helped that leader get into office. 
When it comes to voting, many of us may feel like we don’t matter. We do; we just need to speak louder. Voting is not only about making a decision regarding where you want the future of your country to go, it is about taking initiative. It is about standing up and making an educated decision that will inevitably impact us as a nation, especially us under-employed students who will one day need health care and jobs we can depend on. Not to mention that one day we will need to pay our loans back to the banks that are already increasing our annual percentage rates. 
Because New York does not currently have the mandatory photo ID laws that are being practiced in some states for this election, students from other states can register and vote freely without being denied at the polls for not having New York State Identification. If you are registered to vote in another state, Google your state policies to find out how you can cast an absentee ballot. If you do so, please make sure your ballot isn’t received after Election Day. For information and help deciding where to vote, visit www.countmore.org. For more information on deadlines, please visit http://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingDeadlines.html. To register to vote online, visit www.rockthevote.com. Vote 2012.

There are a good number of students who come into college that are not virgins. I’m not judging, I was not a virgin my freshman year. Most of us go from living with our parents where we have our own room and at least the impression of privacy, to college where dormers share a room with another student. So, what do you do when you find yourself living in a very small room with another person? What are the dorm room rules?
I’ve heard some disturbing stories of people with very inconsiderate roommates when it comes to the intimacy department. It’s a very awkward situation; You wake up in the middle of the night to your roommate getting down and dirty with someone less than five feet away from you. It would be even more uncomfortable if you were to say something right then and there. So what are you supposed to do? Just sit there in silence and pray to God or whoever it is that you pray to that it’s going to be over soon? Not cool.
Beyond that, what would possess someone to even do that in the first place? Who wants their business all out in the open like that? Certainly not me, that’s for sure. It’s actually pretty disgusting. We all have needs, I get that. However, there’s a time and place for things and while your roommate is “asleep” in a bed that’s an arms reach away from you is not it.
Figure out your roommates schedule, and plan your extra curricular activities (or booty calls) accordingly. Or even tell you room¬mate, “Hey listen, I’m going to need the room to myself for a little bit tonight. Is that ok?” It’s just common courtesy.
It’s an uncomfortable subject to bring up, especially if you don’t know your roommate that well. If you find yourself in a situation like this, what do you say? “Hey, do me a favor and stop having sex with me in the room?” Awkward…. 
Bottom line is having some respect. One, you shouldn’t want to have sex with a third party listening or watching the whole thing. Two, figure out an arrangement with your roommate if you have to.

College is all about using your time wisely. From getting to class on time, going to the gym, and getting your laundry done, everything requires consistent scheduling. For the freshmen here at LIU Post, time management may seem like a daunting task, but know that with some simple tips and planning it can be easily reached. 
One of the best ways to man¬age your daily routine is to create a schedule, either in a notebook, on your phone, or on your computer. Write down your class times and then write down some things to do in between, such as getting something to eat and when to meet up with friends. 
However, as your semester progresses, attending meetings for clubs and organizations you want to be a part of also becomes part of your routine. A great piece of advice is to make sure you’re committing to clubs that you really want to be a part of. You shouldn’t spread yourself too thin, otherwise you will end up with more than you can handle. The last thing you want is to have to juggle attending a club event, having a paper due and still having to do laundry, all in one day. 
Cathleen Joseph, a senior studying digital art and design, shares her advice on time management in college: “The key to success during college is to do everything in moderation. It’s perfectly fine to have fun, but don’t waste your tuition money by not studying and taking care of your daily responsibilities. Remember there are only twenty-four hours in a day, so use them wisely.” 
Finally, the best thing you can do to manage your schedule is to make time for yourself. Part of college is self improvement and learning more about what interests you as an individual. Everyday set at least an hour aside for yourself and do something that you enjoy that relieves stress from the day. Part of the busy lifestyle which comes when starting college is to be able to find time to enjoy life, all you have accomplished and most importantly all you are still accomplishing. Whether it’s a good book or music, it’s all a part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle as an adult. 
College is the beginning to creating your life and how you want to run it without parents or guardians around to guide you step by step. Your college experience depends on what you make of it.

With bare walls, little furniture, and limited space, dorm rooms don’t always look too inviting. So what can be done to make it feel more like your room? 
Several stores, including IKEA, Walmart, and Target, offer affordable solutions. Find some special pieces at Urban Outfitters, Century 21, and various online stores, including dormify.com, and familydollar.com. Here are some easy steps to make your dorm room look better: 
1. Decorate your white walls with posters. Allposters.com offers thousands of motifs from starting price of $5.99. Either you can wake up to the New York City skyline, the image of a sunny beach, or maybe the logo of your favorite band. The opportunities are endless, and can set the tone for the rest of your room. 
2. Wall stickers are another alternative for wall decorations. Visit whatisblik.com for numerous opportunities to spruce up your wall, ranging from butterflies, to trees, and other different patterns. There are also plenty of choices at Allposters.com. These sell from $19.99 and up. 
3. Bring your room to life with flowers and plants. Whether you want them as a focal piece, or just as an accessory on a shelf, flowers are always nice. If you’re not one to look after your plant, get some artificial flowers at IKEA starting at $1.99 each. 
4. With the bed as the biggest piece in your dorm room, you want to make it look good. Get some colorful cushions, nice bed linens and bedspreads, that go with the rest of your theme of decorating. Dormify.com offers bedding collections that include everything you need. They’re a bit pricy, but serve perfectly as inspiration. 
5. To organize your clothes, and free some space in your closet, get a clothes rack from IKEA, starting at $9.99. Hang up your favorite pieces of clothing, and they´ll be both easily available, and can also serve as a decoration. 
6. Do your finishing touches by putting up photo frames with pictures of those you care about. Organize your rings, earpieces, and necklaces on a jewelry stand. Have small storage boxes to put your belongings into, and make it clean and nice. Mirrors, vases, and lamps are all accessories to make your dorm room feel a little bit cozier.
Public relations junior Malin Woll Skotnes lives in a suite with seven other girls. They decorated the whole common area with furniture and accessories from Target and IKEA. Both stores are at the nearby Broadway Mall. “We thought mostly functional when we were decorating. Our goal was to make it a little bit cozier,” Skotnes said. With the price tags shared evenly among the group, the cost of decorating wasn’t too bad either. 
International student Vibeke Aarstad wanted to make her room as comforting and cozy as possible, since it’s her only home for several months. “My favorite part of the room is the bed, because it is soft and nice with several cushions, and also because I have a big New York City poster over it that’s so nice,” she said. Her focus is to take advantage of the limited space and make the most out of it. “It doesn’t take a lot of decorating to transform the dorm room from looking like a prison cell to making it inviting,” she said. Her tip is to pick a color scheme and stick to it while decorating. “So it doesn’t look like a carnival,” she explains.
With planning, and smart solutions, you can make your dorm room look much better and feel a little bit more like home. For inspiration, trends, and style advice, visit dormify.com.

LIU Post has lost a vital component of its Art Department, according to numerous students, and that was just from cutting one professor. Students have begun a petition to the University to re-hire Professor Steven Ceraso, who has not been invited back this semester. 
Before this semester, if you were to head up to the Sculpture Building from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on a regular school day, you would most likely have found Professor Ceraso helping students with their projects. Ceraso taught students how to do woodwork, metal work, and clay work, and according to students who took his classes, he was great at it. Although an adjunct professor, (whose contract ran only from year to year), Ceraso proved to be a very well rounded artist. This is a man who took the time to turn desks into cabinets for his workshop according to senior Fine Arts and Education major, Michael Espinosa. “He was able to show students different ways to make a box, instead of just screwing it together. There were certain cuts in the wood he would show the students, plus he knew what he was doing when teaching safety protocol,” Michael said. 
According to the Art Department, his contract was discontinued due to budgetary cuts. “I was told the decision was purely budgetary and not based on my performance,” said Ceraso in an email regarding his current situation. 
Espinosa had Ceraso last semester, and when he heard about the budget cut, he started a petition to get Ceraso reinstated at LIU Post. “We had an invaluable resource at our disposal and now we don’t have that anymore. It’s kind of sad to see that kind of art work die off,” said Espinosa. Some students speculated that Ceraso might have been cut because of a declining number of students enrolling in his classes. 
Freshman Percussive Studies major, Cory Brenner, said, “I would love to take a metal casting class. Knowing that we used to have one but lost it, makes me sad.” Joan Harrison, a professor of 2D media stated, “Certainly the wood and metal shops are essential to our program, economic circumstances seem to be affecting everything.” 
When the Pioneer inquired about Ceraso’s position, other members of the Art Department declined to comment. There were also students who needed to take Ceraso’s Sculpting 102 class to fulfill their graduation requirement. Fine Arts Major Michael Benedetto wrote, “I think it’s deplorable that he (Ceraso) was not given his position back for this year, especially being that I had already signed up for his Sculpture 2 class.” Benedetto wrote this on the petition to bring Ceraso back. This petition can be found online at: www.ipetitions.com/petition/steven_ceraso/. 
The petition was started September 9 and it currently has 67 signatures. There you will find many testimonies to Ceraso’s dedication to teaching, performance level, and overall skill in the crafts he instructed.

A group of LIU students worked to assemble a radio telescope, the only one of its kind on the east coast, in July with Michael Kavic, a Physics professor from LIU-Brooklyn. Kavic and the students decided to house the telescope on the LIU-Post campus. “Radio telescopes have too many signals to be near big cities,” said Michael Kavic. “We wanted to get the telescope away from New York City.” 
The radio telescope, used for astrophysics research, is located on the north side of the LIU-Post campus on a hillside near the Fine Arts building. It is owned and operated by Long Island University. 
LIU Brooklyn students Amanda Larracuente, graduate Biology major, Nickisha Barrett, graduate Education major, and Leandro Quezada, computer science major, received funding from NASA to work with the telescope after joining NASA’s summer research program called Impress-Ed. George Zaky, Pharmacy major, was the only student outside of the program to work on the telescope. “He was simply interested in getting involved,” Kavic said. 
NASA awarded LIU with approximately $108 million, ac¬cording to Kavic. He said that this money supports the Impress-Ed program, five students per summer and four faculty mentors. Kavic is the Principle Investigator for the program and is one of the four faculty mentors supported, along with Paul Wiita, Margaret Benoit, and Nathan Magee. 
“The program is designed to give future teachers of science a chance,” said Kavic. The grant given by NASA will be renewed next summer to continue funding research for next summer and could be renewed for years to come. 
The students began assembling the telescope in the beginning of July. “It took a day to build it, actually. By the third day of July, it was complete,” Larracuente said. 
There is a similar instrument in Socorro, New Mexico, which is much larger, according to Kavic. This long wavelength array telescope, found in Socorro, has 256 antennas. The telescope on the LIU-Post campus will only have four antennas. 
By assembling this instrument from the west, a process that acts much like an assembly line was created, and they found it to speed the process. “The assembly process involves sinking a support post into the ground, attaching the antenna arms to that post and finally attaching data cables to the antenna arms. The cables carry the signal to a receiver,” said Kavic. 
Nevertheless this was only one part of the telescope—assembling the receiver took Barrett almost all summer to complete. A significant part of the telescope that amplifies and detects radio signals still needs to be finished before the telescope can be used. The first observations are planned to happen this week. “We will be getting signals in very soon,” Larracuente said. 
The telescope, which is radio based, can be used during the daytime and the nighttime. The radio telescope is great at detecting signals from the sun itself; this is most effective when the sun is on the horizon. However, during the evening, there is less RFI (radio frequency interference) which makes nighttime an ideal time for astronomical observations. 
On campus, the students and Kavic will scan the sky for events such as solar flares and exploding black holes. They will also search for high-energy cosmic events such as supernovas, gamma ray bursts, merging neutron stars and read signals from space. 
With these observations of solar flares, the scientists may have the ability to protect equipment, such as satellites and GPS systems. Through studying the signals between Jupiter and its moons, it could help the scientists discover planets in other solar systems. 
The telescope will be operated by Kavic, the faculty men¬tors, and the students who helped assemble the instrument. Kavic plans to allow other students to be brought on tour as long as there is supervision near the instrument. 
“It was interesting; it was not like a typical telescope that you see. You see it through a computer so it looks totally different from any other telescope that you would see. It was a great progression,” Larracuente said about working with the telescope for the first time.
“It was a wonderful experience and the students consistently exceeded my expectations,” Kavic said. “The most rewarding thing is when the student takes the project and makes it on his or her own while working creatively.” 
The team plans to do observations every week. “From working with the telescope I learned that there is so much more to learn about science and space. There are so many ways to see out there—you can see stars from billions of years ago!” Larracuente said about her experience. 
Kavic has been looking for more people to work closely with the radio telescope this semester. “I would love to have LIU-Post students working on this project. I reached out to some people at Post, but I was unable to make the right kind of connections,” he said. New students who wish to work with the telescope do not need a strong background in astronomy and physics. “We are always happy to have new people on board and what we want more than anything is enthusiasm,” Kavic said. He assures students that there are still a lot of exciting things to do, such as, building more antennas and making more observations. He added that new observers will be trained and supervised to ensure they know how to use the equipment properly. 
“Everyone was very eager, hands on and was a great collaboration. We had such a great time that we wanted to prolong our experience and work on it some more throughout the semester,” said Larracuente.
Students interested in working with the radio telescope can contact Michael Kavic through his LIU email: kavic.michael@liu.edu.
