After a five-year absence from the big screen, J.K. Rowling brings audiences back to the world of Harry Potter with her new movie, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”
Taking place in 1926 New York instead of modern-day England, the film is a prequel to the Harry Potter series and contains Rowling’s first screenplay. While she is the author of the Harry Potter books, Steve Kloves and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplays for the movies.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” was originally published as a book in 2001, Rowling used the name Newt Scamander, who is the main character of the movie because the book was published as the actual textbook used by Harry Potter in the novels. The movie is not based on the book like Harry Potter was, but is an original story crafted by Rowling.
This is the first of a five-film franchise planned by Rowling and Warner Bros. studios that will see the series stretch from 1926-1945 and will include pivotal characters such as Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander; Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein; Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski; Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein and Colin Farrell as Graves. Ezra Miller and Jon Voight also play supporting roles.
Newt Scamander is a wizard who travels the world collecting different types of magical creatures and stops by New York on his way to Arizona. While in New York, his creatures are accidentally set loose and he must enlist the help of witches Tina and Queenie Goldstein, sisters who work at the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), and non-wizard Jacob. Together they must return to find Newt’s creatures while avoiding the detection of Percival Graves, the Director of Magical Security at MACUSA.
A strength of the movie is the performances of the actors, particularly Eddie Redmayne and Dan Fogler. Redmayne easily takes the franchise reigns from Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe and anchors the Fantastic Beasts series behind his performance. He successfully portrays Newt’s insecurity around humans and is able to contrast that aspect of his personality with his more outgoing nature while spending time with his creatures.
Fogler is able to take what could have been a typical side character and elevate him to one of the core characters by the end of the movie. While Fogler’s performance originally starts out as comedic, he becomes more reserved and sympathetic as several emotional moments throughout the movie revolve around his character.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” also benefits from being written by J.K. Rowling instead of a screenwriter unfamiliar with the world she has created. Her imagination is so expansive that there is no shortage of interesting characters and creatures throughout the movie. Rowling even includes several references to the Harry Potter series and other material not in the books.
There are very few things holding this movie back from being perfect. While all of the main characters are fleshed out, some of the secondary characters are relegated to the sidelines, in particular, Jon Voight’s and Carmen Ejogo’s characters. The movie can also seem busy at some points with several plot threads occurring at once. While this should be expected from a first-time screenwriter, it is not a main issue as Rowling was able to successfully accomplish this while writing Harry Potter.
Since the last Harry Potter movie was released five years ago and the last novel nine years ago, it was possible that interest in Rowling’s work had dwindled and that “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” would underperform at the box office. However, backed by Redmayne’s leading man performance and Rowling’s unique storytelling, the movie has made its budget back at the box office and has successfully started a new franchise. The movie is now playing in theaters.

Thanksgiving? An American holiday most international students have never celebrated. I think some don’t even really understand the concept of Thanksgiving. But for me, I find it quite gracious and humbling, in fact, but only if we thank our close ones in the right manner.
For Thanksgiving this year, I went to Maine with my best friends. The blissfulness of long cold walks where I can truly experience the extravagance and serenity of Spinoza’s God (nature), along with the rawness of staying in a cabin in the woods, away from the hectic reality we live every day. It is one thing to be able to spend some time just with friends, but to spend it with absolutely amazing people is something I am truly grateful for.
If my dad was here, I would thank him for the incomprehensible support he gives me. I wouldn’t thank him for helping financially or for that present he got me for my birthday. Yes, they are lovely things, but material can’t replace the inherent love that comes from your parents.
If I was spending it with my true love, I wouldn’t thank her for a gift or a bagel and coffee; I would thank her for her perfect imperfections, her love and that cute nickname she has given me, which the only person in the world that gets it, is you.
Thanksgiving, at least for me, is about this appreciation of unselfishness, a genuine gratefulness for beautiful natural things which money can’t buy. A raw notion of stripping away all of the barriers that we put up to protect ourselves from this scary and daunting reality that we live in, and having these people still there for us, taking us for who we really are.
Thanksgiving is about showing gratitude to that person, friend, lover, who, when you were in complete doubt of yourself, and you could barely function, was there for you. They didn’t just tell you it’s okay and what they thought, but they just listened and hugged you, and gave you the comfort of their understanding, when you didn’t really understand why you were so upset.
We should give thanks to the people who put up with our shenanigans, the people who smile at us and laugh when we make an awful joke (it’s usually me making the bad joke). The people who listen, the people who genuinely care, the people who only want the best for us, the people who would do something for us with no expectation of a return for such a deed.
Everyone has that person. I think it is absurd that we only show our appreciation to them one day a year, when it should be all the time. But Thanksgiving is a perfect opportunity to really say cheers for their divinity of natural unselfishness and, in simpler terms, just being them.
However, if you have this depressing thought that you have no one who shows such character as I have described, I believe that you do. If you are in a fight or a sticky situation with a friend or loved one, deeply think past their negative traits, remember why you love them and why you are friends with them. It may be something so simple like that one time you called them when you were hysterically upset, and they calmed you down, made you feel at ease and bathed you with a feeling of contentment.
I don’t think that giving thanks should be a forced thing, not at all. But I think we have to put our own guard and our own ego down for a ‘quick sec’ and assess the beauty of that person. Shakespeare once said “a friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still gently allows you to grow.”
This is my giving thanks to my phenomenally genuine friends. What were you thankful for? Who was it for? Really think about this. And if it was someone far far away, then send them a message of appreciation.
Hope you had a happy Thanksgiving, guys!

Goals. Visions. Mission. Objectives. Companies formulate statements and communicate big fancy words both internally and to the outside world. Unarguably there seems to be no question whether setting goals is the way to go.
But it has not always been this way. Not until the introduction of scientific management in the beginning of the 20th century—much due to growing industries and war planning—was the idea of setting goals introduced. Industrial pshygologist Celic Alec Mace is said to be the first to study goal setting in 1935. His foundings included that a paycheck wasn’t necessarily the dominant work initiative, and that a will to work could be created under certain circumstances.
Research continued and during the late ‘60s former professor of university of Maryland, Edvin A. Locke came to the conclusion that ambitious and specific goals generates a higher output, at least if the goal is aligned with the individual’s goals and intentions.
That was really the first step towards the famous SMART-goals model presented by George T. Doran in 1982, where SMART is an abbreviation for the qualities a goal should have: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic and Time-Related.
These conclusions may sound obvious to us today but it was different in the past. Using the great Google tool Ngram Viewer, you can look up how often a word appears in literature over the years and get a sense of what topics and areas humanity is writing about. Looking at “goals,” the usage has increased widely over the last century.
In todays society, what was initially research focused on increasing workers’ performance from a managerial perspective, has become part of all aspects of life. How many in life can you name where nobody has asked you, “What’s your goal?” And with increased quantification and amount of data in both personal and private life the goal-setting trend doesn’t seem to slow down.
But even if the logical conclusion is that some forms of goal setting would make you perform better, it is sometimes hard to believe.
There are always those people who don’t seem to set any goals whatsoever and still perform great, and there are those people who set too ambitious goals and the pressure and expectations limit them. Too high expectations are what behaviour economist Daniel Airley mentions as a limit to happiness in life.
Therefore, it might not be surprising that the term trending right now is process goals. Setting a process goal means that you will not focus on the final output, but on the process and then hope that it will lead to the wanting performance.
Process goals are easier to achieve compared to goals focusing on result as you have the full influential power, and your expectations on the final output will be relatively lower. So maybe this is the golden way, setting high goals but keeping the low expectations.

Offended? Of course, it’s in style. Generation Z, and Generation Y to a certain extent, members are often heard saying “I’m offended” as they express utter disdain towards a person or idea. But what does it mean to be offended? How did the term enter our conversational discourse?
Let us begin with the etymological roots. The term “offend” is partly borrowed from early 12th century French (and partly from Latin), defined in the former as “to strike against,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary.
Later in the same century, it acquired the definition that inspires its use today, “to hurt someone’s feelings.” While the meaning is still the same, the term has certainly become as ubiquitous as the phrase “cool” was 10 years ago. Wherein lies the catalyst?
In the September 2015 issue of The Atlantic, Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt presented one possible solution in their article, “The Coddling of the American Mind.” According to Lukianoff and Haidt, the current movement of restricting speech that could be triggering (or offensive) is not a second wave of a push towards political correctness; instead, it is a movement that has emotional well-being at the hub of its wheel.
Students are seeking protection from what they deem to be dangerous ideas, pushing colleges to create “safe spaces” to protect their ever so fragile minds. However, the movement does not stop at protection; the spokes of the wheel are punishments for those who attempt to thwart the coddling efforts.
Lukianoff and Haidt thoroughly detail the process of how society reached this precipice (and it is certainly a worthwhile read), but, for now, let’s focus on the hub of the wheel— protecting our emotional well-being.
If I say I am offended by X (person or statement), it means that X hurt my feelings; I had an emotional reaction to X. Does that then predicate the conclusion, “X should not exist?” Absolutely not! The protection of our emotional well-being does not entail an elimination of all things that could potentially challenge us; on the other hand, that which challenges us only makes us stronger.
To immediately jump to “I am offended!” is to shutter the gates towards discourse, and discourse fosters intellectual growth. There will be no growth if we create a mote of cushioning around our emotions and, to a certain extent, our minds; an offensive statement should not be enough to run screaming for the hills.

From intensity and focus to jubilation; sophomore forward/midfielder, Emily Miller, let the no. 4-ranked Pioneers exhale with the game-winning goal in the 78th minute of their overtime NCAA Division II Semifinal win against no. 5-ranked Saint Anselm College on Friday, Nov. 18. The win advanced the Green and Gold to the NCAA Division II National Championship for the third time in the last four years.
The Pioneers and the Hawks from Saint Anselm played a combined three times this season and each time the Pioneers ousted its opponent on overtime.
The game itself was a tale of two halves as the Pioneers came out of the gate strong and held a 6-3 advantage in shot attempts. The Hawks though were also aggressive and totaled six penalty corners in each half, but could not get any of them to result in points on the scoreboard. Senior goalie, Ericka Parks, made a game-high seven saves, five of which came in the second half to preserve the tie.
In the overtime session, Miller got off a shot that was turned aside early. A few minutes later, she deflected a shot from sophomore midfielder/defender, Julie Gysels, past the keeper for her tenth game-winning goal of the season.
The win sent the Pioneers to the National Championship game against no. 1-ranked Shippensburg University. The Pioneers have played in the title game two times in the previous three seasons and each time came up short. This season, however, they were a combined 7-1 against teams ranked in the top ten in the country and had toppled East Stroudsburg University, which held the no. 1 rank at the time.
Scoring chances were at a premium on this day, with each team totaling shot attempts to be counted on one hand. When Shippensburg capitalized in the seventh minute with a goal and another in the 61st minute, it seemed like the Pioneers would need a miracle to come back. The team gave it one hell of a shot.
Miller, the hero from the previous game, cut the deficit in half with a goal in the 65th minute and nearly tied the game and sent it to overtime; but sophomore goaltender, Ally Mooney, made a great save to keep her team ahead 2-1.
The clock struck midnight on the Pioneer comeback attempt and Shippensburg came out with the nail-biting 2-1 victory, and the national championship title.
The loss wraps up the season for the Pioneers. “We really thought we were going to do it today. We were right there,” said Head Coach Raenee Savin. “Unfortunately, it won’t be with our six seniors, but I am confident that LIU Post will be back.”
The Pioneers will return to action in the fall of 2017.

Coming off its thrilling 48-41 victory against Winston-Salem State University in the first round of the NCAA Division II Tournament, football faced its toughest test to date and suffered a 40-21 loss at the hands of Shepherd University on Saturday, Nov. 26, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
The loss is the first of the season for the Pioneers who rounded out a historic campaign with a 12-1 record. The 12 wins mark a program record, as do the two play-off games. With the win, the Rams from Shepherd University move on to face California University of Pennsylvania in the quarterfinals.
For the game itself, the Pioneers were dealt a blow early when the opponent marched down the field on its opening possession and scored a touchdown. The Rams’ drive went for six plays and 63 yards and finished with a 31-yard scamper by freshman halfback, Brandon Hlavach.
On its ensuing drive, LIU attempted to answer that score with one of its own, but a costly turnover in the   red-zone kept the Pioneers off the scoreboard for the time being. After the defense forced a punt, the Pioneer offense made sure to get in the end zone on a one-yard run by red-shirt sophomore running back, Malik Pierre, to even the score at seven apiece.
The score stood at 7-7 until the end of the first quarter, but the Rams unleashed a 19-point unanswered outburst to take a commanding 26-7 lead into halftime. Senior quarterback, Jeff Ziemba, tossed all three touchdowns, two to senior 6”4’ pass catcher, Billy Brown, and one to senior receiver, CJ Davis; the last score came just 23 seconds before halftime.
The Pioneers fought valiantly until the end, cutting the deficit to 12 twice during the second half, but the Rams’ offense was in rhythm and could not be stopped. The guests scored in response to Pioneer touchdowns twice and capped off the win with Brown’s third receiving touchdown of the day with 4:27 left in the game.
In the loss, senior quarterback, Jeff Kidd, went 25-for-43 through the air for 288 yards and a touchdown and was also sacked four times. His counterpart, Ziemba, threw for 375 yards and four scores. The Pioneer running game, which played a huge part in its win against Winston-Salem, was held to under 100 yards, but did score two touchdowns.
In the receiving department, Brown stole the show for the Rams, totaling 11 catches for 189 yards and three touchdowns. Kidd’s favorite target, red-shirt senior wide out, Shane Hubbard, finished with 10 catches and 155 yards.
Defensively, senior linebacker, Nate Feliz, had a game-high 10 tackles and a sack. Red-shirt junior defensive lineman, Anthony DeNunzio, had nine tackles to go along with a sack and pass break-up. Freshman defensive back, Joshua Flowers, made nine tackles and two pass break-ups to his credit.
As a team, the Rams totaled more first downs (30-23), total of- fense (591-379), and forced more turnovers.
Football’s most successful season has come to an end. “When you talk about leaving a legacy or building for the future, various programs talk about one specific year,” said Head Coach Bryan Collins. “And I think what this group accomplished – the first to win 12 games; the first to host two playoff games… I think they’ve accomplished a lot. They set the bar very high and established a legacy for themselves.”

The no. 1-ranked men’s soccer team, who had the top seed in the NCAA Division II Tournament, fell to no. 7 Adelphi University in the third round, 4-0, at the Pioneer Soccer Park in Brookville, N.Y. on Thursday, Nov. 17. The loss was the first for the Pioneers in nearly a calendar year—the first one at home in five years.
The Panthers from Adelphi, who improved to 19-1-1 on the season with the victory, jumped out to a two-goal lead in the first 20 minutes. Junior midfielder, Federico De Oliveira, was the playmaker, scoring the match’s first goal from the top of the box and assisting on the second tally in the 17th minute.
Just before halftime, the Pioneers were dealt another blow when the Panthers netted another goal to go up three. In the second half, the Pioneers could not stop the Panther train that rolled into town. Another Adelphi goal put the nail in the coffin and sent the Panthers on to face the University of Charleston.
In the loss the home side was outshot in the first half 11-4, which set the tone for the game. For the game, the Panthers also had three times as many shots on goal and a 9-4 advantage in corner kicks. Also worth noting, the Pioneers committed 17 fouls compared to 10 for Adelphi, and four yellow cards to Adelphi’s one.
The team’s season came to a bitter end, but the Pioneers had a season to remember nevertheless. With an 18-1-1 record, good enough for a .925 win percentage, the team had several highs this season including: sophomore striker, Charlie Ledula, and senior back, David Arvidsson, being named East Coast Conference offensive and defensive players of the year, reaching the no. 1 rank in Division II, and finishing the regular season undefeated for the first time in program history.
The curtain has closed on the 2016 season for the Pioneers and they will return in the fall of 2017. Graduate and senior athletes on this year’s roster include: David Arvidsson, Seb Baxter, Alex Billington, Sean Collins, Maxime Devillaz, Joey Forgaard, Alex Hailes, Erik Berthagen, Oliver Hollingsaeter, Johann Kristjansson, Jason Lampkin, Jesper Malmstrom, Ludvig Brisby Jeppsson and Ian Jonsson.
