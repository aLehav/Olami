The new University President, Chief of Staff, and Dean of Students are all women—this is a first for LIU Post. Parts of the student population believe that this has changed the campus for the better, while others claim that gender should not be the focal point of analysis. Others say that it is simply too soon to tell if this change will be successful.
On July 1, 2013, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline took on the role of LIU President, a role that was held by David Steinberg for 28 years. However, this is significant because President Cline is the first female president to take office in LIU’s 87-year existence.
As soon as Cline came into office, she restructured the hierarchy at Post by eliminating the position of Provost and announced that Dr. Jackie Nealon would take the new position, and would be referred to as Chief of Staff. LIU Post Chancellor Theresa Mall Mullarkey was quoted in Newsday in July 2013, stating that eliminating the position of Provost on the LIU Post and Brooklyn campuses and streamlining the jobs into one Chief of Staff position, was meant to unite all residential campuses.
Nealon was not only appointed as new chief of staff, but also as vice president of Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. Nealon oversees admissions, enrollment, recruitment, financial services, academic and career planning, advertising, public relations, marketing, student success, retention, registration, residence life, non-traditional and adult student programs, and student life.
During the fall 2013 semester, Dr. Abigail Van Vlerah was appointed the new Dean of Students at LIU Post. Van Vlerah is responsible for student services, a position that will allow students to voice their concerns, needs or suggestions to her.
How does this women-led leadership compare to other schools? In March 2012, The Chronicle cited the American Council on Education’s survey, “The American College President 2012,” and the results were that the typical President is a married white male with a doctorate education.
The Census Bureau corroborates this claim with results that conclude that women are still earning less than men, and they often hold lower positions than men.
“I think it’s positive,” said Kirsten Corwin, a junior Education major. “I haven’t really gotten to know the new President, but I’ve noticed a lot of improvement around campus.”
Melanie Spina, a sophomore Journalism major, agrees. “The President really does want to make a difference. I’ve noticed the new amenities on campus such as the new smoothie shop at the Pratt, the Sweet Shoppe, the boutique on the second floor at Hillwood, and the non-alcoholic bar in the Pioneer Room,” Spina said.
However, Spina would not agree that the gender of the new administration is cause for much reflection. Spina stated, “Gender doesn’t matter. Just because you’re a female doesn’t mean you’ll do the job better. It is the credentials and experience that matter.”
Other students believe that the best way to identify efficiency is through comparison. Justin Barsky, a Digital Game Design and Development graduate student, has been attending LIU Post for the last seven years. Barsky has experienced the previous administration under Steinberg, and now this new administration with Cline.
“I didn’t even know what President Steinberg looked like until I graduated with my undergraduate degree,” said Barsky.
Barsky stated he really appreciated the e-mail that President Cline sent out to wish the students a safe holiday over winter break. “I never received an e-mail like that from President Steinberg once,” Barsky stated.
The campus is undergoing what Dr. Joan Digby, professor of English and the director of LIU Post’s Honor’s Program, calls a makeover.
Digby first came to LIU in 1969, and has seen many of the previous administrations. “In truth, it took many years to get equitable pay for women,” Digby said, as she recalled that when she first came to LIU, most of the administration was largely run by men.
Digby expressed that women have held administrative positions at the university in the past, but until very recently, the very highest positions and board of trustees have always been men.
“There have never been as many women in power,” Digby said. She characterized the new administration as “innovative” and “proactive” compared to years past.
Many believe that it is too soon to tell, as the administration has not been in place for a full academic year. “We may need to warm into the spring to see the outcome of this largely female administration,” Digby added.
Despite the outcome, the current administration is vital to the university as it is responsible for crucial aspects that make LIU flourish, succeed, and expand. Cline, Nealon and Van Vlerah have not responded to The Pioneer’s request for comments.

“It’s good because the roads are icy and it keeps people safe. The roads in my neighborhood weren’t plowed last Wednesday,” said Michael Grossman, a sophomore Finance major.
Katie Ventrella, a sophomore Accounting major, was pleased with the class cancellations for a different reason. As a student athlete, the cancellations allowed her more time to focus on improving her lacrosse skills. “Personally, I didn’t think it was terrible because our team still got to practice,” she added.
Courtney Cabo, a freshman Speech Pathology major, felt a sense of relief about the extensive class cancellations. “I think that even if I have to make up the classes, I’d be okay with it because I’d rather drive to school on a day with good weather than put myself in danger,” she said.
“I think it was smart. I had to go to work, so it didn’t matter for me, but it was a good decision overall because it shows that Post is looking out for the best interests of the students,” said Damian Dudek, a senior Finance major.
Other students, including David Mannlein, a freshman Mathematics major, perceived the most recent snow day as more of an inconvenience because it put students further behind in their coursework. “I think that [last] Wednesday did not need to be cancelled. I drove to work and it was fine. It was awful that I missed three classes that meet on Mondays and Wednesdays. I now feel behind,” he added. Mannelein also stated that if Post cancels classes, there should not be additional assignments outside of the classroom for cancelled sessions. “I think that if classes are cancelled, then students should not have to complete assignments online in place of going to class.”
Gregory Schimmel, an adjunct professor who teaches College 101 and is part of the Academic Resource Program, agreed with the postponing of classes, but understood the point of view that the cancelled classes leave professors and students behind in terms of the material they must cover to meet department criteria. “From an administrative standpoint, safety is the most important thing. On a day when the roads are horrible, it’s nice not to have to come to campus. On the downside, it causes you to get behind on your work and certain things have to be pushed back. You just have to roll with the punches. I think we all do a good job of that here, students and professors alike.”
It is uplifting that the administrators at Post care about the safety of students and faculty. It is never a good idea for a person to risk life or limb to reach a destination. Every day, drivers across the nation race on highways to reach their destinations just in the nick of time to begin school and work. Commuter safety is a number one priority.

There’s no denying it: as much as we may try, winter is in full swing and it’s hitting hard. The days are short and the nights are brutally cold. The “winter blues” are defined by mild depression, lack of motivation, and low energy. Luckily for you, here are five things you can do to prevent the blues—or if they’ve already hit, how to bounce back.
1) Exercise
Many of us look at exercise for only one reason: to get in shape. However, did you know exercising could also relieve stress? When you exercise, you release endorphins that improve your mood. Starting your day off with a light workout will keep your spirits lifted throughout the day. Start slow with an early morning walk—let that evolve into a jog, and eventually you’ll be on a morning run in no time.
2) Eat A Balanced Diet
Have you ever overeaten and felt the detrimental side effects the next day? We have all been there. In the winter, many people overindulge on sweets and treats. It’s not a bad thing to spoil yourself once in a while, but overeating will leave you feeling sluggish. Try eating three balanced meals each day. Do your best to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, and allow yourself a few healthy snacks in between.
3) Embrace The Season
You have no other choice, but to accept the fact that winter is here. Enjoy the snow days. Make hot chocolate, eat s’mores (in moderation), and play in the snow (counts as being active). Take up a winter sport like skiing or snowboarding. Believe it or not, New York is home to the most ski areas in the United States.
You can head to: Mount Peter, located at 40 Ski Lane, Warwick, NY. It’ll take about an hour and 30-minutes to get there. Hunter Mountain, located in the Catskills at 64 Klein Avenue, Hunter, NY, is roughly two hours and forty minutes away from campus. Windham Mountain is also located in the Catskills at 33 Clarence D Lane Road, Windham, NY. The drive to Windham will take about two hours and fifty minutes.
You can even head to an ice rink to give ice-skating a try. Students can go to Cantiague Park Ice Arena Ice Skating Rink, located at 480 W. John Street, Hicksville, NY. “I’ve learned to love the winter. I enjoy going snowboarding at local mountains. The whole ski town and environment is a lot of fun,” said Christina Cirami, a junior Business major.
4) Get Some Shut Eye
Naturally people want to sleep a bit more during the winter.
Humans’ sleep and wake cycles are controlled by light. Light subdues the production of melatonin by the brain’s pineal gland. As daylight fades, the pineal gland produces more melatonin, which causes people to feel sleepy. As students, many of us have a lot going on and sleep is often
the first thing we sacrifice. Getting yourself on a good sleep schedule will take some self-discipline, but it will be worth it. You should aim for seven to eight hours of sleep each night, and try to keep your bedtime and waking time consistent. That way, your sleeping patterns can normalize and you’ll have more energy. Try not to oversleep—those 12- hour snoozes on the weekend can actually make you more tired. Don’t forget naps; a short (10-30 minutes) afternoon nap may be all you need to re-energize midday. “Sleep is important because I can focus more, have more energy and be in a better mood,” said Charlie Moerler, a sophomore Broadcasting student. Moerler said he does his best to go to bed at the same time every night.
5) Act On Your New Years Resolutions
Do something positive! Stick to your New Year’s resolution: doing this will keep you busy and motivated. Plus, it will give you something to look forward to as the spring slowly arrives.
Staying active, eating right, getting enough sleep and having fun are guaranteed ways to survive the winter. We can’t change the season, so we might as well make the best of it.

LIU Post will be expecting 30 local high school students to visit the campus and experience a day in the life of a Post student, from Feb. 18 to 20. The students, who hail from Long Island and the five boroughs, will arrive on campus at 9:30 a.m. together with parents and faculty. The event, known as “Inside Post,” is designed to recruit high school seniors by allowing them to get a taste of the campus life, as well as tour the university’s facilities, including Hillwood Commons, the Tilles Center, and the Pratt Recreation Center.
Although LIU Post usually hosts events such as the spring and fall open houses, as well as Post Preview days, Inside Post is exclusively for high school students who have already been admitted to the school and other institutions, and are thus narrowing down their final options.
The students, who were personally invited by the university, will have the chance to participate in classes, such as Dance, Education and Business, speak with faculty and administration, and have lunch with student ambassadors.
“This is a perfect way for students to sample life here at LIU Post,” said Celeste Lacasse, director of Visitor Relations. Lacasse also remarked that the students are granted access to the new campus’
latest attractions, including the Gold Coast Cinema, Post Treat Shoppe, Student Body Boutique and End Zone Sports Bar, all located in Hillwood Commons.
Conni Montalbano, a nurse at Post’s Medical Services Department, believes that Inside Post is a good way of recruiting
high school students. “I think having high school students come into the school during a regular day is a good way for them to familiarize themselves with the smaller class sizes, the diverse student population, and the relaxed atmosphere of college life.”
Montalbano said she would love the prospective students to be introduced to Medical Services, a sector that is not part of the campus tour itinerary. “We want our students to feel comfortable reaching out to us when they are sick or just have questions about maintaining a healthy lifestyle at college.”
Olympia Zipitas, a senior Music major, agrees that hosting such events is beneficial for both the university and the students. “We’ve always had tours in the music department and it’s always helped high school students see what it would really be like to be in college,” she said. The Student Ambassador and campus tour-guide then added, “It’s important because some people come in blindly and have no idea what to expect, or they choose a school they end up hating. If they shadow a current student, they can see if they would like it.”
Jackie Nealon, chief of staff and vice president of Campus Life, did not respond to The Pioneer’s request for comment.

On Friday, Feb. 7, Emmy and Tony Award-winner Kristin Chenoweth performed some of her most memorable songs and Broadway show tunes, including music from “Wicked,” “Promises Promises,” and her new album “Some Lessons Learned” in a concert appearance at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts.
Chenoweth starred as Olive Snook in the ABC series “Pushing Daisies,” receiving an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2009. She also appeared in Fox’s “Glee” as April Rhodes, for which she was nominated for two Emmy Awards and a People’s Choice Award. In 2003, Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda the Good Witch in “Wicked” and earned a Tony Award in 1999 for her performance of Sally Brown in “You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown.”
Recently, Chenoweth has been busy with roles on TV Land’s “Kirstie” and Lifetime’s “Project Runway Allstars,” with voice over work on the new movie “Rio 2,” which is hitting theaters April 11. She is also returning for the 100th episode of Glee, a two-part special event currently scheduled to air on March 18 and 25.
Throughout the performance, Chenoweth spoke to the audience and injected lots of comedy between each song, one of

which she sang with a 10 year old girl from the audience. She noted her hair was done by an LIU Post student and joked about surviving a nearly-fatal accident when she was struck by a piece of lighting equipment on the Brooklyn set of CBS’s “The Good Wife” in 2012. She also learned just how “long” Long Island really is with a four hour commute on the Long Island Expressway due to heavy traffic from Manhattan. As a result, she broke her record of never missing a sound check.
“I am still not over it; I will never get over that trip,” Chenoweth told The Pioneer. “The traffic was just so bad. I should have left at 2:30p.m.”
According to a Newsday article published on Nov. 1, 2013, Chenoweth spent five days on Long Island in October 2013 shooting scenes at a home in Bellmore for Oyster Bay native Sean Nalaboff’s teen indie, “Hard Sell.” She did not get a chance to experience Long Island, but was able to walk her dog in the quiet neighborhood during breaks.
“It’s like being in Oklahoma, but with a different accent,” said Chenoweth who was raised in the Sooner State. “The people are really down to earth, and it made me feel happy. I was very proud to be here. That is one of the reasons why I couldn’t wait to come back and sing here. The people are cool.”

Long Island University has decided to expand the athletic program at LIU Post. Several new sports will be added to the athletic department, including: women’s fencing, women’s golf, and men’s wrestling. Joe Patrovich is appointed head coach for men’s wrestling, Tom Kane will be in charge of the women’s golf program, while Mike Corona is set to guide the new women’s fencing program.
New LIU President Dr. Kimberly R. Cline has decided to bring seven new sports to Post, and Athletic Director Bryan Collins has started to fill the open coaching positions around these teams.
Patrovich has accepted the Athletic Department’s offer to run and build the newly reinstated wrestling program. The program was discontinued after the 1987-88 season, but is now set to reopen come fall 2014. Potential LIU Post wrestlers will have a great mentor in Patrovich, as he was inducted to the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2012. He has coached 21 county champions, 13 state finalists, 10 All-American selections, eight state champions, and has been named coach of the year in Nassau and Suffolk.
“I’m working 16 hours a day with high school football and wrestling, but it’s an opportunity that I just couldn’t pass up. I want to build that program,” said Patrovich, in a Dec. 11, 2013, Newsday article.
To build a proud program is also something head coach for the women’s golf team wants to do. Tom Kane resides in Stony Brook, N.Y., and comes over from Smithtown West High School where he coached the varsity boys’ squad from 1974-2003. Since 2006, he has guided the girls’ varsity golf team. Between those two appointments, Kane led his team to six Suffolk County titles and a Long Island Championship.
On Friday, Feb. 7, Collins announced Mike Corona as the man who will mentor the women’s fencing program for the Pioneers. Corona has served as head coach of the Brentwood fencing team since 2002, where he has developed a competitive program reflected by his six Coach of the Year awards. Among his achievements are 27 top-6 fencers, including six individual champions. Corona has experience as a fencer, as he was County Champion in Epee from Centereach High School in 1978, supplementing his bronze medal from the first-ever Empire Games. In addition to the mentioned sports, the Pioneers have adopted men’s and women’s indoor and outdoor track and field.

LIU Post Fine Art’s professor, Winn Rea, exhibited her work on Jan. 8, through Feb. 1 at the Phoenix Gallery in New York City. There were six videos and 12 drawings on display. This marked her third solo exhibition at the gallery. Her artwork is inspired by natural sources like woods, leaves and water. According to her site, winnrea.com, landscapes are the primary inspiration behind her work. In addition to her teaching, Rea has exhibited her own work in galleries, and has been reviewed by The New York Times and Alternet.org.
“Much of my work is temporal,” she posted on her site. “Objects and materials assembled for a brief period of time, then dispersed to be reconfigured in another place and time—much like the land itself.”
Natural environment, which she often utilizes in her work, is a way of living for Rea. The reason why she wants to combine art and nature is because she believes that it reminds people of greater cycles of geologic time, in which the human race is a tiny fragment. When people take themselves too seriously or get too frantic, nature reminds them of a bigger picture to life. Rea once had a teacher who helped her see art and everyday action as interrelated. Art is not something you do, she learned, but is something you are. For Rea, bringing nature and art together is a way of living an integrated life. These teachings are a large part of her lessons at LIU Post.
In the exhibition at the Phoenix Gallery, her favorite work is “Leaf Drawing Process Video 5, 2013,” which can be viewed on her website. “It is a 4:04 minute loop video showing a spot of light traveling across the face of a mossy boulder,” she said. “[The video is] my favorite because it shows the quiver and disintegration of the video created by the friction of drawing, and the passage of time.”
Rea takes influence from the Japanese. “[They] have a practice called Shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing—a practice of walking in the woods for therapeutic effect. I, too, feel this restoration. In my efforts to convey that experience to the viewer, my work investigates the nature of experience and perception.”
The artist weaves this method into her work, by working frequently in the woods rather than a studio. With a small stack of watercolor paper, and a vague notion of direction, she uses materials found in the woods to record action, and collects colors found where she walks.
“As I begin to draw with rolled-up leaves on the watercolor paper I noticed the sound; wanting to record that sound, I pulled my iPhone out of my pocket and placed it on my drawing board face down. I did not expect the amazing quivering images that were recorded—they came as a gift to me,” she said.
The artist then conveyed these elements to her viewers. “It was a matter of how to bring that information back to the viewer,” she continued. “Which is when I began to think about presenting the videos on six separate monitors and have them begin and end randomly, sometimes quiet and peaceful, sometimes frantic and agitated—like listening to the wind come up in the woods.”
Rea is confident of her work on this first level “because I have had a personal encounter as an artist with nature that has nourished me,” she said. “On the second level, I had the opportunity to share that with viewers who came to the show, and on a third level, you are inviting more people to know and understand my work, who may keep thinking about it in their own life experience—which is very gratifying as an artist.”

On Thursday, Feb. 6, the Women’s Basketball team (15-5) squared off against the District of Columbia Firebirds (14-4) in a battle of the East Coast Conference’s top two teams. The Pioneers came out on top with a 74-72 win from Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y.

The Firebirds came out of the gate strong, grabbing a 13-5 lead in the game’s first seven minutes. Junior forward Denikka Brent, who scored six points during that run, led them. That run to start the game by the Firebirds was matched by a 14-2 response by the Pioneers, giving them a 21-15 advantage. Later on in the first half, sophomore guard Quanisha Ratley came away with a steal and went coast to coast for the fast break score, as the Pioneers extended their lead to eight. In the closing seconds of the first half, Ratley again came up with a rebound and scored at the other end, giving the Pioneers a jolt of energy as the half came to a close. Entering halftime, the score was 34-27, in favor of the Pioneers.
At the break, sophomore forward Nyasia Davis already had 14 rebounds along with eight points. Junior guard Chelsea Williams got to the line six times, her aggressive play showed as she had eight points at the half. For the Firebirds, Brent was the high scorer with 12 and she also grabbed six boards. Defense was strong on both sides, as both teams had field goal percentages in the low 30s.
In the second half, the Pioneers extended their lead when Williams nailed three pointers on back-to-back possessions, giving them their first double-digit advantage of the game. The lead reached its peak at 12 when senior forward Shayna Gatling dropped in a layup, making the score 44-32 in favor of the Pioneers.
Looking to respond, the Firebirds answered with an 18-6 run that was capped with Brent’s layup, tying the game at 50 with 8:45 left. The two teams had three ties after the 8:45 mark, as neither team was able to pull away. The Pioneers had a slight edge of just one with under a minute remaining. Williams converted six clutch free throws to help the Pioneer efforts, and a late three pointer by the Firebirds was not enough as the Pioneers came out with the narrow two-point victory.
For the Pioneers, Williams and Ratley combined for 26 points in the second half while senior guard Alexis Peters dished out five assists. Davis totaled 19 rebounds and scored 12 points, notching her first double-double this season, and also setting a new career high for rebounds. The Firebirds had three players score double figures in the second half, led by Brent.
The Pioneers made several strides in the shooting percentages in the second half, recording higher totals in field goal percentage, three point percentage, and free throw percentage. In addition to their impressive second half shooting, the Pioneers also tripled their opponents’ second chance points for the game.
Coach Moore and the Pioneers are back in action on Wednesday, Feb. 12, when they hit the road to battle the Purple Knights from the University of Bridgeport. Tipoff is slated for 5 p.m.

Thursday, Feb. 6, the men’s basketball team took on the Firebirds of the University of District of Columbia for an ECC match up. The Pioneers dominated the game right from the get-go, and won comfortably 91-52.
Coming from an astonishing 84-49 win last week against Roberts Wesleyan, the Pioneers were full of confidence heading into their first home game in February after playing three away games. Led by senior Forward Vaughn Allen, the Pioneers wasted no time in the start of the game, and they earned a 22-9 lead after playing only 11 minutes. Allen accounted for six out of the first eight points for the green and gold, as the team steered into halftime with a 46-28 lead.
Opening the second half, the Pioneers sealed the victory with a 14-0 burst, widening the margin to 66-36. Junior guard P.J. Torres and junior forward Tyuan Williams combined for all the points in the run. Williams tipped in 10 points, while Torres added the remaining four.
Torres had a game high 22-point showing, as he hit 10-of-17 shots from field-goal range. He also added three assists, three steals, and six rebounds to his standout performance. Williams came close with his 21 points and nine boards. Junior guard Isiah Stokley accumulated 13 points, three rebounds, three assists, and three steals. Allen added
11 points, eight boards, four steals, and two assists to his senior season statistics.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers return to the court Wednesday, Feb. 12, when they start another three-game road trip in Bridgeport, Conn. at ECC rival Bridgeport. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m.

The Post Theatre Company held the Virgil J. Lee New Play Festival on Feb. 6, 7 and 8. The festival is an annual event that showcases new work from LIU Post theater students and professional playwrights. This year featured “Falling in Line” by junior Sarah Taylor.
“[The plays] are usually staged readings,” Taylor told The Pioneer. The readings feature a combined effort, with theater majors serving as actors, as well as part of the production team. A director works alongside the playwright to develop the script at hand. Staged readings are a form of minimal theater, without elaborate sets or costuming. Actors read from scripts, and the effort is a means of improving the script.
Taylor’s “Falling in Line” was a period piece, set during the 1800s. “It is about a young drummer boy who is thrown from his home into a rag-tag group of soldiers during the Civil War,” she said. “During the rehearsal process I have been making the necessary changes to [the play] to make it the best it can be.”
The young playwright plans to move somewhere in Queens or near New York City after she graduates with her B.F.A. in Theater Arts. “From there I plan to find some type of job and audition, audition, audition,” she said. “My main focus is to be an actress, but I also plan to write plays on the side and hopefully get something published.”
“I always like to open my eyes and see what is going on with the world around me,” said Taylor. Like other artists, she finds inspiration by creatively viewing the mundane. “[Sometimes it’s] something as easy as reading the paper or taking in the scenery while walking somewhere. With theatre, I want people to leave a show with answers, but also with some questions. I like to put myself in other people’s shoes and see how they live.”
To Taylor, the people who fight for justice or equality, such as her little drummer boy in the Civil War, weighed in emotionally for the audience. Taylor said, “Unfortunately, we live in an unbalanced world, but I think if people start questioning the unbalances, then we can start evolving to a more equal way of living.”

In honor of Black History Month, the Black Students United (BSU), a club committed to encouraging a unified campus and sharing African-American culture and professionalism among LIU students, will host events the last week of February.

The LIU chapter of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a group that confronts issues affecting people of all races, religions, and backgrounds through outreach and education, will also host events from Feb. 10 to 12.
Black History Month is set aside to acknowledge, honor, and celebrate the achievements of black men and women throughout American history. Originally known as Negro History Week, Dr. Carter G. Woodson created Black History Month in 1926; a scholar with a Ph.D. from Harvard whose parents were both slaves.
Woodson became outraged that there was little to no proper written documentation of blacks in the United States. He fought endlessly to initiate what he felt was a needed change. Before the creation of Black History Month, African-Americans were expressed in historic literature as inferior, portrayed in a negative light.
Negro History Week was designated for the second week in February in 1926. Black History Week officially began in 1972 and four years later, in 1976, it became Black History Month.
In commemoration of this national annual tradition, the BSU will begin the week of events by hosting Family Feud, on Monday, Feb 24, co-sponsored by the NAACP. The game “will be based on the fame show format, with BSU and NAACP asking questions based off of black history past and present,” said Khadija Greenidge, sophomore Business Administration major and president of BSU.
The Student Caribbean Association (SCA) is an organization that promotes the education of the Caribbean and carbine culture through lecture, demonstration and entertainment. On Tuesday, Feb 25, BSU, co- sponsored by the SCA, will host a game night, in which students can play classic games with BSU and SCA. Both groups will be teaching students
how to play the card game Spades and Dominoes. The Family Feud and game night will both be held in the Hillwood Commons Fishbowl at 7:30p.m.
At 9 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 26, BSU will host a Scavenger Hunt that will take place at the Interfaith Center Chapel, located on the east side of campus. “The scavenger hunt will be during our general meeting,” said Greenidge. “As most scavenger hunts are structured, participants will get a list of hints and will have to find the picture around the chapel lounge describing it,” Greenidge added. The winner will be rewarded a $25 gift card.
On Thursday, Feb. 27, BSU will have a Movie Night at the Gold Coast Cinema, located in Hillwood Commons at 9 p.m. The film “Fruitvale Station” will be shown. The Movie Night will be co-sponsored by the Association for Campus Programming (ACP), a group that creates both large and small events to enhance college life outside the classroom.
NAACP hosted two other events this week for Black History Month. On Monday, Feb. 10, they hosted a speed-dating event in the Long Island Room of the Winnick center at 8:30 p.m. Students and members conducted informal mini interviews in search of a potential partner.
On Wednesday, Feb 12, NAACP celebrates Founders Day with a “birthday party in commemoration for the special date. Details about the event can be found on Instagram (@post_naacp),” stated Denell German, a junior Education major and president of the NAACP chapter at Post.
Black history is rich and vast, and has significance for everybody of all colors and race. “Black History Month is extremely important to me. It gives everyone in the world a chance to learn more about the African-American struggles, what we had to overcome, and how far we have come in today’s society,” said German. “It’s the one month of the year where we are recognized for all of our accomplishments.”

Feb. 14 can be one of the most dreaded days for some couples.
Valentine’s Day is that time of year when the pressure to show someone just how you feel about them, intensifies dramatically. Some people use Valentine’s Day as an opportunity to show their affection, while others think it is just consumer garbage. Either way, thinking of a perfect date and gift could be a challenge for some students.
“I think Valentine’s Day is a fun way to celebrate being with someone you love,” said Jacklyn Stringham, a junior Public Relations major. ”It gives a girl the chance to feel special and get a little pampered, even though I think that should happen every day.”
A fun and different Valentine’s Day date idea could be ice- skating. Between handholding, sweaters and hot chocolate, your valentine is sure to be pleased. Local rinks, such as IceWorks on Underhill Boulevard in Syosset, and the Port Washington Skating Center on Seaview Boulevard, cost no more than $30 for an hour of rentals. This cost-friendly date is not only cute, but also affordable for the couple on a budget.
The classic movie or dinner date is sure to please and will not add on any pressure to try to make a night too perfect, or romantic. If you do not feel like going out, you can stage your own film night in your house. Load up on some snacks and your favorite flicks. This could be a great idea for the couple that has just recently started dating or the couple that is still defining their relationship status. Some other cheap, last minute date ideas could be a karaoke bar night or simply spending the day together having lunch and going shopping (window shopping works too).
For the lovebirds on campus, LIU Post will also be hosting a few Valentine’s Day activities all week. On Thursday, Feb. 13 there will be a Valentine’s Day photo booth, for free, in the lobby of Hillwood Commons from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Evening fun on campus includes a Valentines’s Day date night dinner, which will also take place on Feb. 13 from 8 to 9 p.m. Dinner will be served in the Fishbowl, following “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” in the Gold Coast Cinema.
Whether you have a romantic evening planned with a special someone or just plan to stay in, these date ideas are sure to be a blast. Want to make the day even more special? Don’t forget the flowers and chocolate—it makes everyone feel wanted.

In its spring 2014 “Aerie real” campaign that launched this January, Aerie, American Eagle’s lingerie line, decided to ditch Photoshop. The models wearing the lingerie are not retouched. With its slogan, “Aerie real—the real you is sexy,” Aerie is taking a different approach to beauty rather than the traditional ways of altering the appearance of women.
Before Aerie, Dove was another brand that opposed giving girls and women false beauty ideals. Instead, Dove chose women with feminine curves for their commercials. However, Dove’s campaigns were targeted towards middle-aged women. Aerie, on the other hand, is a brand directed at teenage girls and young women.
While Victoria’s Secret is still taking advantage of the misleading functions of Photoshop, such as making stretch marks, tattoos, and other seemingly “imperfections” invisible, Aerie shows unaltered models throughout their entire spring campaign.
Mabel Santos Haugen, a junior Film major, said, that already at a young age, most ad campaigns convey the wrong ideal body image to girls. “Girls and young women think they need to look like the photoshopped models they see in the ads in order to fit the norm,” she said. “They have this image of retouched models in their head and think that’s the way they should look, but it’s not real because the pictures are edited,” she added.
“This campaign is a step in the right direction,” said Nicole Urbonas, a senior International Business major. “I guess Aerie is trying to reach out to a real, relatable market. It’s simply a fact that not everyone is a Victoria’s Secret model and when not retouched these models have their flaws.”
Of course, one could say that these campaigns, promoting more realistic standards, are not effective because there are only a few companies who have adopted this approach and the models are still skinny. But, it takes a lot of courage to go against the trend.
Brands should focus on representing the larger part of the population in their campaigns since customers want to imagine how certain pieces would look on them and not only on a size zero model with a B cup.
One campaign cannot change the way the industry addresses the population or conveys the ideal beauty image to society, but hopefully these pictures will be a wakeup call for some to realize: the real you is sexy.

When a celebrity dies unexpectedly, are we affected by it? Why is it that some of us feel a complete stranger’s sudden tragedy as strong as if it was a family member’s? The recent deaths of Paul Walker, the “Fast & Furious” movie star, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, the acclaimed stage and film star from “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,” have resulted in nationwide mourning by many who had seen them only in movies.
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the word “celebrity” as, “the state of being famous or celebrated.” Celebrities are individuals that society values. They are given this status for their accomplishments, family or friend relations, or by creating a name for themselves without any specific talent. But what happens when these elevated humans die? Does it affect us in any way? Well, let’s take a look at history.
When Princess Diana died in 1997, the world stopped. It was a tragedy for the royal family, but regular people took to the streets crying and mourning her death. Queen Elizabeth II took her time before addressing the people because this was a time of private mourning, even though it cost her some of popularity points. The people were mourning and they expected their monarch to address them, which she did eventually, but not as soon as some would have wanted. When Princess Diana’s funeral cortege was driving towards Westminster Abbey, and eventually reached her final resting place at the Spencer family home, over a million people lined up along the route. Millions more tuned in to watch the funeral on television worldwide.
Another world shock was Michael Jackson’s death. The grief spread all around the world in minutes, thanks to the rapid news coverage. His fans and followers gathered around special places in Jackson’s life, including his home, places where he performed, and his old record studio. It was a grief-ridden world that said goodbye to the King of Pop in a public memorial at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
Other famous people, whose deaths have shaken some to the core, were John Lennon and Elvis Presley. Both were deaths that have had a major impact on fans around the world. Lennon and Presley, like the others, were regular human beings with a talent that elevated them to iconic figures. They were loved, respected, and seen as a part of people’s lives.
So, are we affected by the deaths of a celebrity? Yes, absolutely. These are people who we learn to love, even though they are neither friends nor family members. In fact, we probably never met them or talked to them. However, they were important to us because we made them a part of our lives, and that is why we mourn for them as if they are our loved ones.

Students seem to be attached to their cell phones now more than ever. However, does that make it okay to text and drive, to text during class, or at dinner with your friends or family? LIU Post students responded overwhelmingly that manners and safety still do matter when it comes to cell phone use.
“You’re not paying for school to text,” said Jake Scotto, a junior Broadcasting major. In addition to being opposed to students texting in class, Scotto said that texting and driving makes him really mad. “Driving and texting pisses me off to no end, [and] not because you’re risking your own life. That’s your choice, but because you’ll hurt or even kill someone else just to grab your phone to text someone.”
Scotto said that it is unacceptable to text, “I’ll be there in five minutes,” at the same time as you’re driving. He added, “Texting and playing games when you’re with people is kind of rude. It’s not appropriate when you’re with people, driving or in class.”
Richard Renelique, a sophomore Broadcasting major, agreed. “It is appropriate to use my phone when I am alone, not moving, or not in a place where I must be silent. This is because I do not want to be a disruptive person, or put my life at risk,” he said.
“I have no intention to come close to death because of texting,” Renelique added. “To kids who text and drive, I’d tell them to find some alternative or learn self-control, or else they could end up injured or even deceased. You can even try parking before using the phone, at the very least,” Renelique stated.
Stephanie Morales, a sophomore Art Therapy major, also agreed that texting and driving should not be mixed. “Kids that text and drive do not realize how dangerous that could be. They could not only hurt themselves, but also others. They could take someone’s life,” she said. She also lamented about the plain rudeness of texting around others. “It’s appropriate to use your phone when you’re alone or not disturbing anyone around you because most people find being on a phone rude. For kids that text in class, I think it is rude and distracting to the teacher and students during lectures, but should be allowed when nothing important is going on.”
Josh Levine, sophomore Psychology major, like many college students, texts all day long. “I use my phone from when I wake up to when I fall asleep. I don’t really stop using it except driving, and when in conversation.” Levine continued, “Texting and driving is stupid. Wait until you’re at a red light or home. Never text while driving, it’s extremely dangerous, and you or others could get hurt.”
It is okay to text when you’re by yourself, and not bothering those around you. Texting while on the road is absolutely not acceptable, nor is using your phone in class. If you have an emergency to tend to, or a really important call that cannot wait, excuse yourself and respond to the text in the hallway. Your professors and classmates will appreciate
it. Please remember that every action has a consequence, not only when using your phone but in life, as well. It is your job to be proactive about decisions that you make.

Music was a natural part of my childhood. My siblings and I attended the Swedish Music School at an early age, and my parents moonlit their academic occupations with jazz performances at night. Harmonious singing during family road trips was an inevitable pastime, and at home, my parents’ collection of jazz music played as a constant soundtrack on the record player.
Even before I knew what jazz music was, I decided I did not like the unpredictable ba-bi-di-bopping. To my father’s outspoken dissatisfaction, I would always turn it off. Thereafter, I went through his large collection of CDs until I found my favorite; the one with all the colors—Billy Joel’s “River of Dreams” from 1993—and played it.
As I started to sing along to songs like “No Man’s Land” and “Two Thousand Years” with my made-up-English lyrics, my father would instantly forget my recent interruption, and join me. Together, we would sing along to these songs that we shared an affinity for, and the feeling was exhilarating. The generational gap—non-existent.
Usually, his sudden excitement developed into nostalgia. Before I knew it, I was obliged to follow him on a trip down Memory Lane, to the good ole ‘80s, when MTV actually played music, and shoulder pads seemed to find their way into everything. But perhaps more importantly: when my, at the time, 17-year- old father discovered the musical treasure of a little man from Hicksville, N.Y., named Billy Joel.
It was 1980. My father had just left Sweden for Memphis to do a year as an exchange high school student, when his American host brother, Russell, insisted on showing him his new Tennessean hometown.
As they were cruising in the Buick, Russell played Joel’s album “The Stranger” from 1977. Amazed with what he was hearing, my father asked Russell to take him to the nearest record store.
Before he went to bed that night, he had caught up on seven albums and nine years of Billy Joel’s music. It was only the beginning for Joel, but my father was stuck for life. During my early days by the CD player, singing and listening to my father’s memories, I adopted the bond to Joel’s music that he had discovered 25 years before me. Although I am well aware that it is not particularly cool to share these kinds of opinions with your parents, Joel is still my favorite artist.
This year, Joel turns 65. He has not released any new music since the “Fantasies & Delusions” album in 2001. That was enough reason for me to assume that his days of live performing were over. Oh, was I wrong!
Celebrating 50 years as an artist, Joel announced a show in Madison Square Garden on Jan. 27, which sold out immediately. Since then, he has established a residency at the prestigious venue, with a show every month from March to September. All of them sold out.
Miraculously—well, thanks to the very generous parents of my boyfriend—I ended up with second hand tickets, two weeks before the January show. So, on that Monday, it was time to fulfill a life-long dream. Remarkably younger, but nonetheless excited like my fellow concertgoers, I experienced a night not soon forgotten. As Joel fired off one well-known hit after another, he proved that he’s still got it. Only during his small talk in between songs could you tell that Joel is getting older—a fact he did not hesitate to joke about.
The crowd seemed to sing along to every word throughout the evening, myself included. Iconic melodies were the highlight of the night; during songs like “New York State of Mind” and “Piano Man” the enthusiasm in the venue was mind-blowing.
Somewhere in the middle of the evening, familiar African rhythms morphed into “River of Dreams.” I could not help but think about home: the CD collection, my favorite one with all the colors, and my father. My father. I wish he could have been there with me.

Whether you love it or hate it, Valentine’s Day comes every February. Many students are excited to spend the day with their special someone and to revel in the day’s festivities. On the other hand, a lot of students are excited for the day to pass. One thing we seem to have in common is a desire to indulge in a good movie, curled up on the couch with our significant other, a close friend, or just alone, with our favorite candy not far away.
When it comes to the students at LIU Post, an eclectic variety of film genres were recommended to watch on the acclaimed “day of love.” However, the majority of students like to curl up to film that is romantic in nature—much like the day itself.
“I’m a sap for a good romantic chick flick,” said Michelle Gruber, a junior Education major. She recommends her favorite movie, “Something Borrowed,” or a romantic classic like “The Notebook.”
It is clear that Gruber represents some of the students at Post because the general census among students was that they would be watching “The Notebook” on Valentine’s Day. “The Notebook,” originally a novel written by Nicholas Sparks, stars Rachel McAdams as Allie Hamilton and Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun in a tale about everlasting love and the trial and tribulations it endures. The film was released in 2004.
Even the male population at Post seemed to be in agreement. In truth, many of the male students appeared to be at a loss for suggestions when it came to recommending a movie for Valentine’s Day. Yet, they still perceived the effect that “The Notebook” had on their female peers. “Well, I heard ‘The Notebook’ was a good movie to watch on Valentine’s Day,” said Brian Riley, a sophomore Journalism student, who had not personally seen the film.
Akilah Courtney, a senior Electronic Media major, recommended the appropriately named movie “Valentine’s Day,” and not only because of the all-star cast, with celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher, Taylor Swift, and Jessica Biel. Instead, Courtney recommended “Valentine’s Day” because she believes it to be “the perfect example of what Valentine’s Day embodies.”
Much like Courtney, Kevin O’Lear, a sophomore Broadcasting major, will be watching movies that he believes embodies the essence of Valentine’s Day. O’Lear’s top recommendations were “Bee Movie,” “Scott Pilgram vs. the World,” and “Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.” However, O’Lear was most emphatic about the movie entitled “The Room”—an independent film directed, produced and written by Tommy Wiseau.
In contrast, Rachel Haas, a freshman Digital Art and Design major, heeded a warning to never watch “The Room” as it is potentially the worst movie ever. “Don’t listen to her!” said O’Lear, going on to say, “It is a very tragic movie about a romance, love and betrayal. I think it’s very heartwarming and touching.”
Melanie Spina, a sophomore Journalism major, would much prefer a feel–good movie that retains a romantic undertone. Spina’s recommendation was the recently released “That Awkward Moment” starring Zac Effron and Miles Teller. The film is not for the faint of heart, presenting issues of monogamy and promiscuity through scenes that are said to be explicitly sexual. However, Spina stands by her recommendation. “In the end, everybody finds love in an unexpected way.”
While many students chose classic romance titles such as “The Notebook” or “Titanic,” many preferred to think outside of the box when recommending what they believe to be the perfect Valentine’s Day film.

Going into Mitchell Kraeling’s basement to listen to various bands was a regular for some Long Island kids. Man Overboard was one of the bands that played, now well noted across the state and country. Two years ago, Mitch was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma—a rare type of bone cancer. The first Mitch-a-Palooza event was created in response to this and brought huge success as Long Island bands came together to raise awareness, support, and donations to Mitchell and his family at the Broadway Bar in Amityville.
In Oct. 2013, Mitchell Kraeling lost his battle to cancer. Nick Amalfitano, lead guitarist of Bellwether, was introduced to Crime in Stereo by Mitch, which happened to be his favorite band. They were best friends.
Hosted by East Coast Collective, a Long Island booking and promotion company, and Amalfitano, the second Mitch-a-Palooza event on Sunday, Feb 9, gathered five of Mitchell’s favorite bands, including Crime in Stereo, to the 89 North Music Venue in Patchogue. “He was always loved,” Amalfitano stated. “I had asked Vinnie [Caruana] to
do this benefit show and he was 100 percent for it. We talked with everyone—it seemed in the works since Mitch had a good relationship with Kristian of Crime in Stereo.”
Tomahawk Chop, No Good News, Bellwether, Vinnie Caruana (I Am the Avalanche/The Movielife), and Crime in Stereo, were the bands that performed. When asked what does Mitch-a-Palooza represent, Dan Clemens, guitarist/vocalist of Tomahawk Chop, responded, “We’re celebrating a kid who was a little too radical. He had a heart of gold—he was taken too early.”
Lined up across the ballroom of the venue were tables of merchandise and raffle prizes, all of which were donated by various vendors. Running the booths were Paul Brandel, Dylan McGovern, and Lauren Pardo: friends of Mitchell and supporters of the bands performing. “[This is] all about lifelong friendships and we all went to high school together,” said Brandel. “Mitch would want this.”
“All proceeds of the show go straight to the 11 South Wing in the Stony Brook University Medical Center in the Pediatric Ward, where Mitchell was treated,” Pardo noted. The group has already reached its goal, but if you wish to donate, you can do so at igg.me/at/ Mitchapalooza.
These bands, along with over one hundred Long Island music fans, put on an amazing show and demonstrated the interconnectivity of friendship, brotherhood, and as Desmond Zantua, lead singer of Bellwether, said, “Don’t mourn, celebrate. This is the perfect celebration, [like] a giant swan song.”

After having spent a week away on the Bahamas for preseason, the LIU Post swim team was back to keep up their great record in the regular season. The team kicked off their final stretch with Senior Day, a special occasion in many ways. The day is a tribute to the seniors on the team for their last appearance at home. The squad spent time decorating the walls of the Pratt natatorium for the big day on Saturday, Jan. 25.
Many came out to support the Pioneers in their second to last meet of the regular season, facing the Purple Knights from Bridgeport. “We had a big crowd, including both parents and alumni, which was a nice change, and the support meant a lot to the team”, sophomore Seren Jones said.
The green machine definitely took advantage of the sentimental ambiance surrounding the event by winning eight of 11 meets, scoring four new top-five times, one team record, and four pool records.
Megan Brazier, a sophomore, led the way to victory. Brazier had a hand in four event wins, two individual and two relays. Her impressive 100-yard backstroke race gave way to a new pool record, and was the fourth best time in school history. She managed to notch a ’B’ cut time of 56:97.
It was a special day to remember for the team, and Jones was pleased. ”We did very well, and we were happy that the seniors’ send off was so successful. They’ve contributed so much to our team it was important that they got their recognition,” Jones added.
Jones mentioned that there were two seniors, who have been swimming for four years at Post. “Chelcee Hew and Tamara Garriock are the first girls in four years to complete a whole four-year collegiate swimming”, she said.
The team’s success on Senior Day allowed them to keep their standing in the national rankings. The College Swimming Coaches Association of America summed up the month of January by releasing its final NCAA Div. II rankings of the 2013-14 season on Friday, 31, and the Pioneers remained 11th.
With a perfect month behind them, the green and gold headed to the East Stroudsbourg Invitational on Saturday, Feb. 1, to close up their regular season. In a continous winning strive, the Pioneers overwhelmed their opponents by winning nine out of 16 meets. Senior Tamara Garriock was eager to finish her regular college career in success, and scored 2 individual wins. The Pioneers also placed top two in the two relays of this afternoon.
With a perfect 2014 record, and 9-1 overall, the Pioneers are heading into postseason for the important meets, starting with the Metropolitan Conference Championships at Rutgers in Pistachaway, N.J. on Feb. 15-17.
