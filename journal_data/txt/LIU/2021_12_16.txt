Post is home to the inaugural class of the Positive Transitions to Work (PTW) program. The program is offered through Positive Behavior Support (PBS) Consultation in collaboration with the campus’ Center for Community Integration.
PTW is a two year program where college aged adults with developmental disabilities can learn vocational skills in a group of cohorts. The PTW program focuses on supporting independence and personal growth.
Students are exposed to six different career field options identified as important by the US Department of Labor; human Resources, business, communications, health, agriculture and manufacturing.
Though only in its inaugural year, the PTW program is being well received by students.
“I’m loving it so far. I learned that I appreciate not just writing but also there’s several other jobs people can take and how each of those jobs contribute to society whether low or high,” PTW student Victor Hoang said.
Hoang loves art, writing and fiction. 
”It’s a very calm, peaceful environment where we do group sessions and activities as a group, so that we’ll be given time to learn and develop,” Hoang said.
Hoang has been working towards the goal of providing for himself and his family through the PTW program.
“I wish to work independently and lead a more independent life, and also to help my mother make some money in order to live a fulfilling life, and in order to do that I need to learn how to work,” Hoang said.
Behind every student there is a mentor. Hoang’s mentor is Victoria Arias. Arias is part of Post’s early childhood education masters program.
”I just look forward to coming and hanging out with Victor. He’s given me some movie recommendations. We just learn more about each other everyday. It’s been a great experience, and meeting everyone else too has been fun,” Arias said.
Arias signed on to be a mentor for the PTW program in order to fulfill some hours needed for a course, but ended up staying for the experience.
“I had never worked with anyone with any developmental disabilities, I have some family members that have some disabilities, but this was the first time for me. This was for a class to get some hours, but honestly, I’ve done more than I ever had to for class just because I enjoy spending time here,” Arias said.
Arias says she learned confidence from Hoang. He is far more outgoing than her, while she is more of an introvert.
“I never really put myself out there to try new things, I never thought that I would be a mentor for anyone. I just think this is a great opportunity and I hope to continue,” Arias said.
The PTW program interviews less than half of the applicants they receive applications from, and accepts less than half of those interviewed. The program is selective, but this ensures the students coming in are ready to work.
One hope Arias and Hoang share for the PTW program is that the Post community would be more receptive to them. 
“I wish more people knew about the program and signed on to be a mentor and tried to include them in the community and be friends with them too,” Arias said.
Hoang wishes more people knew about the program, and signed up to be part of it as well. 
“I want them to know that if they know somebody that has a developmental disability of some sort. A young adult looking for a purpose in life, I recommend them coming here, where they can learn about themselves,” Hoang said.
Hoang encourages anyone on the Post campus to introduce themselves to any PTW student, they are looking to be a part of the campus community as well.For more information on the PTW program, visit https://www.positivebehavior.org/ptw.html.

The Netflix drama “Squid Game,” which has proven to be one of the most popular releases of 2021, has been pushed off the number one spot in Netflix’s Top Ten for Non- English TV, dropping down into third behind season two of “Queen of Flow” and season one of “Hellbound,” respectively in first and second.
While it seems that “Squid Game” might now be declining in terms of popularity, it has been featured on the aforementioned chart for the past 11 consecutive weeks; nearly three months after the initial airing of the show.
“Squid Game has officially reached 111 million fans – making it our biggest series launch ever!” read a tweet by Netflix on Oct. 12, 2021.
The story-driven show written by Hwang Dong-hyuk surrounds the idea of a set of games that gives hundreds of in-debt Korean citizens the opportunity to win a fortune 45.6 million won, or die trying. Each consecutive game played acts as a trial in which more and more people are eliminated. In the feature of nine episodes, the season develops as viewers follow lead character Seong Gi-hun through the cinematic and deadly games featured in the show.
The acclaimed tv series has succeeded in being Netflix’s highest watched tv shows of the year, gaining 571,760,000 hours viewed in just its third week of airing. In total, Squid Game has amassed more than 1.6 billion views. It reached number one on Netflix’s top charts in all 94 of the countries that Netflix streams in.
“I thought it was really good up until the end, I didn’t like the acting portrayed by the animal mask wearers, they weren’t very good. All up to that point, I was like, this is awesome,” junior musical theatre major Cameron Stanick said.
Other viewers had slightly different reactions.
“It was my favorite movie this year for sure. I thought the plot and story was really well done, the cinematics of the show were great. It was a really good movie,” sophomore computer science major Nathaniel Pyram said.
This new wave of success of Korean culture in countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom has been a rising trend over the past decade, and shows such as “Squid Game” have been highly influential in contributing to this trend; so much so that it has captured the interests of people who don’t regularly indulge in K-dramas.
 “I really enjoyed the movie even though it’s very different from what I usually watch, I don’t watch Korean dramas regularly. I watch teenage girls’ shows, stuff like that,” freshman health sciences major Gianna Pavese said.
Along with “Squid Game,” movies such as “Parasite,” a Korean based film featured on Hulu,  have further fueled this wave of cultural movement. 
“Parasite,” a blockbuster hit on its own, was raved over in the reviews, obtaining a 98 percent on rotten tomatoes, and an audience score of 90 percent.
“After the movie Parasite came out, I think Korean films started to pop up more. I like the way Korean films are shot, which is different from American films. I love the vibe of the movies, as well as the music,” bio-med Grad Student Sabri Abu Salim said.
The streaming company plans to release more Korean films, now having established two production facilities in the country. Over a five year time span from from 2015 to 2020, Netflix produced over 80 shows in Korea and has invested over 700 million USD into Korean movies.
In parallel with these critically acclaimed movies, k-pop, as well as other forms of asian pop, like j-pop, have carved a major listenership into the modern American audience.
Korean pop, or K-pop, is a genre of music that is characterized by Korean artists singing over pop instrumentals. Young influential k-pop groups such as BTS and Blackpink have made a name for themselves on the American stage, even overachieving the success of Justin Beiber. 
In 2017, BTS won the award for Billboard’s Top Social Artist, putting an end to Beibers 6-year long run. That same year, the group became the first Korean group to be featured on the Billboard’s Top Ten.
“I am not surprised that k- pop is big in the U.S. now, I’ve had a lot of friends who had been big into k-pop since I was a freshman in high school, at least 4 years ago, My girl has always been a big BTS fan, and they had been doing more shows in New York in the past years before covid happened,” Pyram said.
That being said, the social influence of “Squid Game” on the U.S. has created a huge impact on the community. For instance, the show has inspired a real life replication of the game itself by a Youtube collaborative, under the Youtube channel named MrBeast.
“I saw MrBeast’s version and thought it mirrored that Netflix version really well, and there was a lot of money on the line which gave it actual stakes,” Pyram said. 
The replication features all of the same details of the movie; 456 people starting out, competing for 456,000 USD (instead of won), with only one winner.
The YouTube video has amounted to over 142,123,000 views in the less than two weeks it has been uploaded.

       Post Theatre Company (PTC) premiered the first of five performances of the show “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” on Friday Nov. 19. It was directed by Jason Jacobs and assistant director Grey Sindaco. 
The show featured 10 performers playing one of three roles. The show follows the journey of a German rock singer, Hedwig, and her backing band, the Angry Inch.
To accommodate the number of actors in PTC, the show had multiple actors playing the same character – Hedwig – at different stages of her life. 
Members of the cast and crew shared their thoughts on this re-imagined version of the show.
 “Classic plays and musicals invite interpretation, and this production is shaped by a new generation of young artists who are tearing down the walls of traditional gender strictures. Our rehearsals have been an inquiry into how this multifaceted role can be embodied by a diverse ensemble – and how this story continues to resonate, more than 20 years since its inception,” Jacobs said in the director’s note. 
Other members of the crew shared similar thoughts on the importance of interpretation in musical theatre.
“It definitely started with research and understanding the songs. I had to blend characters and make it clear in the movement. Their different characters but all one. It’s definitely a different take on the show,” senior musical theatre major, and choreographer for the show, Danielle Burman said. 
Burman choreographed the songs “Origin of Love” and “Wig in a Box” for the production.
“ “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” explores a variety of concepts, one of which is that of the mythological construct of love […] In its entirety, Hedwig serves as a guide through one’s journey of self-actualization, taking the good with the ugly,” read the dramaturgical note by junior musical theatre major Sarah Beth Barlow.
The show explores themes of love and gender identity set to a score of rock music. Members of the crew shared their thoughts on the premise and purpose of the play.
“The purpose is to show that our lives are shaped by so many different events and there are so many different pieces to us. We have to find love and acceptance within ourselves before other people,” junior arts management and stage management major Jillian Sajda said. Sajda served as the stage manager for this production.
Other members of the crew shared similar sentiments of the importance of the themes of the show.
“It’s an exploration of gender identity in the point of view of Hedwig as they transition and their identity through what it means to not be a part of a binary,” Burman said. 
“I hope our Hedwig celebrates the diversity of gender expression in this community,” read the director’s note by Jacobs.
The show explores a wide variety of concepts set to the sound of exhilarating rock music. Members of the crew shared various elements of the show they consider their favorites.
  “I loved working on the dances […] it was great to collaborate with my peers,” Burman said.
Others shared similar thoughts on the fulfilment that came with progressing through every stage of the production and the important role every member of the cast and crew played.
“My favorite part was seeing it all come together with a live audience. […] Watching how moved the audience was was breathtaking. […] This is the first live show I’ve worked on since the pandemic. It was really nice to get back into doing live shows and having all those components. And it didn’t hurt that I had a great cast and creative team,” Sajda said.
Members of the crew shared thoughts on the importance of communication and teamwork in their jobs.
“My job is so centered on people that I can’t do it without the team,” Sajda said.
“Coming in prepared with a vision and understanding how you want your vision to come to life and communicating that clearly is the important part of my job,” Burman said.
There is a lot to take away and learn from Hedwig’s story. Members of the crew shared their thoughts on what they hoped the audience got out of the show.
“I hope that they had a good time. I hope they were able to see the beauty and the universalness of Hedwig’s story,” Sajda said.
“Other members of the crew shared similar thoughts on the importance of the theme of empathy in the show.
“I hope [the audience] sees[s] a different perspective through the lens of Hedwig. It’s a difficult story to tell and it has moments of uncomfortability but I hope they saw a different experience in someone else’s shoes,” Burman said.

Legendary composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim passed away at age 91 on Nov. 26. 
Sondheim was one of musical theatre’s most revered and beloved composer-lyricists of the 20th century – receiving acclaim for reinventing the American musical. His work was known for exploration of the human psyche and tackling complex ideas related to the large human experience.
Students on campus were very fond of Sondheim and his work; his death was very saddening and came as a shock to some.
“It was one of those things where you knew it would happen eventually but not so soon,” sophomore musical theatre major Laura DeGraw said.
Others shared similar sentiments of disbelief at hearing the news of his passing.
“I was simply just shocked. […] It’s something that came so suddenly and it’s unfortunate he didn’t get to live long enough for the world to be opened after covid but at least the theatre world was mostly open,” senior musical theatre major Jade Burns said.
Sondheim wrote the lyrics and composed the music for many musicals throughout his lengthy career – his best-known works include “West Side Story” and “Company.”
His works have a lasting legacy and many were warmly received by his supporters and critics alike. Sondheim’s accolades include eight Tony Awards and eight Grammy Awards.
 Students on campus shared various opinions and reasoning for their favorite of Sondheim’s works.
“My favorite show is either “Sweeney Todd” or “Into the Woods.” “Sweeney Todd” was the first musical I saw by him […] my favorite song is “Roses Turn” from “Gypsy” […] the song is bold and brassy and the character finally had her moment, it’s so amazing to watch,” Burns said.
DeGraw favors another Sondheim classic.
“I love “Take Me to the World,” it’s such a sweet song. I love the way it’s written and composed. […] My favorite show is “Into the Woods.” The storytelling is so clever, especially the way he ties the characters into the songs,” DeGraw said.
 The uniqueness and complexity of Sondheim’s music is something that helped launch him into legendary status. Students on campus share in this appreciation.
“He’s just so clever with his use of music. None of his works are carbon copies of each other. […] He was always exploring what musical theatre could be,” DeGraw said.
Other students shared similar sentiments.
“His music is just so unique to him; he has his own feeling to his music,” Burns said.
 Sondheim’s work is influential to musical theatre as a whole on a large scale but also to the lives and careers of individuals. Students on campus credit Sondheim with igniting their love for musical theatre.
“Sondheim is the reason I’m doing musical theatre. […] I fell in love with his characters and stories and ability to take outlandish ideas and make them human and real […] If I ever questioned doing musical theatre I would relisten to his music and there was nothing else that made me feel the way his work did,” DeGraw said.
Other students shared similar sentiments of the importance of Sondheim’s work to their personal career choices.
 “There was something with musical theatre that wasn’t entirely there but with Sondheim’s work […] I knew I wanted to do musical theatre because of his work,” Burns said.
Though now revered as a legend and icon in the theatre world, this has not always been the case. A lot of Sondheim’s works were initially box-office failures and didn’t receive much commercial success or love from critics. 
A common critique of Sondheim’s work early on was that it was too austere and cerebral for mainstream culture – sometimes even being labelled dark.
Students on campus share their thoughts on Sondheim’s work pushing the boundaries of musical theatre and as a result dividing opinion.
  “I think that when he was first making music it was definitely a point in time when musical theatre was stereotyped into a box as happy-go-lucky; white picket fence; American dream. What Sondheim did was talk about issues that weren’t being talked about. […] I wouldn’t say it’s dark, I would say it’s raw emotion and attention to details that wasn’t normally seen in theatre. […] he really knew how to get emotion out of the characters he wrote,” Burns said.
Others shared similar thoughts of Sondheim’s work challenging the musical theatre norms of his time.
“He did what felt authentic to him and he didn’t care about pleasing critics. […] His work reflects real life and life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows. He approaches it all with such grace,” DeGraw said.
 Sondheim’s impact on the musical theatre community and the lives of the people in it will be remembered and celebrated for decades to come.

The United States has seen a 6.8 percent rise in inflation for the month of November. This continues a trend that has occurred as the economy has opened up after an unprecedented shutdown brought on by COVID-19. As inflation has been a major point of conversation recently, and economics professor Dr. Udayan Roy has a lot to say on what has caused this recent spike.
“[Inflation is generally caused when] the central bank of the country prints currency at a faster rate than the increase of its productive capacity,” Roy said.
At the root of this period of increased inflation is the stimulus that was given to American citizens in an effort to provide aid during the pandemic. With money coming in and fewer ways to spend it in a mostly closed economy, Americans began to save and reached a higher amount of savings than they previously had.
“As the economy started reopening, the opportunities to spend rose and all of that saved up money started getting spent. That increased demand led to inflation,” Roy said.
While Roy identifies this as a cause of the inflation, he feels the stimulus was still necessary and that doing nothing to help people during the uncertain times of the pandemic would have been a worse option. Another contributing factor to inflation has been an increase in the price of goods owed to the unique circumstances that COVID-19 has brought. 
“People could not spend on travel, or entertainment like going to the theater. Most of the spending has been on goods like exercise machines and cars,” Roy said. He adds that the disproportionate increase in demand for goods rather than services led to problems with the supply chain, as the shipping industry became overwhelmed.
“Many businesses scaled back their productive capacities because they thought the lockdown would last for a long time. The economy opened faster than most anticipated,” Roy said, further explaining the cause of the rise of goods which has contributed to inflation.
As for a solution, one option is for the Federal Reserve to take direct action. “The central bank can reduce inflation by raising interest rates, because if interest rates rise then it’s harder for people to borrow money to buy a car or to buy a house or something like that or for businesses to borrow money to expand,” Roy said.

LIU’s very own WCWP radio station celebrated its 60th anniversary on the air on Oct. 18, 2021.
Over the past 60 years, WCWP has delivered insight and entertainment to the entire LIU community. Throughout its time on campus, WCWP has become a landmark of history for all of Long Island. The LIU Post campus radio station is the oldest college radio station on Long Island. 
WCWP has always had a unique ability to illuminate current events while diffusing the current interest of the students, but also for bringing the student body together. Senior adolescent education major and Co-Station-Manager Jordan Georgiano said the radio station has positively impacted his time at Post.
“My freshman year, I was rather shy, and during fall of 2018, a friend of mine brought me to the station several times while he was doing his live rock n’ roll show,” he said. “While I was there, I ended up talking to some of the other members of the station and found that I had a lot in common with them. Many of them became close friends of mine to this day.”
In its time on campus, WCWP has become more than just a radio station; it embodies the LIU community. Among the lifelong friendships between students and even staff, WCWP has also evolved into a beloved alumni community. During the last 60 years, WCWP has developed an alumni association of hundreds of alumni. 
This alumni association is a special addition to the LIU community, with many successful names and personalities that still remain engaged on campus today. These alumni have stayed in touch and are involved with one another and the campus community in many ways. LIU and WCWP alumni Jeff Kroll has been involved with the radio station for 50 years.
“I walked into WCWP 50 years ago, in Sept. 1971, when I started my Freshman year at CW Post. Many of our folks have gone on to long careers in broadcasting, and many have not, but we’ve remained a tight-knit, ever-growing group through these years,” he said. “Our big event is Homecoming Weekend each year, where all the generations can get together.”
Over the years, WCWP’s alumni association has remained an active part of the station and its future endeavors. In recent years with the hard work of the current students, staff and the ever-growing support of the alumni, WCWP has accumulated more traction for its evolving content. Recently, WCWP has made history yet again by breaking the internet side of radio as well. After being a strictly FM station for a majority of its time on the air, WCWP has split into the FM side (WCWP) and the web side (The Wave). 
A remarkable endeavour such as this is not only gaining the station more exposure, but it raises levels of excitement across the student body as well. Students find more ways to get involved on campus while learning from the talented LIU staff.
Senior digital art and design major and Co-Station-Manager DeAnna Aguinaldo claims the station is becoming more of a commodity to students outside of just the communications department.
“One major change we’ve seen is how diverse the majors of our members have become. When I first joined, the ratio of broadcasting majors to none was very high,” she said. “Now it’s the complete opposite. It hurts to see the enrollment of broadcasting majors dwindle as each year passes, but it makes me happy to see other majors take an interest in the broadcasting field.”
Over the last 60 years, WCWP has remained a staple of the LIU community. It’s even evolved into so much more. From students to staff, everyone will agree that WCWP is a unique aspect of LIU. Students are always welcome to share ideas and spark their creativity. 
Therefore, celebrating a milestone like 60 years is not only a huge accomplishment for everyone involved but an exceptional aspect of their lives. Aguinaldo is excited about what the station has become and all the future memories it will hold.
“As one of our alumni would say, ‘Morale is at an all-time high!’ We may come from different backgrounds, majors, interests, ages, but the morale we share with one another is something I don’t think a lot of other clubs or organizations truly have,” she said. “My members, new and old, they’re the biggest part of why I’m involved with the station. Without them, myself, WCWP, and The Wave wouldn’t be where they are today.”
You can listen to music, shows, and live sports for WCWP on 88.1 FM and The Wave on liuwave.org. 
After 60 years of making memories and changing lives, WCWP has embarked on a special side of history for the LIU community.

This year, Hanukkah began on Sunday, Nov. 28 and will be celebrated until Dec. 6. Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a Jewish holiday that lasts eight days. The holiday is a festival that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem by lighting the candles every day of the festival. 
Sophomore health science major Riley Goldberg proudly celebrates Hanukkah every year whether she is home with her family or not. Goldberg is from California, so she was unable to go home to celebrate.
“I have celebrated Hanukkah every year since I was born, and that has been no different since coming to college. I may not be home with my family celebrating but they are just a phone call away and it is still a special time to celebrate my Jewish origins,” she said.
Goldberg and her family still honor and celebrate the Christian holiday Christmas, and she is excited to at least be home to celebrate that holiday with her family.
“I do not know anyone who isn’t Jewish that celebrates Hanukkah. However, my family also celebrates Christmas, despite being 100 percent Jewish. We use Christmas as a time to bring together the entire extended family and spend the day embracing one another,” Goldberg said.
Sophomore Charli Cohen, who is from Florida, grew up in an interfaith family where her dad is Jewish and her mom is Christian. Cohen understands that this is a little uncommon blend of religions, but she is thankful that her family is loving towards one another regardless of their faith. 
“I don’t really have a comment about being raised in a family that celebrates two different religions because I’ve grown up with it my entire life, but I am very grateful that I am. I celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas every year and I’m thankful that my parents haven’t pressured me into choosing which faith I want to practice.”
Cohen has family that lives in Long Island, and is excited to continue her Jewish traditions and celebrate her roots during this Hanukkah season.
“My brother and cousin both live about 40 minutes away from Post, and so I am happy that I am able to keep my Jewish traditions alive with them by lighting the menorah. I am also thrilled to then be able to travel home where I can then celebrate Christmas with the rest of my family,” Cohen said.

Fans are getting excited as we near the end of the NFL’s first-ever 18 week season, in which all teams will get the chance to play 17 games with one bye week. Some teams are unexpectedly coming out on top, while others have struggled to perform. 
During week 13, the Detroit Lions finally had their first win against the Minnesota Vikings, and the Indianapolis Colts destroyed the Houston Texans 31-0. Those were just two of many big moments in this NFL season. 
Junior marketing major Maxwell Morris is a big fan of football and watches the sport every week. 
“I thought week 13 was impressive to say the least,” Morris said. “We got to see more of Cam Newton playing back in his own colors, which put a smile on my face.”
Morris is referring to Newton’s one-year Carolina Panthers hiatus, in which he played for the New England Patriots as their quarterback. He’s now back playing with his original team.
Morris’ favorite team, the Arizona Cardinals, are currently 10-2 and have the best record in the NFC.
“The Cardinals are definitely either the best or one of the best teams in the league right now,” he said. “They’re on fire with Kylar Murray as their quarterback, and they’ve got some really good receivers too.” 
Another big Cardinals fan is sophomore adolescent education major Samuel Anglim.
“The Cardinals are the best team in the league on both sides of the ball,” Anglim said. “They have a phenomenal offense with a lot of weapons.”
A team on the other side of that spectrum would be the New York Giants, who are receiving a lot of heat this season for their poor performance
“The Giants have scored 18 total touchdowns this year,” Anglim said. “To put that into perspective, Colts running back Jonathan Taylor has scored 18 touchdowns this year alone.” 
Morris and Anglim, like many other fans, are not shocked by this season’s current division leaders.
“I don’t think there are any surprises in who the division leaders are. Kansas City, Bucs, Patriots, Cardinals, Packers, are all to be expected,” Morris said.
Anglim already has predictions on how the end of the season will look.
“While I think this season has been very inconsistent and there are few teams that are Super Bowl favorites, the Buccaneers and the Patriots will most likely go to the Super Bowl this year,” he said.
Fans are excited to see where these next few weeks will take us. There are many crucial games coming up within the last few weeks of the season, so you definitely won’t want to miss out.

The 64th annual Grammy Awards ceremony will air on Mon. Jan. 31, 2022. The top categories consist of Best New Artist, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.
The Best New Artist nominees are Aroof Aftab, Jimmie Allen, Baby Keem, FINNEAS, Glass Animals, Japanese Breakfast, Arlo Parks, The Kid LAROI, Olivia Rodrigo, and Saweetie.
“It’s kind of funny to me that Glass Animals is nominated for Best New Artist. They’ve been around since 2014, so that’s funny to me because they aren’t very new,” senior theatre arts and international relations major Matthew Sporrer said.
On campus and on social media, the clear frontrunner for the Best New Artist category is Olivia Rodrigo.
“All of those artists are new and upcoming, they have all had great albums, but Olivia Rodrigo seems universal. You could go up to anyone and they would say they have at least heard of her, if not heard her songs,” Sporrer said.
Other students have similar feelings about Rodrigo.
“I think Baby Keem is phenomenal. I think if they go with an out there pick, it would be him. I do think they will probably go with Olivia Rodrigo,” senior acting major Steele Whitney said.
Album of the year has many big names in the list of nominees. The nominees include “Love For Sale” – Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga, “Justice (Triple Chucks Deluxe)” – Justin Bieber, “Planet Her (Deluxe)” – Doja Cat, MONTERO – Lil Nas X, “SOUR” – Olivia Rodrigo, “evermore” – Taylor Swift, and “Donda” – Kanye West.
In this category, students had different opinions on who they think will win.
“I don’t think Olivia Rodrigo will win, because I do think she will probably take home Best New Artist. It’s been a minute since Kanye has actually been a contender for best album, so there’s a possibility that “Donda” wins,” Whitney said.
Others felt that this category has different possible winners.
“I’ve listened to “evermore,” “Montero,” and “SOUR.” I think that “Montero,” being nominated is really cool since Lil Nas X is one of the first out, Black, gay rappers. If he wins that, it could make history. I would love to see him win, but the album I would choose is “evermore,” Sporrer said.
For Record of the Year, the nominees include “I Still Have Faith In You” – ABBA, “I Get A Kick Out Of You” – Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga, “Kiss Me More” – Doja Cat feat. SZA, “Happier Than Ever” – Billie Eilish, “Montero” (Call Me By Your Name) – Lil Nas X, “drivers license” – Olivia Rodrigo, and “Leave The Door Open” – Silk Sonic.
‘“Drivers License” was the song with the most continuous streams ever. The impact that song had throughout later quarantine gives it that push towards winning, “Montero” was another song you heard everywhere when it came out. I think ABBA being nominated is really cool, with them being from the 1970s,” Sporrer said.
Students feel that the Grammy nominations show how much the music industry is changing.
“Compared to past years, this group of nominations seems pretty diverse. I don’t think there should be one artist who walks out completely sweeping the table. When that happens, you’re ignoring other artists. I think that it is better for different types of music to be celebrated,” Sporrer said.
Whitney adds that the diverse music types shown have correlation to streaming services opening up people to different types of music.
“Fifteen years ago, there was no way for people to kind of curate your tastes for you, but with the addition of streaming services into our world, they make playlists for you and expose you to other artists you would like. They expose you to more music. People are more accepting of music they usually wouldn’t listen to. I do think that people’s music tastes can expand because of streaming services,” Whitney said.
Time will tell who the winners will be. Tune in on Jan. 31st to watch the ceremony.

Heading into the 2021 offseason, the New York Mets had a lot of questions that needed to be answered. After a very underwhelming 2020-2021 season, fans were disgruntled, as it looked as though the Mets were going to be a top team in the National League until their collapse at the end of the season. With owner Steven Cohen publicly expressing his frustration with the current roster, it was clear that significant changes were coming for the Mets. 
MLB free agency began on Nov. 8, as St. Louis Cardinals LHP T.J. McFarland was the first free agent to sign. Following this initial deal, many players followed suit in the weeks after, particularly former Mets. 
On Nov. 16, RHP Noah Syndergaard agreed to a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels in what was seen as a stunning move for many. Less than a week later, the Angels signed another Met, acquiring LHP Aaron Loup on a two-year $17 million contract. 
With many Mets fans worried by these crucial losses and the lack of action by the Mets front office, on Black Friday, owner Steve Cohen and new general manager Billy Eppler responded to these doubts in a big way. Through deals that totaled $124 million, the Mets signed OF Starling Marte to a four-year contract, as well as IF Eduardo Escobar and OF Mark Canha to two-year deals. While these signings were huge improvements, the Mets front office wasn’t done, as days later, they agreed to a three-year $130 million contract with former Cy Young winner Max Scherzer. 
  For fans like sophomore broadcasting major Brady Campbell, these deals marked an exciting time to be a Mets fan.
“I think they have done a good job so far. I am very happy about the Scherzer signing. He was one of the best pitchers in the league and him and DeGrom together, if they can stay healthy, would be the best 1 to 2 punch in baseball,” he said. “We added a lot of other good players as well, so overall it has been a very good free agency so far.”
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher agreed although he was more excited about another signing the Mets made this offseason. 
“Personally, the best signing was Eduardo Escobar. He is a former All-Star that was honestly a steal for the Mets because he is a switch hitter who can play multiple positions in the infield. In my opinion, he is basically a better version of Jonathan Villar, which makes him a big upgrade for the Mets.”
While the lifelong Mets fan was excited by these deals, he believes there is still more work that needs to be done.
“They need two lefties in their pitching staff because they lost one starter [in Stroman] and I do not want to see David Peterson pitching, so I would like to see them sign Yusei Kikuchi or someone like that,” Boettcher said. “They also need a lefty reliever too, so someone like Jake Diekman along with re-signing Jeurys Familia would be really good.”
With bullpen changes being a glaring issue on this current Mets roster, Campbell also cited the need for the Mets to “retool” their struggling bullpen. However, if these improvements get done, Brady is confident that the Mets can make a run this upcoming season.
“I think they have a good shot at the playoffs as long as they stay healthy. In years past we have had issues staying healthy, so as long as they are able to do so and get a good manager, I think they can for sure be one of the best teams this year,” Campbell said.
Despite these promising moves, Boettcher thinks that the Mets are still a few pieces away from true title contention. 
“The moves they have made so far have only filled the gaps that were missing from losing Villar, Stroman, and Syndergaard, so they need to add more,” he said. “They need at least another bat and more pitching to really consider themselves competitive in the World Series race.”
With the MLB currently on hold due to the lockout that began on Dec. 2, it remains to be seen whether the Mets can continue to make the necessary improvements to their roster. For now, Mets fans can celebrate their team’s recent signings. As stated by Forbes’ Bernie Pleskoff, the Mets are the “kings of the MLB offseason” so far.

The LIU Men’s Soccer team finished their regular season with a Northeast Conference (NEC) Championship ring. They then beat the University of Maryland Terrapins on Maryland’s own field in the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer Tournament, earning their way to the second round against the Saint Louis University Billikens, where they fell 5-1 on Nov. 21. 
On Sunday, Nov. 14, the Sharks won their first-ever NEC title after finishing what Junior Health Science major Nika Takagi called “a nail-biting experience.” 
“It was definitely one of the most stressful games that I have been to, and since this year, we are actually allowed to watch in person instead of on a screen. That just made the experience more intense,” Takagi said.
The first game that LIU played in the NEC tournament, the Sharks kept their fans on their toes when playing against Bryant University at home on Friday, Nov. 12. After the game’s second overtime, the game went into penalty kicks, where the Sharks took the victory 5-4, with the game-winning kick coming from sophomore forward Emil Jaaskelainen. 
Junior defender Aiden Wilson feels that having support from their fans in the stands was really important for the players on the field to keep the energy up while playing. 
“We are very thankful for everyone that was able to come and support us. Hearing the cheers in the stands really makes our experience better, as well,” he said.
With this being graduate student midfielder Julio Abad’s last season with the team, he is proud to be a part of this team and that they were able to accomplish their mission and what they had worked so hard for all season long.
“After losing to penalty kicks at the NEC’s in 2019 against Fairleigh Dickinson University and then losing at the NEC’s to penalty kicks against St. Francis Brooklyn last season, the start of this season, our only goal was to win this thing, and once we got the opportunity to play St. Francis again we really wanted to redeem ourselves, and we did just that by beating them in penalty kicks,” Abad said.
After winning what the Sharks had worked so hard to achieve, they were able to advance to the NCAA Tournament, where they played their first game against the University of Maryland in College Park, MD, on Nov. 18. The Sharks won 1-0 with an incredible shot by forward Assane Ben Fall with less than two minutes left in the second half. 
Junior business major Amanda Loo had the opportunity to take a bus provided by LIU to Maryland with a couple of other Shark soccer fans, and she explained that her experience was incredible. 
“Before we had scored, I thought for sure we were going to go into overtime. Once we had won, only a couple of Sharks’ fans were with us, but it was so great to celebrate the victory with fellow LIU students,” she said.

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers tested positive for COVID-19 before the game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Rodgers previously released that he was immunized. However, he has not received a COVID-19 vaccination shot. 
Rodgers claimed in an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show days before the game, defending his decision not to get vaccinated and criticized the league for how they treat unvaccinated players. During the interview, Rodgers claimed that a team doctor informed him it was impossible for a vaccinated person to get or spread COVID-19.
NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy later released an email stating that information was false and no member of the NFL infectious disease consultants spoke to Rodgers. If they did, they would not communicate that incorrect information to the player.
Prior to training camp, Rodgers had an alternate treatment, and he then petitioned the NFL for that treatment to allow him to be considered the same as someone who received one of the approved vaccinations. Rodgers said he couldn’t get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines because he’s allergic to an ingredient in them and that the Johnson & Johnson shot was “not even an option” for him in the spring after it was briefly shelved over blood clotting concerns. 
After consideration from the league, union and infectious disease consultants, it was determined Rodgers would not get the same consideration and would be considered unvaccinated. 
In the absence of Rodgers, the Packers lost to the Chiefs 13-7. Kansas City capitalized on having the star quarterback out of the game. 
Senior sports management major Ashlee Garrett felt this gave the Chiefs a huge advantage. 
“As a Chief’s fan, it was certainly nice not to face Rodgers. The defense really jumped on this factor and played aggressively. However, learning that Rodgers is, in fact, unvaccinated is shocking because someone so smart and understanding did not have the courage to announce he was not vaccinated,” Garrett said.
Rodgers has been an ambassador for State Farm for nearly ten years. After the revealing interview, State Farm released that they will stand by him through this. The company did not support some of his statements, but they do support his right to have his personal point of view. 
Senior business major Kyle Underwood believes it was in bad taste for Rodgers to mislead the public.
“As a sports fan, you always want to see the players, especially the household names, being honest and upfront, but we all know that is never the case. I find it interesting that it was unknown for such a long time, but I am glad it has been brought to proper attention, he said. “Rodgers will just have to face the consequences from fans or the NFL itself, but I think everyone can learn from this situation. I’m glad he will return healthy and get back to playing his great game.” 
After recovering, Rodgers was able to play in the Week 10 game against the Seattle Seahawks and won 17-0. He completed 23 of 37 passes for 292 yards. The Packers are now 10-3 and sit first in the NFC North.
