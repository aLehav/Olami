C.W. Post is offering a new certification for individuals with a Master of Social Work degree or a professional degree in a related field. The Forensic Certification, which was approved this fall by the New York State Education Department, is ideal for professional social workers interested in obtaining advanced education in the field of forensic social work. The program was created in conjunction with the already-existing forensic concentration in social work.
The program allows professional social workers to gain legal and psycho-sociological knowledge to practice within the criminal justice field. “This is a developing field, and we are at the vanguard of advancing the role of social work in criminal justice,” said Dr. Ilene Nathanson, who is the director of the program.
According to Nathanson, there is no program like it within the tri-state area.  She added, “Our curriculum is unique in its focus on the social work forensic professional as a clinician and agent of change.”
M.S.W. student Lisa Ganz, who felt the forensic concentration was incredibly enticing but chose her concentration in alcohol and substance abuse, said,  “I think the interest in forensic science and law enforcement is incredibly large and still growing in today’s society, especially as a result of television and media.” She added, “It’s also a field that is becoming more recognized and is in need of unique perspectives that social workers can offer.”
M.S.W. students can qualify for the certificate while completing work in their concentration. Students would need one more course to complete the certificate beyond the M.S.W., said Dr. Nathanson.
The certificate requires one additional course on top of four courses required for the concentration: four in social work and one in forensic science. Nathanson said, “The social work courses offer an overview of the criminal justice system.” She added that it also “prepares students for generalist as well as clinical functions, particularly in areas related to alcohol and substance abuse and domestic violence.”
According to Dr. Nathanson, the certification is part-time. “Students can take as many courses as they like but probably can do it in one academic year if they wish,” Dr. Nathanson added.
Ganz said students in all concentrations are required to complete the same amount of hours in order to obtain the M.S.W. degree. “The concentration courses are the only ones that vary and are, essentially, only different in content, not the amount of work required,” she added.
There are five concentrations available for students enrolled in the M.S.W. program are: Alcohol and Substance Abuse, Non-profit Management, Gerontology, Child and Family Welfare and Forensic Social Work. The Non-profit Management and Gerontology concentrations also offer certificate programs.
According to Nathanson, opportunities for students are as broad as in any other area of social work.  Graduates with the Forensic Certification may be employed in prisons or parole, probation, the juvenile justice system, rehab facilities or private practice. She added, “Opportunities exist in legal defense and prosecution. Social workers work with both victims as well as perpetrators.”

The Thanksgiving holiday leaves C.W. Post a ghost town.  Most facilities close, and almost all students leave to go home to celebrate with families and friends, to visit relatives, or to simply take advantage of the days off as time for a vacation.  For those students who do stay on campus, however, there are opportunities to celebrate the holiday and have fun.
“I really wish that domestic students would invite friends who are not able to go home for the break to celebrate Thanksgiving at their house,” said Volunteer Coordinator and Assistant Director of Religious Life Jeanette Murray.  She explained that mostly international students and athletes stay on campus over the break.
“I feel it’s great how people in the United States celebrate Thanksgiving,” said international graduate student Nisha Yadav.  She was invited to celebrate the holiday at a friend’s house last year. “Being from a different culture, I understood what this day means for them. It’s really good to spend a day with your family, relatives and thank each other, and God, for everything that we have been provided,” she said.
The student shuttle stops running from November 23rd  to November 26th. The Winnick Student Center  closes on Thanksgiving Day, the Library closes early at 5 p.m. on November 23rd. The Library will be closed on Thanksgiving Day and Friday November 25th.  However, as one of a few facilities to remain open over the break, the Chapel is available as a gathering place for students who stay on campus. But Yadav, who plans to spend Thanksgiving on campus this year.  does not mind if the campus remains quiet. “I don’t mind staying on campus on Thanksgiving because to me this is the best time to catch up with my pending work.No one is here; there’s no distraction,” said Yadav.
For hungry students, ISS (International Student Sevices), Residence Life, Student Life and Leadership Development, the Pratt Center, Dining Services, and the Office of Religious Life team up to provide a free Continental Breakfast in the Interfaith Centre on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24th.  From 6:30 a.m. until noon, food will be served.  Later, starting at 1 p.m., a free Thanksgiving dinner will be provided in the Long Island Room of The Winnick Student Center, followed by a boxed sandwich to be brought back to the campus dorm room for the evening.
“We are serving a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, including turkey, jams, potatoes, pie…yes, basically a lot of food,” said Murray. Traditionally, mostly international students come to the dinner, but everyone is welcome to join. All other dining services locations will be closed on Thanksgiving Day. To make a reservation for the Thanksgiving meal, students must call (516) 299-2416 by 5 p.m. on Thursday, November 18th.
On Wednesday, November 24th, Friday, November 26th, and Saturday, November 27th, the Hillwood Commons Cafe will be the only campus dining service location open, with hours between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. On Sunday, November 28th, The Winnick Student Center will operate by its regular schedule.
On Thanksgiving Day, for $10, students can jump on the bus outside the Chapel and go to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.  The bus leaves for the city at 6:45 in the morning. Spots are limited, so to secure a seat, sign up early, either online at www.tinyurl.com/thanksgivingfest, or by filling out a form at the Interfaith Chapel by Friday, November 18th.  Murray said that the bus trip has been a tradition for years and that the seats will fill up. Students can choose whether they want to stay in the city or take the bus back to campus at the end of the day.
As the Free Shuttle bus stops running during the break, students without cars can make use of the N20 bus from outside the library. The bus will run by a Sunday schedule during the break, which can be found at http://www.mta.info/libus/routes/n2021/n2021_new.pdf.

Garbage cans filled with dripping water aren’t an uncommon sight if you’re walking into a class on the second floor of Humanities Hall or if you’re just strolling by the TV studio.  The leak outside of the TV station in Humanities Hall has been a problem that’s been going on for years, according to both students and university staff.
“The leak has been going on since my sophomore year at Post, maybe even my freshman year, ” commented Matt Saur, a senior journalism major, who has classes in the TV station. “The past few years, they would have garbage cans with water in them. They would just sit there in the hallway.”
The university has acknowledged that the problem has been an ongoing issue for the past several years.  However, it asserts that it has made many efforts to fix the problem.
“There has been more than one problem,” said Bill Kirker, the director of facilities services. “The major problem was the roof.  This was taken care of when the roof was replaced last year.  In addition, we made repairs to an air conditioning unit on the roof, which stopped most of what was still leaking.”
Yet, through all the efforts, the leak remains outside the TV station.  Kirker said that the current leaks are an intermittent problem, but that they are having a difficult time pinpointing the current causes of the leak.
“It is being investigated,” Kirker said. “But, the condition that causes the leak is not always present.  This makes it very difficult to pin point.””
However, Joe Voce, a junior, who takes Television Prod in the TV station, feels that the university is not doing anything about the current leak.
“I see the two garbage pails outside the room collecting water from the ceiling everyday, and it looks like nothing is being done about it,” Voce said.

 On Wednesday, November 9th, C.W. Post hosted its tenth annual Turkey Trot. The event, which is hosted every November at the Pratt Recreation Center, features both a five kilometer run and a one mile walk and participants may choose which event they want to enter.
The entry fee for this year’s Trot was one non-perishable food item or a cash donation and all cash proceeds were donated to help homeless veterans while food donations were given to the Beacon House, a veterans’ shelter based in Bay Shore, New York that, according to its website, helps homeless veterans transition from homelessness to “living independently and productively in the community.” The Beacon House was established in 1994 and is responsible for feeding over one hundred people a week in addition to delivering food to homebound elderly patrons.
Fernando Mendoza, a member of the staff, won the 5k race, completing the 3.1-mile loop in just 19:16.62.  Elsa Klarin, a freshman member of the C.W. Post women’s soccer team, was the first female to cross the finish line, coming in at 21:12.26.
According to Martin Guillet, Fitness Director and Associate Director of Recreational Sports, and one of the primary organizers of the event, 220 people registered for the Trot and made a donation.  This year’s event attracted participants from a number of different organizations, departments, ages, and abilities. Pleased with the success of the Trot, Guillet noted: “We met with several groups this year trying to get the word out about the event. I was really happy that we were able to see many new faces as well runners and walkers who we have had participate all 10 years.”
At the end of the day, participants took home a tee-shirt with the event’s logo, the shape of Long Island shaded in the American flag pattern. “It was great to have us connect a cause with the event.  It was an honor to help our veterans in any way we can.  They have given everything for us and we needed to recognize we could do our part, although small in comparison,” said Guillet.

 Get your wallets ready!  Black Friday is just a week away and before you know it, the holidays will be here! Whether you plan on waiting on the never-ending lines on Black Friday at the crack of dawn, or waiting until the last minute to buy your gifts, it is always helpful to have an idea about what the popular items are this year.  Here are some of the new products that are sure to make a memorable gift for your loved ones.
Brand new on the market as of October is the Apple iPhone 4S.  This product can be a great gift for virtually anyone, except for very young children.  Some of the major differences between the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4 is that the 4S has faster internet speed, an 8 megapixel camera, and a dual-core A5 chip.  As college students, we may not be able to spend as much time with our friends or family at home as we would like.  FaceTime is an amazing feature on the iPhone 4 and 4S that allows you to video chat with someone else who also has an iPhone with that feature.  Depending on the amount of gigabytes, the iPhone 4s ranges from $199-$399.
Warning: This next item may result in the disappearance of your boyfriend.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was just released early this month and has already broken its selling record.  This very popular first-person shooter game can be played on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows, and Wii.  The game sells for $60, but you can also purchase a pre-owned game online.  The price for a pre-owned game will vary depending on where it is bought.  However, whether you are buying this for your brother or your boyfriend, keep in mind that it is likely that he may not stop playing the game for hours on end.
Another holiday must have for 2011 is the Kindle Fire.  This product, which was released in November, is a tablet computer version of Amazon’s e-book reader and runs on Wi-Fi.  Selling for $199, the Kindle Fire features a colored 7’’ multi-touch display and includes the Amazon Appstore to purchase e-books, as well as games, music, movies and TV shows.  While very similar to the Apple iPad, the Kindle Fire can be a great purchase for college students as many are converting to e-books instead of textbooks.  In addition, it can also be a great idea to give to parents and grandparents.  The tablet allows for larger print on a screen than a regular book would, making it easier for the elderly to read.  Not to mention, it is also eco-friendly because it is paperless.  With the winter season underway, this can be a great present for those who enjoy staying warm inside and reading a new book.
For those looking to find a special gift for a girlfriend, a Pandora charm bracelet continues to be a popular trend.  Pandora offers a wide variety of different charms to make the bracelet personalized and just recently released its Autumn/Winter collection.  The bracelets and charms vary in price and may put a dent in your wallet.  As an alternative, you could go to a local flea market and have a charm bracelet made there for half the price.  Choose charms that are meaningful to your significant other, and she will treasure the bracelet forever!
If you are looking to buy the gift of warmth this season, then the Forever Lazy is the perfect match.  For just $29.95 on their website, the item offers a button closure and belt and is available in pink, blue, and grey.   Similarly to how the Snuggie is simply a blanket with sleeves, the Forever Lazy is basically a one-piece jumpsuit with a hood.  The sizes range from XS-XL so can fit most people.   Regardless of one’s age or gender, comfort and warmth during the frigid winter season will always be appreciated.

We have all been there time and time again, the first date. To some it is the most important date there is. It’s the one that everyone makes the biggest deal about. “What am I going to wear? Where are we going to go? What are we going to talk about?” It is a time full of excitement, stress, and question, but is it still as important as it used to be?
The answer to that question depends on who you ask. If you ask a female, she will probably give you a most definite answer of, yes, the first date is still important. Sophomore adolescent education and English major, Laura Fitzgibbon, thinks just that. “First dates are important because first impressions are important no matter what. This is your first serious encounter with someone.” Junior photography major, Brittany Dembowski, also agrees. “It really is a big deal if you don’t know the person because that is like a first impression of how the relationship could go.” Well, this just turns the pressure up because now we guys have to try and really impress.
But not all guys feel the same way. Junior film major Christopher Suchy said, “I think the whole idea about the first date and the way it’s supposed to go has become very overrated these days. It used to be the romantic thing for a man to be the one to ask a girl out, have it all planned, and sweep her off her feet. It’s supposed to be a thing from the movies, but these days I feel it’s much more casual.” So to many guys this idea of a first date is a bit overrated now. But that doesn’t mean you can slack; you still have to show up and impress as much as possible. Traditionally this falls on the guy. Most of the time it is the guy who has to plan it out, figure out the perfect place for the first date, which is a lot of decision making, especially if you barely know the person.
So for all you guys out there, here a few date ideas that may take the burden off your shoulders just a bit. Keep it simple, there is no need to rent a limo and take her to a five-star restaurant on the first date. Dinner at a simple, more casual place will do fine, and it will keep your pocket a bit fuller. The typical movie and dinner sounds great but movies can be awkward. The first date is a time to see if you want to even attempt a second one, so go places where you can talk and interact more, perhaps mini golf. McDonalds is not dinner, drive through is not a good first date meal, so spring for the little extra and go somewhere fun. Chilis or Applebees are both good choices. Most importantly, relax and just be yourself. Conversation and a fun date will come naturally if you don’t think about it. No need to stress over it. Chill out and just have a good time and enjoy the company.

  It’s the holiday season; people are heading out to restaurants to avoid cooking as there are plenty of holidays coming up that require excessive amounts of cooking. It is, unfortunately, common to see people in restaurants who appear to have had no home training in manners or who have no concern for other people.  This article may help people refine their behavior when they are out, and avoid being labeled as “rude Americans”.
Whether one is out at a bar, restaurant or traveling, there are some things people shouldn’t do. Marisa Anziano, junior Public Relations major, said, “I hate when you are out to eat with someone and they are constantly on their phone. It makes me feel like they are not interested in what I have to say, or that I’m boring. Another pet peeve of mine is when people are rude to waiters and waitresses.  It is such a difficult job that is not helped by rude people making their lives even more difficult.”  I have to give Anziano some credit. Few people actually consider the feelings of those serving them.  Cell phones do come in handy, but some people are addicted to them and don’t know that they should put them away while having dinner, or any meal, with other people. It is just common courtesy to do so. Some people lack face-to-face communication skills, but eating with friends will give everyone the chance to really get to know each other, and practice their conversation skills at the same time!
A person’s eating habits can also condemn them.  Your parents raised you with table manners, hopefully.  Don’t make fools of them and yourselves.  Gina Osegueda, a Senior Criminal Justice major, discussed her many peeves while eating at restaurants: “People eating with their mouths open, and talking with food in their mouths really bother me. I hate when you’re eating at a table, and people reach over you.  I also dislike others yelling at the table, and talking on the phone, and constantly getting up from the table, and finally, grinding one’s fork and knife together.”
Samantha Vega, a junior English Education major, said “I can’t stand when people pack their food in their mouth, not eating with utensils, sitting on tables in a restaurant.  It’s gross for people to pick their nails, hair, or nose, with food on the table.”  Not eating with utensils is probably the least classy thing someone can do.  Sure there are plenty of finger foods, but dishes like pasta are not finger foods.
Hygiene is equally as important as table manners.  The holiday season is also cold and flu season; spreading germs is a big concern. Unfortunately, Lauren King, a senior Education major, has seen her fair share of this. “When people are at a bar they don’t wash their hands before they leave the bathroom.  I also can’t stand to watch people blow their noses into restaurants cloth napkins; it is completely disgusting.”  Washing one’s hands is probably the most important thing to do from November to March, along with bundling up and staying dry.
When going out and the destination is someone else’s home, please take your dirty shoes off at the door and politely ask where you may place them. Tracking your mess onto someone’s carpets and floor is not acceptable.  You wouldn’t want to clean it up if it were your home. The same goes for wet coats, hats and other apparel.
Some people may not think that going to class constitutes going out, but it does. You are in public, and you have left your place of residence.  Behaving appropriately in class also contributes to one’s reputation and is a mark of one’s character.  Not showing up to class and consistently relying on the notes or work of others labels a person as a slacker or lazy. Guys, when your belt has to be at its tightest to keep your pants hooked up below your butt, it is a problem and there is something wrong.
All in all, put your best foot forward when you step outside your home.  You reflect yourself and your family.  Think about the points mentioned in this article that are considered to be offensive and ill-mannered by your fellow students, and please don’t do them in public. Have some respect for the people around you, regardless of whether they are friends or strangers.

As the holiday season approaches, it is now officially time to start preparing for the impending bitter cold of winter on Long Island.  It is important for all of us to dress according to the weather reports to stay healthy and happy.  However, that does not mean that we have to
sacrifice style in favor of warmth.  I have devised several outfit and accessory options to keep you warm, yet fashionable at the same time this winter season.
 
Opting for a cute beanie or fur trapper hat from stores like Forever 21 and Target is the perfect way to beat the cold while still maintaining a more fashionable appearance.  After all, just about 40 percent of your body heat is released through your head, so you definitely want to
lock in the heat as much as possible. Traditional or infinity, scarves keep your neck warm, while adding a splash of color and a little flavor to an outfit.
 
Gloves are also a great idea to keep your hands warm in between classes.  However, many people have done away with wearing gloves because of touch-screen handheld devices.  In that case, many manufacturers have produced gloves that allow you to use your electronic equipment. For example, North Face’s E-tip gloves ($40) contain special fabric on the pointer finger and thumb so that you can use your iPhone while shielding your hands from the winter chill.
 
Another winter necessity is a warm coat or jacket. Wear one with natural, non-synthetic materials such as wool, down feathers, and more. These fabrics will keep you warm, despite the inclement weather conditions. Check out Old Navy and Gap for great wool pea-coat options that marry warmth and style at a reasonable cost.  North Face is another option for great quality jackets that will keep you warm in most temperatures.
 
To ensure the optimal level of warmth, make sure to layer clothing.  In this case, you may want to wear a cute tank top underneath your favorite long sleeve shirt.  Add a warm chunky knit sweater under your pea-coat and you are ready to go!  Layering clothes will help you keep warm while wearing your winter jacket.  Layers trap the heat that radiates from your body to make certain that you remain warm and comfortable.  Layering permits you to control your body temperature more precisely.  In addition, when you get too warm, you can always adapt by taking off a layer or two. “Layering is a big thing for the winter time. It is definitely hard to stay warm without looking like an Eskimo, but layering does help. You can pair a regular warm sweater with plain jeans, but dress it up with matching knee socks that show a little above knee-high boots,” said Junior Digital Art and Design major Erin Griffin.
 
Winter boots such as Uggs are able to protect your feet from brisk weather.  My favorite option is to wear soft, fuzzy socks and then my trusty pair of black boots to keep my feet nice and toasty, no matter what. “Winter accessories are my favorite,” said Junior Public Relations major Bianca Fusco.  “I keep warm by wearing cute scarves, gloves, and hats or headbands.  I also only wear boots in the winter because they keep you the warmest and they come in different styles so they can be worn with anything.”
As my mother always says, “I would rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.”  So overdress and wear extra layers to guarantee that you remain comfortable this upcoming season. As you can see, there is no need to fret when it comes to dressing during the colder months.  Apply these very simple tips to your attire this winter and you will see how easy and fun it is to stay warm and cute. Trust me, you will be happy you did.

  Believe it or not, you have made it more than halfway through the fall semester. That’s definitely something worth patting yourself on the back about; however, the stress is really just about to begin. As the end of the term approaches, we all struggle to catch up on any work we may have missed to make sure we actually understand what we have been taught and to prepare to prove that on our finals, which are only a short month away. During this stressful time, it is important to stay in control of our nerves. Here are some tips for helping the stress stop.
1. STAY AHEAD- The only good thing that may come out of stressing out over finals a month in advance is that it gives you time to really figure out exactly what you need to do in order to successfully achieve those As. You can decide which classes will really demand the majority of your time and patience when it comes to finals and focus on those. Even if you just give yourself an extra half an hour a week of studying, it will keep you ahead, and when December arrives, you won’t be swamped with playing catch up.
2.SEEK HELP NOW- No, I don’t mean mental help. Although, some of you may feel like you need that, too, at this point. What I mean is: if you are seriously struggling in a class, acknowledging that now will give you time to do something about it. Contact your professor, whether it is by email or seeing him or her after class, and let him or her know that no matter how many times he or she goes over chapter five in class, it’s just not sticking in your brain. Who knows? He or she might just explain it to you in a way that will allow you to finally get it. (Maybe, you’ll gain a few extra brownie points, too.)
3.STICK TO A ROUTINE- This may actually be the most helpful tip out of the six. We all try to make some kind of a routine during the beginning of the semester: “I swear, I’m going to go to the gym after class every single day and then study for an hour NO MATTER WHAT.” Then, life happens, and somehow, by now, that routine is usually right out the door. Well, here I am to tell you to make a new one. It is much easier to get stuff done when it becomes routine, and it usually allows for more productive usage of your precious time. So, instead of Facebook stalking for an hour, go over your notes and read a chapter or two.
4.DROP BAD HABITS- You have a biology test in the morning, but your best friend’s birthday is tonight, and you couldn’t possibly miss it without insulting her, right? I’m sure a number of these situations came up during the semester, and that’s perfectly understandable, but learning how to say “No” now might just help you get the grade you are hoping for. Learning to not give into peer pressure (at least not all the time) will help you stick to that routine, too.
5. STAY HEALTHY- Here it is; you knew this one was coming. The key to feeling better about yourself is to treat your body better. Trade in those sugary foods that make you crash for something that will result in real energy, like fruits and veggies. Caffeine might help keep you up at night, but it can also actually make you more stressed and anxious. Replacing coffee with water is a great way to nourish your body. If you’re feeling extra stressed, then take a ten minute walk or hit the gym, even if it’s just for half an hour. Working out relieves stress, and we all already knew that.
If you follow these simple tips as best as you can, I’m sure your school stress will slowly but surely diminish. Of course, incorporate your own tips, too. Whether it’s staying away from people who make you really stressed out or taking breaks in between study sessions, you know what is right for your body. Good luck!

I know this is the last thing you want to think about when you get on the road, but it’s something that may/will happen. Every accident I’ve ever been in, I’ve always cried, screamed, panicked, and realized I had no idea what I was doing. So what did I do? I called my parents of course. But now that I’m a lot older, I want to do this on my own without calling the parents saying, “help, I just got into a car accident, please don’t kill me.” I’m going to outline what you will need to do if you are ever in an accident, or cause one.
The first thing you should do after being hit, or hitting another car, is pull over in a safe spot.  If you are hurt in any way, call the police immediately and they will arrange to send medical help.  If you haven’t been injured, take a few seconds to calm down and prepare for what the damage may be. Get out of the car and inspect the damage to both cars.  Ask the other person if he or she is okay, as well as any passengers in his or her car.  Call the police. Even if it’s a minor accident, you want the police to fill out a legal accident report just in case the other person is intoxicated, without insurance, etc.
While you are waiting for the police, you and the driver of the other car should exchange insurance information, registration information, license information, name, number, model and year of the car, and plate number.  You should also call your insurance company to let them know of the accident so you can explain the accident while it is fresh in your memory.  When talking to the insurance company, never claim responsibility, or blame somebody else. This bit of information could result in a lawsuit you would most likely want to avoid. Just say you were in an accident, where your car was damaged, and if the passengers are safe.  Taking photographs of the accident might help just in case the person you hit/or who hit you, starts to blame you for the accident and throws around the idea of a lawsuit.
An accident may seem like a terrible ordeal at the time, but later on you’ll be able to look back and learn from your mistakes.  My mistake before my accident was that I wasn’t paying attention. Now I always pay attention to avoid both an accident and my insurance rate going up.  It stinks seeing your car damaged, when most of us work to keep our cars clean and maintained. Also living without a car for a week really stunk and I wasn’t going to get stuck with my mother’s minivan for a week.  I walked instead!  It’s important to know your facts and get every bit of information there is on the person you get into an accident with. Keeping calm helps. Don’t freak out, unless of course they give you a reason to freak out. Accidents happen, that’s why we have insurance.  So as always, I wish you all safe driving, and a Happy Thanksgiving.

How do you explain to the guy you’re seeing that your best friend is another guy? Or if you’re a guy and your best friend is a girl, whatever your situation may be.  I just can’t see that as something that is going to go over well.  Speaking from my own standpoint, I would definitely find it sketchy if my guy was spending just as much time or more with another girl.
Trust isn’t something you just acquire automatically; it’s something that is earned.  I’m not the type to trust easily at all. So, how am I to expect some guy to trust that there isn’t anything going on between my best friend and me when I would be freaking out too? Even though the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach because this guy is like my brother and that would just be wrong.
I don’t suppose I will find the answer anytime soon. Obviously, the two would need to be introduced and get to know each other a little bit. On one hand, my best friend is skeptical of this new guy because he’s always looking out for me and what’s in my best interest. On the other, this new guy is probably thinking, “Ok, who’s this guy always hanging out with her?”  It’s an awkward limbo to find yourself in.
Say the wrong thing to either of them and you’re going to be up the creek without a paddle.  Say nothing at all and you could find yourself losing one or both of them. Either way it is an increasingly sticky situation that must be handled delicately.
First, you need to be sure that this is the guy for you and that it’s even worth the trouble to explain this to him.  If you don’t see the dating going any farther than that, save yourself the trouble and keep quiet. However, if you see a relationship coming on, continue this conversation with caution. People can become quite touchy and territorial very quickly. The last thing you want is a competition of egos or a “my stick is bigger than yours” match.

            It’s twenty-five minutes into a class; everyone is writing down notes while the teacher is giving his lecture. Then, suddenly, you see that same student slowly open the door and quickly gets into his seat. The teacher gives him a small glare, and rest of the class is momentary distracted. Then everyone in the class thinks the same thing, “That guy has been late almost three times already.” However, for many students, this scenario happens every semester: a student who is always late to class.  Sean Grennan, a Criminal Justice professor, explained that he had “a student who was 25 to 30 minutes late every week”. He hasn’t had had any problems recently, but he has had his share of students who are perpetually late.  He says that “a student should at least tell a teacher why they are late at the end of class.”
I do agree with Professor Grennan because if you don’t at least explain to your teacher why you’re always late, he may just fail you because he perceives that you are not committed to the class.  So if you have a job or another class that ends at a time that makes it nearly impossible to be on time, talk to your professor and let him, or her, know. Your professor wants you to pass that class and move on in your education, but you have to show your commitment and diligence too.
However, for those of you who are bad at getting up for morning classes and perpetually end up ten minutes late, here are some tips to help:
Hopefully these tips will help those students who are always late.  It’s important to be prompt to class.  Being late is distracting to your professor and fellow students. After all, you’re paying for your classes; you might as well be on time.

As the semester continues to fly by, more and more students seem to be scrambling into the campus library in order to complete their homework.  Most students who attend college also have jobs and other responsibilities in their lives, and sometimes the workload can be overwhelming.  For some reason, the idea of piling up loads of papers and homework for students to do seems highly appealing to many professors.  There comes a point in every college student’s life when he or she thinks, “How much more work am I going to have to do?”
The high pressures of completing all school work, studying, showing up for a job, and of course having something of a social life, becomes very challenging.  Todd Smith, a sophomore majoring in History Education has a lot on his plate. “Working forty hours a week and taking five classes is difficult.  Most professors are understanding and helpful, but once in a while you get the elitist who wants to make you suffer.” It is definitely tough to juggle the demands of a harsh professor’s workload along with extracurricular activities.  C.W. Post likes to promote clubs, and it is a challenge to become involved in school activities, when most students have other things going on.
Casey Curran, a junior who is majoring in Political Science said, “Most of us are going to school and working at least one job while trying to get all of our papers and studying done.  That, in addition to all of the social pressures of college, accumulates a lot of stress in our lives.”
Time management plays an important role in the lives of college students.  It is important to set free time aside in order to finish schoolwork that needs to be done.  So why do professors give a lot of work?  Professors may have the intention of trying to build the qualities of responsibility and hard work in students. These are characteristics that companies look for when interviewing candidates for jobs.  The professors are preparing students for a professional life.  Professor Christopher Mauceri of the History Department who was once a college student at C.W. Post can relate.  “I know students work, and it is hard to find balance.  I went here so I do know what it is like.” There are professors that are very understanding towards students.  College should be the first priority in student’s lives and this is the time when students can learn how to manage their time to be better equipped for the future.
Of course not all students feel that the professors give out an unreasonable amount of work.  Matt Price, a Physical Education major in his junior year knows how to balance his time. “I enjoy my classes a lot.  The professors are very fair and give out a sensible amount of school work.”  Noelle Darby, also a junior, majoring in Childhood Education also feels the workload from professors isn’t too bad.  “I feel in the beginning of the semester, I didn’t get assigned that much work. Once midterms came, I had a lot of papers and studying to do.  Everything started to be due at the same time.”  In the end, while professors try to figure out how much work they should assign to their students, it is definitely important for them to keep in mind the other responsibilities students have outside the classroom.  Students need to cope with an easy class without any work, or a difficult class that requires a lot of extra work.  Even though at the time, doing tons of work for one class may seem a bit unfair, the truth is that one day it may be beneficial.

 “Kim’s Fairytale Wedding” just barely debuted on E! and the couple is already ending their marriage. Many of us haven’t even had the chance to see the two-part episode yet and now the network is scrambling to get it off the air. As most of us have heard throughout the past week, reality star Kim Kardashian, 31, filed for divorce from her husband, Kris Humphries, on October 31, after a short-lived 72 days of marriage. Although this isn’t really “news worthy” perhaps there is a need to address the situation; whether you love or hate the Kardashians, you definitely know of them. With people on social media websites such as Twitter attacking the 31 year-old’s decision to end her marriage, many questions have been raised. Was this simply a business decision? How can gay marriage be illegal in many states when many straight couples are ruining the sanctity of the act all on their own?
Kim Kardashian is a self-proclaimed businesswoman. In the words of her own mother she is not just a name, she is a brand: Kim Kardashian Inc. With that being said, is it a coincidence that reports show that Kim profited $18 million from the wedding? After the announcement of Kim filing for divorce, the family put out statements denying any profits were made from the wedding. Kris Jenner, Kim’s mother, spoke about the divorce during an interview on “The View” on November 2.  When asked, “Did they net, or gross any amount of money?” she replied, “Absolutely not.” However, this wasn’t the case when the reports first came out right after the marriage took place. Vendors donated their locations in return for publicity, lavish gifts were received, incredible amounts of money were paid for magazine interviews and photo opportunities, and every time the wedding special aired on E!, Kim and her soon-to-be ex-husband received a payment. In her personal blog the star stated, “I’m so grateful to everyone who took the time to come to my wedding, and I’ll be donating the money for all the gifts to the Dream Foundation.” According to TMZ, a celebrity gossip website, Kardashian will donate $200,000 to the foundation.
Celebrity blogger, Perez Hilton, let the world know his thoughts on the divorce via his Twitter page when he wrote, “Straight people do a damn well good job themselves of ruining the sanctity of marriage! “MarriageForAll.” This was not the only angry tweet on the social-networking site following the news of the divorce, other celebrities and just common people shared similar thoughts. Kardashian made such a spectacle of her “fairytale” wedding despite the warnings of her family members, and jumped into something she wasn’t 100% sure about, when there are couples out there that have been together for years and may never have the chance to legally tie the knot.
Despite all the media attention, one question that remains is, will this hurt Kardashian’s public reputation? Some sources say it might even help. According to www.dailymail.com, during some of her first interviews after the shocking (or not-so shocking) news, Kardashian told an Australian radio host, “I don’t think I’m ready to go into the details of what went on in my marriage.” Some may say that this was a way to get viewers to tune in to her publicly-commercialized new series “Kim and Kourtney Take New York.”

As the race towards the 2012 Presidential election continues, the Republican Party is getting closer to choosing its candidate.  Last Thursday, a debate was held, where the Republican candidates tried to prove to the world why they deserve the spot as the Republican contender against President Obama. However, for some, things did not go as planned. Governor of Texas and Republican nominee hopeful, Rick Perry, had a major blunder on stage when he actually forgot the name of one of the government agencies he would want to cut if he became President. As quoted from ABC News “It’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone – Commerce, Education and the, um, what’s the third one there? Let’s see. Oh, five – Commerce, Education and the um, um.” Not a very good sign for the Governor Perry at all, especially when his competitor, Mitt Romney, stepped in and said Perry was thinking of the Environmental Protection Agency. Perry, of course, agreed, and when asked if he was sure about that answer, he quickly retracted it only to say, “The third agency of government I would do away with – the education, the uh, the commerce, and let’s see. I can’t the third one. I can’t. Sorry. Oops.” Turns out that after the debate, Perry remembered the agency to be the Department of Energy as the third one he would want to cut.
Ok, he messed up. But, he is not the only one to have done it. In fact, many politicians have slipped up over the years. For example, let’s jump back in time to the last presidential election, shall we? Everyone knows who Sarah Palin is by now, right? But, how many people remember her little bit on Russia? During the presidential campaign in 2008, she actually claimed that she could see Russia from the backyard of her Alaska home. Now, ok, sure, the two landmasses are close to each other, but not quite that close. Instead of retracting the statement, Palin stuck with it and defended herself and the statement until the very end.
Anyone remember who invented the Internet? Well, during the 1999 Democratic primaries, Al Gore claimed that he was the creator. The Internet was created by contributions made by several different people, but Al Gore wasn’t one of them. In all fairness, he did bring something to the table. While he was a Congressman many years earlier, he was part of an initiative that pushed for more commercialized Internet, but he did not create the Internet. This did not necessarily lose the 2000 presidential election for Al Gore. He did lose to George W. Bush, who was not without blunder himself.
Well, I’m sure we all remember the obvious one. Former President Bush could never seem to master the world ‘nuclear’. But, Bush made several mistakes in wording over his eight years in the Oval Office. In fact, he made enough of them for people to start calling them “Bushisms,” and Slate Magazine even created a full list of mis-wordings President Bush made while he was in office. Then, there was his reason for the invasion of Iraq: weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Bush claimed, and stuck to it for a lot of the war, that his administration could prove the existence of WMDS in Iraq. Well, we got to Iraq, of course, and as the war went on, not a single WMD was found the entire time. Not only did his entire administration mess up a huge accusation, but Bush also made it worse by joking about it. The BBC covered a slide show Bush did in 2004 when he used political cartoons to make fun of his mistake… not really funny when you were wrong about something that cost people their lives.
Then, there is Dan Quayle, the Vice President of George H.W. Bush, who once said, “I love California; I practically grew up in Phoenix.” This is just completely wrong since Phoenix is in Arizona and not California. Of course, these are just a few over our lifetime; we can go back farther to the Watergate lies or to just about any point in history and find a president who said something wrong or funny as a big ‘oops’ moment.
So, to Governor Rick Perry: Trust in the fact that you are not alone in your mistake. Just don’t do it again.

My boyfriend of three years is going away to boot camp for the Marine Reserves in February.  I was wondering if you had any advice on dealing with him being away for three months, ways to pass the time, and where I can find advice/support groups from other Marine girlfriends? -R.D.
First of all, I’d like to thank your boyfriend for the sacrifice that he is choosing to make for his country, and you for sticking by his side.  That being said, this will definitely be a trying time for your relationship, though I’m sure that’s no news to you. As you’re trying to cope with your significant other being gone for an extended period, there are ways to productively use the free time you’d usually spend with your sweetheart.
For starters, I suggest writing letters to him.  About two weeks after he arrives in boot camp, a letter should be sent back home letting you know where you can address correspondence to him.  Sending him personalized letters, letting him know that you’re thinking of him might be a great way to help him pass the time a lot more quickly.  Most importantly, having a support network of friends and family that care about you, and stand behind you, will be crucial to getting through the three months in one piece.
As for support groups, there are plenty out there on the web, so you can do a simple Google search to find one that fits what you’re looking for.  There’s a popular site, USMCGals.com that might be a good place to start.
 
There’s a co-worker of mine, who I’m also friends with, who keeps asking me out.  I don’t want to hurt his feelings because he stinks with taking rejection, but I don’t like him.  How should I let him down? -C.K.
These situations can always be difficult.  Mixing business with pleasure is hard to navigate, especially when you don’t reciprocate the feelings.  However, there is a simple way that allows you to let your friend down gently without really damaging his ego.  Just explain to him that you, in fact, do not do what he is expecting of you: date where you work.
It may seem cliche that this is the advice that I’d give, but it’s true.  Letting him know that you don’t date within your workplace is an easy way to spare his feelings.  Explain that being friends and co-workers would make it awkward to date, by blurring the boundary lines that should exist within the workplace.  Putting things in this light will allow you to present a more logical argument against your dating, rather than making it seem like a personal attack.

Nicholas Sparks – The Lucky One
Over the years, Nicholas Sparks has become a very popular author and not only because many of his books have been made into movies, such as A Walk To Remember, The Notebook, The Last Song and Dear John.  In all of his novels, he gives his readers almost a sweet escape, and we watch these beautiful love stories unfold.   We fall in love along with the characters, and get wrapped up in how the boy is instantly infatuated with the girl, yet she resists because she’s just not interested or never expected anything but a friendship, but then they end up falling in love somehow.
One of the best things about Sparks as an author is that, while his books may have happy endings, they are in no way fairy tales. There is always a struggle, and sometimes, there are even tragedies. This makes his novels more realistic to his readers.
I am a big fan of all of his novels, and I love watching them come to life in the movies.  The Lucky One is by far one of his best novels; it is addicting.  I finished it in two days.  This story is about a U.S. Marine who finds a picture of a girl; he has no idea who she is.  Yet, he still carries the picture with him everywhere.  Surprisingly, this picture brings him a lot of luck, and he overcomes several obstacles that others were struggling with. He searches for years until he finds the girl in the picture.  I can’t give away the ending, but trust me; this book is totally worth reading.  I was so intrigued with this love story, mostly because it is very different.
This book is actually being made into a movie, with Zac Efron as the lead, which Is due out this spring, and nothing is better than watching the book that plays out in your head made into a movie.  I highly recommend this book; it was not hard to finish at all and can definitely fit into your hectic schedules.

Can you think of an activity that allows you to lie down and do absolutely nothing for an hour except to relax?  I can. Getting a 60- minute massage is one of the most successful stress relievers out there.
At Massage Envy, a chain of spas that has tons of locations close to campus, the staff goes above and beyond in order to give you the best massage that is right for you.  With locations in Farmingdale, Merrick, Commack, Massapequa, Port Washington, and Plainview, among others, it is almost impossible not to find one that is convenient for you.  When you make an appointment at Massage Envy, they will ask you to arrive 15 minutes prior to the appointment so they can customize your massage.  This means that they will ask you to fill out questions about why you are getting a massage or if there are any specific painful areas on your body.  Most people get massages in order to relieve stress, relax, manage pain, loosen muscles, or even to improve flexibility; so, it is important that you tell your masseuse exactly what you would like to get done.  There are many different types of massages to choose from, ranging from deep tissue massages, which target knots and muscle tension, to Swedish Massages, which are the most popular.
When I got my massage at Massage Envy in Farmingdale, I was very satisfied.  The massage room was set up perfectly in order to relax. The lights were dimmed and calming music was playing lightly in the background. The best part was that the massage bed was heated!  My masseuse was extremely polite, and I felt calm and relaxed after it was over.

The regular price for a massage is $99.00, or you can become a member and pay a monthly rate of $59.00.  With this membership plan, you can receive a massage once a month.  The prices remain the same within each outlet.

Drake’s sophomore album entitled, “Take Care,” leaked to the Internet, and I had to have a listen. I’ve been following Drake since, “So Far Gone.” I don’t really consider myself a fan of his because he’s inconsistent with making tracks that I like. Also, his first album really didn’t impact me like I thought it would.
Leading up to “Take Care,” there were a couple of songs floating around the web and radio, some official and some leaked. From listening to those, I had low expectations for his sophomore album.
Then, he released his first single, “Headlines,” and I was actually feeling this single. I decided I would listen to his album and give it a fair shot. (Plus, everybody’s going to be talking about it, and I didn’t want to be out of the loop!) The album starts out a little slow but then picks up once you get to “Headlines”. The title track features the lovely singer Rihanna. It’s interesting. Drake’s flow takes a different turn and catches you off guard, but in a good way.
The track everybody seemed to love, “Marvin’s Room,” has been combined with another track called “Buried Alive.” I hate when artists make long tracks when they should just separate them into two different tracks, but upcoming artist Kendrick Lamar drops a dope verse on the second half of the track, so I can’t really complain.
“Make Me Proud,” featuring Young Money’s First Lady Nikki Minaj, is dope. The beat is unique, and I like the topic of women’s empowerment. “Lord Knows,” featuring Rick Ross and produced by Just Blaze, is epic! The beat just sings to you.  Drake does an okay job on it, and Rick Ross delivers a typical Ross verse, and it’s mediocre at best.
At first glance of the track list, I was excited to see that Mr. Drizzy collaborated with the legendary Stevie Wonder. I was disappointed after listening and learning Stevie had no actual vocals on the track, but, with that being said, the track is still pretty decent.
Just like on Lil Wayne’s album, we get a surprise visit from “Andre 3 Stacks,” also known as Andre 3000 on “The Real Her.” His verse is one of the better feature verses on the album and is the highlight of this track. I’m not a big fan of Drake doing the singing thing, but he does a singing-remake of Juvenile’s “Back Dat A** Up,” and I must admit, its pretty dope.
With that being said, I like about 10 tracks on the album, and I say its okay. It’s not really better or worse than his first one. I give “Take Care” a 7 out of 10. If you’re a Drake fan, support him by buying his album out now.

A very Harold and Kumar Christmas takes place in a surreal universe where anything is possible. You never know what happens next: Simply because it´s all just a little bit too crazy to imagine.
If you´ve seen the previous Harold and Kumar films, you are familiar with the two characters. This story takes place six years after their last adventure: Harold and Kumar have lost track of their friendship, living two separate lives. When Harold receives a mysterious package on his doorstep addressed to Kumar, their paths cross again, and an unintended journey to rekindle the friendship begins. But not without complications. In an evening filled with bad luck, pot smoking, and unexpected occasions, the only thing you´re sure of is that it will all work out in the end.
Screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg presents the third movie in the Harold and Kumar-series, packed with a variety of characters, including family-members, more-or-less good friends, heavy criminals, and attractive women; even Santa Clause makes his appearance. It is after all a Christmas movie.
Kal Penn and John Cho in the roles of Harold and Kumar works well together on the screen. With two contracted lives, the buddies are forced back together, with a message that some friendship are meant to last forever. Those who find drug related humor offensive, should steer away from this movie, because a lot of the storyline includes weed, and the use of other substances. In fact, the film represents a number of scenes and plots that could easily be perceived in an offensive way. The thing is, the writers makes fun of anything, and the storyline is so unrealistic, that whatever happens are just pure, crazy, imagination, that makes it hard to take it serious.
A very Harold and Kumar Christmas ends up being a weirdly heartwarming affair, that makes a viewer that is not easily offended laugh out loud, showing a mixture of occasions, characters, and events that together tells a highly unexpected story about two friends, and their journey back together. If you´re one not to get easily offended, and you´re looking for some easy entertainment to make you laugh, you should definitely see this one. The 90 minutes goes by so fast that you never have the time to get bored. With one crazy scene, taking another, you´ll find yourself amused by the most hilarious situations, with one thought pending in your head: “What really just happened there?” And then you´ll laugh some more.

“Last Man Standing”
ABC
By Paul Kalis

Tim Allen, the star of ABC’s Home Improvement, returns to the network as Mike Baxter, the director of marketing at the Outdoor Man, a sporting goods store, in Last Man Standing, airing on Tuesday nights at 8:00 p.m.  His boss, Ed (Hector Elizondo), reassigned him to supervise the company’s website and to run the Outdoor Man video log, where Mike wonders “what happened to men?”  When Mike’s wife, Vanessa (Nancy Travis), is promoted at work, he spends more time in his female-dominated household. Their three daughters, who are have relied on their mother for many years, have difficulties adjusting to and spending more time with their father.
Mike gets himself into some pretty sticky situations.  His comments cause his grandson to be expelled from daycare; he comes home with the wrong child on Halloween, and he has to stop his daughter from entering nude photos in a modeling contest.
This show is definitely a great family comedy.  The situations are amusing, and, before you know it, the episode will have come and gone.  However, at no point did I laugh out loud. Last Man Standing is definitely worth checking out; it has been picked up for a full season.

Anonymous:  Title?
With its many twists and turns through the sex life of queens and nobles and the uncivilized escapades of nitwitted peasants, Anonymous brings the age-old argument of who is the true writer of Shakespeare’s plays to a confusing and paradoxical hypothesis.  This is a film that is not for the weak at heart; i.e. the avid disciples of the image of Shakespeare. It was created, instead, for those who appreciate Hollywood’s license to reconstruct history for its entertainment. For us, it is a movie to see!
The film begins with the first meeting of Ifans’ Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, as a youth. He is an orphan, though still a noble, and is sent to live with a bishop who seeks to correct his blasphemous habit of writing poetry. In addition to being a sinful lover of art and beauty, he is also a man who takes a liking to sleeping with the future queen. One may get confused during the beginning, as the story line switches back and forth between the aging queen and the young queen, but towards the end, the plot comes in order.
Edward, in his old age, after being restrained from his two true loves for many decades, takes up writing the timeless works of genius that would be disguised as the craft of an illiterate actor named William Shakespeare. He decides to publish his work through these means in order to spread his political agenda without risking his status as a noble by directly criticizing of royal scandals and weaknesses.  Scenes of Hamlet and Richard III are performed from the perspective of one who is observing the audience and display the riotous reactions of the audience to these themes of royal conspiracy. Heirs surface out of the blue; rebellions are passed from the stage unto the audience, which then pour out into the streets; French fencers die in labyrinths; the story is a “royal mess” (which is not to be taken negatively).
My criticism lays more with the bulk of film critics themselves rather than the farfetched formations in the movie. The majority of the reviews of Anonymous throughout the “high-brow” world of newsprint take on bitter resentment towards the writers who commit a crime against historical accuracy. Yet, if we want to view a film that strictly follows history, then should we not turn on a PBS documentary? My true critique is of those individuals who are so purist in their belief that films based on historical periods of time must be 100% accurate.  Why do we need to remain fanatics over the individual writer? Does our love of the plays get lost if the true writer becomes obscure? I always thought this controversy shrouded Shakespeare’s works in an air of mystery, but, then again, I like to question the truths fed to me since childhood. Overall, I stand true to my conviction that it is the job of films, as works of art, to cause us to fantasize about whether or not our “concrete” conceptions of history are the absolute truth. I pay money only to have my world turned upside down, not to be bombarded with the same old pretentious and bygone remittances.

Two summers ago, the New York Jets starred on the HBO series Hard Knocks, which showed the summer camp held by the potential Superbowl champions for the upcoming season. Now, halfway through the third season following the show, they have come up short two seasons in a row and are now behind the New England Patriots for the lead in AFC East, having lost Sunday, November 13th’s, game 37-16 to the Pats. The Jets struggled on both sides of the ball, with Sanchez throwing two interceptions, one that was returned for a touchdown, and the defense letting up 30 of the points scored by New England. After a loss like that, coach Rex Ryan must have something to say to back his team up before they face the Broncos, who are 3 and 1 under Tim Tebow, in Thursday, Novemeber 17th’s, showdown.
And, what about the “Dream Team?” With a current record of three wins and 6 losses, the Philadelphia Eagles reached the “must win every game” point of their season three weeks ago and have now blown their lead in the fourth quarter five times this season. On Sunday, November 13th, the Eagles fell to the Arizona Cardinals when John Skelton threw for a five-yard touchdown pass with less than two minutes remaining. Now, if the “Dream Team” has any hope of making the playoffs, it must win every one of their remaining games. The Eagles will face the New York Giants this Sunday, November 20th, and the New England Patriots the following Sunday, November 27th, so don’t get your postseason hopes up too high if you’re a Philly fan.

After one win and one loss during last weekend’s National NCAA Tournament, the season is over for the C.W. Post men’s soccer team.
Receiving the third seed in the NCAA East Region, the Pioneers traveled to Boston for their next challenge. The Pioneers were looking for revenge against Nyack College after suffering their only loss in the regular season to them. The Pioneers started fast offensively, jumping out to a 1-0 lead after freshman forward Eivind Austboe put the ball securely into the net with a header, following a corner-kick by sophomore captain Eirik Bjornoe. However, Nyack evened out the score early in the second half. Shortly after, Pioneers sophomore forward Cemil Turan put the Pioneers back into the lead. Soon after, graduate forward William Lindberg secured the 3-1 win with another header.
The win against Nyack College advanced C.W. Post into the second round of the tournament. On Sunday, November 13th, the third-seeded Pioneers squared off against second-seeded Southern New Hampshire University.
Despite an incredible effort by the Pioneers, SNH shut out the Pioneers with a 2-0 win, sending the Pioneers home from the tournament.  C.W. Post came up short, as the Penmen scored one goal in the first half to take the lead and one goal during the final seconds of the game for insurance. A key statistic as to why the Pioneers failed to beat 18-3-0 Southern New Hampshire was the difference in shots on goal. The Penmen had a five shot advantage, attempting 18 shots on goal compared to 13 tries for the Pioneers.
Rounding up the season with a 17-3-1 record, C.W. Post men’s soccer can congratulate itself with the best program record in school history.

 To begin the 2011-2012 regular season, the C.W. Post men’s basketball team came out with a victory, defeating the Saint Anselm College Hawks by a score of 104-99. In the Pioneers’ following game the very next day, they showed no problems with the lack of rest, beating the College of Saint Rose in convincing style, 97-83. These first two games played were hosted in Albany for the Saint Rose Tip-Off Tournament.
In the first game of the year, junior guard Tobin Carberry led the Pioneers in scoring with 22 points on an efficient 8-12 shooting from the field. Carberry wasn’t the only scorer for the Pioneers, as sophomore forward Vaughn Allen scored 21 points, and pre-season All-American senior guard Stefan Bonneau scored 20 points to go along with five rebounds and six assists.
In the game, depth off the bench was shown as sophomore forward Amir Tarif finished with a double-double, scoring 13 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. In addition, graduate guard Vince Rosario contributed with 10 points off the bench in 26 minutes of action. An exciting performance was displayed by freshman forward Charles McCann as he scored eight points, secured seven rebounds, and swatted five blocks to provide some toughness inside for the Pioneers.
With 3:20 left in the fourth quarter, the Pioneers seemingly had the game in hand as they led 100-86 at the time. However, the Hawks would go on a 13-1 run and close the gap to within two points with 20 seconds left. The Pioneers ended up shutting the door and winning their first game of the season in a high-scoring affair.
In the Pioneers’ subsequent game the very next day, they took on the hosts of the Saint Rose Tip-Off Tournament: the College of Saint Rose. The Pioneers would end up winning by a final score of 97-83, led by an outstanding game by Carberry. He notched a career-high 37 points on 14-23 shooting from the floor and grabbed a team-high nine rebounds. Bonneau dropped 22 points to space out the floor well for the Pioneers in the win.
The Pioneers will look to continue their fast start to the season in their next game on the road against Chestnut Hill College (3-1) on Wednesday, November 16th, at 7 p.m.
