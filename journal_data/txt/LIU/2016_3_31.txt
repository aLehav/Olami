On March 17, the university issued a campus-wide email stating that a female had been found near campus in a suicide attempt. The news impacted our campus greatly. While I was extremely glad to hear that she was okay, I couldn’t help but wonder about how much awareness of mental illnesses there is among college students.
According to NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a mental health organization, approximately 43.8 million adults in the U.S. experience mental illness in a given year. However, in the past year, only 41 percent of adults with a mental health condition actually received mental health services. The remaining 59 percent do not seek help for multiple reasons, like expensive mental health care or because of the negative stigma that is attached to mental health. NAMI also states that adults in the U.S. who live with a serious mental illness, but do not obtain treatment, tend to die on average 25 years earlier than those who do, or those not affected. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S.
Yet, mental illness is usually not talked about as much as physical illnesses. Why is that? The statistics show that mental illnesses affect many people and can be as deadly as other serious physical illnesses. However, there still is a stigma surrounding mental health. Unfortunately, mental illnesses are commonly associated with stereotypes and are judged by individuals who don’t actually understand the concept of mental health. In other words, they are not properly educated on what mental illness is and how they should be treated. According to a scholarly paper by Patrick Corrigan and Amy Wats, for the Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association, some of these stereotypes are prompted by what people see in the media. Many believe that if someone suffers from a mental illness such as depression, personality disorders or anxiety then he or she must be homicidal, crazy and feared. Another big misconception is that the person is responsible for their illness.
This stigma not only affects the way mental illness is perceived but sometimes it can affect the individual who struggles with mental health. According to the World Psychiatric Association, many people with psychiatric disabilities tend to internalize these misconceptions and start to believe them themselves. This brings on serious self-esteem issues, allowing the person to believe they are less valued because of their disorder or what they are feeling is not a valid illness. This can be one of the reasons that some people with mental illness don’t seek necessary treatments.
It’s especially important to create more awareness on a college campus. According to a 2014 study by the National College Health Assessment, data collected from 76,266 students’ health habits, 33 percent of the students surveyed said within the past 12 months, they have felt so depressed to the point that it was difficult to function. In the same study, 55 percent of the students reported feeling overwhelming anxiety and 87 percent reported feeling overwhelmed by all of their responsibilities.
Taking these numbers into consideration, it’s clear how much mental health can affect students while in college. I do not think it’s talked about enough and I still believe there is a negative stigma connected to it. In fact, according to NAMI, 40 percent of students with diagnosable mental health conditions do not seek help. NAMI reported that concerns about stigma are the number one reason for students not seeking help.
There should be more education on mental illness and how it should be approached. Mental health needs to be taken more seriously and be spoken about openly without attaching a negative perception to it. Just like other illnesses, when somebody is struggling with a psychiatric disability, they don’t have control over how it affects them. They don’t have the option to make it stop simply because “it’s all in their head.” Education and bringing light to these issues is key to end the negative stigma that follows mental illnesses.
On campus, the counseling center offers students the opportunity to talk to a counselor confidently. The Center of Healthy Living, also known as the counseling center, treats alternative lifestyles, drug and alcohol counseling, eating disorders, individual and group counseling, physical and psychological abuse counseling, problems with anxiety, confusion, or depression, crisis intervention, and rape support service.
The Center of Healthy Living is located in the basement of Pell Hall. Counselors are available Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The office can be contacted by emailing lynne.schwartz@liu.edu or calling 516-299-4162.

To most college students, their phone is their life. Not only because it houses their favorite social media, games, emails and notes, but also their photographs. Your photos will always mean something and you will have that moment forever. Here are this week’s LIU Post students’ favorite photo on their phones:

“I like this pic because it shows my personality.
Always happy and smiling through life.”
Stephanie Mocerino, junior broadcasting major

“I laugh a lot and smile just as much. 
This picture captures a little bit of both of those. 
No matter how you’re feeling, 
what age you are or who your friends are…
one thing remains the same. 
Laughter is contagious and a smile is the sunshine on a cloudy day.”
Savanah Cummings, junior health science major

“This is my favorite picture in my entire photo album. 
It’s not recent but I always keep it in there because it makes me relive that goal 
and reminds me of the exact feeling I had at that moment. 
Out of all of the goals I’ve scored, in both high school and in college, 
during my field hockey career, this one was by far the absolute best. 
On October 6, 2011 (I know that date because it’s written on that ball in the 
goal in the picture sitting on my shelf in my room) 
I was a sophomore in high school and we were playing our rival school, 
Bernards, who we hadn’t beaten in years. 
I scored the winning goal in that game alongside my teammates. 
The final score was 1-0 and it was one of the most intense and roughest games I’ve ever played. 
And that’s why that’s my favorite picture in my entire photo album.”
Kaycee Zelkovsky, sophomore psychology major

“This is from Pratt After Dark and it’s our favorite picture
 because it’s a great memory from a great night with great friends.”
Kari Kyrkjeboe and Aida Enamorado, international studies majors

The eight weeks between spring break and the end of the semester can make or break final grades. With the weather getting warmer, flowers blooming and birds singing, it becomes increasingly difficult for students to focus on school work. The spring semester always seems to be the one where students struggle the most with finishing strong, especially when senioritis is kicking in.
So, how do you stay on track with school when all you are thinking about is summer, or applying for jobs or internships? Melissa Walk, a junior psychology major, said, “I believe if you can push yourself to accomplish what needs to be done, such as studying hard and getting all your assignments done on time, you’ll be able to end the semester with a bang.” Walk added that students should think about their family and support system of friends “…that all want you to achieve your goal to finish, so push yourself to do that.”
Shannon Nami, a senior elementary education major, said, “Before finals week, I create a review sheet so I am prepared for all my exams. I try and stay organized throughout the semester so it’s easier for me since I am graduating and have a lot on my mind.”
Tori Gottlieb, a junior public relations major, feels a little unsteady about the end of the semester. “I feel unprepared. I have an 18-page paper due and I am freaking out,” she said. She will be spending a lot of time at the library on campus, along with many other students. Starting April 27 through May 5, the main level of the library will be opened 24 hours, along with librarian help until 1 a.m. and Bleecker Street Café open till 2 a.m. You can also stop by the writing center, located in Humanities room 202. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Tuesday 9 a.m. through 9 p.m., and Friday 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. Walk-ins are welcomed.
It’s easy to lose sight of the academic goals you set for yourself throughout the spring semester, but it’s not too late to get back on track. Form a study group with friends so you don’t feel alone. Ask your teachers for help; they want to see you achieve your goals. Make sure you don’t skip class; it’s tempting with the nice weather, but you’ll feel better and more prepared if you attend. Most importantly, just try and relax. You’re almost done, so just take a breath and crack open that book and you’ll see how much your hard work will pay off when your semester grades are posted.

“Who’s Who Among Students” is a national student recognition program among colleges in the U.S. Every year, since 1934, who’s who selects students from over 1,000 colleges and universities to join the program.
In order to be selected into the program, students must have a GPA of a 3.0, have completed a minimum of 15 credits, have good leadership ability and be involved in the community.
The office of Campus Life and LIU Promise nominated students to become a part of Who’s Who Among Students for the first time this past December.
“Members of Campus Life and LIU Promise nominated students who have made a significant impact on the LIU Post community,” said Joseph Vernance, assistant director of Campus Life. “The goal of the acknowledgement is to recognize students for being outstanding leaders in their student organizations, athletic teams, residence halls, and all other areas of the university.”
“It’s such an honor to be chosen, especially as a freshman,” said Olivia Kavanaugh, a freshman art education major. “I’m extremely appreciative and humbled to be chosen alongside a group of great students at this great school.”
Amy Smith, program administrator for Who’s Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges, said, “Unlike other honor societies there are no membership fees to the Who’s Who nominee.”
Henry Pettus Randall, Jr., founder of Who’s Who Among Students, decided to create the program in 1934 due to the financial struggles he faced in college. Randall believed that honors programs should be based on students’ achievements, not their financial standing and ability.

As the summer is growing nearer, graduate students in the art department are scrambling around in the Steinberg Museum to prepare for the annual MFA exhibition, this year called Nexus of 12. “It’s a reflection of work from 12 artists who have learned and grown together,” said Carrie-Anne Gonzales, a photographer and one of the MFA graduate students in the show. “Nexus of 12 shows the universe’s incredible ability to harmonize individual paths and beings in and through itself.”
The show has a variety of mediums, chosen by the artist themselves, ranging from photography to print making, video art and painting. Alongside the Nexus of 12 in the Steinberg, which is up for six weeks, the artists also show their work in SIA Gallery in Chelsea in NYC. The shows are a part of a mandatory thesis for the students, and show some of the body of work they’ve created throughout their academic career at Post. “Your job is to create art… all of the time. To see where it takes you, to reflect on it, to see what drives you and how far you can come. We all have our own process and way of getting there,” Gonzales said.
Gonzales has a pretty rigid process, after over 20 years of being a photographer. “I start with sketches, or charcoal drawings, or cut-outs or collages of an idea and then I stick it to my studio wall,” she said. “There are many things up there.” Her work shows the struggle of women, relationships and of the working class, and for her thesis, she gives a nod to the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. “Like Siqueiros, my pieces also reflect on social and political subjects of today,” she said.
Although the students work on their theses during the time, they can exhibit anything they’ve made. “Most artists usually have some kind of theme and/or ideology that ties the works they’re exhibiting together,” said Nicholas Frizalone, another artist and graduating MFA student. Frizalone is showing paintings and drawings in the exhibit. “It’s helpful to me because I get to experience what it’s like to exhibit alongside artists of other disciplines and backgrounds,” he said.
The show in the Steinberg Museum opens April 11, and is up through May 6. It is located in the Hillwood Commons at LIU Post campus. The show in the SIA Gallery is up from April 13 to April 20, with an opening reception April 14 from 6-8 p.m.
Steinberg Museum hours:
Monday – Friday 9:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.
Wednesdays 9:30 a.m. – 8 p.m.
Saturdays 11 a.m. – 3 p.m.

“Daredevil,” based on the Marvel comic series of the same name, follows Matt Murdock, a lawyer who was blinded as a young boy after coming in contact with radioactive substance. As a result of the accident, Matt developed heightened senses and can see using a form of radar. After seeing the corruption in his neighborhood, Hell’s Kitchen, Matt dons a red devil costume and becomes the vigilante Daredevil in order to fight crime outside the law.
Season one of “Daredevil” was focused on the origin of the hero as he worked to take down crime lord Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. Kingpin. Season two sees Matt face off against a new adversary known as the Punisher, and also come to terms with the return of his ex-girlfriend. In season two, Daredevil is joined by new and returning characters, including Foggy Nelson, Matt’s best friend and law partner; Karen Page, the secretary for Matt and Foggy’s law firm; Frank Castle, the violent vigilante nicknamed the Punisher and Elektra Natchios.
In the first episode, “Bang,” the law firm of Nelson and Murdock takes on a new client who has a questionable background working for the Irish mob. They soon find out he survived an attack by the Punisher, while the rest of his crew was killed. While the tone changes over the course of the episode between light hearted and serious, it does become very intense whenever the Punisher is on screen.
Charlie Cox continues his role as Matt Murdock. He convincingly plays the role of a blind man while making sure that Daredevil and Matt Murdock each have different personalities. The supporting cast is well rounded, in particular Jon Bernthal. While Bernthal is most known for his role as Shane on “The Walking Dead,” the Punisher is much more damaged and dangerous. He takes over the show whenever he appears on screen, and has great chemistry with Cox in later episodes. While Bernthal shows the darker aspects of the character well, he excels in scenes where he is having conversations with Daredevil.
Like season one, the action sequences in “Daredevil” are outstanding. The fight choreography is always top notch and the camera work makes it easy for the viewer to understand what is going on. There is also a fight scene in a stairwell in one of the earlier episodes that rivals the five-minute hallway fight from season one.
Like “Jessica Jones,” “Daredevil” is a dark show that may be too intense for younger viewers, especially certain aspects about the Punisher, such as his tragic back-story and his extreme methods of violence. However, viewers who enjoyed the first season, the comic book series, or other Marvel movies, should watch this action packed show.
All 13 episodes of “Daredevil’s” second season were released on Netflix on March 18. Audiences were treated to season one of the superhero show when it released on April 10, 2015. “Daredevil” season two is the first Marvel show to be released on Netflix in 2016; it will be followed by the release of “Luke Cage” on September 30.
