Tesla (TSLA) ⬆️ Over the past 9 days, Tesla has had an incredible run increasing by nearly 8%. Despite the Nasdaq and the tech industry having a tough stretch, Tesla has been able to push through and almost eclipsed the 800 mark for the first time since February. 
JP Morgan Chase (JPM) ⬆️ Chase has been making consistent gains since the start of the pandemic. However, a 10% gain over the past week has allowed Chase to break it’s previous all time high and continue to rise.
Microsoft (MFST) ⬇️ After having great gains for a while, Microsoft has taken a tumble down about 7% in just a few days. However, this seems to be just a minor correction and nothing to worry about as an investor. 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) ✅ While this coin has had a tough time taking off and has been very back and forth since it’s hype last May, it is bound to come of age among the cryptocurrency sector. The release of the exchange Shibaswap as well as other projects based around this coin, Shiba Inu has all the potential to become a major crypto in this new investment space

The National Football League (NFL) made it’s highly anticipated return this weekend, with the Buccaneers and Cowboys kicking off the league’s 101st season on Thursday night. The return of the NFL also meant the return of fans to NFL stadiums, as a vast majority of the league lifted their COVID-19 restrictions and allowed fans in at full-capacity. For New York sports fans, the return of the Giants to Metlife Stadium this Sunday marked the last major sport to bring back fans in full capacity in New York. 
Leading up to the opening of Sunday’s slate of games, both Jets and Giants fans alike shared a sense of optimism about their teams this season. With both franchises having promising offseasons, fans were justified in their belief that this season would be different from years past. 
Speaking of the offseason, the New York Giants made a big splash in free agency this year by signing WR Kenny Golladay, who could be the new WR1 in the Big Apple, and a great target for QB Daniel Jones. The G-Men also bolstered their defense, resigning DL Leonard Williams and signing CB Adoree Jackson to aid their already top 10 defense. With star RB Saquon Barkley returning from injury, the Giants have their sights set on a division title in the weak NFC East. 
As for the New York Jets, this offseason saw them make major changes. These changes started when they traded away QB Sam Darnold to the Panthers, and drafted the highly touted BYU QB Zach Wilson with their second overall pick. They also brought in former 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh to be their new head coach, who helped bring in weapons for his rookie QB such as RB Tevin Coleman and WR Corey Davis, as well as DE Carl Lawson, DL Sheldon Rankins and CB/S Lamarus Joyner to help boost an otherwise weak Jets defense. With both teams looking promising prior to kickoff Week 1, New York football fans had a lot to root for heading into opening weekend. 
The New York Jets started their season on the road against their former QB Sam Darnold and the Carolina Panthers. After a relatively quiet first quarter for both sides, the Panthers’ offense started to gain momentum, as Sam Darnold found former Jets WR Robby Anderson deep for a 57-yard touchdown which gave the Panthers a 9-0 lead. Following this big play, the Jets offense punted after a quick three and out, which led to another Sam Darnold touchdown which extended the Panthers’ lead to 16 heading into halftime. In the second half, the Jets were able to mount a comeback, as QB Zach Wilson found his new favorite target in WR Corey Davis for two touchdowns, which cut the lead down to 5. Unfortunately, the Jets’ defense had no answer for RB Christian McCaffery and the Panthers’ offense, losing by a final score of 19-14. 
The New York Giants had the honor of welcoming fans back to Metlife as they squared off against the Denver Broncos. Unlike the Jets, the Giants got off to a great start, as QB Daniel Jones connected with veteran WR Sterling Shepard for a 37-yard touchdown to take a 7-3 lead in the second quarter. However, this proved to be the peak of the Giants’ offense, as they were completely shut down by the stellar Broncos defense for the rest of the game. After the Giants scored, QB Teddy Bridgewater led the Broncos’ offense on a scoring drive and took a 10-7 lead at the half. From there, the Broncos never looked back, as they dominated the second half and beat the G-Men by a score of 27-13. 
Sophomore broadcasting major and avid Giants fan Brady Campbell felt that the teams’ offense struggled to pull their weight. “[The] offense couldn’t do much the entire game, which left our defense exhausted and vulnerable,” he said. “[It] brought me down to earth about my expectations for this season.” 
While Jets and Giants fans had a disappointing Week 1, fans around the league enjoyed one of the best weeks of football in recent history. Out of the 16 games played in Week 1, 9 of them were only won by a single score, with the final game of the week ending in an overtime thriller. There were also breakout performances across the league, as stars like Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes and Cardinals QB Kyler Murray played exceptionally well in their respective games. 
Out of these many outstanding performances, freshman finance major Luca Van Velsor was most impressed with one player in particular, new Rams QB Mattew Stafford. 
“Stafford looked incredible,” he said. “He is one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the league.”
 This high praise comes after Stafford’s lights-out Week 1 performance, as he torched the Bears defense on Sunday night, throwing for 321 yards, 3 touchdowns, and finished with a 156.1 passer rating. 
After an exceptional Week 1, Van Velsor believes that the former Lions QB leads the very early MVP race, and has the Rams in position to be Super Bowl contenders this season. 
“The [Rams] defense has been great the past few years,” he said. “And now with an MVP caliber quarterback in Mattew Stafford, the Rams should be favorites to win the Super Bowl.”
Despite their lackluster Week 1 performances, Jets and Giants fans shouldn’t hit the panic button just yet. There is plenty of football left to play this season, and both teams have a real chance at having a great season if they can learn from the mistakes made in Week 1.

Sept. baseball marks an exciting yet nerve-racking time for MLB fans. With teams competing for one of the five playoff spots in each league, the games in Sept. become that much more important. 
The New York Mets started the season in promising fashion, as their starting pitching looked dominant, and their hitting was doing just enough to win them games. Heading into midseason, the Mets had a 47-40 record and sat on top of the weak NL East. Eyeing a playoff run, the Mets made a move on July 30 to acquire Cubs All-Star infielder Javier Baez. 
Unfortunately for Mets fans, the back half of this season was brutal, as they lost arguably the best pitcher in baseball when SP Jacob DeGrom strained the UCL in his throwing arm. From there, the Mets have slowly fallen apart, with Sept. marking the complete collapse of this team as a whole. 
Sophomore adolescent education major Ryan Kaim felt his team drastically underperformed expectations. 
“My disappointment was immeasurable. This team was supposed to go places with a new owner willing to spend, but injuries and astonishing headlines continue to plague the team making it look like the leadership never truly changed,” Kaim said. 
Kaim believes there are many parts of the organization that need to change in order for the Mets to be competitive. 
“I think it’s the management aspect that needs to change. The medical staff needs to go, the head of baseball operations needs to belong to someone like Epstein or Beane. Rojas needs to be a part of the Mets organization but not as a manager,” he said. “Steve Cohen has the money, now he’s gotta put it where his mouth is.”
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher has a similar sentiment. 
“My disappointment was really bad and honestly crushing because with all of the injuries the Mets sustained over the season, they still at one point had a 5+ game lead,” he said. “The Mets are the only team to hold first place for over 103 days and end up with a losing record ever. So overall it’s a crusher to a true fan.”
Boettcher claims the Mets need more reliable players who can get the job done. 
“In order for the Mets to be successful next year, the key is to bolster their hitting with key players who hit with runners in scoring position and pitchers who can eat up innings at a reliable rate,” he said. 
The New York Yankees have had a very up and down season, as the Bronx Bombers have been very inconsistent the entire season. Many fans were disappointed in their team in the first half of the season, as they weren’t living up to their championship expectations. Heading into the All-Star Break, the Yankees had a 46-43 record and were a few games back from the last Wild Card spot. Similar to the Mets, the Yankees made big moves at the deadline, trading for lefty sluggers Joey Gallo and Anthony Rizzo to help boost their struggling offense.
Junior digital art and design major Anthony Hines is satisfied with where the Yankees are at this point. 
“Considering this team was at 41-41 at one point, I am genuinely happy with this season and if this team can get their heads together they can really make a push here and we’re looking good for October,” he said. 
Hines is looking for young phenom Gleyber Torres to step up most for the Yankees in the final stretch. 
“I’m gonna call it right now, Gleyber Torres. We’ve seen him struggle a lot at shortstop and obviously the move to second we’ve seen some results,” he said. “I’m gonna look for him to produce really big into the last week here and hopefully into the playoffs.”
Unlike the Mets, the Yankees significantly improved after making these moves, as both their hitting and pitching saw major improvements in the back half of the season. After an underwhelming start to the season, Yankees’ ace Gerrit Cole and the rest of the pitching staff greatly improved, as they have one of the best collective ERAs in baseball after the break. Currently, the Bronx Bombers are 89-67 and hold the top Wild Card spot in the American League playoffs with less than a week to go in the regular season. As of now, the Yankees have a one-game lead on the Red Sox and would host them in the Wild Card Game.
Sophomore business administration major Rebecca Margolin believes the Yankees would be the favorites to move into the Division Series.
 “I definitely think the Yankees will win against the Red Sox,” she said. “As long as they continue to play well, they can make it to the playoffs for sure.”

The term drilled into all first-year students causes emotional turmoil and self-confidence issues that can and will spread to other parts of their life. But what exactly is the freshman 15 and why is it such a nationally concerning issue for college students?
Thrillist, an online lifestyle website targeted to young adults, tells us that the term originated in a “Seventeen” magazine in 1989. “Seventeen”’s target audience was primarily female, and the editors were aware that any article containing weight loss tips would bring forth magazine sales. The article detailed 15 ways in which students would be able to “beat” the pounds that “Seventeen” claimed they would gain in their first year of college. While the term was created as catchy wordplay that would grab an audience in order to sell more magazines, it has turned into a cultural issue that strikes fear in incoming collegiate students. 
With the term ingrained into incoming college students, many reported concerns about weight gain in their first year of college. The struggle to maintain a healthy diet and start your independent life is a difficult task, and not one that many are able to figure out in their first semester. The stigma behind weight gain during freshman year of college can cause students an even higher stress level than what many first-year college students already experience. 
Regardless of whether the phenomenon is true, college itself is not the only cause for weight gain, as there are several factors for first-year students that may influence a fluctuation in weight. For instance, students must familiarize themselves with living alone and independently. The home-cooked meals students once knew and loved are gone, and many are now faced with the task of not only living on their own but learning to eat on their own.
Many universities provide students with an array of food, mostly buffet-style in large quantities. Although universities attempt to provide healthy food for students, the food is produced in such a massive quantity that it becomes increasingly more difficult to make in a healthy manner. 
According to students at Post, Aramark, which caters food to all students at the university, does not do the best job at providing healthy options for students. Senior forensics major Eric Nazario gives insight into the options students have.
“If the school provided healthier and more appealing options, then maybe it would be easier for students to eat healthy, but every day it’s pizza and pasta and the daily meals are never good. Not only that, but the only healthy option we have daily is the salad bar where the vegetables are wilted half the time,” Nazario said.
Sophomore business administration major Gina Symes echoed Nazario’s frustration with food on campus. 
“ Honestly there aren’t enough healthy food options on campus. I’m a healthy eater and value fitness as part of my lifestyle. I often find myself rotating between the same few meals every day. These being, different types of protein salad and chicken and tofu dishes from the “home cooked” station,” Symes said. “It’s enough to get by but barely. I’d love to see a smoothie bar or some sort of whole wheat wraps or anything involving avocado.” 
The issue lies primarily with students who dorm at school rather than those who commute. People who commute still have the option to eat at home and have healthy meals provided to them by their families. 
“Home-cooked meals from my mom are made with fresh quality ingredients as opposed to the frozen, bland food that the school offers. Meanwhile, you pay exorbitant amounts of money for a meal plan and they offer too few options,” said sophomore finance major Joseph Dowling.
Not only do students at Post claim to be disappointed in their meal choices while dorming, but the students who dorm rather than commute have an increasingly difficult time finding healthy options while at school.
Junior accounting major Banu Bokhari commutes to campus and feels the dining options are unfair for many dorming students because they have fewer options. 
“If [students] are dorming especially instead of commuting [they’re] only able to eat what’s provided to them. Not only that, but most of the food that they sell at these universities is basically fast food so it’s almost out of the students’ control. As a commuter, it’s easier for me because I’m not stuck with the same choices every day.”
Symes’ shift from home to dorming has affected her eating and lifestyle.
“My eating habits haven’t changed since arriving at college, but my options are much more limited than when I was home. Healthy eating makes both my mind and body happy and that’s why I like to stick to it,” Symes said. 
Students today are familiarized with the term freshman 15, however there isn’t much research to back up this phenomenon.  Scientific evidence says that there is not only a serious rebuttal to the phrase but a completely different reality than that which is fed to students.
The U.S. National Library of Medicine provided a journal published in 2008 where the findings are more than just a rebuttal, but a completely different result than what the unhealthy phrase insinuates. Out of 125 students who were analyzed in their first year of college, the average weight gain was only 2.7 pounds. About half of the students gained weight and 15 percent of students lost weight.

It’s pumpkin spice season, and students on campus have been bringing out their favorite fall fashion pieces for all to see. 
Many students are embracing the changing seasons and sporting familiar fall favorites and colors on campus.
 “I wore an autumn red, button-down corduroy dress with a black turtleneck to match the colors of the changing leaves,” sophomore musical theatre major Kara Joy Fish said. “The overall style dress gives a more outdoor feel to the look and the turtleneck pulls in the more formal side of fashion.” 
Sophomore musical theatre major Maria Meouchi also embraced the colors of fall and dressed in her favorite fall pieces. 
“I wore a white turtleneck with a burnt orange corduroy skirt. I added black sheer tights and the coat to make the outfit more weather appropriate. I love these colors together, the brown, orange, and white black tones are perfect for the fall, never going out of style. Adding the boots and tights is the perfect way to dress up a little more,” Meouchi said. 
As the leaves and seasons change, many students have been keeping up with the changing styles and colors. With the amount of thought that goes into the color choices, people give just as much, if not more, into the functionality of what they’re wearing as not to feel the effects of the changing seasons. 
“For everyday school life, I usually go for a more functional outfit, especially being a musical theatre major and moving all the time. But I like to dress more fashionably on the weekends,” Meouchi said. 
While some familiar trends are coming back, Meouchi feels styling and reinventing pieces to express yourself are becoming bigger trends in fashion. 
“I think we’ve upgraded in regards to fall trends. Thrifting and used clothing that looks oversized, like blazers and cardigans, are becoming more popular. It’s great to give clothing a second life before just discarding it and also reduces fast fashion purchases,” Meouchi said.  
Fish agreed with Meouchi and believes that fashion is about expressions and risk. 
“If you saw Kim Kardashian’s dress at the MET Gala, you would know that we are truly on one of the most adventurous paths that fashion has ever seen. But truthfully, it’s one of the most accepting places to be,” Fish said. “Now that fashion has chosen the more adventurous route, everything that follows is becoming accepted.” 
Regardless of the impact the media has on people’s wardrobe, in the end, fashion is a form of expression. It is the wearer’s option to choose how much they would like to use clothing to express themselves.
“I believe that if you wanted to dress modestly or adventurously, they both would be seen as a unique choice. I think it’s critical to learn what style expresses yourself most and to run with it, no matter what the world has to say. You should never be ashamed of you,” Fish said. 
Enjoy the display of this years’ latest fall fashion trends.The tones of the portraits are meant to represent the dichotomy of the changing of the leaves and the cooling of the temperature that is respected as a direct association to the fall season. Utilizing the tones of the lighting to pay homage to fall and its lovely characteristics.

President Joe Biden addressed the nation on the COVID-19 pandemic on Sept. 9. The main focus of this address was to get Americans vaccinated. 
“COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of people spreading the virus that causes COVID-19,” the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said.
With full Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Biden announced that his administration will start mandating vaccines on the federal level. 
Biden’s administration is requiring vaccines for federal contractors, all healthcare workers and most people employed by federal agencies. The mandate requires private sector companies that employ more than 100 workers to require all employees to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination, or get tested weekly. 
States and cities are also introducing mandates. New York City is requiring businesses to check for proof of vaccination for entry to most indoor activities, including restaurants and theatres. Los Angeles is requiring proof of vaccination for all kids 12 and older that attend public schools in-person. NYC has not required proof of vaccination for public k-12 schools yet.
Some students support these plans initiated by the Biden administration.
 “As long as the vaccine is FDA approved, I think [the government] can mandate it,” sophomore childhood education major Daniella Azzaretto said. “If it’s approved, schools and other institutions should be able to mandate it the same way they have mandated other vaccines for decades. I think having most people vaccinated will help stop the spread and return us to normal.”
The NYC mandate affects the Post community more than other mandates.
“Until the pandemic gets under control, we have to do what we can to stop the spread,” communications professor Dr. Jennifer Cusumano said. “I understand why people would have concerns about a mandate like this, but we are in a major pandemic. I think some people will try to get around following the mandate.”
Cusumano agrees that people should question decisions they make when it comes to their own health, but that individuals should also use the guidance from doctors to guide themselves forward. 
Sophomore nutrition and dietetics major Amanda Battista sees both sides of the issue.
“Now that the vaccine is FDA approved I think it can go both ways,” Battista said. “The vaccine definitely helps you and others around you if you get it, but people should still have a choice. Mandating it or not isn’t going to end the pandemic because there are so many people who cannot get the vaccine. I still think that the president should encourage people who are eligible to get vaccinated, but not force it on anyone.”
Many students and faculty at Post comply with the state and university rules by wearing their masks indoors. As time goes on, COVID-19 fatigue may affect the success of federal and state-level mandates.

Throughout the 2020-2021 school year, music majors have been shuffled around campus, trying to find places to hold class, rehearse and perform. While frustrating to most students in the program, they have finally been provided a space to practice their material, on the second floor of Hillwood Commons. The Fine Arts Center, located on South Campus was reserved for music majors for years, but has recently been transformed into a building for what seems to be conference rooms.
“I was disappointed last year to find out that construction was being done on our only building, to be given to another program,” senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said. “It felt like we were being pushed aside.”
Sottung, along with other music majors, felt as though they were being pushed out of their home, almost like an eviction. Junior music education major Annie Rodriguez felt that the change in practice rooms were out of the blue.
“I wish they gave us more of a heads up,” she said. “While I am very grateful for the new practice rooms they’ve given us, our department was worried for our future all of last year.”
Post did not give the music majors any heads up about their change of location. Students found out in a meeting at the beginning of the spring 2021 semester.
The music department students are grateful to have a space to rehearse again. 
“I have not yet used the practice rooms, but I plan on doing so when I have more material to rehearse,” Sottung said.
A common concern among the music majors is privacy in Hillwood. Anyone can walk by while they are practicing, which can be uncomfortable for some performers.
“My biggest concern with our new spaces being located in Hillwood is privacy,” Rodriguez said. “Not everyone understands the work that goes into being a music major, and others may not take it seriously. I am nervous I will be interrupted by loud noises during common hour as well.”
The state of the Fine Arts Center has not yet been announced to the public but it is no longer home to the music majors, as it once was.
