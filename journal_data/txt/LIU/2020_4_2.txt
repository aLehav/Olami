Hedda Walltott, a senior nutrition major from Saltsjo-Boo, Sweden, is one of the top riders on the equestrian team.
Walltott qualified for the Intercollegiate Horse Shows Association (IHSA) Regional Show this year, and won novice over fences and flat at the IHSA Regional Show in 2019. She also won her section of intermediate flat at the Adelphi/Pratt Show in 2019.
Walltott finished up her season abruptly since the remainder of equestrian shows were canceled due to the new coronavirus pandemic. In her three years on the team, this was the season she was looking to get the most from. She had high expectations and ambitions for herself going into the last semester of her senior year.
“With no previous experience of North American riding, I have developed and learned so much,” she said. “This was my last chance I had to show what I really got and get that receipt of all the hard work I’ve been putting in during these years.”
Walltott led the equestrian team all the way to the regional finals before they were canceled due to the pandemic.
“When the news hit that all upcoming shows, including Regionals, Zones and Nationals were canceled, I was devastated,” she said. “Everything me and my team had been working so hard for this whole year was just gone, done. I had no words.”
With equestrian being a sport that falls into both spring and fall, Walltott and the team are protesting for an extra year of eligibility.
“What is happening right now is no one’s fault and competing athletes are putting in so much work into their sport, they shouldn’t be punished for this,” Walltott said. “They should get their chance to continue doing their sport. If winter athletes get their season cancelled too, I wish the same for them, to gain an extra year of eligibility.”
With the equestrian season over, Walltott looks to finish out her academic year at Post and expects to graduate at the end of the 2019-20 school year.

Despite rising concerns about COVID-19 and its effect on everyday life, the National Football League (NFL) Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the league has no plans to postpone the 2020 NFL draft which will take place on its originally scheduled date, April 23-25.
For the first time in NFL history, the draft was supposed to take place in Las Vegas, with some festivities scheduled to take place in the famous Bellagio Fountains. However, with the spread of COVID-19 throwing everything off its normal course, the venue will be closed, and the NFL will need to explore new options.
“This decision reflects our foremost priority – the health and safety of all fans and citizens,” said Goodell, according to a statement released by the NFL.
“While this outcome is disappointing both to the NFL and to the Las Vegas community, we look forward to partnering with the Raiders, the City of Las Vegas and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority for a future NFL Draft as well as evaluating opportunities for other major NFL events in Las Vegas in the future, including the Super Bowl.”
Goodell, who was adamant about having the draft on its scheduled date, said that although the draft will be held without fans, it will still be televised. The most likely option, according to sources for the Los Angeles Times, is that the draft will occur inside of a television studio, with cut-ins to each team’s specific headquarters as they make their selection. Goodell is supposed to reevaluate the situation by April 8.
In recent years, the draft has become more and more of a spectacle, garnering close to a record 600,000 fans in live attendance for the 2019 draft in Nashville. Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis was expecting close to 750,000 fans for the 2020 draft.
Instead, a studio setting will have to do, as hundreds of players will achieve the next step in their careers through a screen rather than in person.

Gov. Cuomo announced that 100 percent of New York’s nonessential workforce must stay at or work from home on March 21. This announcement and the strong encouragement to practice social distancing has left many students binging TV shows to pass the time.
Stephanie Conway, a sophmore international business and relations major, is watching “Gilmore Girls”, “Lucifer” and “Grace and Frankie.”
“This is literally the third time I’ve watched ‘Gilmore Girls’” she said.
Some students have turned to rewatching shows as a way to distract them from the current situation. Margaret Levin, a senior musical theatre major, has been rewatching “Parks and Recreation” with her seventeen year old cat.
“I’ve watched ‘Parks and Rec’ countless times, but I love how it never fails to make me laugh and smile” Levin said.
Ashley Herkomer, a senior digital art and design major, said she’s watching “Shameless” with her dog while eating snacks.
“[It’s about] a family in Chicago that struggles with their crazy dad and poverty,” she said. Watching Netflix, crafting and hiking have been getting Herkomer through this time.
Levin agreed with Herkomer and said she has been coping with the situation in various ways.
“I’m working out through the Peloton App, going for long walks, trying to enjoy the nice weather in my hometown, and binge-watching shows of course.”
Levin has been watching “Private Practice” and is a huge fan of Shonda Rhimes, the producer of “Grey’s anatomy,” “Private Practice” and “Scandal.”
“[I] have watched Grey’s Anatomy too many times already,” Levin said.
Some professors have also turned to television as a way to pass the time. Mary Piglicelli, adjunct professor of English, has been watching “Little Fires Everywhere.”
“I read the book with my book group, so I’m interested in seeing how it’s been translated for television. I think that this story speaks so strongly about privilege, about who belongs and who gets to be seen as fully human… and who doesn’t,” she said.
Pigliacelli has also been coping by being productive.
“I am working a lot, getting the Writing Center fully functional online and teaching my class. This has been very helpful because I know for me, boredom can definitely be an enemy.”

With the outbreak of the new coronavirus, the university moved all classes online. This new setting was a surprise to some, as few courses are offered online regularly. This change may hinder the learning experience for some, especially those who rely on in-person classes, more specifically, those majoring in the performing arts.
Theater students rely on face-to-face classes since they rehearse different styles of acting, as well as other performance techniques. With classes now being conducted virtually, some of these students are finding the online platform difficult.
Carolyn Lenza, sophomore acting major, enrolled in many interactive courses this semester like intermediate/advanced ballet, intermediate acting, beginning voice and speech II, voice lessons, and production lab.
“The program is a mess, but everyone is doing the best that they can,” Lenza said. “With all classes being online, we are unable to rehearse or perform multi-person scenes, as well as those that require face-to-face interactions.”
For students to get the most from a dance class, a large studio space is required for them to practice, which many students don’t have, according to Lenza. She understands those in her major must make the most of the situation, and is thankful that none of her courses have been canceled, putting students in jeopardy of not graduating.
“Luckily there has been no talk of retaking classes at this point but we are figuring it out,” Lenza said. “Also to my luck, my play for the semester had ended right before break got out, so it isn’t an issue for me, but the rest of the plays are all canceled.”
Kaloni Smith, sophomore musical theatre major, said it was incredibly hard to try and move performance art to a non-social space. Smith is enrolled in acting, modern theatre history, and voice and speech this semester.
“Online classes have been overall okay. My professors are trying to make the best out of the situation which has been very helpful with everything,” Smith said. “Finishing the semester scares me though because of the high possibility of not being able to do my work with the lack of resources at home versus on campus.”
While Smith said he is still learning new things considering the circumstances, he is also missing out on learning new techniques.
“We no longer can rehearse things constantly and be able to give our instructors the product to take and move in the right direction,” he said.
With everything being moved to a virtual setting , Smith’s play was cut.
“I did lose my play this semester, which had a very important and relevant message that is worth people hearing, as well as my first work alone as an actor on stage that I was ready to work on and show,” he said.
Smith is also worried about the tuition money that he paid to the school, along with the fact that he resides in Oregon where they’re on Pacific Standard Time, creating a three-hour time difference.
“Honestly, my own personal vendetta with everything is that since I am going home, I’m worried about the money I already am supposed to pay for this semester,” Smith said. “Also, how am I going to be able to do all my work with the time difference being three hours behind, and still being expected to have to put the same energy as everyone else although we will be up earlier than other students on the east coast.”
The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused colleges to revert to online instruction across America. The virus is still very new, but healthcare workers and the government are doing the best they can to slow the spread and keep Americans safe. With that being said, Smith and Lenza are prepared to make the necessary adjustments until the pandemic passes.

The United States currently has over 20 states under a stay-at-home order to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, but some college students ignored the mandate and followed through anyway with their spring break plans.
Florida was a hot spot for students to party through the pandemic and socialize with other spring breakers. A spring breaker in Miami told the New York Times, “If I get Corona, I get Corona.”
Amidst spring breakers returning to their universities or family homes, a correlated uprise began in COVID-19 cases. Speculation among some included the possibility that spring breakers who traveled to Florida might be “super-spreaders,” or people who disproportionately infect a large number of people with the virus, according to Politico.
But not all students found it necessary to travel to places such as Florida this spring break. Some actually felt that those who did travel to popular destinations were being insensitive to the potential risk of jeopardizing their own and their loved ones health.
“The college students that willingly went out during the virus weren’t thinking at all because now they are spreading it to their loved ones who then could spread it to others, thus, spiking the curve,” Tasia Hernandez, a sophomore nutrition and dietetics major, said.
Some students believe that President Donald Trump is to blame considering the lack of concern some think he has shown regarding the hazards of COVID-19.
“[Trump] hadn’t taken it seriously and instead tried to play it down,” Tierra Gillet, a sophomore business administration major, said. “If I had no idea how bad it really was, I probably wouldn’t have canceled my vacation either.”
Gillet also believed that if the president provided a more accurate approach at assessing the crisis, students would have taken the situation more seriously.
“I’m sure if it was made clear that the situation is serious, like it is now with curfew and 14-day quarantine after travel, then there would be much less cases now,” Gillet said.
Some students canceled their plans to Florida for spring break due to their worry of the COVID-19 outbreak. Tyanna Middleton, a sophomore music major who battles with the autoimmune disease Lupus, was one of those students.
“I was supposed to go to Florida for spring break, but I cancelled it because I was worried about the coronavirus outbreak and my potential to get it because of the fact that I have Lupus,” Middleton said.
Hernandez said she couldn’t go out or see her family and friends during her week off from school. “COVID-19 ruined all of my plans that I had for my spring break,” she said.

There are several businesses considered essential and permitted to stay open during stay-at-home orders. While workers and students are communicating remotely, access to technology is necessary. Some individuals need ways to pick up required medication. Food must remain accessible to everyone. During a time of social distancing, an emphasis is placed on goods and services some cannot live without.
“I think that grocery stores, medical services, liquor stores, and transportation are all essential businesses during quarantine,” Mike Ciardiello, a junior accounting major, said. Grocery stores have remained open although they’re short on inventory due to customers stocking up and preparing to remain inside indefinitely.
Medical services are open, including hospitals and urgent care centers. Telemedicine is currently being used for patients to continue seeing their doctors. Liquor stores are considered essential businesses. Transportation, for example the LIRR, has seen less business lately.
Harris Becker, director of guitar studies, shared a similar opinion to Ciardiello. “Supermarkets and pharmacies are necessary services right now. The internet is also crucial regarding schooling and work. I know that Zoom has been being used and has been very helpful during quarantine,” he said.
Ryan Miller, a graduate student, believes that the United States as a whole is the most important industry.
“You can pick any sector, public or private – any worker, laid off or not, just needs to do their job,” he said. “There will be an effect on the job market that leaves people graduating and entering the workforce for the next few years. There is going to be a transformation of the job market that will benefit those already entrenched in careers at the expense of those lacking experience.
“For America to stay running, Amazon must deliver packages. Nurses and doctors need to treat, and universities and pharmaceutical companies need to research. Some people are not that lucky and do not have the option of staying home from work,” Miller continued.
Overall, some students agree that no single job is more important than another. Miller said, “This shows that no job lacks importance. Our job right now is to stay inside to be safe and healthy for ourselves, loved ones, fellow Americans, and humanity.”
