Fall semester classes at LIU Brooklyn have begun without its faculty. The Brooklyn faculty union, which includes both full time professors and adjuncts, has been preemptively locked out since Labor Day weekend. The faculty’s current union contract expired on August 31, and the faculty and LIU administration have not agreed upon a new contract, despite ongoing negotiations.
The faculty was “denied access to the campus, had their email accounts blocked and had their health insurance canceled,” according to John Lutz, chair of the English department at Post.
“We never even got a chance to vote on the [proposed] contract,” said Donald Allport Bird, professor of journalism and communication studies for over 37 years at LIU Brooklyn.
The LIU administration explained its decision to lock out the LIU Brooklyn faculty. President Kimberly Cline, Vice President of Academic Affairs Jeff Kane, and Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and University Counsel Gale Stevens Haynes did not respond to inquiries from the Pioneer, which were all referred to the university’s communications office. “Five of the past six contract negotiations with the LIU Brooklyn faculty union have ended in strike votes,” said Jennifer Solomon, communications strategist at LIU. “One strike lasted for nearly two months, leaving our students and the University virtually closed. It is a history that caused harm to students and the University.” When the union issued a strike authorization during pre-negotiation, the administration decided on a lockout to prevent such repeated action, according to Solomon.
The union objected to several items presented in the university’s proposed contract, including cuts for adjunct faculty, and full-timers’ minimum wages being lower than the base salary for faculty at Post. “Other issues revolve around faculty control of curriculum, various work rules that transfer power from faculty to administration, the continuation of the parity clause, cuts to overtime pay for librarians and increases in librarian workload, and the desire by administration to implement post-tenure review, something many of us feel is a step toward infringing on our rights as tenured faculty,” said Emily Drabinski, secretary of the LIU Faculty Federation (LIUFF), and coordinator of library instruction at the Brooklyn campus.
The university responded to this alleged imparity with a statement that Brooklyn faculty “earns salaries above those at most peer institutions,” and added a guaranteed “average wage increase of 13.4 percent over the five-year term with some faculty receiving increases in excess of 22 percent,” according to an article by Heidi Landecker in the Chronicle of Higher Education on Sept. 3
The Post faculty voted in solidarity with their Brooklyn counterparts at an emergency meeting held in Humanities Hall on Thursday, Sept. 8. In an email to the Post faculty, Willie Hiatt, associate professor of Latin American history, shared a resolution of no confidence in President Cline and Vice President Kane, which was introduced and passed at the emergency meeting. The Brooklyn campus faculty senate previously passed its own vote of no confidence in President Cline and Vice President Kane on Tuesday, Sept. 6, with a 135-10 decision.
“In the absence of the LIUFF, classes at LIU Brooklyn have been taught by both hired adjunct professors and University administrators,” Solomon said in an email to the Pioneer. Many have been hired through advertisement on the site monster.com; others are administrators and staffers from Post, although the administration ensures that “all replacement faculty at the Brooklyn campus have advanced degrees,” according to Solomon.
The hiring of replacement faculty has caused concern for professors on both the Post and Brooklyn campuses. Brooklyn Professor Bird grumbled, “People aren’t that interchangeable.”
Post professors are concerned about the absence of administrators who are traveling to Brooklyn instead of performing their administrative duties at Post.
“The staff and administrators at Post are dedicated professionals who will no doubt put in many extra hours to compensate for their absence, but inevitably there will be gaps in support with so many in Brooklyn,” Lutz said. “This decision is unfair to staff and administrators who have not been given a choice in the matter and a disservice to students at both Post and Brooklyn campuses.”
Drabinski expressed empathy towards the replacement teachers, but pointed out that, “people taking these positions aren’t helping themselves in the long term—the jobs are temporary because legally, in a lockout, workers can’t be permanently replaced—and they are letting themselves be the facilitators of the administration’s devastating attack on its faculty workforce.”
In an email to Post faculty members, Hiatt emphasized that administration has not been clear with the compensation being paid to the replacement teachers. “At least in the short term, Human Resources has told substitutes that they will receive $500 per day and a $50 commutation reimbursement,” the email read. “However, if the replacements teach the entire semester, they will receive around $3,000 total.”
Professor Hiatt’s email also touched upon the quality and training of replacement teachers. “One replacement instructor told me that the administration required the substitutes to attend one of four ‘onboarding sessions’ (two at Brooklyn, two at Post),” Hiatt wrote. “Dr. Sterling Jasper of LIU Brooklyn Promise, the facilitator, listed three books on college teaching that replacements should purchase. For the first day of class, Dr. Jasper recommended that the instructor go over the syllabus, divide students into three groups to discuss the syllabus, and then have each group ask questions about the syllabus.”
In addition to the academic concerns for the students, Drabinski expressed concerns about the ultimate financial cost of the lockout. “If you look at the myriad costs of this lockout, from the cash spent to send COBRA paperwork to all faculty via overnight express weekend delivery to the hiring of all these temporary workers to the inevitable legal challenges from students and faculty that will come after the lockout, you begin to see that this is not really about money,” she said. “It is just too expensive to lock us out to think that the reason management is doing this is to cut the small fund that subsidizes some adjunct health care benefits. This is about power, transferring it from faculty to administrators.”
“The current situation at LIU reflects a volatile and challenging era for higher education, particularly for private institutions,” Solomon said, explaining the impact of the 2008 financial crisis. “[We] have seen peer schools face declines in enrollment, donations and endowment returns. Some schools have not survived this turbulent period.”
In its no-confidence vote, the Post faculty has expressed concerns about university management, including the drop in enrollment from 2012, the year before President Cline arrived, to 2016, and the drop in staff from 4,110 a decade ago, to today’s 2,573, according to research published in Newsday. “Experienced staff continues to be fired; others who have left are not being replaced,” Hiatt wrote in his email to faculty. “We continue to see respected friends and colleagues depart with no hope of replacing them.”
Solomon, on the other hand, credits the Cline administration with celebratory results in financial management. “In addition to Standard and Poor’s upgrading [of] the University’s credit rating in April, LIU is part of a group of only three percent of private universities that have received a positive financial outlook,” she said.
“College affordability has become a national conversation,” Solomon said, “and the University has proudly committed to keeping tuition increases at or below 2 percent per year until 2020.” She compared her numbers with an average 3.7 percent tuition increase for private institutions across the country in 2014-2015.
Solomon admits, however, that maintaining this commitment requires the university to balance faculty contribution to the school, and its dedication to budgetary control to serve its students.
“I think what happens with LIU Brooklyn will tell us a lot about what happens to higher education going forward,” Drabinski said. “Is it true that it really doesn’t matter who you have in the classroom?
Do accrediting bodies that are charged with ensuring the quality of education at higher education institutions take that mission seriously? Do they see teaching and learning as a part of that quality? Is higher education about anything other than budget lines and credit ratings?”
Negotiations between LIU administrators and the Brooklyn faculty union resumed on Monday, Sept. 12, and both parties have expressed willingness to find common terms, sooner rather than later. “Faculty really want to be back in the classroom,” Dubinski said. “We are hopeful that we’ll be back in our classrooms with our [students] soon.
We want to teach the students at LIU Brooklyn.”

The class of 2020 was introduced to its first collegiate semester on Sept. 7 with new professors, class structures, peers, and personal adjustments.
In years past, incoming students took part in an orientation cycle for two days dur- ing the summer. This year, students were able to move into their dormitory on Aug. 30, and participate in a three-day orientation from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2. Those who will not be living on campus were invited to attend orientation, as well.
Considering the unfamiliar environment that will now be home to half of nearly 550 incoming freshmen, the challenges of living on their own may bring some fears. Kaitlyn Jones, originally from Queens, NY, now living on campus, shared her fear of not passing all of her classes. As a new member of the all-season track team, her first days on campus have been dedicated to getting herself ready to begin training.
“A challenge as a new student and athlete would be having to focus 100 times more on time management between classes, a job and the sport,” Jones said.
The remaining 50 percent of freshman students that will be commuting to campus are also going to have new scheduling accommodations that will take some getting used to. Freshman dance major Johnnier Fenner will be commuting from Huntington this semester.
“My fears are not being able to make a certain class or not being able to make events with friends,” Fenner said. One of her greatest fears is missing out on opportunities and the “full college experience” that residing on campus may provide.
There are many clubs and organiza- tions for freshmen to get involved with on campus. An Involvement Fair was held in Hillwood at 12:30, on Sept. 8, to introduce new students to the clubs. 21 organizations lined up the front entrance of Hillwood, including clubs, Greek life, and athletic teams.
There are other ways to become involved on campus without joining a club right away. Students can attend as many Campus Life events as possible! Events are advertised in each academic and residential building while the concierge desk in Hillwood offers a list of events. For a weekly events list, students are emailed a day-by-day schedule of on and off campus events via their my.liu.edu account.

Post opened up its doors on Tuesday, Sept. 6, to 1,000 freshmen and returning students who will be dorming on campus for the coming year, according to Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life.
“Kings Hall and Queens Hall serve as the first-year residence halls,” Berthel said. “Post Hall serves as Honors College housing and South Residence Complex is home to Greek Housing and 21+ housing.”
The move-in process this year was spread over a week to allow residence assistants to get trained and prepare for the coming semester, according to Tim O’Connell, a junior biology major, who is one of the resident assistants in Riggs Hall. This is O’Connell’s first year as an RA, and as a result, he had to move in on Aug. 20 for Campus Life staff training, held from Aug. 21 – Aug. 31.
“As an RA, it’s my job to check people in, make sure their finances are in order, and help them adjust to residence life,” O’Connell said. He doesn’t know the total number of resident assistants, but stated that the number of RAs per building is based off of the building’s population. This semester, Riggs Hall, Post Hall, Brookville Hall, South Residence Complex, Queens Hall, and Kings Hall are open while Nassau Hall and Suffolk Hall are closed.
On Sept. 6, most parking lots were full as parents helped their kids move into their new home for the coming year. Along with cars, some students used U-Hauls and other trucks to transport their items to the residence halls around campus. While most students carried one or two suitcases, others opted to use carts provided by Post to transport their belongings.
After an orientation session in the Hillwood Lecture Hall on Sept. 6, students were separated into different parts of Hillwood Commons, the Fishbowl, Lecture Hall, and the cinema. There, the students were given briefings on their MyLIU accounts, Greek Life, an overview of campus programs, and campus and commuter life. The Orientation Leaders and RAs gave campus tours to the freshmen and their families to finish the day.
Ben Brinton, a senior double-major in political science and musical theater from Nashville, Tennessee, also moved into his dorm on Aug. 20, as an RA and orientation leader. Since he has been dorming for four years, Brinton always packs a few special items in his suitcases. “Some out of the ordinary items I bring with me every year are a water jug, Playstation 4, and a fridge for leftover food.”
Freshmen Brenden Murray traveled all the way from Portland, Oregon to attend Post. “I decided to attend Post because I wanted to major in musical theater and I know that the school has a great program,” he said. “Another big factor in coming here was that Post is a short drive away from Manhattan, which you can’t beat.”
One special item Murray brought with him this year was his hair dryer because he “has to keep his hair up to standards.” During this first semester, Murray just wants to “gain a lot of experience in theater and have fun.”
Carlos Abreau, a senior marketing major and an office assistant at Campus Life, said that this year’s move-in was better than other years. “It helps that the RAs get to move in first to help the other students and it makes the campus less crowded when the freshmen and returning students move-in,” he said. Abreau believes that the move-in process can be even further improved in the future. “One improvement that can be made is if there are separate days for the freshmen and the returning students to move in, since it would make the process less hectic. I also think there should have been an earlier day for returning students to move in while the freshmen could move in last.”

Many changes were made on campus before the start of the fall semester. The Barnes and Noble bookstore, which was previously located next to Pell Hall, has been moved to the Steinberg Museum location on the second floor of Hillwood Commons.
The Museum has moved to the Hutchins Gallery in the lower level of the library. The bookstore was closed from Aug. 13-20, and reopened for business on Aug. 22.
“This was a joint decision between the University and Barnes and Noble,” said Jorge Lanas, the Barnes and Noble bookstore manager. “It was done to put all the campus shops in one place.”
Abagail Van Vlerah, dean of students, concurred. “Hillwood Commons serves as the central location of the university; it brings together all members of the community and student life. It provides various student services and serves as a comfortable place for students to meet, organize and attend a variety of events,” she said.
Lanas hopes the new location will be more convenient for students to shop. “We hope this change in location will drive more sales and create a more student friendly atmosphere,” he said.
According to Van Verlah, the former bookstore location will now be home to administrative offices for the Alumni Relations and Career Services teams.
According to the LIU website, the Employer and Alumni Relations building is located in the Winnick house. Employer Relations will assist in creating greater career success experience for current students and alumni, Van Vlerah said.
“By allowing the Alumni Relations and Career Services team to work together in one location, we can further ensure success at landing an internship, full-time employment, and/or placement in the right graduate school program,” Van Vlerah said.
The Steinberg Museum, formerly known as the Hillwood Art Museum, which was built to be an exhibition space for professional artists, had been in Hillwood Commons since 1972.
Although the Hutchins Gallery is currently vacant due to an exhibition that was cancelled, it will remain open until Oct. 31. After the last exhibition in October the Hutchins Gallery will be closing permanently. The Hutchins Gallery features more local and community based exhibitions whereas the Steinberg Museum features more scholarly exhibitions.
The Steinberg Museum is temporarily closed until the last exhibition at the Gallery comes to a close on Oct. 31 and the renovations to the space will begin in November.
Barbara Applegate, the director of the Steinberg Museum, hopes that they will be able to open the Steinberg Museum for the spring semester in January. The exhibitions that were planned at the Steinberg Museum for all future semesters have been canceled.
According to Applegate, the exhibition space would be comprised of the current Hutchins Galley with changes to make it a space more in line with best practices for museums, such as, enclosure of the portico facing 25A, improvements to the wall coverings and ceiling coverings, new lighting, and other modifications.
The art department will continue to use the Hutchins Gallery while it remains open, and will then have to occupy other spaces while this renovation takes place. The department used the gallery for students to take a look at exhibitions and study the art.
The Steinberg Museum has a collection of about 5,000 pieces of artwork, including African Sculpture, and various types of pottery. The storage, located in Hillwood Commons now consists of large metal cabinets with locks on them, but will soon be transformed into a glass viewing room.
To showcase this artwork, the visible storage area will be attached via a shared entranceway from the north side. It will be comprised of the book stacks on the west side of the building. There will also be aesthetic and security upgrades.
The librarians will begin the process of sifting through the books to decide what must be kept, a process that will take some time. Some of the books will be moved into storage, while others will be donated.
While the Steinberg Museum hopes to reopen in January, students can expect that the visible showcasing will not be completed for at least a year.
“Using the stack levels in this way will enhance the museum and it will also enhance our prestige on Long Island. We have a great art school here and to give our students more access to objects would be fantastic. Being able to do this is really a big deal,” Applegate said.

It’s election season again and, unless you have been living under a rock, you have most definitely absorbed some amount of news regarding this seemingly unprecedented presidential election. News outlets covering this presidential election have been slinging stories left and right, so how is one to disseminate which news stories are credible and unbiased?
Media bias is prevalent in our society, especially in the world of politics. In politics, you are typically either on one side or another. The same goes for journalism outlets; this is called partisanship.
“There is no doubt about media bias, but today we have it from both the left and the right, eg. MSNBC vs. FOX,” said Michael Soupios, a professor in the department of political science. “This is what happens when a culture allows its standard of truth to become thin and watery.”
Traditionally, certain media outlets have been pegged as solidly Democrat or Republican. For example MSNBC, BuzzFeed and The New York Times have typically leaned left (liberal). Media outlets such as FOX News, Breitbart and the Wall Street Journal have consistently leaned right (conservative).
So how is a college student to figure out where to get unbiased, credible and non-partisan news? There is no easy answer.
Chris O’Connell, a sophomore film major, believes “to stay informed, it is our duty to assess news from as many outlets as possible and draw our own conclusions.” The responsibility lies in each individual’s own lap; if you want the truth you need to seek it.
This is where things get tiring. It’s hard to stay motivated in this daily hunt for the news, and most of us get fed up with the media altogether.
“I strongly [dislike] the media when it comes to political coverage,” said Dylan Silva, a junior business administration major. “I feel the media doesn’t do its job because all they do is rip on the political candidates vs. sharing what the candidate supports.”
What’s one example of media bias in this presidential election? A prime example is when Donald Trump picked his Vice-Presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, to join his ticket; MSNBC televised panels critiquing Pence, while Fox News showed Pence’s first rally.
In this example both outlets are covering the news, however in different fashions. MSNBC, the traditionally left-leaning outlet, is being critical of Pence while Fox, the traditionally right-leaning outlet, is depicting the celebration of this event.
Despite how minor examples of media bias may be, they certainly have wide-ranging effect. One of the most well known effects is the increasingly low trust rating of the media. A 2016 Associated Press poll found that a meager six percent of Americans polled in fact trust the media.
“Media bias; It’s not fair,” said Jesse Agbotse, a senior health science major. “In a capitalist economy like ours, there will be media conglomerates that will seek to take advantage of the opportunity to influence the population.”
Clearly, you may be thinking twice about the presidential election stories you have heard as of late, so let’s recap. First off, you should always assume that partisanship is everywhere, so be aware that all outlets are capable of pushing some sort of agenda. Secondly, checking multiple outlets and sources is a smart move; if two or three outlets are reporting the same story in the same fashion, chances are high that it’s less biased. And lastly, you should know that it’s okay to not trust the media—most clearly don’t!

When students returned for the fall semester, they were greeted by changes on campus, including new walkways, plazas, smart classrooms, and a new location for the bookstore.
Post Information sent out an email on Aug. 9, informing the community that construction would begin on the campus pathways.
“We are working towards beautifying the lawn and plaza areas between the Great Lawn, Humanities and Hillwood,” the email stated. “The library main entrance and east side entrance will also be affected. Pardon our appearance during this process and please use alternate routes and building entrances as needed. Thank you for your assistance and we look forward to the new look.”
Representatives from the facilities department did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the construction project.
But John Lutz, chairperson of the English department, said, “Buildings and grounds need regular renovation in order to keep the infrastructure from deteriorating. I believe that the work of creating smart classrooms in Humanities Hall has also been completed, and this will enhance the learning environment. Students need a safe and pleasant environment in which to learn.”
Some students, however, aren’t too happy about the school’s current appearance, especially around the Great Lawn. “The lawn looks so dead right now,” said Carly Franqui, a junior criminal justice major. “I mean the new pathways are cool and all, but I miss the beautiful green grass. Now, I basically have to walk through the dust and dirt when I cut across the lawn. It’s nasty.”
Katriel Kelly, a freshman psychology major was on campus during the construction while attending a five-week summer session for the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP), a platform dedicated to help educationally underprepared and financially disadvantaged students attend college.
“I was extremely annoyed at all the construction going on around campus,” Kelly said. “As an incoming freshman, that wasn’t the type of view I wanted to see my first time being at this college. During the program we had to do a detour through the mud to get around the construction and get to class in Pell and Khan.”
Lutz, though, was not concerned about the construction. “I wasn’t particularly disturbed by the construction,” he said. “Summer is the most sensible time to do this kind of work since most classes are not in session.”
Many students seem excited about the improved campus appearance. Corry-Ann Cadet, a junior education major, said, “Finally they fixed this place up. “I cannot tell you how many times I have tripped over the messed up walkways at this school. I am so happy that I can actually walk on smooth pavement.”
Cadet added, “Post is on a roll right now; I hope they don’t slow down. Next up, create more parking spaces!”

Debbie De Louise, a former editor of the Pioneer, is an author and a reference librarian at the Hicksville Library. Her previous books include “Cloudy Rainbow,” and “A Stone’s Throw.” Her new book, “Between
a Rock and a Hard Place,” is a sequel to “A Stone’s Throw” and will be releasing this fall.
De Louise is a graduate of Post and wrote for the Pioneer. Besides being an author, she has also written articles for Cats Magazine and Catnip. De Louise described the differences between writing articles for a magazine and writing a book.
“Articles are much shorter, of course, but they still entail research. Besides the feature articles I wrote at Post, I’ve also written articles for pet magazines and recently won an award from Hartz Corporation for my article on cat grooming.”
De Louise added, “writing a novel is more of a creative process than article writing because, although you include facts in a book, you have more flexibility as far as using your imagination. However, good articles, especially features, should include some creativity. Many article topics can also be turned into books and vice versa.”
In both of De Louise’s first two books, Post is either included in the story or mentioned as part of a character’s back-story. In “A Stone’s Throw,” De Louise had the main character attend Post for college and also included scenes in Brookville. De Louise explained how she paid tribute to her former school in “A Cloudy Rainbow.”
“I did not originally intend to include Post, but it turned out that way.
In my first book, “Cloudy Rainbow,” I focused on the themes of bereavement and pet loss, but I ended up taking the main character back in time to her college days and, of course, since the Pioneer and Post were such large parts of mine, I included them. I fictionalized the characters and scenes, but some of the facts were true. For instance, we often ate Fireside food on production nights, and although computers were around at that time, layout was done manually back in the late 80s.”
De Louise also feels that most there has been a change in the journalism process from when she attended Post in the 1980s to now. “There’s been a big switch from news appearing in print to that now available online and through other media. I would say most people want their news 24/7 in the fastest and most convenient way. Social Media including Facebook and Twitter are big purveyors of news today. The number of news magazines and print newspapers are declining. However, the ones that still exist usually also have an online component.”
In this age of social media, journalism majors face new challenges and have to adapt to the changing times. “I would imagine that today’s journalism students would have to be able to scoop news quicker and stay up-to-date on social media channels. They have to be aware that some news stories reported online are not always accurate, so they need to check the reliability of their sources,” De Louise said.

Say hello to the innovative mindset that is being brought to LIU’s Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, under the direction of the new Executive Director, William “Bill” Biddle.
Biddle, who joined the Tilles Center on Jan. 4 of this year, has brought a “new spark of creative energy to the Tilles Center” said Sharon Maier-Kennelly, the Tilles Center’s general manager and director of programming initiatives.
Biddle moved to New York from Virginia and began his career at Post after Elliott Sroka, the Tilles Center’s former executive director, retired in July 2015 after 29 years.
In his short tenure so far, Biddle has already brought helpful improvements to the center, such as the addition of new dressing rooms for the performers. The upgrade and renovation of the dressing rooms has been Biddle’s biggest project so far. His devotion to expand the demographic of the audience has also led to more success in the audience’s turnout.
“[Biddle has a] commitment to the community engagement… meeting people at their churches, clubs, [etc],” said Susanna Stickley, director of marketing and communications.
Expanding the demographic is important to Biddle because the demographic of people who attend Tilles Center productions is constantly changing. He feels it is important to look at the programming that they have and make sure that it matches the changing demographics on Long Island. Classical music is a staple for the Tilles Center, but Biddle is devoted to expanding the Center’s involvement with contemporary music, thus expanding the age demographic of people who attend Tilles Center events. Classical music will remain a staple at the Tilles Center even with the new involvement of contemporary music.
Traveling music has also been put into plan. This is the idea of incorporating national Broadway tours, only furthering the reach the Tilles Center can have. Biddle also wants to have more interaction with other departments on campus. The Tilles Center has put a focus on working with departments in the arts and communications programs. Master classes can assist with the collaboration between departments, as well
as free tickets that are offered to students if a professor is teaching work related to the show. The Tilles Center also tries its best to provide speakers that can coincide with classes that are being offered at the university. Master classes, which are classes for students that are taught by professionals, are now also being offered through the Tilles Center in a new supported program called “vocalocity.” The Tilles Center introduced the new musical phenomenon “acapella” to the campus with the assistance of Deke Sharon, the musical director and arranger for the film Pitch Per- fect. Acapella is a popular form of music, which involves the use of only voices as instruments. Vocalocity will have a one-time performance on Jan. 20, 2017.
In addition to the master classes, Post is re-introducing the four-part “Speaker Series” which “haven’t been done [at] Post in seven or eight years,” according to Maier-Kennelly. The “Speaker Series” will broaden the demographic of the audience who attend shows. The series is open to both Post students and the general public.
Upcoming speakers in the 2016-2017 season include Linda Ronstadt (singer), Billie Jean King (former professional tennis player), Neil Degrasse Tyson (astrophysicist), and General Colin Powell (former US Secretary of State). The speakers will discuss their lives and experiences and educate the audience about who they are and what they are passionate about. These speakers were chosen because of their reputation and appeal to the public’s wide demographic.
In addition to programming for adults, “We have a big children’s program for both families and for education [purposes],” said Stephanie Turner, the director of arts education. “The arts education program serves over 10,000 students per year [by showing] performances that happen [while the students are] on a field trip… we also go into [the students’] schools. We take dancers, actors, and musicians into schools all over Long Island.” Next year, this program will serve 18 schools on Long Island in 10 different school districts.
The Tilles Center also plans community programs where “a dancer will be sent from a company to a senior citizen center or a local dance school,” Turner said. These dancers work alongside community members and put on a show at the end of the program. These programs have been around since the Tilles Center opened and they continue to be valued in the Center’s overall mission. That mission is “to have a broad reach with all of the local population,” according to Turner.
The Parson’s Dance Company, a New York City-based modern dance company specializing in contemporary dance will be teaming up with the Tilles Center to work with autistic children. This one-time performance will take place on Jan. 28, 2017.
One of the strong aspects of our mission is [for the Tilles Center to be at] the highest level of professional performing arts. Ensembles that you would see in Lincoln Center, or London, or Amsterdam, or you might see in China or Japan all do come through here,” said Susanna Stickley, director of marketing and communications. “So we do really try to be global and bring artists in from every continent, except Antarctica and that’s only because penguins don’t travel,” she added, with a chuckle.

After a four-year absence, the Long Island Fringe Festival returns to the Tilles Center on Saturday, Sept. 17, at 7 p.m. “The purpose of the Long Island Fringe Festival is to honor traditional fringe and to provide a showcase for all forms of creativity,” according to Debra-Ann Kasimakis, one of the producers of the Long Island Fringe Festival. “We celebrate the arts in every form: dance, music, visual arts, film, poetry, and comedy. Being the Long Island Fringe, we concentrate on the many talented people who live on this island of ours.”
When asked about the background of the festival, Kasimakis said, “we are following in the footsteps of the original Fringe Festival which started after World War Two in Edinburgh, Scotland. They held a theater festival to lift the spirits of the people following the war. So many performers arrived that all the theaters were full. Performers set up everywhere around the fringe, hence, the name. It continues in Edinburgh and other places around the world to this day, and of course here on Long Island.” This year, the festival will be hosted by Stevie GB, and will feature performances by Fran Capo, the “World’s Fastest Talking Woman”; Frank The Bald Guy from the band “For the Kill”; poet and musician Jay Jii; and dance groups from the North and South Shores.
“I know Bob and Deb Goida [the coordinators of the festival] from a show I did five years ago about Groucho Marx, the iconic comedian,” Stevie GB said. “They loved my portrayal and asked me to be in their Fringe Festival in 2011. They have followed my stand up career over the years and asked if I would host this year. I graciously accepted.”
Stevie GB is also known as the “World’s Funniest Accountant” because he was an accountant before going into stand-up. “When I started doing stand-up comedy, I was looking for a catchy persona. A guy I worked with suggested ‘Long Island’s Funniest Accountant’…But I was reaching for greater heights and went with World’s Funniest Accountant,” he explained.
One of the performances at the festival will be a poetry set by Jay Jii, who will perform a “Poetic Cabaret.” “I like to deliver the poems in way that is very theatrical and includes music, masks, illusions, sound effects, and a few other surprises as well. For Fringe, I’ll be doing a mix of some of my own poems and a few classics,” she said. Jii has known the coordinators of the festival, Bob and Deb Goida, for many years and met them while they were putting on a show called “Artmosphere.” Since working on that show, Jii has partnered with the Goidas on several projects involving the Tilles Center, including this year’s festival.
Kasimakis explained why the Tilles Center was once again chosen to hold this year’s festival. “Tilles Center and the Post campus was the home of the Fringe Festival for the first three years. There are few places that can accommodate a three-day festival that needed multiple performance spaces. The campus welcomed us into the Little Theater, Recital Hall, Cinema, and the stage at Tilles to show off our local talent pool. This year we are happy to bring this back to the Tilles Center for a one night version,” Kasimakis said.
She added, “we will present two great Long Island comedians, Stevie GB, the ‘World’s Funniest Accountant’ and Fran Capo, the ‘World’s Fastest Talking Woman,’ a rare acoustic set by For The Kill’s lead guitarist Frank the Bald Guy, a new show by performance poet Jay Jii, Dance Visions NY will perform their work ‘Rejuvenation’ and we will have a tribute to the recently passed Maxwell Corydon Wheat Jr., the first Poet Laureate of Nassau County.
Kasimakis said there will be pre-show events at 5 pm in the Tilles Atri- um “where you can view the Unlimited D8A art exhibit in the Patrons Lounge, enjoy music by Jeanne Marie Boes, pop up poetry readings, vendors with specialty spice blends by Sabba’s Spicery, handmade crayons, brain games, interact with local animal rescue groups and bring a food donation for RockCanRoll.”
Tickets for the Long Island Fringe Festival can be purchased at ticketmaster.com for $15 each and are free to all Post students.

A game that was supposed to be affected heavily by hurricane-like conditions, ended up as a gem for the Pioneers (2-0) as they held off the Virginia Union Panthers in a 14-12 victory to kick off the 2016 campaign on Saturday, Sept. 3, at Hovey Field in Richmond, VA.
The poor field conditions came into play immediately as Panthers senior quarterback Shawheem Dowdy lost a snap near his own end-zone where he was sacked by red-shirt senior defensive end Kenny Scotland for a safety.
After jumping in front 6-5, the Panthers yet again were pinned deep in their own end-zone where sophomore punter Russell Balance had his punt blocked by senior linebacker Nate Feliz, resulting in another safety, giving the Green and Gold a 7-6 advantage.
With time winding down in the first half, the Pioneers scored their lone touchdown of the game as senior quarterback Jeff Kidd connected with red-shirt junior wide receiver James Higgins from 14 yards out with just 29 ticks remaining until halftime.
Defensively, the Pioneers continued to limit the Panthers offense as the Pioneers 14-6 lead stood strong late into the fourth quarter. Dowdy finally led his offense down to the Pioneers 12-yard line until he was picked off by senior defensive back Jared Chester, keeping Virginia Union off the scoreboard. After missing all but two games last year, Chester led the Pioneers veteran secondary with two interceptions, seven tackles and three pass break-ups. True freshman cornerback Joshua Flowers also came up clutch late, picking off Dowdy.
However, the Panthers redeemed themselves as they rallied down the field for a late touchdown in the final two minutes as Dowdy delivered a 2-yard strike to receiver Jusse Yorke, making it a 14-12 game. On the next play, the Pioneers defense stopped the two- point conversion followed by the onside kick which was recovered by red-shirt senior linebacker Justin Ortiz to secure the upset.
Weather definitely limited the Pioneers offense as Kidd finished just 13-of-33 for 106 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Senior running back David White racked up 73 yards on 16 carries. Red-shirt senior wide-out Shane Hubbard, who was held without a catch in the first half, caught four balls for 28 yards.
Feliz led the defense with 11 tackles as red-shirt junior defensive lineman Jess Agbotse has 10 stops. Sophomore linebacker Connor Farrell chipped in with eight tackles.
Following a very solid performance against the Panthers, the Pioneers looked even better when they took care of business against the University of New Haven by a score of 43-20, to flip open their NE-10 schedule on Saturday, Sept. 10, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
The Pioneers accomplished their goal of getting revenge after New Haven ended their NE-10 championship hopes last season with a decisive 63-16 victory over the Green and Gold.
Kidd had a bounce-back game, racking up yards through the air and completing 31-of-36 passes with four touchdowns. He unplugged his tool box this game, spreading the ball around nicely to all of his receivers as Hubbard led the Pioneers with 10 catches for 87 yards and one touchdown. In addition to his gaining 46 yards on the ground, Pierre did damage on the receiving end as he caught six passes for 65 yards and a score. Ward continued to display his explosiveness, catching six balls for 61 yards and racking up some nice return yards. Higgins also played well on a bum ankle, making four receptions for 49 yards and two scores.
On the ground, the Pioneers continued to confuse the defense with their three-headed attack, highlighted by White who totaled 11 carries for 59 yards and one touchdown. After some ball security issues last week, Pierre rushed 12 times for 46 yards. Kidd also chipped in on the ground with 11 carries for 33 yards and one touch- down.
Defensively, the Pioneers were without their signal-caller Feliz due to an injury, but had other players step up in his place. Agbotse led the Pioneers with eight tackles. Petit-Frere provided good energy recording three tackles and a sack as red-shirt senior defensive end Kenny Scotland and junior linebacker Kmani Odrick chipped in with four tackles and half a sack each.
Looking ahead, Head Coach Bryan Collins and his Pioneer squad return to the field Saturday, Sept.17, as they take on NE-10 rival, Stonehill College up in Easton, MA. Kickoff is slated for 6 p.m. The game can be listened to on 88.1 FM and WCWP.ORG.

After winning a pair of matches by a score of 2-1 to open the season, the Pioneers took the field in Bridgeport, Conn. to play Merrimack College on Thursday, Sept. 8. The No. 8 ranked Pioneers toppled the No. 15 ranked Warriors by a score of 5-0.
The star of the game was no other than senior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom, who made five saves and picked up the victory, his first shutout of the young season. After a half hour of no scoring, the Pioneers broke the stalemate with goal by sophomore forward Charlie Ledula.
For the rest of the first half, both of- fenses were held in check.
In the second half, however, the Pioneers erupted for four goals. Tallies by senior mid- fielder Alex Hailes, graduate midfielder Alex Billington, senior forward Jason Lampkin and junior midfielder Harry Pearse put the match out of reach and into the winning column for the Green and Gold.
The Pioneers returned to the pitch on Saturday, Sept. 10, to take on Dominican College in their finale of the tournament in Conn. The Pioneers handed the Chargers a 7-0 loss.
The Pioneers started their assault early on, getting on the board in the eighth minute. Ledula put the Pioneers up 1-0 and they never looked back after that. For the remainder of the first half, the Pioneers got help on the offensive side of the ball from Erik Berthagen and Johan Mauritzson.
In the final 45 minutes, the key con- tributor was Harry Pearse who netted two goals in a ten-minute span to further pad the Pioneer lead to 5-0. Two more goals between minutes 80 and 90 put an icing on the Green and Gold cake for a 7-0 win.
The Pioneers return to the field Wednesday, Sept. 14, when they play Post University. The Pioneers will look to keep the right side of their ledger clean. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.

Just like their male coun- terparts, the Pioneers secured back-to-back victories to open up the 2016 campaign. After winning 3-0 against Southern New Hampshire University and 2-1 over American International College, the Pioneers got off to the hot start they hoped for.
The team looked to continue that against Southern Connecticut State University on Wednesday, Sept. 7, in its home opener in Pioneer Country. Unfortunately for the Green and Gold, they would have to settle for a 1-1 draw.
The No. 21 ranked Pioneers didn’t lack firepower in any sense of the word, constantly on the offensive and outshooting the Owls 24-11. Although they didn’t have many shots, the Owls made one of them count early in the match, giving them a one-goal lead and putting some early pressure on the Pioneers.
After a scoreless first half, the Pioneers had plenty of scoring chances, but only cashed in on one of them. After a slew of shots on goal, the Pioneers broke through with junior midfielder Klara Berggren who scored the equalizing goal. The overtime sessions saw shots, but none that found the back of either net.
In their weekend matchup against Stonehill College on
Saturday, Sept. 10, the Pioneers fell by a score of 1-0. Although the Pioneers outshot the undefeated Skyhawks 10-9, they were unable to find the back of the net. The lone point of the match came in the 36th minute via Lydia Beiter.
The Pioneers return to the field Wednesday, Sept. 14, when they face No. 4 ranked University of Bridgeport from the Pioneer Soccer Park.

In the heat of summer while most students were off campus, the athletics department rolled in a brand new turf field directly next to the Pratt Recreation Center. The field was installed in June and is ready for all fall sport practices and games.
“We are really excited to have a new facility for everyone on campus,” said Lloyd Donald Robner, assistant athletic director. Robner added that the new field will benefit the football, field hockey and lacrosse teams, among others.
“The average life of turf is anywhere from 8-10 years and it needed to be replaced,” said Bryan Collins, director of athletics. The turf being replaced was ten years old.
“The old [turf] didn’t really work since I had a knee injury. Things like my hip, and quad as well have caused me to step off the field for a while,” said Jason Lampkin, men’s soccer forward. When asked if the new turf can cut down or limit the risk of injury, Collins said, “There is no evidence of injuries occurring on turf.”
One thing that is vastly different from this playing surface as opposed to the previous one, is the installation of a shock pad underneath the turf. According to Collins, the pad provides a surface that may assist concussion prevention. In addition to the possibility of preventing head injuries, the shock pad also increases the playability and safety of the turf and will keep it at a top level for a longer period of time.
Junior attacker of the women’s lacrosse team Connor Bird applauded the job the athletic department did with the installation, saying, “It took less than a month to construct.” She agreed with Lampkin about the old field, however, noting that it was overused and had “patches that caused harm to players and still had the C.W. Post sign on it.”
Bird’s teammate, junior defender Cara Douglas, added that the colors are different and “underneath the field has impact cushions for our shins.”
Collins would not specify the exact cost of the process of removing the old turf and replacing it with the new one, but he did add that replacing turf field is much less expensive than installing new turf due to the fact that drainage is already in place.
The 2016 fall sports teams will be the firsts to experience the new turf field. The football team, led by Collins, will get to christen the new field on Saturday, Sept. 10, when they host the University of New Haven at 1 p.m.
