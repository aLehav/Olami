After the women’s soccer team’s first Division I season came to an end, so did the tenure of their head coach, Eleri Earnshaw. Earnshaw, who was head coach for the Blackbirds since February 2017 prior to the athletic department merger, was dismissed from her position on November 11 effective immediately. 
Members of the soccer team received an email from Athletic Director William Martinov via his administrative assistant Debra Roselle at 3:25 p.m. on November 11. The email notified the players of a mandatory meeting to be held that day at 4:30 p.m. at the Gold Coast Cinema in Hillwood Commons.
When the student athletes arrived at the meeting, they were met with Martinov and Deputy Director of Athletics, Lloyd Ribner. According to several athletes, Martinov and Ribner announced that Earnshaw had been laid off effective immediately. 
The athletes were told there were “multiple reasons” for Earnshaw’s dismissal and that a national search is being conducted for a new head coach, which they hope to find by the start of the spring semester. 
Earnshaw’s coach profile was removed from the athletics website, liuathletics.com. The page now reads “to be determined.”
The Pioneer reached out to the athletic department’s director of athletic media relations, Casey Schermick, on Friday, Nov. 22 to request an interview with Martinov. Schermick forwarded the request to Martinov, but no response was given. 
A follow up to the request was made on Tuesday, Nov. 26, and Schermick asked for a list of questions via email, though he said matters of personnel would not be discussed. The Pioneer then offered to conduct a phone interview regarding the new leadership direction, but was denied. 
A final follow up was made on Monday, Dec. 2, and Schermick informed the Pioneer that there were new media policies from the administration and that they wouldn’t be able to give a response by the deadline. Schermick could not provide the new policies in writing when asked.
The Pioneer also reached out to Earnshaw on two occasions from December 2 to December 3, but did not receive a response. The story is ongoing.

The football team wrapped up their first season as a Division I program with a 10-24 loss against Merrimack College on Saturday, Nov. 23. 
The Merrimack Warriors, who also played in Division II last year, came into the game looking to avoid their fifth consecutive loss while the Sharks looked to avoid a winless season. 
The Warriors scored first. Towards the end of the first quarter, with a 7-yard pass, they took the lead. Their kicker Corey Resnedes converted on a 36-yard field goal to extend the Warriors lead to 0-10. At the end of the second quarter, Merrimack scored another touchdown on a long drive and the Sharks left the field at halftime, down 0-17.
Halfway through the third quarter, Head Coach Bryan Collins subbed out quarterback Jacob Cheshire and brought in freshman Camden Orth. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Orth found Jake Bofshever for a 32-yard touchdown completion. On their next drive, Sharks’ kicker Briant DeFelice knocked through the 38-yard field goal, cutting Merrimack’s lead to seven points. 
But the Sharks did not manage to get any closer. Instead, the Warriors extended their lead by scoring a touchdown with just over 5 minutes left on the clock, making the final score 10-24.
Despite finishing their first Division I season with an 0-10 record, Coach Collins sees the positive aspects with his team’s performance. He thinks they played multiple competitive games during the season and that his younger players were impressive. “We had many freshmen that came in and competed against top players in the conference,” he said.  
The end of the season also marks the end of some players collegiate careers. Coach Collins said he will miss his talented senior class, a class who contributed to both the Pioneer and Sharks programs. “They had two undefeated seasons, two championships and appeared in the NCAA Playoffs twice [as Pioneers]. They also ushered us into the Division I world,” he said. “I am grateful for having them in our program.”
One player from the senior class, business graduate student Abel Joseph, is thankful for his college experience at Post. Joseph said he made life-long friendships, learned to take responsibility to always put the team before himself. “This has been the best five years of my life,” he said. 
Looking forward, Coach Collins is optimistic about the future and plans to continue to build on the positives and eliminate the negatives for next season. 
To be able to compete with the other conference teams in following years, Coach Collins said they will keep bringing in quality student-athletes, keep supporting them with strength and conditioning programs and add depth to the roster. 
“Entering a new level of football and a new conference is a process,” he said. “But we believe in building this Division I team.”

A reception was held in the SAL Gallery to showcase Pauline Senemetis’ MA thesis titled “Eye Contact” on Wednesday, Nov. 20. Senemetis is a graduate student obtaining her MA in art photography in the fall 2019 semester.
The photos lined along the walls captured the moments of a conversation with people who are special to Senemetis. The top portion of each person’s face wasn’t pictured, a strategy she purposefully designed. “I found that I responded more and more to the images that were not complete and went on to shoot with less restrictions,” Senemetis said.
The overall theme focused on the intimacy of a conversation in the absence of electronics and technology. “[It’s] breaking bread across the table with people that are important to you in your life and not having phones or anything that will interrupt your conversation,” Senemetis said. “That doesn’t happen too often anymore. Those meals are the ones where you have the best conservations, and they happen few and far between.”
Sememetis’ intention was noticed by a few others who attended the reception as well, including Florence Kadri, a coworker of Senemetis. “The part where we’re not seeing the full head or the eyes, it doesn’t take away, it actually pulls you in more,” Kadri said. “You feel the intimacy of the moment. You feel like you’re there on the table.”
Jodi Bernstein, a friend of Senemetis, agreed with Kadri. “Just the fact that people are communicating face to face without electronics. [It feels] very warm and intimate.”
Bernstein found particular joy in the piece depicting Sebenetis’s mother. “The one of her mom [is my favorite]. I think that speaks the loudest as far as people communicating with each other,” she said. 
Kadri, on the other hand, found a favorite in another piece. “I love the colors and the hands of photo number four. [It’s] so in the moment, the cup, the shirt, it’s just a beautiful composition,” Kadri said.
The composition of each piece varies from one photo to the other, but the underlying message remains the same: it’s important to value the conversations one has with another person without the pressure and presence of technology. 
“In this time of fast food, drive-throughs, over scheduled agendas and cell phone notifications, I find sitting around a table breaking bread with friends and family in the absence of electronic devices is where real connections are made, problems are solved, deep discussions are had, worries are settled, ideas are exchanged, deep belly laughs prevail, and healing of the soul occurs,” Senemetis said.

 It’s that time of the year again, a time where family, friends and loved ones come together to celebrate the holidays. What better way to ring in the holiday season then by witnessing the lighting of the Rockefeller Christmas tree.
On Wednesday, Dec. 4, the 77-foot Norway spruce will be lit for the first time this year. Located at 45 Rockefeller Plaza, the tree will continue spreading holiday cheer until Jan. 17, 2020 when it will be donated to Habitat for Humanity for use as lumber.
The annual event got its start in 1931, during the height of the Great Depression. Demolition workers at the Rockefeller Center construction site put their money together in order to buy a small Christmas tree. Two years later Rockefeller Center decided to put up their own tree, officially beginning the Christmas tradition.
Students are excited to be able to experience the tree lighting in person. 
“I am very excited to see the tree ceremony, I’ve never seen it in person because it’s always so crowded,” junior mathematics major, Charlotte Beshers, said. “I feel like it’s become a staple of American culture to see the lighting ceremony.”
Some students, such as sophomore game design major Matthew Lanza, feel that the lighting ceremony marks the beginning of the holiday season. “For me the lighting of the tree means that we can start celebrating Christmas properly, I always find it crazy how some people just try to start celebrating it as soon as possible,” he said.
The tree isn’t the only thing to get excited about. Some students are looking forward to see how the city changes for the holidays as well. “The city really captures the Christmas spirit with all the lights, it’s just so much fun to see how much the city changes during the season,” senior psychology major, Maddie Titus, said. 
The tree lighting ceremony will also be broadcast on NBC on Wednesday, Dec. 4 at 8 p.m. for anyone who wants to experience the event without being there in person

 It’s no secret that being a college student is stressful. Exams, homework and extracurriculars can have a taxing effect on student wellbeing. Students need an escape, something to get away from it all, perhaps to another world entirely. Luckily students now have that escape with the campus’s new Dungeons & Dragons club.
D&D is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game where players make a character and enter a world of their creation. Players act as their character, setting apart the gameplay of D&D from a traditional tabletop game. Dungeon Masters (DM’s) create and oversee a story that the other players need to navigate through. The creativity and freedom involved in game ensures that no two games will ever be the same.
Matthew Lanza, a sophomore game design major, started the club so he could play D&D with friends, but was unprepared for the demand that such a club would bring. What originated as four friends playing together quickly increased to ten player party. The club currently meets on an unofficial basis, hosting games in rooms rented on campus, but Lanza wants the club to be officially recognized next semester. 
All students are welcome to join the club regardless of their experience level. Lanza plans on hosting a “session zero” early next semester where students can learn how to play the game and create characters. 
Lanza also wants to emphasize freedom when hosting campaigns, rather than sticking to a strict by the book structure. This allows interested students to be able to DM and write their own stories. This loose structure also allows for the DM to be switched out midgame, giving multiple students a chance to try out the role. The club will also allow homebrew, or custom content, to be used in games, as long as it is approved by the DM beforehand. 
The D&D club aims to create a space where students can relax and create unforgettable memories together. “We’ve had moments where our DM will just get up and act out what his character is doing in a very funny cartoonish matter,” Lanza said. “It’s moments like that you can’t get anywhere else.”
The next D&D night will be held in Hillwood Commons room 109 on Thursday, Dec. 5 at 5:30 p.m. Students with questions about the club or it’s activities can contact Matthew Lanza at Matthew.Lanza@my.liu.edu.

With a new semester approaching, students may be interested in joining a new club or organization. One club students can consider joining is the Newman club. 
The Newman club is a Catholic student organization, allowing students to share their faith about God without judgement. 
The Newman club meets on Thursdays during common hour in Hillwood Commons, room 110. Board meetings take place on Monday nights in the basement of the Interfaith Center chapel. The club also hosts prayer and adoration sessions on Tuesdays, and mass and fellowship every Sunday at 3 p.m. 
Michaela Fox, a senior theatre major and president of the club, believes that joining the Newman club has allowed her to make new friends through her faith.
“This club has become more than just a campus extracurricular activity to me,” Fox said. “It’s a place where I can connect with people of my faith, where we can come together safely and speak without judgement about anything.” 
The Newman club will be hosting a charitable Christmas Formal dinner and dance on Friday Dec. 6 at 6 p.m. in the basement of the Interfaith Center chapel. All proceeds will be going to Saint Judes Children’s Hospital. Ad-mission is $10 at the door or $7 if purchased in advance by Wednesday, Dec. 4, to the campus minister’s venmo @Govinda-Willard.

When stepping into the corporate world, there is more to it than just capitalizing on business ventures. There are also corporate social responsibilities, like donating portions of profits to charities. Students in Dr. Nada Kobeissi’s business and society course are learning this through a fundraising project, where they have the opportunity to fundraise for charities of their choice.
Dr. Kobeissi has been teaching this course for 15 years, and began the charity project seven years ago. She believes corporations need to “trade their current business model of stockholders’ profit maximization with a more enlightened business approach.” 
Phillip Lutz, an alumnus and one of Dr. Kobeissi’s former students, founded the Waridi Kenya Trust, an organization dedicated to helping disadvantaged families in Kenya. Since 2015, students in the class have raised a total of $6,144 for the trust. 
This semester, Dr. Kobeissi allowed her students to fundraise for a charitable organization of their choice. To help with this process, she used Global Giving, a website that allows users to find and donate to charity projects all around the world.
Dr. Kobeissi found a trend in what students’ interests are and the organizations they choose. “I have a couple of student-athletes who selected to raise funds for a project in Haiti that focuses on teaching young kids education and sport,” she said. “Others are choosing projects that focus on the environment, or planting trees to combat global warming, etcetera.”
Jordan Goldsher, a senior business administration major, is fundraising for teamtrees.org. “Their mission is to plant 20 million trees by January 2020,” he said. 
Goldsher initially felt nervous being as-signed the project because he wasn’t sure if he could find a cause that would excite him. “We were given a specific website to look at different charities helping different causes, but there were thousands to choose from,” he said. Goldsher chose to donate to teamtrees.org because the environment, and the animals that live within it, are all suffering from deforestation.
Goldsher and his group sold cookies to help raise money for TeamTrees. Goldsher said he learned a lot through this fundraiser. “Working on this project has definitely opened my eyes when it comes to raising awareness for a cause that’s as wholehearted as this one,” he said. “All it takes is a little bit of effort and only $1 to help save the planet.”
Owen Gold, a freshman business management major, raised money for the Lynn Sage Foundation, a charity dedicated to funding breast cancer research. Gold and his group donated to the “Help Find a Cure for Breast Cancer” campaign, which aims to raise $100,000 to fund a scholar’s breast cancer research.
Gold chose the Lynn Sage Foundation because his life was personally affected by breast cancer. “[I] was extremely interested in this organization because one of my childhood friends was a victim of breast cancer and unfortunately passed,” he said. “My mother also had breast cancer but was fortunately lucky enough to overcome it.”
Gold said it was interesting for the university to center a project around charity. “It is nice to see community involvement being incorporated in our education,” he said. His group originally wanted to fundraise by giving out pink ribbons, the symbol for breast cancer awareness, to students on campus. However, they had trouble getting permission to host the event on campus, so instead, they decided to raise money by asking local businesses for donations.

 Dear readers,
It’s hard to believe that this is my final issue of the Pioneer. It has been an honor to report on and deliver campus news to the LIU Post community for the last three and a half years. If I’m being honest, it’s going to be hard to say goodbye to my amazing colleagues and friends that I’ve worked beside for so long. 
Working on the Pioneer throughout my college career helped me to foster my passion for writing and news reporting, and has also broadened my social skills. I’ve met so many talented and exceptional people through interviews, I’ve worked alongside professionals in my field through invigorating summer internships and I even had the opportunity to speak on a panel about student media at a national college media convention. 
There are so many fond memories of my time at the Pioneer to look back on, but what I will miss most are the hand cramps from writing too much, the countless hours of doing layout well into the early morning, and the sense of home I feel every time I step into our newsroom. The Pioneer is like a child to me, and along with the editorial board, staff writers and photographers, we are one giant family raising it together. A horrible metaphor, but it’s true. 
I want to leave you all with some advice. To my wonderful staff, first and foremost – thank you. Thank you for your dedication and perseverance to putting out an issue each week. Never stop chasing a story. You have the talent and the means of being the voice of LIU Post – don’t take it for granted, and do your duty justice. To our readers, keep be-ing informed. On a campus where so much is changing and happening everyday, it’s important to pay attention.
 I hope you enjoy this last issue of the Pioneer this semester. It’s been fun. 
Sincerely, Jada Butler Co-Editor-in-Chief

The Pioneer hosted a Democratic Debate watch party in the End Zone on November 20, which gave students the opportunity to learn about the primary candidates still in play while also discussing the sociopolitical issues that concern them. An exit poll conducted at the close of the event revealed a glimpse into the voting minds of the student body.
Big-money adversary, Senator Bernie Sanders, was the top candidate for students prior to the start of the fifth debate, leaving Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris tied with philanthropist, entrepreneur Andrew Yang for second place, according to the survey. Sixteen percent of students polled were uncertain of their top choice before the debate began.
After watching the debate, 58 percent of students still backed Sanders as their number one choice, while 23 percent changed their minds. Fifty percent of those who shifted their choice no longer supported Sanders, changing their votes over to Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg also grabbed himself a small percentage of the switch, along with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who didn’t participate but joined the race just days before the debate.
Although Sanders and Warren were the popular choice at the start and end of the debate, when it came down to choosing a candidate that can beat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, Vice President Joe Biden swiped a few of their votes away. Sanders and Warren were tied as top nominee to go against the real estate tycoon turned president.
To better understand what a LIU student is looking for in their ideal president, students revealed their suggestions for a candidate that isn’t already in the race. Answers ranged from well-known cartoon characters such as Lisa Simpson all the way to more conceivable options such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Governor Gary Johnson. Trump’s antithesis, Hillary Clinton, even earned herself a tally. Former H.U.D. Secretary Julian Castro who is still running but didn’t quite qualify for the debate, along with Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke who dropped out of the race early, also gained themselves a mention.
The candidates recommended by students may be a representation of what students vote with: their heart, gut, mind or wallet. The debate exit survey revealed that 35 percent of students polled narrow down their choice of candidate with their minds; they’ve paid attention and done all the research they can to determine which one will best satisfy their individual goals. Thirty percent vote with their hearts or whichever one makes them feel most comfortable. Nineteen percent go with their gut decision after hearing the news and those around them, and 13 percent enter the voting booth to vote for the candidate that will best help their financial situation. Two percent said they don’t vote.
Heading to the polls on election day is important; it’s a constitutional right that initiates change. Social and political issues which concern the majority of college students have a tendency to become a tool that politicians use in a partisan government. 
Climate change was voted the number one stressor for students, just ahead of wage and race equality. The subject matter that received only one vote, but is discussed almost as often as environmental change, was gun control; a debate that O’Rourke passionately involved himself in after a gunman opened fire inside a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso, Texas.
Since Buttigieg surged into first place in the Iowa polls just two days before the debate, many in the media suspected he would be the night’s frontrunner; however, he fell under the radar. 
With wage and gender equality being the secondary voting issue amongst students, female candidates such as Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Tulsi Gabbard, should have polled better among students; even the debate was moderated by an all female panel. Warren was the only woman candidate to keep her head above the water. 
As of December 3, Harris pulled out of the race because she “can’t fund her own campaign.” In other words, she’s not a billionaire like her opponents such as Tom Steyer and Bloomberg who poll at lower numbers but have the funding to remain in the race. But, she isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. President Trump mocked Harris’ exit in a tweet, to which she went back at him with, “I’ll see you at your trial.”
The next and sixth debate will be hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico at UCLA in Los Angeles on December 19. Thus far, only six candidates meet the qualifying threshold.

Post’s theatre program was recognized by “OnStage Blog” as one of the top 30 college musical theatre programs in the country.
“OnStage Blog” is an online publication dedicated to promoting the art of theatre. The website was started by Chris Peterson in 2014 to cover theatre in his hometown, but has since expanded to cover the arts internationally. 
Peterson chose to feature Post because of the quality of the program and its faculty.  
“For us, it was an easy choice to put LIU Post high on our lists once again. The selection of majors the school offers only enhances a student’s versatility in entering these industries,” Peterson said. “Also, with LIU-Post’s top-notch faculty, students are receiving exactly the type of training they need. We feel that LIU Post has quickly become a theatrical gem in New York.”
Students agree that what truly makes the program outshine the rest is the dedication put in by staff. 
“Our professors specialize our experiences to give us the exact training we need and want. They give us hundreds of performing tools that we learn how to apply to ourselves,” Steele Whitney, a sophomore theatre major, said. “I can comfortably say that our training is unlike any other program in the entire country.”
The effort put in by students is also a central piece to the program. “I can’t say enough about how amazing our students are,” theatre professor David Hugo said. Hugo feels “grateful and blessed” to work with students who are so dedicated to what they do.
The theatre department also prides itself on having student involvement in all aspects of production. 
 “In this department everyone does everything,” Cara Gargano, chairperson of the department of theatre, dance & arts management, said. “There are no stars and no divas; we are all here to support the work. Being an artist means putting ego aside and working to create something that changes peoples’ lives.”
Students in the program also have the opportunity to participate in shows outside of class as well. The Emerging Student Theatre Association (ESTA) is a student-run organization that puts on shows every semester. ESTA gives students a chance to direct, act in and write shows outside the normal curriculum. “This is a way that can put our art out there and share it with our community,” sophomore musical theatre major Shelley Dean said. “This is also a way for us to try other things besides acting. It is extremely useful to go out into the world and be able to direct, stage manage or choreograph on top of acting.”
Despite receiving recognition, the theatre program still faces problems such as low staff and a lack of space. Some feel that being recognized contradicts how the university has been treating the department. 
“If we have the recognition, we should have the reward,” Whitney said. “Our faculty works way beyond class hours to make sure every student is taken care of. They are here every single day of the week and oftentimes the weekend as well. In a growing, succeeding program, we need a growing faculty, improving facilities, and honestly more respect from the university.”
Hugo agrees that lack of space and low staff are problems that need to be addressed, but believes the university does have the student’s best interest in mind. “I didn’t get to Broadway by having negative thoughts,” he said. “I got to Broadway by believing in myself and believing that I could. And I believe that at this school too, that eventually we’ll get what we need, and the students will be supported more.”

Several success coaches from the Promise Office left the university this semester, leaving some of the students they had overseen confused and feeling helpless.  
Each student is assigned a success coach to ensure they have the right tools, guidance and support to achieve their academic goals. They are the student’s point of contact for everything from class registration, career guidance and financial aid up until they graduate. But, if a student’s coach changes regularly, some students say it becomes more of a nuisance than it’s worth. 
The Promise Office has a large and dynamic team of twenty professional staff members to support students, according to Ashley John, senior director of student engagement. “This semester, one success coach and one resident director left the university and we are actively searching for new candidates to fill these positions,” she said. 
Some students reported that their coach has changed several times over the years. Upperclassmen have had to reintroduce themselves, their academic history and future goals to their new promise coaches with each switch. 
Jacqueline Duncan, a junior business administration major is now on her second promise coach. 
“Now having been without a success coach for almost a month, while I’m working on my schedule [for] next semester and study abroad plans, I have been meeting with various people in the promise office,” she said. 
While staff departures can be expected within any organization, John said the Promise office ensures that every student has a success coach in the interim. “While a coach may change, our commitment to students and being there to support them does not,” John said.
The revolving door at the Promise Office has caused some incidents of students being misled about courses and majors which are no longer offered but are needed to graduate. 
Students lament that a lack of experience and knowledge among those positioned to guide them in the right direction has created unnecessary pressures and distractions during a time that should be designated to school work and finals. 
“I have a new success coach but I have no way to set up an appointment with him since success coaches notoriously never answer emails, and he’s not on the website for making appointments online,” she said. 
“I’m switching my major and have a bunch of questions so I’m in a big, big situation here because I have to submit my nursing application in the spring and I have questions about it and no one to ask.”  
New Promise staff members go through an extensive training program to teach about the university and their students, according to John. “We make sure our staff are qualified, trained, and ready to hit the ground,” she said. Yet some students turn to department chairs and directors for advice on scheduling, majors and credit evaluations.  
Graduation plans have also been affected for some. “If it wasn’t for my professors and department heads waiving classes and helping me with course substitutions, I don’t think I would have graduated on time,”  said Ashley Herkie, a senior digital design major. 
Charles Conover, director of the digital design department, has taken the time to sit down with students in his department to ensure they’re on the right track to graduation, according to Herkie. 
Being that Herkie is a transfer student, she has mainly dealt with enrollment services rather than the Promise Office, but her experience there has followed a similar pattern to that of the Promise Office. “I’m constantly being moved around by advisors and constantly have them tell me different things about what I need to graduate,” she said. 
Robyn Beeber, a senior childhood special education major, has had three promise coaches so far. “My old promise coach messed up some of my academic requirements causing me to take unnecessary classes that didn’t count toward my requirements,” she said. This added stress to her senior year and has made her academic planning more complicated.
While the Promise Office may seem like they’re experiencing some obstacles, they have added two part-time resident directors who are already forming connections with students in their residence halls, according to John. 
Also adding support to the Promise Office is Deirdre Moore, the former women’s basketball coach. John said she has joined Promise as director of HOPE Scholars and provides a new and added level of support to LIU students. 
When searching the campus website, liu.edu/post, for a list of Promise coaches, the page could not be found. Students can visit the Promise Office on the third floor of Hillwood Commons, or email their coach to schedule appointments.
