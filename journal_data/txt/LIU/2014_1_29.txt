The 2014 spring semester was supposed to start on Jan. 21, but instead, a 10:30 a.m. message was sent out to students, faculty and others on campus, informing them that classes were cancelled after 3:30 p.m., and LIU Post would close for the remainder of the day. All classes were subsequently cancelled for Jan. 22, as the snow continued to build early Wednesday.
This is not the first time that classes have been cancelled in the beginning of the spring semester due to terrible weather, according to Kenneth Mensing, LIU Post historian. With the campus closed, some students had difficulties registering for their spring classes. “I’ve been waiting for paper work to go through all break so I could register for my classes. It finally goes through and the school closes. Now I am basically just sitting around waiting [until] I can sign up, ” said James Bliss, a sophomore Criminal Justice major.
However, the enrollment deadline was extended. “The snow storm certainly threw a wrench into the start of the semester. Though students were still able to utilize self-service enrollment and register on line, I’m sure the snowstorm and associated campus closure did impact  some students who wanted to process enrollment transactions,” said Beth Wilkow, LIU Post’s registrar. “As a result, the usual two-week drop/add period has been extended by two days; students will be able to make changes to their schedule through Feb. 5. LIU leadership wanted to make sure that students were given ample time to enroll or make changes to their Spring ‘14 schedule,” she added.
The storm left many students stranded on campus on the first day of the semester with nothing to do. The Pratt Recreation Center, Hillwood, and even the Library were closed. The shuttle bus, which transports students from the campus to the Hicksville train station and several stops in between, did not operate on its normal schedule. Some dormers were confined to their rooms. “I have no roommate, no homework, and nothing to do. After staring at the ceiling for two days, I am ready for classes to start. I can’t even go outside because it is too slippery to walk around,” said Danielle Mazer, a junior Criminal Justice major, who was stuck on campus all through the closure.
Simone Costa, a sophomore English major who commutes, had difficulty getting to campus. She had a rather unlucky circumstance while trying to get back to campus on Tuesday morning from her home in Florida. “I had a 10 a.m. flight on Tuesday morning that was supposed to arrive at [John F. Kennedy Airport] JFK. That morning, I learned that the storm had caused all flights going to New York to be cancelled, including mine. Now instead of being on campus, I am stuck in Florida until I can get a flight, which may not even be until Thursday night. Thank goodness classes where cancelled, or I would have missed two days of school! ”
April 30 and May 1 have been alloted for snowdays, so the semester will not be extended, according to Concetta DiMare, academic scheduler.

The cancellation of the Music Theory courses, commonly referred to as the MUS 90 series, has caused outrage among students in the Music department, who are required to take the classes.
When freshman Kelli Shahinian entered LIU Post’s Music Education program, she was extremely cognizant of the fact that the major she chose could change the trajectory of her scholarly career. However, as Shahinian learned more about her major, she began to fear that her graduation date might be postponed. Shahinian also found that two of the four Music Theory classes were being cancelled every semester despite the fact that 14 other students require this class as well.
The problem lies in that music theory classes, such as MUS 90 and 92, are offered solely in the fall semesters, and others such MUS 91 and MUS 93 are only being held in the spring semesters. These cancellations could prevent a student from practicing theory with an instructor for more than a semester. Shahinian is not alone when she states that theory courses, such as the MUS 90 series, should not be cancelled due to their paramount importance to the major.
“As a Musician, not being able to practice theory for more than a semester, not sitting in every other day and really going over theory with an instructor, because they cut it, just doesn’t make sense,” Shahinian said.
“LIU Post broke their ‘LIU promise’ when they promised us that we could take a theory course, but they did not keep to that promise,” said Vanessa Gonzalez, a freshman Music Education major.
Shahinian and Gonzalez fear that they won’t be able to truly maintain an understanding of music theory with these cancellations. Shahinian also stated that the uncertainty of future class cancellations are causing many of her peers to rethink their majors, and even their choice to attend LIU Post.
Her love for LIU Post, has Shahinian feeling as though she must fight to improve this situation, though. Shahinian is not alone in her convictions, and many of her peers fully support her fight.
Gonzalez is also feeling the weight of these cancellations. She is considering transferring to another school, such as Dowling, Molloy, Adelphi, or SUNY Stony Brook.
However, some students, including Andrew Krahm, a freshman Music Education major, are taking on a different perspective about transferring. “I believe that if we go about this the right way, we can get this rectified and it won’t affect us,” Krahm said. He also stated that he has put so much work in at LIU Post, he is completely disinterested in starting new at a different university.
Shahinian and Gonzalez have both taken it upon themselves to meet with Noel Zahler, the dean of the School of the Visual and Performing Arts, to try to cultivate a solution about these cancellations.
Zahler believes that this concern is a misunderstanding. He is adamant that the graduation date of these freshmen will be in no way compromised or postponed. The dean stated that the reason why these students might be behind in their coursework is because they simply did not qualify to enter the MUS 90 series and were placed into MUS 2, which is Elementary to Musicianship.
Zahler chose not to comment on the individual choices of students with regard to transferring. However, he did mention that considering his extensive resume at institutions such as Carnegie Melon and Connecticut College, he is absolute in his assertion that holding certain theory courses every other semester is a common practice. He expressed his desire to assist in the implementation of more courses, but with the enrollment shortage in the Northeast, it has proven to be difficult.
“I am very happy that students such as Kelli, Vanessa and Andrew are demonstrating an interest in their education, but I will continue to uphold that the music department is one of the most sympathetic to student needs,” Zahler said.
Jennifer Miceli, chairperson of the Music Department, has yet to respond to The Pioneer regarding the cancellations of the Music Theory classes.

As the spring semester begins, many students are required to take a trip to the campus bookstore for new textbooks. However, that trip to the bookstore might end up feeling more like a robbery, rather than a fresh start to the semester. As the prices of textbooks in the campus bookstore can be far from budget-friendly, students are finding other ways to get a less expensive deal.
“I’m not buying any textbooks this semester,” Johan Rundquist, a junior Business Economics major, said resolutely. He is tired of buying expensive textbooks that he rarely ends up using. Last semester, only one of the six textbooks he bought in the campus bookstore turned out to be useful for his classes. It is the lack of actual use of the textbooks, rather than the price, that Rundquist reacts to. “If I knew that a specific textbook would be crucial in order to get through a class, I wouldn’t mind paying $100 for it,” he said. “I would probably buy it in the campus bookstore. I’m simply too lazy to search for lower prices somewhere else,” he added.
A visit to the campus bookstore reveals, however, that a student can be charged far more than $100 for a textbook. “The most expensive ones are about $400,” said Derek McMaster, assistant store manager at the Campus Bookstore.
The bookstore was surprisingly peaceful during common hour on Tuesday, Jan. 21, the first day of classes. There weren’t any frustrating lines and stressed cashiers, only cheerful staff that was happy to help. The relatively small number of visitors could have had something to do with the heavy snowstorm that inevitably shut the campus down on Wednesday, Jan. 22.
As many students think that the campus bookstore textbooks are overpriced, countless numbers of less expensive options are to be found with just a Google search. Websites such as Amazon.com and Valorebooks.com, where textbooks can be less expensive, could be another option.
An online bookstore is a great alternative, according to Eddie Richter, a sophomore Business Marketing major, if students want to save money. However, his Amazon.com delivery last semester was not at all what he expected. “For some reason it took about 20 days to get the books delivered, so let’s just say I wasn’t too popular with my professors the first weeks of classes,” he added.
Like the campus bookstore, many online bookstores sell both new and used textbooks. Some of them also provide a rental service, and encourage students to sell them back their used textbooks.
McMaster has seen a difference in the sales since Internet booksellers gave students other options. He would not discourage students from going on the Internet to buy textbooks, but claims that buying via the bookstore is safer. “Sometimes there are circumstances that call for a sudden refund or change of a book. For example, if a professor is switched after the class has started, then the student might need another book or edition. Here, students can have a full refund during the add/drop period of the semester,” he said.
In addition, McMaster stated that a student could sell a textbook back to the bookstore after using it, and get up to 50 percent of the money back.
It’s difficuly to discern whether that is a hollow promise or not. Some students say they have never been able to sell a textbook back to the bookstore. “I have been told the book is out-of-date, or that they don’t need it. I guess it’s a way for the bookstore to get expensive books sold in the first place,” said a student who preferred to remain anonymous.
As professors are aware of the rising prices of textbooks, some decide to make them non-compulsory for certain classes. Some put a copy of the textbook on reserve at the library so the students can read it there if they are unable to buy it. “It seems like the textbook requirement is a mandatory part of a syllabus,” said Carl Lystad, a junior Business Finance major. “But in some of my classes, the professors tell us that we don’t have to buy them, although it is required in the syllabus.”
Some students do not face the expensive textbook prices by searching for cheaper ones—they simply do not buy the books. “I have learned that if a professor doesn’t mention the textbook as crucial on the first day of classes, it probably isn’t,” Lystad said, before walking away to his first class of the new semester.

The B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is a place for literacy, reading and acquired learning. However, during this spring semester, the library has undergone changes to help transition their building further into the new millennium and fit the needs of modern education. The library also plans on implementing more renovations for future semesters.
This semester, the library renovation process began with the moving the bookshelves that were once in the main study/computer area, which is located behind the reference desk, to the back of the library behind the copy room. The library has used the newly acquired space to increase the number of desks and chairs to offer more seating room for students. “Short term plans were to renovate the main study area behind the reference desk and create a larger student seating area because there just wasn’t enough space for students to sit,” said Mellissa Hinton, the assistant dean of Technical and Digital Services at the library.
In addition to the changes to accommodate more study space, the library has modified another way to obtain their resources. The Periodicals have also been changed. “It’s moved to a document delivery format, so that it won’t be necessary for a student to go downstairs and fill out a form to obtain the periodical. You’re able to request the article online,” Hiton said.
Other additions include charging stations. “New stations will be put in for students to charge their devices; they’ll be able to power their iPods, iPads, and laptops into the furniture,” Hinton added. “The 21st century library is very different from the old. The renovations are in-line with the changes of technology, and we want to make it a place that’s more exciting and a place where students want to be,” she added.
Furthermore, the library has listened to student requests for longer hours of operation on the weekend and has started the semester with adjusted hours. The Monday through Thursday hours remain the same, 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., but the weekend hours are have also been modified. Friday and Saturday hours are now 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., instead of 5 p.m., and Sunday now operates from 12 p.m.to 11 p.m. Hinton continued, “As you can see, the LIU Post Library has expanded the hours of operation during the regular semester by over 15 percent.”
The Bookmark Cafe, located down the hallway to the Information Technology labs, where students went for a variety of food items, has plans for modifications as well. There are plans in the works for a larger cafe with extended hours as early as the fall 2014 semester.
These changes were made on the basis of student surveys. Hinton clarified, “Over the last year and a half we have been conducting a research study based on the students’ use of our library, library resources and the building, and how the students do research.” Hinton claims that the renovations are based on what the research has concluded so far.
In a Feb. 5, 2013 press release on the LIU website, the school announced the ethnographic study and revealed its observations. The study showed that students use Google and the library’s databases equally as resources to complete their work and that 67 percent of students browse the library’s website to find what they are looking for, as opposed to knowing where things are.
Additionally, it was revealed that 64 percent of students spend one to five hours per day on the web for research and school-related activities. As a result of the ongoing study of student habit, Hinton commented, “print is still with us, but students want 24/7 digital access.” She continued, “The research has shown that we need to make more renovations to the library in order to help our students achieve their goals and their social needs as well, as many students interact with their friends at the library.”
The library staff is hopeful and excited for the changes. “I think that once all of the renovations are complete, students are going to love the changes,” said Laura Kaye Chamberlian, a sophomore Musical Theater major who works at the library student circulation, as a desk assistant. The staff members aren’t the only ones who are optimistic.
Breana Martinez, a junior Journalism major, feels the changes are for the betterment of the student body. “I think the new improvements will be very beneficial,” Martinez said, “each addition can help accommodate the students, and the extended hours will help the students get their work done without stressing about the library closing early.”

The changes that began in Hillwood Commons during the fall semester continued over the winter break. The latest additions, according to Dr. Abby Van Vlerah, Post’s new dean of Students, are the relocation of the Center for Student Information (CSI), the new Gold Coast Cinema, modified hours at The Student Body (the boutique), some modifications to the Hillwood Second Floor Lounge, and new gaming systems in the recently relocated Game Lounge, and more changes are expected.
Hillwood Commons is said to acquire a sports lounge and a candy shop, and future plans for the CSI include a tech store.
Last semester, Hillwood Commons added the boutique and the game lounge was relocated to the now defunct old study lounge. The newly renovated cinema, now known as the Gold Coast Cinema continues to be the place where students can catch new releases and old favorites. The Gold Coast Cinema has been spruced up and movies will run Thursday at 9 p.m. and Saturday at 3 p.m. Students can also hang out at the new sports lounge, which opens on Feb. 2.
Michelle Evjen Halvorsen, a Business Management major, thinks that the changes will benefit students. “I think people will start to think of the school as a place where they want to spend their time and not only to attend classes,” Halvorsen added.
Rachel Haas, a freshman Digital Arts and Design major and Marketing minor, liked some of the ideas, but not all.
However, overall Hass thinks the changes are positive for the campus. “It is good that they are trying to accommodate the students.” She also added, “as a vegetarian, I like that they now have more options.”
The sports lounge will be located in the Pioneer room in Hillwood, and according to VanVlerah, the name is to be determined. The lounge will feature 9 LED TVs ranging in size, a menu including wings, fries, burgers, chicken sandwiches, shakes and salad, and the opportunity to watch sports. The grand opening is scheduled for Super Bowl Sunday at 5 p.m. Regular hours will be Monday through Wednesday from 8 p.m. to midnight, Thursday from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., Friday from 6:30 p.m. to 1 a.m., Saturday from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Sunday from 6 p.m. to midnight.
“We changed the hours to better suit the needs of our shoppers,” said Tamir Dayya, Special Projects coordinator. “We found that we were open for too many hours and decided to tailor the hours of operation based on the most common shopping times that we noticed,” Dayya added.
The Post Sweet Treats will be located in the former CSI location. According to VanVlerah, the shop will sell candy, cupcakes, muffins, beverages and other non-perishables. No hours have been determined yet, and just like the Student Body, the candy shop will be student- operated. CSI has relocated to the second floor and a tech store is tentatively planned for fall 2014.
According to Van Vlerah, The Student Body Boutique’s hours have been modified due to student feedback. The new hours are Monday through Friday, noon to 8 p.m. Additionally, the game lounge now has new gaming systems that include a PlayStation 4, an Xbox One, and games, such as “Call of Duty,” “Ghosts,” “Madden 25,” “Battlefield 4” and “Rock Band” game with new drum kits and guitars.
The changes, according to Dan Potenzieri, president of the Student Government Association (SGA) , are very positive for the campus and have already generated a lot of buzz. About adding these new businesses on campus, Potenzieri said, “The changes are targeting services that students have asked for.”

Some mammals hibernate in the winter, meaning that they are dormant for a few months in order to preserve energy. Many of us humans tend to hibernate during the year’s cold months too. We use the excuse that it’s too cold to do anything. Exercise? That’s out of the question for sure.
However, there are ways to stay active without having to endure the harsh weather. For starters, join a gym. If that is not an option, then creating a workout routine at home is simple. Working out at home eliminates expense, packing a gym bag, commute, parking and, of course, waiting for equipment—so no excuses!
It takes very little effort to set aside at least 30 minutes of your day to work up a sweat. Cardio and strength training can easily be navigated with practically no equipment by performing short circuit routines. Short circuits are when you perform different exercises with minimal rest in between them, keeping your heart rate up.
Here is a short circuit to try in your dorm room or bedroom:
Abs: Crunches (25 reps) 
Chest: Push-Ups (20 reps) 
Legs: Squats (20 reps) 
Cardio: Jump Rope
Rest for 2 minutes after each circuit; repeat this as many times as you can in 20-30 minutes.
“I love the idea of this – first of all, it’s
free. Second, it really makes me realize that it doesn’t take much to get a little work out in,” said Alyssa Mayor, a Public Relations major. Keeping yourself active throughout the cold brutal months will keep you feeling healthy and doing a little bit of work will pay off. Remember: once winter is over, bikini season arrives.

The Super Bowl is one of America’s favorite sporting events. People from all over the country tune in to the game for various reasons, the die-hard sports fans love the excitement of the game, some just watch for the best commercials, and others relish the halftime performances.
The Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks will compete in this year’s Super Bowl XLVIII on Sunday, Feb. 2, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The halftime performance will feature singer Bruno Mars and the band Red Hot Chili Peppers. “I only watch the halftime show during the game,” said Brittney Cataldo, a senior Early Education major. “I am super excited to see what the stage will look like and what songs Bruno Mars will play. I loved Beyoncé’s performance last year.”
If you are having a Super Bowl party, you might want to make sure your bowls are topped with tasty, crowd-pleasing snacks. Finger foods are the clear winners at a sports-themed bash. More popular snacks include classic chips and dip, pretzels and anything else that can be easily poured into a bowl.
Other favorites are chicken fingers, potato skins, sandwiches and hot wings. “I personally only watch the Super Bowl for the commercials; I don’t even know the teams playing in the game,” said Talia Charlton, a senior Journalism major. “But I go to my friend’s party every year and just hang out and eat snacks. It’s always fun.”
Get your friends geared for the Super Bowl with themed decor like napkins with footballs on them. The napkins can be purchased at most online party stores, such as partycity.com. Decorate the house with your favorite team gear such as flags, posters, or jerseys. Put snacks in bowls and plates that represent team colors in order to add some spirit to your party.
Be sure to tune into Super Bowl XLVIII with the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks at 6:30 p.m.

As I was trying to write this article on my father’s old computer, a surprising number popped up in front of my face when I opened up a new Word document. It said, “Microsoft Office Word 2007.” This version of Word is already 7 years old. I let that sink in. At the very same moment, I was also playing songs I used to listen to in 2007. What happened? How did those years fly by so fast? It feels like it was yesterday and we were all singing “Under my umbrella, ella, ella,” and Rihanna was still a good girl, not a good girl gone bad.
But then I started to walk down memory lane, and adding all those memories up to who I am and where I am today, helped me relax. A lot has happened since that version of Word was made. I’m not an insecure 15-year-old anymore. I’m a 22-year-old who is about to finish up her last semester of college. I’m more confident, but the thought of entering the adult life on my own scares me. I am trying to write both job applications and school applications, but they all ask me to define my
brand. What is my brand? I’ve had 22 years to figure it out, and I still don’t know. I know easier things like what my favorite food is or what music I like. But I don’t know where and who I want to be as far as a professional life goes. I’d like to think that I’m a carefree, “yolo”- practicing (I can’t believe I just used that word) 20-something girl who has it all figured out. I was a girl who moved across the Atlantic at the age of 19 to live the life of her dreams, a girl who likes to live through the clichés that every Hollywood-made movie portrays. I’m still that girl, or should I say young woman, the only difference is that I’m another step closer to getting old, and another step away from knowing what I want to do.
My sister laughs at me when I tell her about my worries. “You’re only 22 years old, honey,” she often says. Well, yes, but time runs away like sand between our fingers, and it’s amazing how one moment can change the path that you’re about to take. That is why I’m worried. I need to make sure that every decision I make will lead me to exciting moments that I can pull out of my memory drawers every time I’m feeling slightly depressed.
So, that leads me back to defining my brand. How do I explain to potential future employers and professors that I am, as one person once put it, a product of my memories, and that I make up my brand as I go? Do I tell them that my brand has a frenetic quality and one day I’m this, and the next day I’m that? Or do I simply state that I don’t have a brand because it’s impossible for me to place myself in just one branded box? I think I need to invest in a brand guide, if that even exists.

“New Year, new me!” These words echo out of the mouths of many people every year on Jan. 1. We make goals for ourselves, whether it’s getting a new job, losing weight, or even trying harder to find the love of our lives. We all set some personal standard to the New Year. While only a small fraction of us end up fulfilling our resolutions, it does not stop us from attempting another one the next year. The problem is that this almost always ends in disappointment. 
“To me it’s just more false promises to one’s self, if anything, because people claim to change and three days later they just completely stop doing that and go back to their normal habits,” said Gerard Gilmartin, a senior Digital Arts and Design major.
However, others disagree. Hannah Leigh Van Ronk, a sophomore Art Therapy major, thinks that they are not so lost. “People don’t necessarily need a new year to change a bad habit, or lose weight, but it provides a hope for them and I think resolutions are a good thing. Whether a person sticks to them or not, it’s always nice to try and create a goal for oneself.”
Personally, the biggest problem with my resolutions is that I set my standards too high. After weeks of eating unhealthily and drinking soda every day, I expect myself to swear off sweets and run five miles every day. In order to succeed in our New Year’s resolutions, we need to stop making them “New Year’s” resolutions. Instead, we need them to just be lifestyle changes. We need to stop hiding behind the idea of a new year because that will keep us procrastinating with our changes until the following year. As Amanda Lewis, a freshman Psychology major, stated, “New Year’s should not be the reason you all of the sudden decide to change your life with a resolution. If you wouldn’t do it any other day, what makes you think you’ll do it because you promised yourself on New Year’s Day?”
New Year’s resolutions are always going to be something people aspire to complete. Personally, I am still working on that 4.0 GPA. However, until we have the mental ability to completely turn our lives around in just one day, we need to strive for the change all year long. Every day is a new day; a new year isn’t what is needed to change, but a new mindset is.

The underdog is the person with the obvious disadvantage in any situation. On Oct. 1, 2013, the author Maxwell Gladwell published the book, “David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants.” This book discusses the phenomenon of the underdog. He introduces his theory by retelling the very famous biblical story of David and Goliath. As we remember, Goliath was the giant, the obvious victor. But against the odds,David managed to win the battle. This is, not surprisingly, very often the premise of our movies and books. We like to root for the weaker one. 
Gladwell believes that the strong are often the weak, if looked at from the right angle. However, I want to say, as I look around in the world, I see a lot of Goliaths winning. Take a look at companies; the major ones are just getting bigger with little or no room for the smaller companies. I want to say the same when it comes to people; a person that has grown up in a wealthy family has substantially bigger opportunities than those who grew up poor. But according to Maxwell, this is a mistake of judgment, a misinterpretation of the strong and the weak. We have all heard the phrase: “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” This is what Maxwell bases his theory on.
A person alternates in the situation and finds another way to win. As I take a look at my own life, I must say even though it’s a cliché, that the things that made it tougher for me to get where I am, are what got me here. As you read this, you may think this is ridiculous. But as an example, 67 percent of British prime ministers lost one of their parents before the age of 16. Gladwell points out this example and says that this forced them to find other ways to achieve what they wanted.
What’s more interesting is that the author actually points out how there are several hints in the Bible that Goliath is actually blind. The Bible states that Goliath was calling for David to make him come closer during the fight. Also, a person guides Goliath through the audience and into the arena. Another finding was that giants are often born with a genetic error, leading them to blindness. So, was Goliath the real underdog? The author is actually telling us that the people with the obvious advantages aren’t always the winners. Any powerful person has their weakness; if you take a closer look, it may even be a David.

Lorber Hall was used as a set on Jan. 15 and 16 to shoot the sizzle reel of “OSS,” a television promo project by LIU Brooklyn grad students. The sizzle reel will be shipped to various television networks, with the hope of being made into a full show. Gina Massaro, a graduate student in the M.F.A. in Writing and Producing for Television program at LIU Brooklyn, received her B.F.A. in Film from LIU Post in 2012, and was one of several students to develop the story and helped cast actors for the production.
“OSS” is a period piece set during World War II. “[It focuses] on William Donovan,” said Massaro, “[who is the] head of the Office of Strategic Services, and his agents who work across the globe, both behind enemy lines and in the United States.” The OSS was the wartime intelligence agency that preceded the CIA. This was part of a class assignment by Professor Norman Steinberg, who gave the students a prompt the first day of class. Steinberg has won an Emmy award for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Variety or Music for the series “Flip” in 1971, and was one of the screenwriters of Mel Brooks’ “Blazing Saddles.”
“From there it was our job to come up with characters, story arcs and ultimately a script,” added Massaro. “The first year focused on writing the pilot and individual episodes. The second year focused on production. At the beginning of the production semester, each class member lobbied for a position in the department,” she added.
Lorber Hall was set up to be the OSS headquarters. Since the production takes place in the 1940s, several things were changed to accommodate the period. The production team brought in appropriate items to join the existing antiquated tudor-style buildings on campus, ranging from paintings and typewriters to desks and a leather couch.
Massaro stressed the effort of such a production. “We had an amazing art department [that] secured wonderful props and furniture,” she explained. “The quality of their work was one of the most impressive aspects of production that I experienced. They made everything look professional and authentic.”
Having prior experience in casting internships, such as at NBC Universal, Massaro’s choice to take on that role was easy. When the time came to find extras, the alumna reached out to Post students, sending out her call online, including on the Post Filmmakers group on Facebook, and acting community sites like backstage.com.
“Casting is a fun and rewarding job,” said Massaro, “[After editing audition tapes] we forwarded our favorites to Jonathan
Frakes, our director, who made callback selections and then ultimately determined our cast. In addition to principal actors, we had to cast all of the featured extras and background extras. We actually used some really great LIU Post students.” Frakes is best known for his acting, portraying Commander William T. Riker on “Star Trek: The Next Generation.” The actor has also directed television episodes for shows such as “Falling Skies” and “Burn Notice,” and also directed the trailer as a favor for Steinberg, who is a friend.
“Returning to LIU Post felt like coming home,” said Massaro. “Post has a beautiful campus and I truly loved my time there as a student. Being able to combine two parts of my life, the former at LIU Post and the current at LIU Brooklyn, was special for me, and I will always treasure it,” she added.
Massaro is happy to be pushing forward in the film industry. But first, she’ll finish grad school. “Graduate school has taught me a lot about what it is to be a writer in the industry,” she said. “You have to learn to collaborate, filter ideas and deal with egos. There will be arguments. You have to be able to not only communicate effectively as a writer, but also be able to deal with personality conflicts in the least damaging and most productive way. At the same time, we laugh, and we laugh a lot.”
“OSS” is one of many student films to be shot on LIU Post’s campus. Students in the Film Department have traditionally used the campus for their productions. The production lab short “Love Less Naked,” written and directed by junior Michael Mirabella, is shooting through February and March. In addition to these student projects, LIU Post has recently been the site for several commercial film projects. Last spring, students were able to witness bits and pieces of “The Reluctant Professor,” by director Mark Lawrence (“Miss Congeniality”), which was shot at the campus bookstore, as well as in the Kahn building. That film stars Marisa Tomei (“The Ides of March”, “My Cousin Vinny”) and Hugh Grant (“About a Boy”). In 2012, the tennis courts by the Pratt Center were used to shoot parts of Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which has been racking up awards and nominations in recent months.
To find out more about working with experienced industry professionals, The Pioneer sat down with Gina Massaro, a member of the TV Writers Studio, who received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Film from LIU Post, to learn more about her experience.
The Pioneer: What was it like working with a professional director?
Gina Massaro: It was really exciting to watch Jonathan Frakes work. He had a great energy on set and you could see the positive impact it had on our actors, including extras.
TP: How can this experience help film production majors become accustomed to the daily challenges faced by professionals in the industry?
GM: The biggest lesson to learn is how to roll with the punches. At the eleventh hour everything can go wrong; weather, extras dropping out. You name it and it will happen. There’s no controlling it when it does, but you have to be inventive and find quick solutions. Another thing is everyone has to work as a team. If one person doesn’t do their job, it’s a domino effect. You have to be on your game at all times.
TP: What was your favorite part about producing this project?
GM: Aside from collaborating on the pilot script, I was involved in casting all the actors, including extras. I loved holding auditions for the principal actors. Sometimes it can wear you down, seeing dozens of people for the same role, but when that one person comes in and blows you away, it’s all worth it.
TP: It seems a lot of shows and movies have been filmed recently on LIU’s campus. How does working on location differ from working in a studio?
GM: While our program meets at Steiner Studios (a Hollywood-style production and support facility in Brooklyn’s Navy Yard), I only have experience working on location. Working on location has a lot of challenges and limitations. Certain objects are not removable and there may be noise that’s not under your control. In a studio you construct the set on a soundstage, so you’re able to limit outside interferences. At the same time, being on location gives you advantages you wouldn’t have otherwise, especially for outdoor shoots. The fog during our morning shoot at Lorber Hall really set the mood for the scene. We got lucky in that respect.
TP: Is there anything else you’d like to add about the production experience?
GM: As a screenwriter, seeing your characters come to life is an indescribable experience and watching the daily footage from our shoots is mind blowing. Knowing all the work that went into it, and seeing it all come together is truly rewarding.

The fashion, the artists, and most importantly, the music—these elements represent each and every year of the Grammy Awards. On Sunday, Jan. 26, the 56th Annual Grammys were all about Daft Punk’s latest and critically acclaimed album, “Random Access Memories,” Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’ performance of “Same Love,” and rapper/ producer Pharrell William’s eccentric brown hat.
Winning not only Album of the Year, but also the coveted Record of the Year for “Get Lucky,” the electro-dance duo known as Daft Punk were not hesitant on their big comeback. “I really liked Daft Punk and Pharrell’s performance with Stevie Wonder, but Pharell killed it on stage,” said Alexis Cobb, a junior Childhood Education major.
Moving on to the fashion statements made on the red carpet, it seemed as though the “lucky” musical artist Pharrell took inspiration from a traditional Canadian Park Ranger; he donned a red Adidas jacket, jeans, and dirty worker boots with a brown headpiece to match. Pharrell’s hat was one of the night’s top-trending topics onTwitter.
Some other fashion faux-pas included Madonna’s Ralph Lauren tuxedo, Paula Patton’s zebra dress by Nicholas Jebrang, and Paris Hilton in Haus of Milani.
More surprises unfolded as Beyoncé took the stage for the first time after releasing her self-titled, visual secret album. The “Drunk in Love” singer sported a sexy bob with a transparent outfit to match. On the red carpet, the fierce lady was wearing a beautiful Michael Costello lace gown.
Other fashionable ladies included Taylor Swift, who rocked a glimmering Gucci dress, Katy Perry’s musically inspired Valentino and Alicia Keys in a plunging custom blue Armani gown. The men of today’s music were also looking fine in their threads, such as John Legend, Jay-Z, and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, who took home the Grammy for Best New Artist.
Performing alongside Macklemore and Ryan Lewis on stage were singers Madonna and Mary Lambert. As the duo performed one of their biggest hits, “Same Love,” actress and ordained minister Queen Latifah helped marry 33 straight and same-sex couples right outside of the Grammy Awards at the Staples Center.
“Macklemore’s performance was really cool,” said Katie Pallini, a sophmore English Education major, “I was really surprised that Queen Latifah was an ordained minister—that came out of nowhere.” This was definitely one of the most memorable moments of the nights.
Imagine Dragons and Kendrick Lamar, Pink, Metallica, and Paul McCartney with Ringo Starr all gave amazing displays of their talents on stage in between each award given. To finish out the award ceremony, Nine Inch Nails, Queens of the Stone Age, Dave Grohl, and Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac completely blew rock fans and aficionados out of the water by performing “Copy of A” and “My God is the Sun,” both songs from respective group’s Grammy nominated albums.

On Jan. 19, four million viewers tuned in to PBS to watch season three of the award-winning British television show “Sherlock,” which premiered after a haitus of two years. The show, which began in 2010, has been nominated for 17 Primetime Emmy Awards as well as a Golden Globe, and has won 13 BAFTA Awards including Best Drama Series, Best Sound, Best Director and Best Writer, according to Imdb.com. While some may be surprised that a show can do so well when airing only three 90-minute episodes every two years, the saying “absence makes the heart grow fonder” proves true here, as the ratings steadily escalate each season.
“Sherlock,” written and created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, is a modern adaptation of the adventures of
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s titular detective, and his loyal doctor John Watson. Although the adventures were published in
1887 in The Strand Magazine, the same characters now race around present-day London in taxicabs
and communicate on the newest smart phones while taking down the world’s most dangerous criminals. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch (“Star Trek: Into Darkness,” “The Fifth Estate”) as Sherlock Holmes, and Martin Freeman (“The Hobbit” trilogy) as Watson, the show has a talented cast.
“The cast is incredible, and the amount of talent that works on the show really says something,” said Cayla Avellino, a freshman Film major. “The fact that Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman come back every couple of years to film this BBC show after working on projects such as ‘The Hobbit’ and ‘Star Trek: Into Darkness’ speaks volumes about the show’s quality. The cast really lends a hand in making the show what it is,” she added.
The show is a phenomenon with the premiere of the third season becoming the most watched television drama of this decade in the United Kingdom. The show boasted a staggering average of 11.2 million for the entire season. Although it is still considered a “cult classic” show in America, found on Netflix and other media, the popularity is increasing as the PBS Masterpiece’s show ratings rise. The audience between the second and third season rose by 25 percent and the ratings of the time slot for the show (10 p.m. on Sunday evenings) increased by 81 percent. So, while the show may not be breaking incredible records here in the States, it is getting well-deserved attention and bringing more viewers to the non-profit PBS.
During an interview on Jan. 19, Sherlock writer/co-creator Mark Gatiss told Phil Itter for Al Jazeera News, that he believes the reason the British show is becoming popular in America is that, “it goes right back to the fact that they are definitive. They’re originals. And I think over the years of so many different films, etc., they’re incredibly identifiable icons. They’re so get-able. More than anything, what people have responded to is the fun of the show, which is so much what Doyle’s stories were actually like. They’re quick reads, they’re jolly thrilling, blood-curdling thrilling adventures and really, that’s what we wanted to do,” he added.
Plot twists, beautiful film work, and fantastic acting are sure to bring the patient audience back every two years to watch the show for its three-week run. As the newest season begins in the United States, the network questions if the ratings will rise or fall after the explosive first episode. But one thing is for sure: Sherlock is progressing from something watched only by a condensed fan base to a wildly successful television show for PBS.
Sherlock airs on Sundays at 10 p.m. on PBS until Feb. 2.

On Saturday, Jan. 25, the women’s basketball team (12-4) squared off against the Queens College Knights (11-5), and the Pioneers came out victorious 74-64. The first half featured a plethora of ties and lead changes as the scoring was practically evenly distributed between the two sides. Led by a second-half surge, the Lady Pioneers were too much for the Knights to handle.
The back and forth battle between the two sides was no better exemplified than by the eight ties in the first half. In addition to the ties, neither team led the other by more than four points,
so both teams were in striking distance to take control of the game. Freshman guard Madison Rowland, who scored 15 points in the first half on 6-9 shooting, led the Knights. She was also a thief on the defensive end with four steals. The scoring for the Lady Pioneers was well distributed, as four players had five points or more going into the half. At halftime, the Pioneers were up by two.
Wanting to pull away in the second half, the Pioneers came out inspired. Early in the second half, the Pioneers went on an 11-0 run led by junior guards Ariana Ijaduola and Chelsea Williams. That run by the Green and Gold put them up by nine points, and gave the Pioneers a lead that they did not relinquish.
The second-half surge was provided by a big game from Williams, as she poured in 16, giving her 22 for the game, which led the Lady Pioneers. Williams also grabbed eight boards to lead the squad as well. Senior forward Shayna Gatling scored ten points in the second half to give her 16 for the game. Senior Guard Alexa Peters added four assists in the second half, as the Pioneers put all hopes of a comeback to sleep.
For the Knights, freshman forward Mackenzie Rowland finished with 30 points and was one steal shy of picking up a double-double. Rowland scored 11 points and grabbed eight rebounds.
As a team, in the second half, the Lady Pioneers shot 52 percent from field as compared to the Knights, who shot under 50 percent. In addition to their field goal percentage, the Pioneers drew a lot of fouls, going to the charity stripe 21 times and knocking down 17 of them. On the Pioneers’ current seven game win streak, they are outscoring their opponents by over 16 points a game.
Coach Moore and the Lady Pioneers are back in action on Friday, Jan. 31, when they face off against the Daemen College Wildcats from Amherst N.Y. Tipoff is scheduled for 6 p.m.
