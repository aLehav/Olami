 The women’s soccer team lost their first conference game this season against the Fairleigh Dickinson University Knights in a 2-0 defeat on Wednesday, Sept.18 at home. The Sharks had trouble facilitating an effective offense and sending shots into the back of the net, whereas the Knights capitalized on their chances.
During the first half, the game was even. The Knights took seven shots, and the Sharks took four. The Knights had four corner kicks and the Sharks had three. The score read 0-0 at half time, however, this did not last long into the second half. 
Only two minutes and 50 seconds into the second half, Knights senior, Jackson Bennett, sent a shot into the back of the net. A minute and six seconds later, the Knights sent another one soaring past the Sharks’ keeper to put the score at 2-0. The Sharks weren’t able to answer these back-to-back goals sent in by the Knights offense and the game ended in a 2-0 loss. 
The Sharks’ offense was able to get shots off, yet none were accurate enough to go in. The Sharks finished the game by taking 10 shots, three of them were on-goal. The big difference between the two teams was that the Knights took 14 shots with six of them on goal. The blue and gold were able to generate some sort of offense, yet they were unable to capitalize in finishing shots. 
Despite the loss, the Shark’s freshman goalkeeper Kayla DeTreux had a solid day in between the posts finishing the game with four saves. 
Later in the week, on Saturday, Sept. 21, the Sharks faced off against Harvard University. They took a defeating 5-0 loss to the Harvard Crimson. 
The past week for women’s soccer puts their record at 1-7-1 for the season and 0-1 for the NEC conference. However, this is not representative of the Sharks’ chance to make it to the NEC tournament. With nine conference games left in this season’s schedule, there is still ample time to improve their record and play their way towards the NEC tournament. 
The Sharks now prepare to begin a nine game NEC game stretch beginning with St. Francis College Brooklyn away on Friday, Sept. 27

 The football team hosted the Sacred Heart University Pioneers in their first home opener as a Division I program on Saturday, Sept. 21. With a 38-3 loss behind them against South Dakota State two weeks earlier, the Sharks looked to bounce back and prove they have the ability to compete in the Northeast Conference at the Division I level. 
In a pre-game interview with WCWP’s Matt Weinstein, a senior broadcasting major, Coach Bryan Collins shared his optimism about his team’s performance against South Dakota State. When asked about how he thinks his Sharks will stack up with the rest of the NEC, Coach Collins said, “We just have to practice to be the best team we can be in order to be a competitive team in the conference.” 
Sharks’ running back Tim Marinan has a similar take on the situation.“We want to take it as a step moving forward, not two steps backwards,” Marinan said to WCWP’s James Waldhof in regards to the team’s prior loss to South Dakota State.
The first quarter of the game against Sacred Heart University started off defensive with the Pioneers punting the ball away after going 3 and out to start the game. A field goal attempt by the Sharks was blocked, keeping the game scoreless. 
The Pioneers opened up the scoring when running back Eli Terry rushed into the end zone, giving the Pioneers a 6-0 lead with 3:34 left to play in the first quarter. 
The Sharks wasted no time getting back on offense. After getting 46 yards on five plays, they took their next snap on second and two at the Pioneers’ 20.   
Sharks quarterback Clay Beathard looked downfield and scrambled 20 yards into the end zone to tie the game at 6-6, and score the first touchdown in program history with 39 seconds remaining in the first quarter. Kicker Briant DeFelice made the extra point, giving the Sharks the 7-6 lead. 
In the second quarter, the game started to get away from the Sharks. Pioneers quarterback Logan Marchi took the game into his own hands. He completed back-to-back passes to running back Julious Chestnut and wide receiver Tory Holland, totalling 59 yards. Marchi found wide receiver Tyrese Chambers in the end zone for the 11-yard touchdown reception. The Pioneers took the lead, up 13-7 after a successful point after from kicker Dane Borges. 
After a fumble by Beathard near the end zone, the Pioneers maintained their lead. After a 14-yard rush by Chestnut and a false start penalty, Marchi met with tight end Del Driscoll in the end zone for an-other Pioneers touchdown, extending their lead to 20-7 with 7:30 left in the half. After a short play, Mar-chi connected with Chambers for the 60-yard touchdown reception, making the score 27-7, Pioneers in the lead. 
Just before the end of the third quarter, kicker Briant DeFelice knocked through the 33-yard goal to bring the score to 27-10. 
With 12:37 left of the game, Chestnut settled the match by running down the Sharks defence. It only took four plays for the Pioneers to reach the end zone. Chestnut ran for 69 yards on the drive on three attempts, and capped off on a 44 run into the end zone for the touchdown, making the score 34-10. 
This would be the final score of the game as The Sharks would turn the ball over on downs on their next drive nearing the goal line. 
The Pioneers offense was no match for the Sharks’ defence this time around. Marchi threw for 375 yards and three touchdowns; Chambers had eight receptions for 144 yards and one touchdown; Chestnut rushed 28 times for 169 yards and one touchdown. 
Sharks’ Beathard did not shine in the same light, as he only completed nine of his 25 passing attempts, totaled 135 yards, and his only touchdown came on the run.
The Sharks’ will look for their first win in their next game on Saturday, Sept. 28, at Wagner College. The contest against Wagner can be seen on ESPN 3 or heard live on WCWP “The Wave” radio on 88.1 FM.

 Nissequogue Village Living (NVL) magazine spotlighted music performance alum Ashley Akl (2018) on the front cover of its September 2019 issue. Akl is a self-employed piano instructor who volunteers to write about music and the arts for her local magazine, NVL. She began writing for the magazine in January 2018 because of her love for music. “I really wanted to write for the magazine to initiate appreciation for music,” Akl said.
At the age of 5, Akl developed her love and passion for the piano. “I always knew I wanted to do something with the piano since a young age,” she said. When members of NVL reached out to Akl for an opportunity to write for their magazine, she was very excited. “There was nothing related to the arts [in the magazine],” she said, and she wanted to be the first person to “educate the public” on the subject.
Although Akl has a strong passion for music, she also loves writing. “I actually took extra writing classes because I love it so much,” Akl said. She believes writing for NVL gives her the platform to “spark public appreciation for the arts.” “I feature all kinds of things that relate to music,” Akl said. She expressed that writing for her local magazine is somewhat of a “self-promotional program.”
The NVL magazine releases a new issue every month and Akl is looking forward to having the responsibility of writing every month. She writes on various topics relating to music and the arts in each issue. “I explain different topics in different angles…to teach the public on topics they may not necessarily know a lot about,” Akl said. “It’s almost like a ‘Dummies 101’ book for everyone to understand.”
“[Playing the piano] is something that came naturally to me as a child,” Akl said. However, “training in the music field gave me the knowledge to write about [music] that I can now pass down to others.” She believes her recent publications are a great way to “boost LIU and the music department.” 
Akl has a website where she shares all her stories written in the NVL magazine, www.ash-leyakl.net. Her website is also used to schedule piano appointments instructed by her.

 Select students get the opportunity to showcase their artwork in the SAL gallery. Junior photography major Michael DeCristo received this opportunity from Sept. 16 to Sept. 20.  A reception for DeCristo’s exhibition “Manmade,” was held on Sept. 18 from 5-8 p.m.
Shot through a 35mm film, DeCristo captured images of men from his past. “Growing up, I felt really separated from the male population. I grew up in a rural area in North Carolina and I’m very outwardly queer,” DeCristo said. The portraits he produced “required [his] subjects…to trust [him] as a queer artist to depict them,” he said.
Raymond DeCristo, DeCristo’s father, mentioned that the pictures shot “are photos that challenge your value system in the world.”
In each shoot, DeCristo had a specific focus in mind. He wanted his subjects to “not confront the viewer.” “I wanted the viewer to just be able to gaze upon the man without any confrontation with that eye contact,” DeCristo said. His favorite piece, “The Roommate,” highlighted this basis. 
Although DeCristo has been involved in many group shows, this was his first solo art exhibition. 
Difficulties came with hosting a solo exhibition. “It’s all up to me to pull people,” DeCristo said. He can’t rely on other artists in a show to bring in audience members. Despite the difficulties, DeCristo said, “I really like that I have my own space to share my ideas and my imagery with people without compromise.” It also gives him the chance to show off unapologetically.
The entire collection was almost a year in the making. From Oct. 2018 to July 2019, DeCristo dedicated his time to each individual photoshoot. He explained that the process of choosing which pictures to showcase was difficult, but he trusted his intuition in choosing the shots that he did.
His self-portrait was the most time consuming shoot. DeCristo crafted a room filled with his own artwork using a process known as cyanotype. The process took approximately two months to complete and is a favorite of many of his friends. “I’m so proud of how far he’s come as an artist. All of the things he’s been freaking out over, I’m so excited to see him finally reap the rewards,” junior dance ma-jor Rachel Frye said. DeChristo’s self-portrait is her favorite piece in the collection. 
The exhibition was just a start for DeCristo. His dream is to branch out and sell his work to customers. “[I want] people to care enough to sponsor me,” DeCristo said. He said he can’t imagine himself doing anything else. Later down the road, he hopes to possibly become a professor relating in the field of photography.

 Post Theatre Company (PTC) will open its 2019-20 season on Oct. 2 with the play “Blue Stockings.” The plot follows the story of four women fighting for the right to graduate from Girton College at Cambridge University in 17th century England. 
Janice L. Goldberg, the director of the production provided background. “Women attending Cambridge University weren’t allowed to graduate. They could attend but wouldn’t have degrees conferred onto them. All the men could graduate but women could not,” Goldberg said. 
“Blue Stockings” has its fair share of action despite being a play about an intellectual debate. “It has all this intellectual leanings but there is also fights, dancing, drinking, romantic intrigue, a love triangle.” Goldberg said.
Lee Metaxa-Rozenfeld is a junior musical theater major who plays the lead role of Tess Moffat in the production. Metaxa-Rozenfeld described a bit about her character “[Moffat] is very curious, [and is] attending to become an astrophysicist. [She] firmly believes she has the capacity to do that, entranced by night sky and organization of stars.” Metaxa-Rozenfeld said. 
Focusing on her education, Moffat is met with a decision she never thought she’d make. “She has to choose between knowledge and love, never did she think that would be an option. She hits a wall and feels stuck.” Metaxa-Rozenfeld said. 
Matthew Sporrer is a sophomore dual major in theater arts and international relations who plays the role of Edwards. 
“Edwards is a second year student at Trinity College at Cambridge, he is going to be a geologist, he loves school but is kind of a punching bag for the other guys,” Sporrer said. This treatment comes as a result of his wanting to be included. “The other boys bully him and do things that go over his head, [and] he understands what’s happening though, they take advantage of him wanting to be a part of the group,” he continued.
In terms of the debate about women graduating, Sporrer’s character remains neutral. “He doesn’t like choosing sides, but he believes women are people,” Sporrer said. 
Francesco DiFlora is a sophomore musical theater major who plays several roles in the production. His main role is Ralph Mayhew. 
In regards to Mayhew, “He is one of the students at the school, second year student not as against the women being there as the other boys, love interest of Tess.” DiFlora said. 
Irene Poole is a junior musical theater major who plays Miss Blake. “She is a teacher at Girton [who] teaches moral science, [is] very progressive, [and stands at the] front lines of the women’s suffrage movement which is happening at the same time as the graduation movement,” Poole said.
David Kemp is a junior musical theater major who plays several roles in the play, mainly Dr. Maudsley. “He’s a leading psychiatrist of the time, at Cambrige to promote ‘Sex in Mind and in Education,’” Kemp said. “[He] gets stuck in challenging debates on degrees for women, and he takes a stand [on] why they shouldn’t have degrees.” 
The view Maudsley takes is a common one of the time that is based on the science of the period. “The theory is that humans have a limited amount of energy, and can only do so much,” Kemp said. “If a man does physical labor, it’s hard for them to do mental labor; if a woman has gone through childbirth and being a mother, then it is impossible for them to get an education since they already expended their energy.”
This concept was considered dangerous for the world, according to Kemp. “[In having] beliefs that if women get education it will affect their body so they won’t be able to have motherly instincts, would eventually be the downfall of society,” Kemp said. 
Goldberg provided further context. “It was a prevailing opinion of the day, back then this was a very common belief they were going to stay home and take care of everyone, these women being there is an affront to everything they know. Nobody’s evil,” Goldberg said.
“The playwright makes a point at the beginning to say that the men aren’t evil, this is genuinely what was believed, and the men thought it was unhealthy for women.” DiFlora said.
PTC’s production of “Blue Stockings” will show on the Little Theatre from Oct. 4 – Oct. 6 and Oct. 10 – Oct. 13. The times of the show for all shows except Oct. 6 and Oct. 13 is 7:30 p.m. The shows on Oct. 6 and Oct. 13 is 3 p.m. Ticket prices are $15 for the general public, $12 for senior citi-zens, and $10 for students with a valid ID. Tickets can be purchased at the box office or online at https://tix55.com/ptc700/.

The B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is an integral part of campus, with various resources to help students and faculty in every program. The library can also be called the campus’s best kept secret, especially for first and second year students, who are often unaware of the resources the library has to offer. 
Manju Prasad-Rao, a librarian who works in the education department, gave an overview of the library services. “We primarily service the school of education and the library upstairs, which trains students to be librarians [or] to become teachers,”she said. 
Students looking for resources to aid in their classes can find them in several formats. The library offers study prints, kits, games, digital collections, interactive ebooks and technology workshops, according to Manju. If a student can’t find a specific material in the library’s collections, the librarians can request the material from another library through an inter-library loan program. Librarians also assist with presentations and video streaming services as well. “Because we are a media center that [responsibility] fell on us,” Manju explained. 
Within the library are sections for professional studies, like when student teachers need help to plan a lesson, and a circulation section that changes about every month. Sue Ketcham, another librarian, explained how the circulation section works. “These books are always getting traded for new books. This section is usually for specialty material,” she said. 
For example, during Hispanic Heritage Month the materials in that section are in honor of the theme. “I have pulled fairy tales from different areas, so we have Spanish, Mayan, Caribbean, Mexican, and Central American, and the other side is more informational,” Ketcham said, explaining the layout. 
The circulation sections cater to students by having all related materials in one spot. The featured section can also give students a chance to read and learn about something new
