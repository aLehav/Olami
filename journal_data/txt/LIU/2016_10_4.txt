There is a good chance that you or someone you know watched the first presidential debate on Monday, Sept. 26. Over 80 million Americans across the country viewed the debate, and many more have heard, read or     re-watched it since.
The candidates went toe-to-toe and verbally duked it out for 95 minutes, covering hot topics including job creation, trade deals, race relations, the War on Terror, US foreign policy, and more.
Polls conducted after the debate came back with mixed results. A CNN/ORC poll conducted directly after the debate, polled the crowd at Hofstra University who watched the debate live. The poll found that 62 percent felt Clinton won the debate and 27 percent thought that Trump was the winner.
A poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 51 percent thought that Clinton had won the debate and 40 percent thought that Trump had won. Among those polled by Public Policy Polling, young people favored Clinton as the winner by a 39-point margin. Among women polled, Clinton was thought to be the winner by an 18-point margin, and among African Americans and Latinos, Clinton was the decided winner by a margin of 64 points.
Students have been buzzing about the debate for a week. “I didn’t see the full debate, but I saw a good chunk of it,” said James Sinclair, a junior physical education major. “After seeing it, I think Trump is very unorthodox. He’s the type of guy that would do whatever is on his mind. In this election, I’d have to vote for Clinton. Being a future teacher, I trust Hillary when it comes to education.”
Sophomore biology major Connor Dromerhauser wasn’t impressed by either candidate. “I saw the debate on Monday, I think it’s crazy that these are our two choices,” he said. “I think they have funny styles, between her style of dress and his hair. I think both candidates had their moments in the debate.”
Donald Trump’s temperament was a focal point for many students who viewed the debate on Monday. Mike Licata, a sophomore health science major, said, “The way Donald Trump speaks on impulse is concerning. A president should be cool, calm and collected. He should think before he speaks. He should think about the problems the country is facing. I’m probably [going to] vote for Hillary. I think she definitely won the debate.”
International students, who do not have the chance to vote in November, have been talking about it as well. Ahmed Faqui, a senior international business major, said, “I think Hillary won, Trump was always out of breath. If I could vote I [would] vote for Hillary.”
Ali Aomascati, a junior business management and administration major, said, “I didn’t see the debate Monday, but if I could I’d vote for Hillary because Trump would turn America upside down.” Faqui and Aomascati, both citizens of the United Arab Emirates, gave a piece of advice to their American peers to “choose wisely.”

With 1 million Samsung Galaxy Note 7s sold nationwide since the model release, only 130,000 have been returned following the recent recall on Sept. 15—due to the device catching fire in a man’s front pocket.
On Sept. 9, Florida construction worker Jonathon Strobel, 28, said that he was severely burned on his leg and thumb when his Samsung phone burst into flames while he was shopping at Costco.
Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, urged owners to power down and return their phones as soon as possible. However, no further information could be obtained. “We don’t comment on pending litigation,” Cohen said in an email.
As of Sept. 13, “Samsung has received 92 reports of batteries overheating in the United States, including 26 reports of burns and 55 reports of property damage,” U.S. safety regulators said. An official recall by the U.S. Safety Commission was filed a week after Strobel’s incident.
Because of the recent news reports about potential injury from the phones, the Office of Campus Life sent an email to all students on Sept. 19 with Director Michael Berthel’s virtual signature at the bottom. The precautionary email included a small explanation of the overheating and fire catching as well as information on returning the phone.
In a bolded, italicized statement, the email advised, “If you have a recalled device, we ask that you do not bring it onto campus or keep it in a residence hall.” There has not been any mention nor information reported of any incident on campus.
Melissa Norman, a resident junior dance major, is the only one in her group of friends with a Galaxy 7. Though she does not have the exact model that is being recalled, she is still fearful. “It’s gotten really hot before but not too often, usually only during software updates,” she said.
Reports indicate that Samsung has been very fair about refunding the device. Consumer Wendi Briones shared her experience on Facebook, praising the employees at her local Samsung store. In her post she included Samsung’s hashtag and pictures of her exploded phone. “They refunded my money in full,” she wrote. “In spite of the unfortunate incident, I am however, impressed by their after sales-support. Much respect to Samsung,” she added.
So far, only Strobel’s lawsuit has been filed to cover expenses from severe injuries, medical bills, and work compensation, according to the lawsuit filed in Florida Circuit Court, 15th District, Palm Beach County. However, 85 percent of Note 7 models that have been sold have yet to be returned.

Much was said in the debate last Monday and many were left wondering, what was true and what was not? The following are some questionable statements made by the candidates and whether they are lies or the truth.
Trump: “Ford is leaving, you see that [its] small car division, leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio, they’re all leaving.”
This quote is not true, according to NPR. The unemployment rates for Michigan and Ohio are lower than the national average. Ford CEO Mark Fields stated that zero jobs would be lost at Ford plants in Michigan, according to NPR.
Trump: “My father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built into a company that’s worth many, many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world.”
This quote is not true, according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported that Trump took out loans from his father on multiple occasions throughout the ‘70s. In total, Trump borrowed more than $6 million from his father, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Trump: “And I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the fraternal order of police which just came in.”
This quote is mostly true, according to NPR. Trump did receive the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. However, Trump received the endorsement earlier in September and not on the day of the debate (Sept. 26), according to NPR.
Trump: “[in New York City] Murders…murders are up.”
This quote is false, according to NPR. Murders in New York City have steadily decreased since the new millennium, and are relatively low when compared to the murder rated of the ‘80s and ‘90s, according to the FBI and the Brennan Center for Justice.
Clinton: “Independent experts have looked at what I’ve pro- posed and looked at what Donald has proposed. And basically they have said this — that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion dollars.”
This quote is true. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s tax plan would increase the national debt by $5.3 trillion dollars.
Clinton: [In response to Trump accusing Clinton of supporting the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement] “That is just not accu- rate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”
This is not true. Hillary Clinton did support the TPP. Clinton wrote
in her book, Hard Choices, that the TPP was the “Gold Standard” of trade deals. She called it “a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia,” according to NPR.
Clinton: “The other day I saw [Trump] saying that there were some Iranian sailors on [a] ship in the waters off of Iran and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know if they taunted our sailors I would blow them out of the water and start another war.”
This is not true, according to NPR. The actual quote of Donald Trump was “When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water, OK?” according to NPR.
Clinton: “For 40 years everyone running for president has released their tax returns.”
This quote is mostly true. Every major presidential candidate in the past 40 years has released tax returns with the one exception of Gerald Ford. Ford released a summary of his tax returns, but not the entire tax return, according to Politifact.

Thinking of joining a club on campus? PTV just might be the place for you. On Sept. 22, PTV, the campus television station, held its first meeting of the semester.
PTV allows students to create a show, independently or in a group. For those who are camera-shy, production positions are available as well. The purpose of the club is to create television shows that will be transmitted exclusively to the campus community.
Those participating in the club will make anything from short skits, mini series, one-off videos, and anything that is fun to watch. The station is on channel 3-2 on the campus TV network.
While the channel can only be streamed on campus, PTV videos can be viewed on their YouTube channel, LIUPostTV.
The club meets four times a semester, on Thursdays during common hour in room 214. Students who have an idea for a show and want to see it broadcast are invited to stop by the television studio on the second floor of Humanities Hall. Due to the amount of students that graduated last spring, membership is low. PTV usually has anywhere between 12-20 active members, according to the co-presidents of PTV, Eric Goodmark and Kaitlin Veygel.
“Being able to have the real-world feel of how a television station works would be the start of your career,” Goodmark said.
There are three basic rooms of operation in the campus television station, the studio room, control room and audio room. There is also an editing lab that offers 16 computers with editing software. Katherine Dalton, coordinator of PTV and adviser for the television club, has years of experience in the industry, from Interning at NBC’s “Late Night with Conan O’Brien” in her undergrad years to working in corporate video production post- graduation.
Dalton said that if broadcasting students don’t get involved now, they most likely won’t be able to excel in the field.
Being involved in PTV helps build confidence and prepares you for internships within your field, according to Dalton. “If you’re not putting time and effort while you’re in college then how does anyone expect you to put time and effort once you graduate?” Dalton said. Goodmark agrees, and added, “Try to make something you would want to put your name on.”

The Center for Healthy Living, open to all students, offers a variety of services including psychological counseling, nutrition counseling, as well as check-ups by a registered nurse. The services are free of charge to any and every student enrolled. The office is located in the Life Science Building, room 154.
A registered nurse is available for students who either have health issues or questions. Nurse Constance Montalbano is authorized to provide students with referrals to other facilities and can schedule an appointment for an off-campus location depending on what the issue is. Her hours are Monday through Friday, 9am-5pm. When the Center for Healthy Living is closed, or the issue cannot be remedied, NYIT Academic Health Center is available for Post students. Nurse Montalbano was unable to comment about her services.
Dr. Stacey Gropack, dean of the School of Health Professions and Nursing, said there is a shuttle available to take students who need to go see a doctor at NYIT.
Maryn Margrey, a freshman health and science major, went to Medical Services with a high fever and flu-like symptoms.
“I had a great experience with the Center for Healthy Living, even though the nurse herself couldn’t help me, she referred me to an Urgent Care in the area,” Margrey said. “I was able to get the medicine I needed and she even called me the next day to ask me how I was feeling.” The Center for Healthy Living provides individual counseling by a licensed counselor for students who are feeling stressed, overworked, or who are going through a particularly difficult time. The counseling is provided by appointment. For students who need additional guidance and/or help from medical professionals, the counselors can refer them to an outside source depending on insurance and availability.
The Center also offers Meditation Mondays in Hillwood Commons every Monday at 1 pm, and Let’s Talk Tuesdays in the End Zone every Tuesday during common hour to help students relieve stress and just relax. These are run by Center for Healthy Living staff members.
The Center for Healthy Living also provides nutritional services. This program allows for students to meet with a certified nutritionist and discuss dietary concerns, healthy lifestyles, and how to eat right on campus.
For students living in the dorms, the nutritionists can supply individual diet plans, education sessions on healthy foods, and weight management tips. For students living in apartment-style housing, or students with access to a kitchen, nutritionists provide cooking tips, food shopping advice, as well as the other services listed above. Nutritionists are available Tuesday through Friday from 10 am – 5 pm by appointment.
Students should access the center by phone, 516-299-3468, or email, Post-HealthyLiving@liu.edu. The office hours are Monday, Tuesday, and Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. And Wednesday and Thursday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Representatives from the NYIT Academic Health Center did not respond back to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the services provided for Post students at NYIT.

Between 12 and 12:30 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 2, shrieks filled the halls of Queens Residential Hall, as an apparent sighting of a clown outside a student’s window stirred the residents from their beds.
Screaming was heard just after midnight, and as the DSS security guard went to investigate a room full of musical theater girls, all of the students denied they were the source. Everyone in the hall had heard the screams, and soon the first floor and lobby were full of students.
One student from the first floor claimed that a friend had seen someone dressed as a clown outside their window. Another two students from the second floor said they had heard someone screaming, “stop, let go of me” from outside their windows.
Michael Berthel, associate dean of students and director of Campus Life, referred to any clowns being involved as mere rumors. “This was not substantiated with any official sighting,” Berthel said. “Out of an abundance of caution, Public Safety and Campus Life staff conducted additional rounds of the campus.”
Students were instructed to return to their rooms as security and the RAs checked to make sure everyone was in their rooms. Public Safety was on their way.
“It was spooky,” said Allie Wise, a freshman marketing and environmental science major. “But public safety handled the situation well.”
Public Safety members were patrolling the campus in unmarked cars, and DSS security ensured the students that everything would be fine and sent them back to bed.
That didn’t stop several groups of students of several residence halls from forming parties and “clown hunting” around campus, armed with baseball bats.
“On Monday during common hour, a student was completing a project for a broad-casting class and entered Hillwood Commons with a clown mask on,” Berthel added. “When asked, the student removed the mask without incident.”

For most people, the food situation in developing African countries is a picture on the news of UN employees handing out bags of food to a crowd of starving people. For Dr. Barbra Shorter of the nutrition department, and Allison Herries, graduate student in nutrition, this summer made their picture into a real-life experience.
Shorter led a group of students, including Herries, on an excursion to northeast Tanzania. The destination of the trip was Tumani Junior School in the town of Karatu, in the Arusha Region. The goal was to improve the nutrition situation and learn about malnutrition. The group hoped to improve the situation not in classic   aid-way, but through knowledge and education.
According to Shorter, it is not only the richness of food in an area that determines the nutrition status but also the level of education and knowledge.
Data from UNICEF shows that child underweight is at the “unacceptable level” of 16 percent in Tanzania, even though many regions have high food production, which emphasizes Shorter’s thought. Therefore, the group spent time sharing their knowledge about nutrition by educating the 900 students and staff at the school.
“We also examined the school’s meal plan to determine if the elementary school aged children had any gaps in their diets,” Herries said. Although the group was able to give some advice, like adding soy flour to foods to boost consumption of proteins, Herries explained that there are many factors to consider when trying to find a solution. Apart from nutrition, the maintenance of integrity of traditional foods, culture and the economics all have to be taken into account.
The data that was gathered over the summer is now being analysed and recommendations about an improved meal plan will be sent to the school, according to Shorter.
Other than volunteering at the school, the group was able to spend spare time experiencing the local environment and culture. There were chances to go on safari and to visit Kilimanjaro, but according to Herries, the best thing about the trip was meeting all the people from Tanzania. “Everyone was very warm and welcoming and wanted to get to know you. There were all happy to share their culture and their language.”
Back in a country where too little food is not the major health problem, Shorter is already planning the next trip. During the summer of 2017, a new group will be given the chance to go to Tanzania, this time as a faculty-led study abroad class. This will enable the participants to receive credits for the work. Applications will be accepted in the begin- ning of 2017.
Shorter admits that the cost can be an issue, but hopes that admissions would lower the tuition fee. Herries agrees, “Traveling is something all students should experience as part of their college education and it shouldn’t be reserved for only those who can afford it.”
She, nonetheless, encourages students to apply. “It will be a once in a lifetime experience that they won’t regret. There is so much that you can learn from traveling that can’t be taught in a classroom setting.”

What is success to you? Is it a six-figure sum after five years from graduating college? Working in the hectic and ruthless environment of Wall Street? Having a big house? What about that glorious Aston Martin?
I have had two or three conversations this week with students and professors, who have asked the question of ‘what do you want to achieve, or what’s your plan after you graduate?’ As a philosophy major, how do you answer this question?
I replied, “I want to understand and learn about life, I want to acquire vast amounts of knowledge of what reality really is and what it means to actually be alive.” If they didn’t laugh, or smile, they turned their heads and said “interesting…”
The immediacy of certainty and the attitude of security are overwhelmingly apparent in our society, especially in New York. So many students here want to be rich, want to earn loads of money, because money is security, money is ‘success.’ But it is? Is making a five-year plan, with the end goal of six-figure salaries really the meaning and true aspiration of life? I am not so convinced.
How many people do you talk to, who have gone into business and shared the same capitalistic goals as you, and have said, “I love life! I love my job! I am drinking this beer or smoking this joint, not to escape my nightmares and stressful working life, but just because I want to live, and love?”
Now, I am not suggesting that you don’t need any money, and you should be a complete hippy, no, no. I really understand that you need to earn money to live in today’s society, in this western bubble, which we are all in. I completely understand that we need to consume (buying things is one thing most of us are all great at).
However the need to have everything— this greedy attitude of purchasing products and fabric, cars and houses, consuming unfathomable amounts of food, buying the latest watch— doesn’t need to be at the forefront of our lives.
For me, becoming a better person is key; learning how to actually ‘Be,’ and understanding life not only from a philosophical point of view but also from a humanistic point of view. We don’t have to follow this capitalistic and consumeristic reality, when we can, in fact, discover actuality.
The end goal is happiness. Be happy with whatever you do, don’t let things kick you down for longer then they need to. Actually, screw that. Don’t let things bother you so much that it ruins your day or week. Feel blessed with what you have and what you have the potential to do. We are all students, most of us are going to get degrees…we have an unbelievable library where we can all study anything we want to study. We are in a place that literally can open any one of those infinite doors.
Maybe the door of corporate development, or a huge salary where you have to wear an expensive suit (otherwise you don’t ‘fit in’) isn’t the right one to open. How about opening that door, way, way down the line of infinite openings? Yes, you may have to really wrench this door open by learning and acquiring knowledge and wisdom. It might be a painful journey, but breaking free from the chains of materialism of this reality that we have created might just be the ticket to success—the ticket to happiness and understanding.
As Plato said, “if the prisoners are released and disabused of their error, at first when any of them is liberated and compelled, suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state, he had seen the shadows.”
Allow yourself to be blinded by the light of true reality and discover all the extraordinary and absolutely wonderful things that we could experience and achieve, without sitting at a desk and being disappointed by a $2000 bonus, because you wanted MORE.
Live life to its fullest and truly grab it with both arms; the possibilities of success with an attitude such as this are of implausible abundance. I promise you.

While the final traces of those long summer days begin to slip away, students reluctantly give way to the cool autumn breeze and the six-o’clock sunset. Although autumn doesn’t offer spring’s new life and summer’s late nights, the season on Long Island does have its perks.
A Fun Time During the Day Time
Unfortunately, the beach couldn’t make the list for climatic reasons; however, it’s still warm enough outside to get the best of Long Island’s rural side. Train stations and bus routes give way to pumpkin patches and corn mazes. Elwood Pumpkin Farm, off Jericho Turnpike in Huntington, and Glover Farms Corn Maze, on Horseblock Road in Brookhaven, are just a couple of places where you can enjoy a brisk autumn day with a group of friends, or your significant other.
If you’re more of the adventurous, outdoorsy type, perhaps it’s time to take advantage of the 200+ miles of Long Island’s hiking trails. Garvies Point in Glen Cove, David Weld Sanctuary in Nissequogue, Caumsett State Park in Huntington and the Muttontown Preserve in East Norwich are some of the places that offer to          de-stress your fall semester. A walk through Long Island’s wild areas allows you to explore, de-stress, and appreciate some fresh air, while also getting some good exercise.
Do It for the Thrill
When some college students hear that phrase, it could mean something is about to happen that our parents would not approve of. However, Long Island’s Halloween-inspired theme parks have visitors from across the tri-state area for good reason.
NYZ Apocalypse, located in Deer Park, is operating every October weekend from 4 p.m. -11 p.m. NYZ Apocalypse offers a unique, interactive survival experience. Visitors are forced to find a way out of an underground prison complex while attempting to escape zombies. At $40 per person, NYZ Apocalypse is a sure-bet for a great time.
If you’re into Halloween but not into fearing for your life, the Bayville Scream Park is probably the place for you. Located on the North Shore, Bayville Scream Park offers six attractions: Bloodmouth Haunted Mansion, Uncle Needles Funhouse of Fear in 3D and Evil in the Wood considered the top three of the scream park’s most heralded.
A little more on the ‘PG-13’ side, the scream park offers a fun time filled with thrills and chills, but not to the point where you’ll find yourself running out of the park. Tickets for the full attraction combo start at $49.75, but you can upgrade to the VIP Speedpass for $63.75.
Historical Sites & Museums for a Rainy Day
Prior to the First World War, Long Island’s North Shore, also known as the “Gold Coast,” fielded some of America’s leading real estate. If you’re into architecture and political history, you may want to check out the Sagamore Hill National Site, also known as “The Summer White House,” from when the estate served as Theodore Roosevelt’s vacation house.
Located in Oyster Bay, the Sagamore Historical Site is free and features historic farms, orchards, and a nature trail to the beaches of Cold Spring Harbor. If you wish to tour the Roosevelt home, the cost is $10.
Huntington features a historic estate of its own, too. Built in 1919, Oheka Castle is one of America’s largest estates, according to Travel- Channel.com. Coming in at 115,000 square feet, and boasting 117 guest rooms, the estate now serves primarily as a catering hall/hotel. You can tour Long Island’s largest castle for $25.
Shopping On the Island
Long Island offers a wide selection in shopping. Roosevelt Field Mall ranks 10th in America’s Top-10 biggest shopping malls, according to the TravelChannel.com. Not to mention the Tanger outlets in Deer Park and Riverhead, and the upscale Americana Mall in Manhasset.

Matt Wilson, a professor of music, 2011 Grammy nominee for Best Classical Crossover Album and co-director of the Post Jazz Combo, will curate the upcoming Jazz on Stage concert series on Sunday, Oct. 9, at the Tilles Center.
This second season of Jazz on Stage will feature the Jimmy Heath Quartet, which has composed 12 CDs and has played with leg- endary artists such as Miles Davis, Nancy Wilson, and John Coltrane, according to www.tillescenter.org.
“Jimmy Heath will work with the jazz students at Post from 11:15-12:30 followed by a pre-concert talk with the audience that is open to the public from 2:15-2:45. Finally, there will be a 70-minute concert at 3:00,” Wilson said.
The audience will be able to sit on the stage and will be “in the shoes of the performers,” according to Wilson. Wilson feels this seating arrangement is a great way for audiences to initiate a relationship with the artist because the audience has a first-hand opportunity to listen to their stories, learn about their history, and ask questions to the artist.
This is Wilson’s fourth year teaching at Post. Besides co-directing the Jazz Combo with Sean Fitzpatrick, he also teaches private drum lessons and founded the Sonic Pioneers two years ago with Fitzpatrick. The Sonic Pioneers, one of two jazz combos at Post, played at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland last year.
“We have a really nice jazz faculty at Post and I am really proud of my colleagues and the support of the department, especially Jennifer Miceli, the chairperson of the department of music,” Wilson said.
Wilson also teaches at The New School in Manhattan, Sara Lawrence in Bronxville, and at the Prins Claus Conservatory in Groningen, Holland for one week a term. “I am appreciative of the opportunities I have been presented,” Wilson said, adding that he is “proud of the students at Post, music wise.”
Wilson said that he is currently working on a new record on the poetry of Carl Sandburg. “I have created the settings for Mr. Sandburg with poems as lyrics, songs with recitation and songs based on the mood and imagery of the text,” he said.
Wilson has plenty of advice to offer students interested in studying music. “Students have to want to learn and ask questions,” he said. “Music is a great discipline, so you have to learn about the history and about other musicians. New York City is a great center of music and it’s in such close proximity to Long Island.”
Wilson likes to remain fresh so he surrounds himself with people who can challenge him and keep him on his toes. “Whatever you do, you have to want to be dedicated and want to continue to learn,” he said.
Although he grew up in Illinois, Wilson wanted to be a part of the New York jazz music community growing up and has worked hard at building this community.
Tickets for Jazz on Stage with Matt Wilson can be purchased for $40 at www.ticketmaster.com.

On Sept. 26, the department of music in the School of Performing Arts and the Tilles Center hosted a convocation with award-winning singer, songwriter and composer Duncan Sheik. Nearly 100 students who attended the event learned about Sheik’s career path, heard him perform with some of their peers, and asked questions.
Born on Nov. 18, 1969, Sheik always loved music. His grandmother, who attended Juilliard, began teaching him how to play piano when he was only six. Even though he loved music, Sheik ended up attending Brown University for semiotics, the study of meaning-making, sign processes and meaningful communication.
However, his love of music never left and he moved to Los Angeles post-graduation to pursue his passion for music.
In 1996, Sheik released his first album, “Duncan Sheik.” One song from this album, “Barely Breathing,” became an instant hit, remaining on the Billboard Hot 100 for 55 consecutive weeks, and earning Sheik a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. Since then, Sheik has released seven other albums, none of which have achieved as much notoriety.
Sheik is also a talented composer. His best-known work is the Broadway musical, “Spring Awakening.” Based on the play “The Awakening of Spring” by Frank Wedekind, “Spring Awakening” follows the story of teenagers in late-19th-century Germany as they discover their sexualities, and “coming of age.” Sheik wrote the music, while Steven Sater wrote the lyrics and screenplay. “Spring Awakening” won eight Tony Awards, including Best Orchestration and Best Musical, and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.
At the convocation, Sheik performed a number from “Spring Awakening,” titled, “Don’t Do Sadness/Blue Wind,” as well as an original song, “Half a Room.” For both numbers, Sheik was accompanied by the Post String Ensemble, conducted by music professor Maureen Haynes.
“It [performing with Sheik] was a very honoring experience. He was a very relaxed and cool guy who was extremely excited to work with us,” said Brandon Allen, a freshman who plays the violin in the string ensemble. “He got to tell us his background and how he got to where he is now so it was very inspiring. It gives me more hope that if I continued doing what I love with perseverance, it will definitely be possible to live out my dreams.”
Katie Hicks, a freshman musical theatre student, also attended the event. “I wanted to attend the event because I really adore ‘Spring Awakening’ and have an interest in learning to compose music,” she said. “I learned that eclecticism is not a bad thing when it comes to music. Having a mixture of genres makes you unique, and that’s okay. It’s like the quote ‘jack of all trades, master of none, but better than a master of one.’”
Sheik expressed his love for speaking with students after the event. “I feel slightly self-conscious doing
it, but it is really fun to have these conversations and hear the questions that college students have about their process and where they’re at, whether they’re an actor or a singer or a musician or a producer, it’s just really great to have that back and forth with students. I just find it incredibly enjoyable,” he said.
Sheik’s biggest piece of advice to the students in the room was, “It’s really important for you to find the music or the thing that is truly exciting to you, personally, and that you own it in a very original, independent way because that’s what going to set you apart from everyone else and make people excited about who you are as an artist.”

Ariana Grande has been in the news recently, especially after a donut-licking incident. The “Love Me Harder” singer decided to go the mature root for this album.
Dangerous Woman is comprised of 12 songs (the deluxe version comes with two extra songs). Grande starts the album off with a song that was meant to be on her previous album but didn’t make the cut. She sings of finding a love that she never though she could find to “till she met him with the moonlight.”
She then switches up the flow of the album by introducing her dangerous self. In “Dangerous Woman,” she belts about how he makes her feel like a dangerous woman and makes her do things she normally wouldn’t.
Later on in the album she teams up with Nicki Minaj for the reggae-inspired track, “Side to Side.” Grande sings about riding bicycles that make her walk side to side, while Nicki Minaj reminds listeners that she is the “Queen of Rap,” and even lets it be known that “Ariana runs pop.”
She ends off the album by telling a past lover that she misses the romance they had before and just continues to think about him. Overall, Grande has solidified to her audience that she’s more than just a teen pop star and that she’s also a grown woman who is going to continue living a “Dangerous Lifestyle.”

Before the match against Pace University on Thursday, Sept. 29, the Pioneers earned the no. 1 overall ranking as voted on in the National Field Hockey Coaches Association Division II Poll.
As for the game itself, the Pioneers handled the Setters easily and won 4-1 to improve to 7-0 on the season. The Pioneers got on the board early in the match thanks to a score on a penalty stroke. Freshman midfielder Arantxa Rosainz Caloca notched the first of her two goals in the tenth minute to put the Pioneers on top. The
Setters got their opportunity to even the score in the same way, but senior goalie Ericka Parks blocked the shot, keeping the Pioneers in front. The 1-0 score held until halftime.
In the later half, the Pioneers were again awarded a penalty stroke and senior midfielder Steph Mocerino buried the shot to double the Pioneers’ advantage. After that tally, sophomore forward/midfielder Emily Miller and Rosainz Caloca followed up with scores to widen the gap for the Green and Gold.
The Setters got on the board in the 60th minute to make it 4-1, but did very little to make the Pioneers sweat late in the game. The shot total spoke for itself; the Pioneers held a 21-10 advantage in that department.
After the match, Head Coach Raenee Savin said of her team’s surge of success, “We continue to take it one day at a time and focus on only the game ahead of us.” She added, “The coaching staff continues to make sure the team never underestimates their opponents and that they stay grounded, even with all of the excitement we have surrounding our recent success.”
The Pioneers continued their quest for a perfect season when they welcomed no. 7-ranked Saint Anselm College into Brookville, N.Y., for an NE-10 conference showdown on Saturday, Oct. 1. The Pioneers were pushed to the limit, but, like every other match this season, came out victorious.
With the win, the Pioneers improved to 8-0 overall and 4-0 in conference play and knocked off the Hawks from Saint Anselm College who came into the match tied atop in the conference standings. The visitors dropped to 8-2 and 3-1 in NE-10 play.
The Pioneers battled all afternoon and were awarded with a dramatic 2-1 overtime win although early on, it seemed like another classic Pioneer victory. The Green and Gold struck first; this time, junior defender Grace Ilias sent a backhand swing passed the keeper for the one-goal lead in the 11th minute. The Pioneers were denied another scoring chance by an effective defensive play, but held the 1-0 lead at the halftime whistle.
In the second half, the Hawks got the equalizer from junior defender Erin Collins and suddenly the game was tied. As time ticked on, regulation was not enough to decide a winner and overtime was necessary to settle the battle. The game was screaming out for a hero from both sides and junior forward Kaycee Zelkovsky played it, firing the game-winning, walk-off goal to keep the Pioneers’ loss column clean.
The field hockey team will try to go 9-0 when it faces-off against Adelphi University from Garden City, N.Y. on Wednesday, Oct. 5. Game time is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Thanks to a relentless ground game and an effective performance from the defensive unit, the Pioneers won a fifth straight game and toppled no. 15-ranked Assumption College on Saturday, Oct. 1, in an NE-10 tilt from Worcester, Mass.
The Pioneers struck first when last week’s hero, sophomore kicker Joey Tolgyesi, nailed a 40-yard field goal to put the Pioneers on the board. Tolgyesi was called on again in the second quarter to convert another kick, this time five yards further out. Same result. The Pioneers, although disappointed with settling for field goals, held a 6-0 lead at the 13-minute mark in the second quarter.
The Pioneer lead disappeared quickly though, as the Greyhounds took the lead on a 36-yard touchdown on a drive that started with a short field. After going up 7-6, the hosts added a trifecta to make it 10-6 with four minutes and change left on the clock before halftime.
The Pioneers, who struggled to move the ball into the red-zone up to that point, put together one of their best drives of the day and it was led by Malik Pierre who scored the go-ahead touchdown on the aforementioned drive. The sophomore running back rushed for 30 yards and also corralled a pass for 26 yards to set himself up for the one-yard score; making it 12-10 in favor of the Pioneers.
After a scoreless third quarter, 15 minutes would decide a winner. The Greyhounds made the first move and went ahead on an eight-yard touchdown pass, and took an 18-12 lead courtesy of a successful two-point conversation.
With nine minutes left and a six-point hole, the Pioneer offense went to work. Senior halfback David White was an integral part of the drive, participating on six of the first seven plays and picking up key first downs in the process. On a critical fourth down and two, senior quarterback Jeff Kidd took it upon himself and picked up 17 yards to get to the Assumption six-yard line. Two plays later, redshirt sophomore receiver Michael Hartgrove took the handoff and found the end zone for the go-ahead score.
Although the Pioneers left five minutes plus on the clock, the Greyhounds managed little on the Pioneer defense, which stepped up big time all day. The defense forced nine punts, which gave the offense short fields and also forced four turnovers. Redshirt junior defensive back Jared Chester had a team-high 11 tackles and an interception, while redshirt defensive lineman Jess Agbotse amassed seven tackles and disrupted two passes.
Kidd finished 21-40 for 191 yards with no touchdowns and no picks while also accumulating 64 yards on the ground. Pierre was a dual-threat, rushing for 62 yards and a score and also leading the team in receiving with 67 yards.
The Pioneers’ 19-18 victory is the fifth straight, and three of their next four games are at home. Head Coach Bryan Collins and his team return to Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium when they host Saint Anselm College for Homecoming on Saturday, Oct. 8. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.

The dictionary definition of “undefeated” is ‘to overcome in a contest, election, battle, etc.; prevail over; vanquish. Three Pioneer fall sports teams share this quality, and to their credit own clean loss columns more than a month into the season.
The football team, led by Head Coach Bryan Collins is 5-0 on the season and is outscoring its opponents, 154-94. The Pioneers have an average winning margin of 12 points. The Pioneers’ run game has been the strength of its offense so far, totaling 812 yards as compared to only 571 yards given up by the defense. This rushing attack is led by senior quarterback Jeff Kidd with his 340 total yards; and the backfield tandem of David White and Malik Pierre have 334 and 241 yards, respectively.
The Pioneer defense has also been stout all year, getting seven interceptions compared to throwing just three. The Pioneers are averaging almost two sacks per game and have accumulated three game-changing safeties. Part of the recipe for winning is limiting the damage and the Pioneer defense has held the opponents under 21 points in four out of five games.
As well as the Pioneers have performed on the gridiron, as outstanding they have been on the soccer pitch. The men’s team is 9-0 and ranked No. 8 in the country for Division II. The sheer dominance of the Green Machine is seen in goals and shots attempts slash line. The Pioneers have amassed 28 goals on 178 shots as compared to just three goals allowed on 64 shots.
The defense has been incredible, allowing only three scores and all in three separate matches. After winning each of their first two games 2-1, the Pioneers have allowed one goal in seven meetings. That’s pretty good. The Pioneers also have six shutouts, which has made life very easy for senior keeper Jesper Malmstrom who owns an .875 save percentage in 637 minutes in goal.
As well as both the football and men’s soccer teams have played, even they have to marvel at the success of the field hockey team. The No. 1-ranked Pioneers are 8-0 and have victories over three top-10-ranked teams in the country.
The Pioneers own a nearly 4:1 goal ratio over their opponents and have used that to power their victories. The Pioneers’ offense has been strong, scoring almost three goals a game, but the defense has been a calling card. The opposition is averaging 0.75 goals a game. It’s pretty hard to win a game when you can’t score; the Pioneer opponents know this all too well.
While all teams have had success to open up the season, the fact that they are all doing it in similar ways with their defense is remarkable. When the offense is a little sluggish, the defense has been there to keep the game in hand for every team.
All three teams have championship aspirations and they are certainly off to a fantastic start; heck, you literally couldn’t ask for a better start.

Forty-five seconds was all it took for the no. 8-ranked men’s soccer team to show its superiority against Wilmington University on Saturday, Oct. 1, when senior midfielder Alex Hailes connected with sophomore midfielder Charlie Ledula for one of the fastest goals in Pioneer history.
The opening 45 seconds was a preview of what was to come, as the Pioneers routed Wilmington on their way to another shutout victory, 4-0. Playing as a striker, senior back Joey Forgaard provided the tools necessary for the second goal when he headed a pass from junior midfielder Harry Pearse into the mesh.
Although the team was up two goals, the Pioneers didn’t let up and added two more. Ledula, who scored the opening goal, notched another tally in the 23rd minute, and provided the assist 15 minutes later on a goal by Pearse.
The match was decided early on as evidence by the shots on goal in the first half, which favored the Pioneers by a wide margin. (Nearly half of the Pioneers shots were converted for goals in the first 45 minutes). The two-headed monster in goal of seniors, Jesper Malmstrom and Brian McPartland, held the opposition scoreless for the sixth time in the last seven matches.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his team are back in action on Saturday, Oct. 8, when they hit the road to play Mercy College in an East Coast Conference battle. Kickoff is scheduled for 3 p.m.
