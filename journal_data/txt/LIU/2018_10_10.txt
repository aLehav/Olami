“Beginning in the 2019-20 academic year, LIU will compete in all sports at the NCAA Division I level, with a unified athletics program that will join our campuses into One LIU,” university president Kimberly Cline wrote in an email announcement to the LIU community on Wednesday, Oct. 3, halfway into the fall 2018 season, and two weeks after the academic add/ drop period deadline on Sept. 18.
“The unification of the Division I and Division II athletic teams into a more robust Division I program will have long term benefits for LIU and the Northeast Conference from an athletic, academic and community standpoint,” NEC commissioner Noreen Morris said during an LIU press conference at the New York Athletic Club on Oct. 3.
Along with seven Post sports teams being elevated from Division II to Division I, the LIU Post basketball (men’s and women’s), women’s bowling, women’s fencing, softball, women’s swimming, track & field (men’s and women’s), and women’s volleyball teams will move to the Brooklyn campus, where a multipurpose athletic facility will begin construction in 2019. New women’s ice hockey and water polo teams will be added in Brooklyn.
The LIU Post football team will move to the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the lower of the two Division I levels. Football players are excited about the change, as they will not be losing their positions. LIU Brooklyn has no football team, and their stadium will be renovated to meet Division I regulations.
The announcement, which emphasized the unity of the individual athletics programs into “One LIU,” has rocked student athletes on the Post campus. For many of the Pioneers, this is not exciting news.
All Post sports teams play under the NCAA Division II, as they have since their inception. The sudden announcement of the transition to Division I in the middle of the current season has caused distress and uncertainty among many Post athletes about their future athletic and academic careers. Post students will have to re-tryout for positions on the new Division I rosters, competing with current LIU Brooklyn students and freshmen recruits for those same spots next year.
Sports that are combining include basketball (men’s and women’s), soccer (men’s and women’s), baseball, softball and women’s lacrosse. The men’s lacrosse and men’s cross country will move to the Northeast Conference.
Ashley Melendez, a senior childhood and early education major, was one of the unhappy students on the softball team. “We could not believe the news. We were all heartbroken that this selfish decision was made without even speaking to any of the athletes,” she said. “We were completely blindsided and devastated that this selfish act is going to break our family apart.”
An FAQ page posted on Oct. 3 on the new one.liu.edu, or athletics.liu.edu website addresses questions about the change. The question of Post athletes being able to continue their positions in the Division I teams has student athletes most concerned. According to the site, the athletics department “will personally work with each individual student-athlete to review all potential opportunities athletically and academically within the new athletic department.”
Newsday reported on Wednesday, Oct. 3 that, “LIU teams will draw athletes from both campuses,” but, “the 2019- 20 rosters will be decided at the discretion of each team.”
Many Post athletes, who qualified for Division II sports, fear they will not make the new teams. “There’s a chance that we might get cut. We don’t know anything; we don’t know
if we are going to keep our coach. We literally have nothing,” Jillian Lomanto, a junior education major and member of the lacrosse team, said. Without further information, Lomanto believes nothing about their team will remain the same.
The method and timing of the announcement were questioned by students and faculty. Many athletes feel underappreciated. “When the president announced it, she didn’t take the athletes’ feelings into consideration. She literally just said this is fine, she’s getting paid for this. It’s the athletes who are getting hurt right now,” Lomanto said.
The students are also concerned about their coaches. “It’ll be very hard if my coach is not the same coach [for women’s lacrosse]. If she’s [Coach Megan McNamara] not the coach, none of us are going to be playing,” Katelyn Politi, a sophomore elementary education and special education major, said.
International student-athletes were especially concerned. Those who were recruited internationally were either signed into a contract to play in Division II, or can only play in Division II based on their semi-professional athletic careers in their home countries before enrolling at LIU Post. Multiple Post teams, such as the women’s and men’s soccer teams, have rosters comprised of mainly international players.
The unified sports teams will have an even bigger impact on campus. The school’s colors will change from the Pioneers green and gold and the Blackbirds blue and black, to a unified blue and gold. The cost of replacing and redesigning the signs and facilities, including the upgrade of both campus athletic facilities, the Bethpage Credit Union Stadium and new uniforms, apparel and signage on both campuses, could be high.
The Bethpage Credit Union Stadium will receive a makeover, with upgraded grandstands to improve sight lines for fans, and to meet Division I standards. “This project will make Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium among the most modern facilities of its size on the East Coast and provide an ideal game day environment for our student-athletes and supporters,” according to a statement on the athletics.liu.edu site.
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services for both campuses, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the timing, execution and price of these projects.
Unifying the university athletic departments under Division I could help increase the profile of the school, as LIU’s administration stated in the statement announcing the change, however it will come with sacrifices, according to multiple students and faculty members.
“What’s stunning about the LIU announcement is the consolidation of sports from two autonomous campuses, one Division I and one Division II, with different colors and mascots, and telling roughly half the 1,600 student-athletes that they’ll no longer have an athletics future at LIU,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of history, said. “We’re forcing them to compete against each other for roster spots. I can’t imagine that a ‘Hunger Games’ scenario like that happens very often.”
Hiatt believes there was an unspoken reason for the merger. “The timing of the announcement also was a slap in the face to athletes. The slick ‘One LIU’ branding didn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Why didn’t the administration make this announcement at least last spring or summer to give students the chance to find another school? With another small freshman class of 550 students or so, was this to avoid worsening our enrollment crisis? And why do this after the add/drop period? If we care about our students, we should allow them a full tuition refund if they choose to leave LIU right now. That’s the least we can do. If I were a parent, I’d be asking for that for my child,” Hiatt said.
Lacrosse player Politi agrees with Hiatt on the timing. “I don’t think [the administration] did it in the right way,” she said. “Especially for people recruited over the summer. They didn’t tell them and [the recruited students] make decisions [on where to go to school] and they had no idea that they were going from a D.2 to a D.1 program, which is a huge difference.”
Students and faculty believe that the change had been planned for some time. “If they knew about [this change] for years, they should’ve told us the summer of 2018 so people had time to digest this new information, instead of telling teams during and right
before their seasons,” Veronica Saager, a junior special education major and member of the women’s soccer team, said.
“If I was a freshman, I might look into transferring,” Lomanto said.
Student athletes are still debating their next steps. Students have created several protests on social media, including a petition that now has over three thousand signatures and a not.my.liu.post Instagram page that has over 400 followers.

Student athletes left their classes en masse halfway through the period on Wednesday, Oct. 3, to attend a mandatory emergency meeting to discuss the effects of the “One LIU” athletic department merger that was announced via email by President Kimberly Cline. The meeting cut through two morning classes between 10:30 and 11 a.m., disrupting lesson plans and lectures by professors all over campus.
“I may, perhaps, be a little biased, but it would seem that taking students out of a class to address this, rather than addressing it during common hour, regularly scheduled practice, or even a Friday (thus holding off the overall announcement by two days) would have been less disruptive to the academic aspect of the campus,” said Professor Michele Dornisch, in an email to faculty later that day. “I know this is but a minor aspect of what is the focus of college campuses, but yet, I would personally have had a much better day if more of my students would have come to class and fewer of my students would have been obsessing about their future as an athlete during my course,” she continued.
Several other professors voiced concerns for their students and lamented the disruption of their classes.
“My student athletes have been heartbroken, and I have had to stop teaching in order to talk to them and listen to their sorrows,” Dr. Joan Digby, English professor of 50 years and director of the Honors College, said in an email to faculty. “We are going to lose a great number of high-end students as a result of this inconceivable decision,” she wrote.
Some student-athletes faced backlash from leaving class. One student, who wishes not to be named for fear of jeopardizing their position on their team, said a professor threatened to fail them and their fellow student-athlete classmates if they left class to attend the meeting. They left regardless.
The last minute announcements were not only happening to students; coaches, too, were only informed the day of.
“[The administration] literally told our coaches 10 minutes before they were supposed to tell all the athletes,” said Jillian Lomanto, a junior education major and member of the women’s lacrosse team. “We didn’t go to our 11 o’clock [classes]. They didn’t have any answers for us whatsoever. I don’t know where I’m going next fall. I don’t know if I’m going to play next fall. It’s crazy,” she continued.
As registration for classes in the spring 2019 semester approaches, athletes are struggling to figure out what they should do, both in their academic and athletic careers. In a letter to The Pioneer, President Cline wrote that, “the University is putting students first by honoring all current scholarships to student-athletes through their graduation. We take the ‘student’ in ‘student-athlete’ very seriously, and we will work one-on-one to ensure all student-athletes graduate on-time, with a LIU diploma.”
“Setting aside all else, it would seem that anyone would have realized the social and emotional, if not academic, repercussions of the One LIU email on athletes,” Dornisch said. “The meeting could then have been scheduled at a more opportune time, and students could have been given the chance to process the information and then have a subsequent question/answer session with those who made the decision to move to Division I athletics.”
Teams have been meeting throughout the week to discuss the players’ next steps in the coming year, though things remain unclear.

A petition that started on Change.org on Oct. 3 raises awareness about the impact the OneLIU announcement has on students. Natalie Hickman, a sophomore criminal justice major and basketball player, started the petition entitled, “Save all athletic teams and coaches who are getting cut or fired due to the LIU merge.”
As of 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the petition has received more than three thousand signatures.
The petition states, “All of us [are] left with no team to play on next year. The poor coaches however were told to find new jobs all in the matter of one morning. When we asked questions, no one seemed to have the answers and the people who made this decision that greatly affects our future were nowhere to be found.
Our highly successful teams that have brought countless numbers of victories for LIU didn’t seem to matter to the university anymore. Our lifestyle, all we’ve ever know was ripped from us and no one seemed to even fight for us, so we must fight for ourselves and our coaches who have put so much into each and every athletic program. I’m reaching out in hopes anyone can help or raise awareness about how absolutely horrible and disgusting this is. Please take the time to help all of us so we can continue to be student-athletes.”
President Kimberly Cline did not respond in time to The Pioneer’s inquiries about the petition.
The original goal was to reach 500 signatures. Now with students, family members, faculty and alumni signing, the new goal is five thousand. Hickman started the petition the day after the announcement of the athletic department merger.
“Our goal is to help raise awareness and show how many people are backing all the student athletes and coaches that have been affected. Hopefully if we can get enough supporter[s] we can find a better solution for everyone,” she said. “I came to Post to not only fulfill my dreams of being a college athlete but also because of my coach. She is so helpful, caring, and has everyone’s best interests at heart which can be rare to find in this highly competitive environment.”
Julia McCloe, a sophomore music theater student who is not a student athlete, believes the change to Division I will have negative consequences on academics and lead to further whitewashing of the university’s image.
“I think that because of this change other departments will continue to be further neglected. All of the money will continue to be poured into sports, rather than updating academic facilities,” she said. “This change tells me that Post’s priorities are only to have a good image and to make money. They don’t care how the students are affected by these changes, as long as it continues to look good to everyone outside of the university. That way, people will keep coming, and [administrators] at Post will benefit,” she added.
Ashley Melendez, a senior childhood education major and women’s softball team member, is upset about the change and the disastrous impact it could have on students and their work. Because she is graduating in May, the change will not impact her, yet she is concerned about her teammates.
“This is awful; the change is horrendous and selfish; my teammates now have to go through the whole process of getting recruited again, worrying about majors and credits, being transferred and things like that,” she said.
The move is “a complete fraud,” according to Michael Soupios, professor of political science and president of the faculty union. “This is about budgetary failure, not image enhancement. Students and coaches are being sacrificed to cover for enrollment shortfalls as were a large number of faculty this past spring,” he said. “Shame on the administration and on our Board of Trustees who tolerate such injustice,” he said. “Pretending there is no budgetary problem is an attempt to make the [administration] look good – these are the same thing. Think money, think politics, think smoke and mirrors.”
Dr. Joan Digby, director of the Honors College and an English professor for 50 years at Post, wrote to her fellow faculty members expressing her disappointment about the emotional impact of the change.
“How the university could, in the same year [as announcing the launch of the vet tech program and Veterinary College], decide to change its commitment to athletes is beyond me. I know that in the Honors College I will lose a significant number of students who cannot afford to take a degree at Post unless they are funded by athletic scholarships,” Digby said.
Digby further critiqued what she considers a great “sports fantasy” that was behind the new Division I push. “I love athletes, and I love the combination of athletes and Honors. I have played tennis for 40 years. I have written about my commitment to athletes in Honors in national journals, so please don’t think I am opposed to sports. But Division I sports is way beyond our financial grasp when we already have other costly academic programs and a Veterinary College in the works. I’m worried,” she wrote.
Digby encourages those affected to push back. “First the coaches kick the P.E. department out of Pratt. Outrageous. Now the coaches are themselves about to be fired. Also outrageous. There comes a time when we need to rise up against plans that are going to destroy us,” she said.
Dr. Barbara Fowles, professor and previous department chair of communication and film, shared stories of students’ suffering as a result of the change.
“I also have met with tearful students, who will, no doubt, want to transfer next year. One is a student from Sweden who arrived in the U.S. in September as a freshman to play women’s soccer. She is likely to be cut because of this move, since she is both young and small,” she said. She further noted the expenses that would be created from this OneLIU change. “Two cheerleaders in one of my classes told me that, because of the new colors, they have to replace their uniforms, which were new and which cost hundreds of dollars. They get no help with this expense. It’s outrageous and mean.”
Surprisingly, many football players, according to Fowles, have objected to the change. “They are sad for their athlete friends on other teams, and they feel quite sure they will be slaughtered in D. 1, while they are doing well now.”
Willie Hiatt, associate professor of Latin American history, sees the OneLIU change as indicative of Post’s failure. “The sense on campus is that this move was done purely to cut costs during a financial crisis. As I said in an email to colleagues, LIU is consolidating and retrenching in every area—faculty, staff, colleges, departments, programs, stipends, course releases, honors scholarships, High School Scholars, student services, SGA budgets, club budgets, department budgets, GAships, Promise, Pioneer newsprint, etc.—even as the administration is planning a costly vet school. Unfortunately for student-athletes, it was their turn to be downsized. It’s a real shame.”

Queen Mab, an anonymous poet who first appeared in the 2017- 2018 academic year with her poem,” Ode to a Campus Bike,” writes poetry pertaining to the ongoing academic and social issues and changes within the LIU Post community. “Talkin’ Division One Blues,” was found on the south hallway door on the second floor of Humanities, and follows the tune of Bob Dylan’s “Talkin’ World War III Blues.”
 
 

King Mab is another anonymous poet, inspired by the style of Queen Mab’s witty and musically inclined prose. “Athlete Ain’t Got No Dorm,” was found slipped beneath the door of The Pioneer newsroom on Tuesday, Oct. 9. Given the topic of the poem and the content of this week’s issue of The Pioneer, the editorial board decided to publish King Mab’s poem alongside Queen Mab.

Daniel Webster’s speech on the Bunker Hill Monument has something to say to us about our resistance to OneLIU. In his remembrance of the fight on Bunker Hill, he told how the empire of Britain closed the port of Boston. Some people in the day expected to benefit from this closure. “The temptation to profit by the punishment of Boston was strongest to our neighbors of Salem. Yet Salem was precisely the place where this miserable proffer was spurned, in a tone of the most lofty self-respect and the most indignant patriotism.”
I now think back to the OneLIU change that rightly offended and upset so many good athletes and students. The football players might be expected to rejoice at the Division I change. But I hear that many are upset on behalf of their fellow athletes and realistically feel that they may not be able to sustain the level of intensity needed to be a Division I player. If that‘s true, I think it speaks well of them. They care about their fellow athletes and are clear-sighted about the spuriousness of this new “benefit.”
I speak as a student senator, a reporter, and, first and foremost, a student who has developed bonds of friendship with faculty and fellow students.
I am not an athlete, but I perceive this change as but one in a long line of questionable consolidations and retrenchments and mergers that I have witnessed. And the timing and the assault of the announcements are odious.
It is out of my bond to Post and to the green and gold that I speak.
Athletes, I stand with you. Your professors stand by you. Your fellow athletes from other teams stand by you. The students, who have developed friendships and relationships with you, stand with you.
You are not alone. If you stand strong, you will endure.
Sincerely,
Anand Venigalla

In recent years, we have taken many steps forward to elevate the University we all love, enhance the value of your degree from Long Island University, and improve the student experience. Thanks to our collective efforts, the word is getting out, with prestigious organizations like The Princeton Review rating LIU a “Best Northeastern University” for the first time in our history and leading publications like Forbes taking note.
Unifying our athletic program and competing in all sports at the NCAA Division I level as “One LIU” is a critical element in our continued path forward.
When it comes to building a national teaching and research institution, athletics is just one part of the equation. LIU’s distinguished faculty offers a world-class education with a focus on experiential learning that prepares students for success.
Athletics plays an important role in bringing people together and promoting educational values. As we elevate the LIU brand nationally through academic excellence and world-class research, our athletics program will unite our entire community and compete at the highest levels. Allowing our student-athletes to compete at the highest level will increase the University’s visibility and ultimately create a broader platform to tell the “One LIU” story.
In order to honor LIU’s strong tradition of athletic excellence, the new program will combine the traditional colors of both campuses into a unified blue and gold. And in the coming weeks, students and alumni will help choose the new mascot for the unified program.
In addition to elevating the brand and reputation of our University and the value of a Long Island University diploma, this new program will feature expanded opportunities for student-athletes. We will now compete in women’s ice hockey, women’s rowing and women’s water polo, and will offer our growing student population an enhanced ability to take courses on either campus.
In addition to enhancing student life, the University is putting students first by honoring all current scholarships to student-athletes through their graduation. We take the “student” in “student-athlete” seriously, and we will work one-on-one to ensure all student-athletes graduate on-time, with a LIU diploma.
We are expanding our elite partnerships. We are hosting the prestigious Polk Awards at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., collaborating with celebrated philanthropist T. Denny Sanford to provide early-childhood education to nearly quarter-of-a-million students in our region, and partnering with BSE Global to renovate the historic LIU Paramount Theatre. Additionally, Governor Andrew Cuomo recently supported LIU with $12 million in state transformative funding toward the New York metropolitan area’s first veterinary program, pending accreditation.
This is an exciting milestone for LIU and is another step forward in strengthening our position as an elite national teaching and research institution. Now, we will be brought even closer together to support a single, NCAA Division I program that will unite, inspire, and elevate our University to even greater heights.
You can learn even more about the future of LIU Athletics and stay up to date on the latest developments at one.liu.edu.
Sincerely,
Dr. Kimberly Cline
President, Long Island University
Debbie DeJong
Director of Athletics, Long Island University

It was recently announced that several academic departments would be consolidated into combined departments, and because of this, new department heads would be selected. Dr. Jeremy Buchman, a political science professor, discussed the implications of one department head for a consolidated program.
“One person will be taking on [the] responsibility of four people,” Buchman said “[being department head] will be a challenge in part because there is a lot of responsibilities.”
The new chairs are managing a job once filled by four people, meaning they will have more work to do across different majors they do not specialize in.
“Some of the tasks a chair has are administrative and similar across departments, but some areas are department-specific. Political scientists are better trained to decide who would make an appropriate adjunct.” Buchman said. “If the chair is from a different department, they are making a decision without the background, or more likely they’ll consult with someone from within political science, which means that someone’s going to be doing chair-like things and not getting paid.”
He also discussed how uncertain the path of the new department heads will be. “There might be some inefficiencies as people are figuring stuff out and developing expertise they didn’t have before,” he said. Despite this, Buchman said faculty has tried to limit the effect these changes will have on students.
While it may seem largely negative, the departments were told about positives that should come of the consolidation. “[We were] told about benefits, things like synergy and enhanced ability to do classroom interdisciplinary work,” Buchman said. “I’m not really sure it does anything that could’ve been done without consolidating.”
“I do think that places a greater burden on secretaries, who really do so much to keep departments running properly,” Buchman said.
While there has been some concern for the consolidated department chairs, there are some who see it as a positive change. “In the case of the new department of English, philosophy and foreign languages, the main benefit is that it brings all of the Humanities together under one umbrella,” Dr. John Lutz, an associate English professor and chair of this newly-consolidated department, said. “This could allow for more effective coordination among us and new opportunities for collaboration.”
Bringing the departments together may allow for more programs to intersect and work with each other to improve all departments. Lutz also expressed that the workload would be an estimated “twenty-percent increase in my labor.” In terms of adjustment to the change, Lutz said he is managing it well. “I’m adjusting just fine. I was already chair of a large department, so none of the tasks are new to me,” he said.
While Lutz saw no downsides to the consolidation in the case of his department, he noted that he “can’t speak for other areas where the combinations of disciplines may make less sense from an academic perspective.”
Lutz said that he sees no impact from the change on students. “This new combination is an arbitrary administrative structure, so there will be no impact on students,” he said. “We will continue to offer the same programs and classes and faculty will continue to support students as we always have.”

Michael Soupios, professor of political science, has replaced Harvey Kushner, professor of criminal justice, as the president of the faculty union. Kushner had been president of the union for over a decade. Although Soupios had not planned to take over this position, he said that he was persuaded by a member of his department to run.
Soupios faces a host of challenges in his new position. Many faculty members were denied tenure, reappointment and promotion at the end of the spring semester, he said. On behalf of the union, he filed between 12 to 15 grievances against the university in just one month over the summer.
Willie Hiatt, associate professor of Latin American history, and a member of the union’s executive board, confirmed that only three out of nine faculty members were awarded tenure last spring. He also confirmed that 15 faculty members will be eliminated in August 2019.
Soupios stated that many of these faculty terminations have little to do with teaching reviews and were in reality administrative
decisions. “The administration has essentially declared war on the faculty members,” Soupios said, and their excuse for this is that the economy is changing.
“The university will end up losing a lot of good professors who care about the students,” Soupios said.
“What has happened at Post just since commencement underscores the importance of a unified faculty,” Hiatt added. “We’ve seen yet another attack on tenure and promotion, the elimination of almost all probationary faculty over the summer, the attempted downsizing of three additional colleges as money-saving measures, the elimination of faculty stipends, and on and on. None of this is particularly surprising considering that our incoming class was only around 570 students. Financially, this is a critical moment for the university,” Hiatt said.
Dr. Barbara Fowles, a professor and former chairperson of the department of communications & film, is happy that Soupios has taken over as the new union president. “I am very pleased that he took on the job, he is a good guy, he is very ethical and he is working very hard, especially with the people who were denied tenure,” she said.
“I’m hoping he’ll do what he is doing, which is to engage the academic vice president about these faculty decisions,” she continued. “It seems like a lot of the [promotion and tenure] decisions are being made without the faculty input and that the administration is effectively getting rid of a lot of the younger faculty members,” Fowles said. She added that the administration seems interested in providing faculty with one year contracts because it gives them more flexibility to get rid of people teaching in programs with low enrollments.

The fusion of life, art and movement is dance, and Nancy Brier, adjunct professor of dance, reflects this in her creativity on stage and on screen. Her extensive dance background includes international recognition for dance pieces choreographed in the jazz, modern and theater genres.
After receiving a Bachelor’s degree of Fine Arts in Dance from Arizona State University, she moved to New York City and completed her master’s degree at New York University. She performed with choreographers Frank Ashley and Lenore Latimer, and her concert pieces have been featured on Metro Arts Thirteen. Her work tends to express real life, painstaking issues through motion of the body.
In 2016, she collaborated with her daughter, Aly Brier, on a short film, “Ultralight Documentary.”
“She was the director and editor and I was the choreographer. The documentary was based on the making of the ‘Ultralight’ film from the director, choreographer and dancers’ perspectives,” Brier said. The documentary was shot and produced at the Little Theatre mainstage, where Brier will be showcasing the film’s choreography from Dec. 7 – Dec. 9, 2018. The concert piece, yet to be titled, will be performed by the Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC).
Brier’s students do more than dance; they tell stories. Her choreography portrays the struggles of the human experience. Andrew Teperdjian, a junior dance major and student of Brier’s said, “I like to call the piece [being performed in Dec.] ‘cruelty of life’—the cruel reality of life.” Teperdjian, who plays a person battling drug addiction, dances alongside characters dealing with abuse, mental illness, violence, homelessness and the vulnerability these struggles cause. Brier explained the theme as “troubles that young people have.”
The piece consists of dynamic lifts that audiences can see on hit television shows such as “So You Think You Can Dance” and “Dancing with the Stars.” The dance is performed to Kanye West’s “Ultralight Beam,” giving the dance texture and displaying Brier’s unique use of accentuation and rhythm to tell the story.
During rehearsal, Brier teaches beyond technicality. She helps the dancers emanate emotion through movement, emphasizing strength in her choreography and musicality. She creates art with her students, rather than for them. She speaks to them as fellow artists, and for this reason, they respect Brier as a director, mentor and teacher.
Leo Nobiletti, a senior arts management major who assists Brier during rehearsals, describes her as, “intense but welcoming.” As she observes, she makes intricate changes, and tells her dancers to “be open to change; you must be fluid in that way.” A piece of advice that applies to the dance floor, as well as everyday life.

On Aug. 10, Netflix aired a new original series called, “Insatiable” starring Debby Ryan. Ryan is often associated with Disney Channel due to her previous roles as Bailey on “Suite Life on Deck,” and as the title role on “Jessie.” The show centers around 17-year-old Patty, who was overweight for most of her life. After an altercation with a homeless man, she was hospitalized for three months with her jaw wired shut, causing her to lose 70 pounds. With a slimmer body, she vows to get revenge on all who mistreated her before.

She becomes a contestant in the “Miss Magic Jesus” pageant with Bob Armstrong (Dallas Roberts) as her coach. Armstrong initially met Patty as her lawyer for the dispute between her and the homeless man. Prior cruelty, a chaotic family life and general unhappiness causes her to become self-destructive.
Controversy surrounded the show’s first season since the trailer released on July 19. Hours after it’s release, a petition was created on Change.org demanding that Netflix shut down the show. People argued the trailer represented a show that is fatphobic, and perpetuates pathological stereotypes and stigmas attached to overweight people, deeming the series as highly damaging to its audience.
The controversy has only exacerbated since then. Some viewers believe the show is culturally and politically insensitive, makes a mockery of the LBGTQ community and inappropriately portrays molestation and statutory rape in a comedic manner.
Some people think the show glosses over issues as comedic, despite their real-life severity. Critics also argue that the show is poorly crafted, has too many unrelated storylines and displays humor that is dark and insensitive.
Senior health science major Caitlin Johnstone explained her feelings towards the show. “I thought the way they made her lose weight was pretty stupid. Like in order to get skinny, you had to get your mouth wired shut and not eat properly is absurd,” Johnstone said.
Defendants of the show claim that many of the audience members and critics are misunderstanding the series entirely. They argue that the show, instead of reinforcing stereotypes with dark humor, actually criticizes the shallowness and behavior of those who interact with Patty before and after she lost weight. The show also demonstrates the negative psychological effects and anger generated from bullying and cruelty. While the creators work on the second season, “Insatiable” can be viewed on Netflix.

Seung Lee, professor and director of the Fine Arts program, is curating a new exhibit
at the Islip Museum of Art called “Diaspora.” Other artists who are participating in the exhibit include Puneeta Mittal, Eliška Mörsel Greenspoon and Andreas Rentsch. The goal of this exhibit is to convey the diversity of human culture and identity and to challenge the ideas and structures of the contemporary art scene.
“Having migrated from other parts of the world to the United States, all four participating artists of “Diaspora” have expressed their diverse experiences of culture and identity in their work by expressing alternative narratives and challenging the ideas and structures of the contemporary art scene,” a press release said.
In June of this year, Lee exhibited “The Miracle Mural Project” for the Hua Quan International Art Village in China. “It was about peace and miracles, and I did a piece about my own miracle. I consider myself as a person who’s living in a miracle kind of dream,” Lee said.
Lee came from a background of poverty. “I came from South Korea. I came into this country when I was 15, because my family was so poor,” he said. “Each day, looking back at where I came from is a miracle; I would have never imagined myself today in this position [as a professor],” Lee commented.
Lee’s art focuses on the use of “waste” in the creation of new artworks. “We are in a very wasteful society; we have a tendency to throw away things too easily, so I have tendency to use artwork from people’s throwaways and giving them a life again,” he said.
“Because that’s how I felt like my life is about. I was being thrown away by the society, as my father died when I was so young, the government didn’t help us, and so we were struggling to live, begging for just the basic housing and food. So it felt like I was recycling myself in a sense,” Lee continued.
Lee has been teaching at Post for 28 years. He finds it enriching, despite his concerns about administrative lack of interest in the arts. “I’m trying to encourage each student as an individual, what they bring into class. [My method] has been very successful,” he said. “I think current administration does not support art too much. It’s too much involved with business aspect. Therefore, we do not get enough support from the administration. But students are fantastic. I just love each student; they bring so much into my classroom. It has been such a reward to deal with young artists who want to succeed.”
One of Lee’s favorite artists is Jenny Saville, a contemporary British painter known for her large-scale painted depictions of female nudity and transgender people. “I think she is a very honest, skillful painter who captures individual struggle in our society so beautifully.”
Lee advises students and artists to persist in life. “I always tell them, you cannot give up. Especially in art. It is a struggle. But as long as they are willing to put their hours and hard work, reward will be there for them. I am a living proof. I always tell them that I came from a struggling family, came to the United States, could not speak any single English word, and went to college and drove a taxi cab in the city to support myself. But I never gave up on my want [or desire] to be an artist.”
Professor Lee teaches Life Drawing I & II, Painting I & II, Art 15: Advanced Painting III, DrawingI & II, Art 613: Painting I, Art 614: Painting II, and Art 615: Painting III.
“Diaspora” is on display from Oct. 18 to Dec. 31, 2018.

The discussion of abortion, pro-life and pro-choice isn’t a new. Netflix released the documentary ‘Reversing Roe’ on Sept. 13, days after the Supreme Court discussed the current state of Roe vs. Wade. Documentary directors Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg address the views in support and opposition of reversing Roe vs. Wade decision.

The ground changing decision passed in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 7-2 vote, which ruled that a woman’s right to an abortion was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
The 99 minute documentary explains the diverse arguments surrounding the controversial issue. Although the creators bias lays with pro-choice, Stern and Sundberg do shine a light on the opposition’s standpoint, and through a series of interviews, structure an equal narrative. They present the timeline and provide clips of Ronald Reagan signing the bill in 1967 that grants women the right to have an abortion in specific situations; they also include interviews with those directly involved in the passing of the law. The documentary also argues against the stigma that pro-choice is anti-life.
Sophomore public relations major Alex Cordova highlighted the importance of the documentary. “It was very eye opening about the history of the federal law. It shows the before and after of the legalization of abortion and how it has allowed for further equal rights of women,” Cordova said. “It also talks about the dangers in our government system that could potentially reverse Roe.”
 
 
 
 
Sophomore earth science major, Corina Reed shared her thoughts after watching ‘Reversing Roe’ in light of the recent induction of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. “The fact that people in this country feel the need the control a woman’s reproductive rights is inhumane. We have come so far along since gaining the right to vote and yet many feel that our society need to be one of the 1950s. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, the daily lives of women will be hugely affected in negative ways.”
 
 
It’s hard to say what the future of abortion laws in the United States will be. But through frank documentaries like “Reversing Roe,” we can see the uncertainty that will follow if the law is reversed.

As we welcome back alumni, Homecoming will be filled with carnival rides, food trucks and competitive spirit as the Pioneers face Saint Anselm on the football field.
Expectations are high for the Pioneers to continue their undefeated streak this Saturday, Oct. 13.
One of the most anticipated traditions of the day is the crowning of homecoming king and queen. Olivia Kavanaugh, a senior art education major, is one of the candidates running for queen. Past homecoming games, Kavanaugh was on duty as a resident assistant, but this year she was chosen to be part of the court.
“To prepare for homecoming, I am working to campaign to the best of my ability,” Kavanaugh said. “From what I gather, homecoming is an event that everyone looks forward to and gets really hyped for.” Other candidates for queen include Angelique D’Alessandro and Samantha Samant.
Matt Goldstein, senior criminal justice major, is running for homecoming king. He wants to be known as the “last king of Post,” referring to the merging of LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn. “If I were to be [homecoming] king of Post, it would be a big deal because I’ll always be remembered as the last one,” he said, “Next year there will be no LIU Post, no more Pioneers.”
Goldstein is the vice president of the Be the Change club and considers himself one of the biggest fans of the Pioneers athletic teams. “I chose to run because I have a lot of school spirit, and I have a lot of passion for the sports teams here,” he said.
His competitor Joseph Migliara, senior digital game design major, is running to uphold a legacy for the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. “My fraternity brothers in past years have won four times in a row, and I want to keep that going,” he said.
Migliara gathered support from his friends across majors, clubs and organizations of campus.
“Homecoming means to me a very special time where students can forget about classwork or anything that’s troubling them and just have fun and watch football and enjoy the rides.”
The homecoming game will begin at 1 p.m. on Oct. 13, with the king and queen to be announced during halftime.
The crowning of the court isn’t the only thing to look forward to. Members of the cheer team have been preparing for their performance at the big game.
“Homecoming is a fun responsibility on our part, we get to hype up the largest crowd of the season,” Jahdai Hernandez, a sophomore forensic science major and member of the cheerleading team, said. The cheerleaders have spent the weeks leading up to homecoming practicing and perfecting their halftime routine. “It’s one of the few events where you see the entire school come together and get involved in showing their school spirit,” she said.
There will also be a carnival on campus this year during the game that will include games, rides and challenges run by campus faculty members.

A game night will be held in Hillwood Commons Oct. 18 at 8 p.m. For five dollars, participants can play a variety of roleplay, console and board games. Dungeons and Dragons, Settlers of Catan, Werewolves, King of Tokyo, SEGA and SNES are among the event’s selection. Candy, snacks and drinks will be sold. Sign-ups start at 6 p.m. on the day of the event.
The event is sponsored by two campus organizations: the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) and the Rainbow Alliance. Their goal is to raise money for charity and to fundraise for both clubs.
SHRM is a relatively new association on campus, having been officiated in 2017. Josh Barnes, a junior finance major, spoke of how the event relates to his club.
“SHRM is a club that is focused on human resources, in which we learn how to work with others and evaluate various situations,” Barnes said. “This game night event will allow everyone to work together as group to achieve a common goal, which is the essence of our club.”
The Rainbow Alliance works to empower the LGBT community. According to LIU Promise, the Rainbow Alliance is a group of people who come together without judgement of creed, religion, race, sexuality or gender.
Professor Courtney Tricarichi, club advisor for SHRM, believes this is a unique opportunity to unify students of all back- grounds.
“Gaming is a great way to bring people together,” says Tricarichi. “Students will have an opportunity to meet new people and have a great time all while raising money for campus organizations.”

“We know what we are, but know not what we may be,” William Shakespeare.
It is easy for some to tell you who they are in this exact moment but ask them who they are going to be and you will receive a very unsure answer.
The journey of life can bring you to places you never thought were possible. Which is why it is important to know that you have the potential to become something more regardless of the uncertainty.
This is extremely common among college students. When you ask what they are planning to do after school their response will be that they have no idea. Everyone can have an idea of what they would like to do but the reality of it is that anything can happen in your life that pushes you down a path you never knew was an option. Allowing yourself the freedom of potential growth within yourself can welcome opportunities.
It is normal to have a theory for who you might become but that is all it is, a concept. Theory, concept and ideas are all things that are not definite. These give us the ability to change and prevent us from guiding ourselves down such strict paths.
Having these theories for where you will end up or who you will become in the future is routine but as long as you remind yourself that none of this is definite. Life events will take place that can change everything about the way you have been “doing” life. As simple as this saying may seem, go with the flow.

Inflammation is defined by the National Institute of Health (NIH) as the body’s natural response to real or perceived harmful substances and injuries. Some important vitamins and minerals that help support the immune system include vitamin C, vitamin B and zinc.
Vitamin C increases the concentration and speed of cells that heal the body, and it decreases inflammation, while vitamin B6 promotes healthy red blood cells that carry oxygen and nutrients through the body. Zinc shortens the duration and strengthens the effectiveness of any and all immune system responses.

Short term inflammation helps deliver blood and nutrients to muscles, bones, and other areas to help them heal after an injury. It also helps form blood clots so that invading organisms cannot enter the general circulatory system and spread throughout the body. These actions make inflammation a healthy and necessary survival process.
On the other hand, chronic, long term inflammation can be critically damaging to the body since it destroys tissues and hinders the function of vital organs. What’s worse is that long term inflammation, as supported by the NIH, can lead to conditions such as diabetes, obesity, digestive diseases, and even cancer.
Due to modern-day lifestyles consisting of stress triggers such as alcohol, environmental pollution, and low-quality food, the number of chronic inflammatory diseases is higher now than it has ever been. Some common causes include mental stress from too many obligations as well as physical stress from lack of sleep and overworking the body. This prevents proper muscle and tissue repair.
A primary cause of inflammation that we may overlook in our daily lives is smoking. Smoking cigarettes, as well as being exposed to secondhand smoke, leads to not only lung inflammation but inflammation throughout the body. Cigarettes contain toxins such as pesticides, arsenic and lead that are released into the environment. As stated in studies done by the NIH, these substances attach to fat cells and make it harder to lose weight, since the toxins are stored in fat to prevent them from affecting vital tissues such as the brain, heart and lungs.
While it’s impossible to control every pro-inflammatory aspect of our lives, it’s important to spread the word about inflammation so we can all help promote life long health and wellness in our community.

“When You Reach Me” by Rebecca Stead is a Newbery Medal winning science-fiction mystery novel. Telling the story of Miranda Sinclair, an average sixth-grader living
in the Upper West Side of New York City during the late 1970s. It first appears to be a coming-of-age story, involving her best friend Sal getting punched by a bully named Marcus and the ramifications of that event on their friendship. But as the book goes on, Miranda begins to find mysterious notes addressed to her. They ask the young girl to tell a story that has not yet happened, but one the author of the notes clearly already knows.
These mysterious notes warn Miranda that the life of a friend, and the author, are at stake. The author insists that he can save their lives if Miranda delivers a letter telling the story to him after the event takes place. To gain Miranda’s trust, the anonymous author writes three little clues to her. Each clue leads to something that in turn leads her to the true identity of the author. Unfortunately, the author dies while saving a life.
Along the way, a homeless man begins sleeping under a mailbox near Miranda’s apartment building, Miranda’s single mother prepares for an appearance on “The $20,000 Pyramid”, and Miranda learns that Marcus isn’t really a bully; he just thinks differently. Through all of this, Miranda rereads Madeleine L’Engle’s “A Wrinkle in Time”, leading to a discussion with Marcus about time travel, and ultimately to Miranda solving the mystery of the notes. By the end of the novel, Miranda’s experiences through the past few months lead her to the conclusion that the author of the notes wasn’t just one person.
While this novel is a science fiction story, it disguises itself as a coming-of-age story so well that it is almost impossible to define its real genre until it ends. In addition to this, there are three separate storylines that are not told in chronological order: Miranda’s mom on the game show, Sal not talking to Miranda, and the sudden appearance of the homeless man. These storytelling techniques lead to the satisfying payoff, but they make reading the novel a bit confusing. But all in all, “When You Reach Me” is a wonderful novel to spend some time reading.

“Assassin’s Creed Syndicate” takes place in Victorian London during the Industrial Revolution. In the game you play as twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye who are in the middle of a different revolution. Jacob and Evie are fighting against the Templars, who run most of the city. The twins form a gang called the Rooks in order to combat the growing power of the Templars. The gang starts out small but quickly grow by integrating other gangs into their ranks.
Jacob is the one who unites most of the gangs that control the underground businesses of London. Jacob’s role within the game is a direct reference to the crime lord Billy Kimber. Kimber became the head of a crime conglomerate by integrating as many gangs as possible into his ranks.
Another way Jacob and Kimber are similar is referenced in the game’s gang strengthening option screen. The player is given the option to let invest money in pubs, carts, bribe policemen and even sabotage your enemies’ weapons and vehicles. This allows you to earn more money and get advantages against the “Blighter” gang, a recurring enemy. This is how Kimber ran his crime syndicate, by making money from pubs and shops and by using his resources to get an advantage over his competition. He also bribed officers into looking the other way whenever he and his gang committed crimes. Both Jacob and Billy are interested in annexing other gangs and building up their armies to take control of the city.
Evie is also inspired by a real-life gang member of “The Forty Elephants Gang,” and her name was Alice Diamond. In the game, Evie prefers stealth and quick getaways, often taking to the shadows to get the job done. She uses knives as her weapon of choice and Diamond was no different. Evie can hold a maximum of 30 knives, and she performs stealth kills by silently throwing her knives to bring down unsuspecting enemies. Diamond also did her work from the shadows, using knives and quick kills to deal with policemen who entered her territory. She was also known to dress as a man, so no one would recognize her, much like how Evie hides her face by covering it with a hood. It is in this way that Evie perfectly matches up to Diamond.
Evie and Jacob Frye appear to be the video game versions of Alice Diamond and Billy Kimber, some of the most iconic gangsters to ever come out of London.

The volleyball team played with a new purpose during their match against the Queens College Knights on Friday, Oct. 5, their first match since the announcement of the upcoming “One LIU” athletic department merger. The Pioneers beat the Knights with a 3-0 (25-16, 25-8, 25-18) win that placed them 12-8 for the season and 4-2 for the East Coast Conference (ECC).
This match set a season high of 13 service aces, the most in a three-set match since scoring 15 on Sept. 16, 2017 against Wilmington University. The Pioneers used long runs in the second (25-8) and third (25-18) sets to secure their win.
Senior outside hitter, Rachel Londot, who was announced as ECC women’s volleyball player of the week on Sept. 24, led the match with four service aces, six kills and 12 digs.
The match started at 7 p.m., but the Pioneers were in the game long before that. This is the team’s first time on the court since the merger announcement, which stated that the Post and Brooklyn campus athletic departments will merge to create a “unified LIU.”
Seven Post teams, including volleyball, will elevate from Division II to Division I in the 2019-20 season, and all Post indoor sports will move to the Brooklyn campus.
“We were fired [up]; we wanted to prove something – we still want to prove something. This is our last season as LIU Post, so let’s make it the best,” said senior setter, Giulia Genna, explaining the mindset in which the team was playing that night.
The volleyball team, along with other sports teams, is against the merger. The Pioneers made a stand during their pre-game warm-up, wearing their LIU Post t-shirts inside out, and taping over “LIU” on their jerseys during the national anthem. They did not cover the name during the game.
“We intended on taping the LIU on our jerseys, but we were told we could not do that by the refs,” said senior middle hitter, Elise Strange, later adding that the administration also told players they could not cover their jerseys.
The team dominated in the first set, and continued to reap in points throughout the next two sets. They were not holding back. “[The announcement] puts a different kind of spirit in you, and a different reason to play. We’re really playing for the school (Post) now, in addition to recognizing this is the last time we’ll play together,” Strange said.
In their season opener, the Pioneers defeated both the Franklin Pierce University Ravens and the Texas A&M International University Dust Devils at the Raven First Serve Invitational on Aug. 24. The Pioneers ran the Ravens through three sets to victory, and the beat the Dust Devils 3-1.
Friday’s win for the Pioneers follows a narrow loss prior in the week against the University of New Haven Chargers on Tuesday, Oct. 2. The Pioneers pushed the Chargers to five sets, recording more kills, assists and digs, but ultimately came up short on a 15-8 loss in the fifth.
On Saturday, Oct. 6, the Pioneers faced Molloy College in a tight match, ultimately losing 3-0 (25-20, 25-22, 25-22) to Molloy. But the Pioneers aren’t giving up yet.
Head coach, Stephanie Sheehan, has faith in her team. “[Friday] night was especially special because every girl on the team got on the court at some point to contribute to the win,” Sheehan said. “We decided as a team that we are going to continue the season the way we started, to win and go out on top.”
The next match is Wednesday, Oct. 10 at 7:30 p.m., against the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury.
