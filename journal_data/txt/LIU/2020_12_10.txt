Colder weather on campus means that items like blankets are a must. The Long Island University Field Hockey team is selling blankets available for purchase. The blankets are $60 each and found  on their Instagram page @liufieldhockey. 
Field Hockey Head Coach Raenee Savin says that she got the inspiration for the blankets from a recruiting trip a few years ago. “I was recruiting at a high school field hockey playoff game in late November, and as I stood there freezing, all the fans in the stands were wrapped in their warm blankets, all matching and supporting their team,” she said. “Right after that, I placed our first order! It was perfect timing, as our field hockey team played into December for the NCAA finals.” 
This is not the first year the blankets have been for sale and the blankets have evolved with the school. “We started selling these blankets in the C.W. Post Pioneers generation of LIU. Sales continued as we kept the green and gold,” Coach Savin said. 
Coach Savin is confident the tradition of these blanket sales throughout the colder months of the year have been a success. “Still now, as we transitioned to the blue and gold, LIU Sharks blankets are keeping fans warm in the stands,”she said. “Eight years later, we continue to sell,and get excited with each sale, knowing that our customers are always happy with their purchase!”
While @liufieldhockey recently posted about the blankets, Savin says that anyone can buy the blankets at any time. “There is no end date. We just had a surge in blanket sales and placed another order, but we always have them available for purchase,” she said. 
Additionally, anyone can buy these blankets with shipping or pickup.“For a small additional fee, we are able to ship your blanket.  We also provide contactless pickup on campus,” Savin said. 
Savin encourages everyone to buy a blanket for their practicality and ties to campus. “These blankets are meant for everyone, not just sports fanatics! I keep one on my car and one on my couch. I use it when I travel,” she said  “These blankets wash easily, are super comfortable and are a great way to show off your Shark spirit, great for incoming freshmen or graduating seniors, a blanket in the dorm or even for an alum as a reminder of your years at LIU,”
You can email raenee.savin@liu.edu or brittany.robertson@liu.edu to purchase.

The Supreme Court is reviewing one of President Donald Trump’s final acts as president, a proposed plan that would exclude millions of undocumented immigrants in being included in the 2020 census figures. 
Excluding such communities from the census total used for congressional apportionment would result in reduced representation in Congress and fewer federal funds for programs, ranging from health care to education and infrastructure.
California, Florida and Texas would each receive at least one less seat in the U.S. House of Representatives than they otherwise would if Trump’s plan moves forward, while states like Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio would each gain a seat that they would have otherwise lost due to population changes showing the drastic political impacts such a move would make. 
Critics of the proposed law cite an unbroken historical and legislative practice spanning more than 200 years of the Census Bureau counting millions of undocumented immigrants. 
Senior film major Kyle Smith discussed such concerns.
“I find it disgusting the way that he’s toying with millions of people’s lives as if we’re all political pawns,” Smith said. “We deserve better leadership.”
In Trump’s memo discussing the issue, he expressed concerns about what kind of precedent the government has set. 
“Policies that encourage illegal aliens to enter this country and that hobble federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws passed by the Congress should not be rewarded with greater representation in the House of Representatives,” Trump said.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that the Act was unlikely to be approved. 
“A lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position,” she said. 
Senior arts management major Brianna Saverino is tired of Trump and is ready for all of the madness to end. 
“Honestly Trump has made political engagement really exhausting,” Saverino said. 
The Justices are expected to come to a final decision within the coming weeks.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, arguments about whether or not there will be a safe and proactive vaccine released to the public soon to help the amplified spread of the virus. After nearly a year of living in isolation, the Food and Drug Association (FDA) officially authorized the antibody vaccine Bamlanivimab, remaining optimistic that it will serve as a secure treatment for COVID-19. 
In hopes of reducing the spread of the virus, the FDA has emergency-released the vaccine, with strict government-mandated guidelines.
“Bamlanivimab is authorized for patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization,” the FDA said. “This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have certain chronic medical conditions.” 
Across the world, countries prepare to begin administering the vaccine to willing and healthy citizens that fit these guidelines. As the COVID-19 cases continue to rise amid all of the social distancing and safety restrictions, the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panel has revealed groundbreaking information. The CDC explained that even though it is unclear when the vaccine will officially be available in the U.S., by the end of December, there will be enough doses available to immunize over 20 million people. 
Sophomore criminal justice major Jillian Hugh is worried about the negative side effects of the vaccine.
“My biggest concern with this new vaccine is that it may disperse negative side effects or outcomes to some people. I’m scared that it will not completely eliminate the virus,” Hugh said. “I don’t think the vaccine is worth releasing until creators are entirely sure that they’ve researched anything and everything they can do to defeat the virus.”
Alongside many worrisome health side effects that this vaccine may entail, another major issue brought up is the ongoing debate across the country on pro and anti vaccine individuals. Recently, many social issues have divided the U.S. in detrimental ways. 
Junior music education Kaitlyn Sottung worries that many people won’t get the vaccine.
“One of my main concerns is having a great number of people refusing to take the vaccine,” Sottung said. “Not only will this increase the spread but it will cause divides in our country with people who are anti-vaccine and people who take the vaccine.”
After many citizens have expressed their concerns with this new vaccine, others have shared the optimism it has brought them. The creation of this defense mechanism vaccine on the virus has installed a beacon of hope in ways people haven’t had in months. 
Double criminal justice and psychology major Kamryn Clarke felt positive after hearing about the vaccine release. 
“The release of the vaccine makes me nervous but optimistic, mainly meaning that even the slightest possibility that we have a chance to get things back to normal is amazing,” she said. “I’m very curious to see the success rate and see where it puts us, maybe even deciding whether we’re able to move forward through this pandemic or not.”
 “I’m hopeful that this new vaccine will help us get back to normal or a possible new normal because I don’t think we could ever truly get back to how society worked before,” sophomore psychology major Kelley Crowley said. “It does make me nervous that the vaccine came out so fast considering it usually takes a couple years for a vaccine to come out but overall I’m hopeful that it will work out. I’m honestly excited for this vaccine to come out because it will hopefully end this pandemic and the world can hopefully start to move past it.”
In hopes that the coronavirus vaccine will be safe, students are left questioning how this makes them feel. If this vaccine works out for the best, it can be a life changing savor to the way we have all been forced to live the past several months.
“It is time to take more action. I think the vaccine gives us a chance to get truly serious about the virus and it would be a good thing for everyone to receive the vaccine to do what’s best for the country,” Sottung said. “I am hopeful that this vaccine will be a step in the right direction to return back to normal life. This vaccine could drastically decrease the spread of covid and would keep more people safe.”  During this worldwide pandemic, everyone has been forced to adapt to a ‘new normal’. In light of the new Bamlanivimab COVID-19 vaccine, students hope that it serves as a constructive and safe beacon of hope for humanity.

Professor of psychology Dr. Danielle Knafo, served as a consulting producer and subject expert for the critically acclaimed documentary Silicone Soul. Silicone Soul was streamed on Amazon Prime and iTunes.
Silicone Soul explores the emotional connection some people have to their synthetic companions and what that means for the future of human relationships. Ultimately, this is a film about love, loneliness, secrets and acceptance. 
Knafo explained her inspiration in pursuing such a project. 
“I had treated in therapy a man who lived with a sex doll as his partner. This intrigued me and triggered my curiosity to know more. I began interviewing other men who lived with sex dolls as their partners, not just sex objects. I also visited the factory that made high end sex dolls and interviewed the creator. I wanted to make a film about it and began filming some of my interviews. However, I am not a filmmaker and so I partnered with Melody Gilbert, an excellent documentary filmmaker.”
In addition to her work on the documentary, Knafo is also a prolific author and has been honored for her work with many awards and prizes, including the American Board and Academy of Psychoanalysis Book Prize for The Age of Perversion and the University’s Abraham Krasnoff Lifetime Achievement Award.
 Knafo continues to devote her time to helping others even after accomplishing so much.
“Many things inspire me and my career,” she said. “I am a professor and I love teaching and mentoring students to become clinicians. I am a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst, and I love helping people overcome internal and external challenges in life. And I am an author, and I love to write and communicate what I’ve learned from my work with others.”

President-elect Joe Biden announced an all-female senior White House communications team when he takes office in January. All seven women elected to office will occupy the most visible roles in the administration. 
“I am proud to announce today the first senior White House communications team comprised entirely of women,” Biden said. “These qualified, experienced communicators bring diverse perspectives to their work and a shared commitment to building this country back better.” 
Jen Psaki will be the new press secretary for the White House. Kate Bedingfield will serve as White House communications director and Pili Tobar will serve as deputy White House communications director. The role of principal deputy press secretary will be filled by Karine Jean-Pierre. Symone Sanders will serve as a senior adviser and chief spokesperson for the vice president and Ashley Etienne will serve as communications director for the vice president. Elizabeth Alexander will serve as communications director for first lady Jill Biden. 
All seven women have served in previous roles for either the president-elect or the vice-President elect during their time in office and on the campaign trail. 
Senior arts management major Brianna Saverino didn’t initially hear about the announcement but is excited about the news. 
“He’s really pushing the progressive agenda,” said Saverino. “I’m here for it.” 
Senior education major Olivia Ali was also excited about the news and encouraged by what these changes could mean. 
“This is an important moment in history,” said Ali. “One day when I’m a teacher, I can tell my students I remember this moment, and hopefully inspire girls in my classes to strive towards their dreams. Having diversity in the faces of the nations shows little kids of all ages that they can be whatever they want to be when they grow up.” 
Kamala Harris, who will also be making history as the country’s first female vice president, believes this team is just what the country needs. 
“Our country is facing unprecedented challenges, from the coronavirus pandemic to the economic crisis, to the climate crisis, and a long-overdue reckoning over racial injustice,”  Harris said. “To overcome these challenges, we need to communicate clearly, honestly, and transparently with the American people, and this experienced, talented, and barrier-shattering team will help us do that. These communications professionals express our commitment to building a White House that reflects the very best of our nation.” 
Senior broadcasting major Jada Harris agrees that this is a change the country needs to see. 
“I think it’s great to set an example for the people to show women are more than capable and qualified in politics, especially after the last administration,” she said. 
President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris are set to be sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2021.

Acceptence of the LGBTQ community within the United States has been rising in the recent years thanks to those in the community who have been unapologetically themselves throughout their day to day lives, slowly by slowly understanding has been incorporated into those around the LGBTQ community.  
The word acceptance can bring a negative connotation to the outside understanding of the feelings of members in the community. Acceptance means that one party is over the other party, that that they are higher on a societal pedestal. Understanding lays the feelings of the party that’s left out, and opens the door for insight to their experiences, wants and needs. The Rainbow Alliance covered acceptence of the LGBTQ community and the recent representation of LGBTQ characters in animation on Friday, Nov. 20.
Television shows started adapting the use of LGBTQ characters to increase representation for the queer youth. Representation is important, especially as a child. Queer children often grow up with no representation in the media. This makes it harder to find themselves and express their identity in their everyday lives, because it was never seen before. Where they don’t feel support, they know that there are others out there watching the same show, grinning ear to ear, ecstatic to finally see somebody of the same variables being understood.
Nicole Ludwig, President of the Rainbow Alliance gave her opinion on why the relationship wasn’t received as well as it’s creators had hoped. “I think it’s mostly a business thing. Nobody wants to air anything controversial because it’ll end up costing them money,” she said. “It’s all about profit. Second to that, I think it’s the fear that it’ll “turn people gay” as if how that works.” 
 The need for increased representation lies in the saying “it will turn people gay.”  Viewing two people of the same sex being in love, does not alter somebody’s views on their sexuality. It gives people leeway to understand their LGBTQ counterparts. This leads to increased support in the world that those of the LGBTQ community wish for.  
“Steven Universe” introduced a lesbian relationship between two characters, Ruby and Sapphire. The wedding displayed Ruby in a dress and Sapphire in a tux. The conversation of gender roles surrounding the LGBTQ community has always been a well-spoken topic with no correct answer. There are no “regular” gender roles when it comes to LGBTQ relationships.  Steven Universe portrayed that within LGBTQ relationships, they do not look at life through a heteronormative lens. The episode displayed that partners do what’s comfortable, and simply pick up where their partners lack, to create a balanced, healthy relationship.
The Rainbow Alliance covered an array of television animated characters displaying LGBTQ relationships. As members of the community, the Rainbow Alliance were able to accurately convey the feelings and ideas the show animators wanted to show. Those being in actual relationships, came out to friends or family, experienced hardships due to sexuality, were able to relate to the representation shown in the shows. During the virtual meeting, the members felt the mutual feeling of satisfaction due to representation in animation. Almost as if a large weight has been taken off of their shoulders and they can lay back and say “finally.” “I think socially and generally speaking, we’re very slowly moving in the right direction. There have been increasingly more conversations about sexuality and gender fairly recently that I would have never heard being discussed so openly five years ago,” Ludwig said. “But I also think we’re at a time of major uncertainty as a community. There’s a lot of anxiety within the community lately in regard to the Supreme Court potentially rolling back protections, and yet at the same time, Biden winning the election was a huge victory for us. Personally, I’ve been worried at times, but I try to stay optimistic. I’m always happy to celebrate every victory we have.” 
Male representation in animation is generally seen as worse than lesbian representation. When it comes to men, audiences expect to see the normal, high masculine, manly-man being in a relationship with women. There is a stigma centering around gay men that saying they that their masculinity is deteriorated for simply, loving another man. When gay men show emotion, it is quickly judged and not understood.
For young queer boys figuring out their sexuality, coming out, or learning how to express themselves on a daily basis, this type of representation is beyond helpful. Even when support is not found at home, advice can be given through the shows. Methods of dealing with internal societal issues centering around their emerging sexualities. The Netflix show “Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts,” showed Kipo expressed her feelings for a boy she liked and the awkwardness was visible on Kipo’s face as he had to tell her that he actually likes boys. She understood him and stayed his friend. This scene gives queer youth a little more confidence in who they are. The representation of a coming out scene, can inspire young and mature men to embrace themselves and live in their truth. Kipo played a major role in conveying the idea of coming out. Coming out is always seen as something big and unnatural, when actually it’s perfectly normal. Labeling yourself as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc., is a part of human nature. There is nothing wrong about it. It takes confidence though, to build yourself up to the point to share who you really are in a world that is not very understanding. What these television shows do is show those who wish to truly be themselves, that it is okay, you are supported and understood. The creators show their fans they are heard, important and understood. 
 “It makes me so happy to see more representation. I think it will help normalize LGBTQ+ people and make queer your feel less alone by having characters they can relate to.  You see a lot of people saying “I wish I had this as a kid” and while there’s no way to change that, we can at least strive to make things easier on the generations that come after us,” said Ludwig. It may be too late to correct the past but going forward the future generations will know that they are supported and understood.

Post recently announced the upcoming education plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas break. Classes will be fully remote following Thanksgiving break and for the remainder of the fall semester. However, the veterinary technology program was approved to hold in-person labs. 
After discussing potential options, program leaders in nursing and health professions agreed upon allowing students to complete clinicals and labs in person after the break. These courses are required to be completed in person in order to receive the professional certification. Health professions such as veterinarians are governed by hands-on experience and knowledge. 
Students were not expecting this decision from the program and made arrangements to travel home. 
Sophomore veterinary technology major Sarah Henderson, is one of several students who made travel plans before Post notified students that the labs would be open. 
“Most students in my major are commuters, so hearing that labs will resume in person is okay with them, but for those of us who live far away, it is unfair to make us change plans so last minute,” Henderson said. 
The University is making the necessary accommodations for students in these programs who do not return to campus. 
“We want to be clear that students who are not able to return to campus after Thanksgiving will have the ability to complete in-person course work and be accommodated in every way that they can to ensure that they are on track for graduation,” Chief Administration Officer Joseph Schaefer said. 
If students choose to return home or do not feel comfortable returning to class in person, they will be able to complete the remainder of the course in February. While they would temporarily receive an incomplete grade for the fall, it will be removed from their transcript once the student completes the course in the spring.

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recently announced guidelines to promote safety this Thanksgiving. The CDC says that the safest way to celebrate Thanksgiving is by celebrating at home with the people you live with and avoiding travel.
As cases of the coronavirus increase, families are left with the decision of whether or not they want to travel for Thanksgiving. If families decide to travel, the CDC recommends checking travel restrictions for your area and the area you’re going to before you leave, getting a flu shot before you travel, wearing a mask, and staying at least six feet apart from anyone who does not live with you. 
Students on campus had the option of receiving a COVID-19 test before returning home for the holiday, and the remainder of the semester. 
Senior fashion merchandising major Hema Chimpidi returned home to the midwest for the holidays. Chimpidi planned on bracing the crowds and taking a flight home. 
“I will be flying home. Unfortunately it’s my only option,” Chimpidi said. “This is my first flight home after almost a year.” 
Before returning home, Chimpidi got a coronavirus test to ensure she tested negative before traveling.
 Senior broadcasting major Samantha Samant stayed on campus for the holidays. Normally, she spends the holidays with her mother, but after Samant’s mother’s recent COVID-19 diagnosis, she’s spending this holiday on her own. 
“While I’m not going home for this holiday season, I will miss all the comforts of home,” Samant said. “I will still be surrounded by friends, whether it be on Zoom or in-person, it will still be a nice thanksgiving.” 
Some students have remained at home since the school previously went remote for two weeks back in October. 
Senior journalism major James Bonner, stayed home since that remote transition, and that’s where he planned on spending his holiday break. 
“I’m already home for thanksgiving,” Bonner said.“I don’t think people should travel if they think they can be a danger to others.” 
The CDC recommended participating in Thanksgiving activities that are socially distant this year. They promoted activities like hosting a virtual meal, watching Thanksgiving Day parades or sporting events on television, watching movies at home, online shopping, or participating in a gratitude activity, like writing down things you are grateful for and sharing with your friends and family.

The official Instagram page for Post – @liupost – posted an image brandishing the text “LIU RISE” on Saturday, Nov. 21. The post was accompanied with the message “We’re 10 days from #GivingTuesday! LIU Rise is a university-wide initiative that will help provide critical, long-term support for student scholarships at LIU. Together We Rise!” The post also asks the viewer to text “LIURISE to 71777.” Doing so redirects the individual to a live donations page for the LIU Rise campaign.
According to the Nov. 21 LIU Headlines article “Long Island University Celebrates Giving Tuesday With Inaugural Kickoff of LIU RISE,” the LIU Rise program aims to “help provide critical, long-term support for student scholarships at the University.”T he initiative hopes to “inspire generosity” through its launch of an inaugural campaign spanning the entire university.  It began on “Giving Tuesday” on Dec. 1 and will continue until Thursday, Dec. 31. 
“Giving Tuesday inspires people all around the world to embrace their power to drive progress around the causes they care about, not just on one day but throughout the year,” said Giving Tuesday CEO and co-founder Asha Curran.
LIU’s Chief of Strategic Planning and Advancement Dr. Andy Person said that the program aims to provide opportunities for competitive students to attain a world-class education through the altruism of scholarship donors while simultaneously propelling the university towards the national Top 100 threshold. 
“Grassroots donations from our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends are an important way to support critical scholarships to equip thousands of our students to be leaders and champions for a lifetime,” Person said. “Participation is the goal, not the amount. Every small donation counts.”
LIU Rise uses social media as a platform to help fundraise, like the website GoFundMe. Person said that the 2020 LIU Rise event is a kickstarter campaign, with prospects for becoming an annual tradition across universities.
“The more the students we get onboard the bigger impact we can have on student scholarships. The more the merrier,” Person said.
Students interested in supporting the LIU Rise campaign should text LIURISE to 71777 for more information as to how to get the word out and expand involvement. Alternatively, text Dr. Person at 516-637-7278 or email andy.person@liu.edu and Chris Hale chris.hale@liu.edu.
