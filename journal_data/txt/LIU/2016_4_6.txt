It’s been a good 239 years since we decided to tell Great Britain, which at the time was the face of imperialism, that we’d rather be a country then a band of colonies, and if you (Britain) have problem with that, let’s have a war about it. It’s been 153 years since Abraham Lincoln gave us the Gettysburg Address, that reminded us how great a country America is despite our gruesome flaws and tendencies.
Fast-forward 153 years and it’s safe to say that America has built quite a resume. We’ve survived two world wars, we’ve built the best economy mankind has ever seen, we passed civil rights laws that make sure that every American, no matter their skin color, gender, race, disability, can fully pursue their right to happiness without discrimination or government intervention. Oh, and by the way we, yes we, set the world wide standard for excellence. An overall excellence that every country on Earth strives to achieve, but ultimately can’t.
However, this is not an ‘America is great’ article; it’s about America’s identity, and why for some reason we seem to be losing that emboldened sense of pride in our culture and our very being during the 2016 presidential election.
Election cycles are so intriguing to people like myself because every four years we take a collective look in the mirror. We see ourselves as a people, the pros and cons of the way we live our lives, and ultimately we see the direction we are going as a nation. As Americans, we do our best to assess ourselves honestly, and thus, we attempt to elect a candidate who best fits the American prerogative for the next four years while emulating the best image of what America truly is all about.
With that said, let’s take a look at the candidates who are asking for our vote to become the next president.
Donald Trump promises that he’ll ‘Make America Great Again’, that we’ll ‘build a wall’ with Mexico and that ‘we’ll win so much we’ll be sick of winning!’ However, Trump never seems to give you the plan on how he’ll accomplish these ‘ideas’ but trust me, he’ll get them done, he’ll make us great again. *insert sarcasm here*
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who seemingly is the antiTrump, promises you that he’ll ‘make the top one percent pay their fair share,’ that he’ll decriminalize marijuana and that he’ll revive American public schools and infrastructure.
Hilary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, First Lady and senator of New York, promises to reform Obamacare, not increase taxes for the middle class, improve women’s rights, and revive American industry. However, like most politicians in the 1990s, she supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, which ultimately has led to millions of manufacturing jobs leaving the U.S. and she is currently under investigation by the FBI for “handing over the private email server she used while she was Secretary of State to the Justice Department,” CNN’s Elise Labott reports.
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, promises a flat tax of just 10 percent for all Americans, including those who own businesses or are part of the highest tax brackets. However, Cruz has been best known for aiding in government shutdowns, as well as being ‘hated’ by other members according to candidates Donald Trump, including former candidate Marco Rubio. These are not erroneous claims, as it took Cruz almost ten months to earn an endorsement from just one colleague of his from the Senate, Senator Mike Lee of Utah. Also, his calls for the ‘patrolling of Muslim neighborhoods’ has made Cruz seem like xenophobiac, so much so that NYPD Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said “That’s why he’ll never be President,” when a reporter asked him about Cruz’s proposed policy in wake of the Brussels attacks.
Finally, John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio who has been on the record saying “I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land,” has been mathematically eliminated in terms of receiving the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the GOP nomination. With his only contest win coming from his home state of Ohio, perhaps the Governor thinks he’ll secure the nomination via an ‘open convention.’ However, this seems highly unlikely, and attributes to the reason why both Trump and Cruz are calling for Kasich to drop out of the race.
According to RealClearPolticis.com, which provides cumulative results of polling done across the nation, as recent as March 22, Hilary Clinton had an unfavorability rating of 58%. Donald J. Trump, proudly touts an abominable unfavorability rating of 61.3% according to a Huffington Post poll, but Bernie Sanders, who likely will not secure the Democratic nomination, actually has an unfavorability rate of just 40.3%, according to the same polling site.
Getting back to the original premise, what is America’s identity? Well, before the turn of the century ultimately the September 11th attacks terror attacks, America was recognized as a land of opportunity and a land that fought for the rights of its citizens. I’d make the argument that since September 11th, we’ve lost that pride, that ‘American spunk’. Look at our middle class. On a national level, the data suggests it’s shrinking. According to “The Shrinking Middle Class,” an article published by the New York Times, Alicia Paralapiano, Robert Gebeloff and Shan Cater of the New York Times, found that the middle class had shrunk from 53 percent in 1967, to just 43 percent in 2013. During that time the lower class also shrunk by 6 percent, from 40 percent to 34 percent.
Look at who we just shook hands with, Cuba, an island nation that doesn’t promote capitalism and still jails its citizens for protesting the government. Look at our manufacturing jobs; they’re disappearing. According to the U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Statistics, about 22.5 percent of American’s held jobs in manufacturing. As of 2011, the number of Americans with jobs in manufacturing fell to just over 10 percent.
Now look back at our candidates who wish to become president. Do you want to know why both Trump and Clinton have such terrible ratings in the polls? In a crucial time like this, they’re not fit for the job. They don’t fit the American mold for president because huge walls, winning, and political correctness, will not, and will never ‘Make America Great Again.” Americans know this, and that’s why most Americans would rather not support the front-runners from each party.
We aren’t a broken nation. We know who we are. We are a proud people who at the core love each other. We are a nation of immigrants who strive for perfection both morally and economically. We are a nation that, despite our differences, unite during the good times and bad. That image of Americans, black, white, rich, poor, gay or straight, all standing together is the American identity, but it seems that lately we are quick to tell each other what’s wrong and why don’t like each other.
In order to lift America back to the global and domestic status it once had, we must recapture the American spirit and embrace it. I don’t believe that will happen this November, and I wonder when it will ever happen again.

Just for a moment, pretend that I am a director of a real life documentary, and allow me to paint a picture for you…
There’s silence all around you. You’re sitting alone in your house, surrounded by darkness. Your eyes are heavy and you really want to sleep, but you cannot. Something is keeping you awake. It may be because you just don’t want to sleep, or it may be something else, entirely. You hear a noise in the room, nearby. However, no one’s supposed to be home, except for you. What would you do? Would you enter the room alone to find out the noise? Or would you stay stationary where you are?
The truth is, there’s no telling what some of us what do if a supernatural situation occurred and we didn’t have the answer as to ‘why’ or ‘how.’
Those two subjects may be exactly what you’re currently wondering: Why the ‘supernatural?’ Or how can something like that be possible? The answer to that depends on your perception of what the realm of ‘possibility’ is.
Transfer junior art education major, Manuel Villalobos, for instance. Villalobos hasn’t experienced a supernatural event first-hand, but he does believe in the possibility that it can occur, and not to any one person, but to anybody. “I do believe, I’m curious in the possibility of bumping into one,” Villalobos stated. He added, “The universe is made of energy and when we die, that energy has to go somewhere. I believe that ghosts were once humans who lived, and I don’t know what it means in the grand scheme of things, though it’s a great mystery.”
A mystery that has many theories as to its secrets and general understanding. According to an article by Kelly Tatera, ‘Do You Believe in Ghosts? This Psychological Phenomenon Explains Why’ off ‘The Science Explorer’ (‘thescienceexplorer.com’ – Oct. 29, 2013), there may be a scientific explanation behind the spooky circumstances of spirit-sightings.
The ‘science’ behind it pushes the fact that our brain has heavily to do with ghostly-sightings or unusual events. In the article, sociologist, Barry Markovsky, expresses that “…the way our brain works plays a key role in our supernatural beliefs.” He goes on, adding that “…Our brains try to make sense of ambiguous information by making patterns,” and that “…it’s probably not a coincidence that most people report seeing ghosts in dimly lit places or right before bed.”
Is that really all there is to the supernatural in this world? Junior broadcasting major, Stephanie Mocerino, doesn’t seem to think so, for she has actually experienced ghostly-sightings in her life and she is a firm believer that they exist on their own. “My pop-pop had just passed away, and I was with my mom at our church early in the morning, helping put together food baskets. After, we got out of the car, and I saw a man that was wearing the exact same clothes as my pop-pop and he looked exactly like him and he was just pacing back and forth by a statue of Mary in the parking lot,” Mocerino stated.
One could wonder, did her mom see the same thing? Mocerino added, “When I freaked out and told my mom to look at that man over there, and that he looked just like pop-pop, she replied to me, ‘What man?”
It seems as though while not everyone experiences the same events under circumstance, that there definitely appears to be a connection between the ‘supernatural’ world, and the ‘real’ world that we’re used to. I for one believe in ghosts and supernatural entities, but I do think that your soul and mental state needs to be ‘trained’ in order to see them. I view supernatural events as happening in another ‘realm’ of life (perhaps even the afterlife). I know, I’m stretching my boundaries a bit, but above all, it’s a very intriguing thing to ponder about.
In light of this subject, what do you believe? Please be sure to send all of your thoughts, suggestions, and comments to ‘The Pioneer’ at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

Social media has been both a blessing and a curse for the last decade. The benefits include being able to interact and communicate with people around the world, and instantly access and receive news and information about world issues, and various other topics. It also allows us to share our thoughts and ideas widely and freely. It can even be helpful for businesses as it provides another forum to share your product and market yourself.
Despite all the positives of social media, there are also serious negative effects. We share our personal information such as our birth dates, occupations, relationship statuses, family members, and our addresses. We share hobbies, interests, and just about everything else you can think of. While we share every little detail about who we are on social media, we often do so for validation of everything we do. Even I used to do that; the more people became interested in what I posted, the more I posted, naturally.
Why? Well, because as a society, we desire recognition. Even if we won’t admit it, we want that popularity. We like people agreeing with our own egocentric views so we can feel like we aren’t the most selfish generation of humans ever, which I think we are, honestly. Sophomore criminal justice major, Georgia Gantidis, gave a simple reason. “People certainly hide behind their screens and appear to be someone they’re not on social media. When people do brag and boast about themselves on social media, it’s mostly to make themselves feel better and digitally place themselves ‘above’ the rest. This doesn’t go for everybody, but for most.”
We also post malicious and negative things. I can’t count how many times I’ve been on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, and scrolled through similar negative posts about cutting people off or being cold hearted. They read: “Never feel bad about cutting people off. If people no longer deserve a beneficial spot in your life… it’s fine to remove them,” or, “Cutting people off gets easier and easier.”
While it’s true that some people shouldn’t be in your life if they constantly bring you harm in any way, doesn’t mean you should go around bragging about it. It’s something that may have to be done even when we may not want to, especially to people that we were once close to and it can hurt, sometimes. I’m not saying it’s wrong to remove anything toxic from your life and cherish your self-worth, but don’t go around acting like it makes you better than anyone else. It’s as if social media has made us take pride in being insensitive to each other and we don’t hesitate to brag about this.
We also use social media to escape from reality. For example, I’ve seen countless Twitter and Instagram posts about living life and being happy and positive all the time. It’s okay to cry sometimes, or to deal with anxiety because these emotions are how we know we’re alive. We feel negativity in a relationship, or have an argument with a friend or lover, and we just want to give up. We need to understand that life is beautiful, but also ugly.
For all the blessings it brings, there’s also suffering and you can’t have one without the other. There’s nothing wrong with being down or upset every once in awhile. Sophomore criminal justice major, Chris Dewey, believes that we post only positive things because it’s easy. “People show off because it’s so easy to just tweet or Instagram something. You don’t have to think about it too much; all you have to do is just tap a few buttons on the screen,” Dewey stated.
If you can put so much effort into boosting your social media presence, then imagine how much stress you can save yourself by not caring what people think and just being comfortable in your own skin. Freshman health and physical education major, Andre Bennett, agrees. “It’s annoying to me honestly; just be yourself. If you’re confident enough to lie, you can be confident enough to be yourself. Tell the truth and forget about what everyone else thinks,” Bennett expressed.
Social media is not all bad, but it can be unhealthy in many ways. The worst part about social media is that it isn’t real life. Go outside, read a book, study, play a video game, be a human being. You never know who you might meet that could change your life. I also think cutting people off and ignoring them is childish because everyone deserves an explanation. Silence may be an answer, but it’s not always the best way to respond to someone when you feel like they’ve wronged you in some way. Confront them and hold them accountable and you might be able to work things out. If you can’t, then move on. Stop seeking recognition. Be successful and work hard because that’s what you should do. Live life, feel emotion, and be the best version of yourself that you can be. Those important to you will feel like they’ve been blessed to have you in their lives.

Gender equality, or should I say inequality, is an issue that always stirs the pot. Whether in the work place, in politics or elsewhere, everyone seems to have an opinion. So why should sports be any different?
According to www.womenssportsfoundation.org, there are significant gaps in terms of payment for performance in men’s and women’s sports. The site states that in 2014, the PGA Tour total prize money was over $340 million while the LPGA Tour totaled just north of $61 million, which happened to be a new-high. The earnings for national soccer teams are similarly unequal. For claiming first place in the 2015 Women’s World Cup, the U.S. National Team won $2 million, while its male counterparts, which finished in eleventh place in the 2014 Men’s World Cup, cashed out at $9 million. Partially in response to these figures, five players from the Women’s National Team filed a lawsuit on behalf of all members of the team claiming wage discrimination.
Perhaps the most glaring difference between pay for performance between men and women is seen on the hardwood. In 2015, the WNBA had a minimum salary of $38,913 and a maximum salary of $109,500, with a team salary cap set around $900,000. Now in the NBA, the minimum salary in 2015 was $525,093 and the highest salary for a single player was a staggering $25 million. The team salary is set at $70 million and is expected to rise with television contracts expiring after the current season.
The highest paid female athlete in the world is Maria Sharapova. According to www.forbes.com, the Russian tennis star earned $29.7 million in 2015, most of that coming from endorsement deals. Sharapova is one of seven female tennis players in the top 10 of highest paid female athletes. The non-tennis female athletes in the top 10 include house hold names like Danica Patrick and Ronda Rousey.
Boxing superstar Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather made a staggering $300 million in 2015 in just two fights according to the same forbes.com study. Although Kobe Bryant is the NBA’s highest paid player at $25 million, LeBron James and Kevin Durant earn more when they combine their salaries with off-court endorsements. In total, Sharapova’s earnings of $29.7 million land her the twenty-sixth spot in terms of highest paid athletes. She lands right in the middle of New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony and Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer.
What does all this mean? It means that there is an obvious gender divide in athletics in our country. The roots of the games being played are the exact same; the only thing changing is the sex of the people playing the sport. Television ratings certainly back up men’s leagues with billion dollar contracts powering the big four sports leagues, (NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL), but does that explain why the best player in the WNBA barely makes a fifth of what the worst player in the NBA makes?
Some might say: If women’s sports received the same amount of media coverage as men’s sports, they would be just as popular. That’s a fair and legitimate point, but I fail to think of a time when that will happen. Viewers may prefer to watch a tennis match with two women as opposed to two men, but if we’re talking about a sport with a larger following than tennis, the viewership for men vs women are in different stratospheres. Take basketball for instance. Men trump women in ratings both at the professional and collegiate level. The NCAA men’s national championship drew 28 million people in 2015 compared to three million for the women the following night. The same can be said for the NBA which saw their highest rated game come in at 18 million compared to 828,000 in the WNBA.
Leagues that clearly favor men’s athletics over women’s are starting to become the norm. Yet there are professional sports leagues that are gender equal in terms of payments. Those sports include surfing, marathon running and, most notably, tennis. All four Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open), offer equal prize money to the champions.
Although men’s sports are generally played at a more physical level and involve a higher tempo, women’s sports deserve more recognition in terms of earnings for participants. How a woman can make $100,000 and be the best player while a man can make $25 million and also be the best player makes no sense. Women are playing the exact same sport as men and the salaries should reflect that. In an ideal world, there would be no pay differences, but as we know, the world is far from ideal.

To most college students, their phone is their life. Not only because it houses their favorite social media, games, emails and notes, but also their photographs. Your photos will always mean something and you will have that moment forever. Here are this week’s LIU Post student’s favorite photo on their phones:
“This is my favorite picture because it portrays my perfect Alpha Xi Delta tree true to form. We’re crazy, wild, flawless, and scandalous and we always have an amaXing time! I’ve been blessed with the best twin littles, a great twin, an amaXing big, an awesome G and Gtrips and an amaXing left side branch who are just as perfect! This picture shows the people I love having fun and being the crazy silly women we are! TFJ” Stephanie DiPretta, senior health sciences major.
“This my favorite picture because it reminds me that summer is near and I’ll be spending my days relaxing on the beach with friends very soon.” Renee Reddy, sophomore business major.
“This is my favorite picture because I got to go to London this spring break to visit my friend to what studying abroad it was the most amazing experience of my life filled with so many memories” Julia Kontos, sophomore management major.

At this point, we all have or know someone who has Netflix. The next step, is to watch Trailer Park Boys. The tenth season of the bad, but awesome mockumentary was just released, and it’s more of the good old same Canadian stoned humor. It’s wonderful.
The weird, almost cult-series hovers around three childhood friends, Ricky, Julian and Bubbles, and their ways of life in the Sunnyvale Trailer Park. The three are small time criminals, mostly spending their time fighting and harassing Jim Lahey and Randy, the park supervisors. Lahey is an alcoholic and Randy is a male prostitute, selling himself for cheeseburgers.
In season nine, we left the boys after they had finished a scheme to buy the trailer park, and firing Lahey. Bubbles had opened a kitty hotel and a bed and breakfast. Julian had a bar and massage parlor in his trailer and Ricky didn’t have much except a grand daughter and a need for “banging Lucy.” Ricky is truly not the bright one in the bunch, and really struggles with anything that requires, well, thinking. He’s only in school to do one thing, and that’s to sell drugs.
Netflix released the show in 2014, after seven seasons were done years earlier for Showcase in Canada. The show was mostly filmed in standard definition, and was not widescreen before the later seasons. It was pretty obvious when Netflix came into the picture that the budget and production value went up, and with season nine, it felt a bit like the show suffered from it. What had been a very natural feeling of just some buddies hanging out together, suddenly felt very forced, as if money suddenly became the goal, rather than quality.
It’s nice to see that in season 10, released last week, the quality is back. With help from Netflix, the show that started off as a cult favorite among the few, has reached millions. The guys frequently show up on talk shows, world tours and national television as their characters. With season 10, it comes back after a dodgy reboot, as what it used to be over ten years ago. It’s nice to have them back and they have their dope-train back on track from last season. Binge watch all 10 seasons of Trailer Park Boys now on Netflix.

The first annual MIC Fest will be held on April 9 and is presented by the Music Industry Club. “The purpose of MIC Fest is to support local music and encourage more music involvement on the LIU Post campus,” said Michaella Bowne, a junior arts management major and the vice president of the Music Industry Club at MIC Fest. There will be live performances by artists such as ‘The Como Brothers Band,’ Sam Woolf, Sarah Barrios and Shorebreak.
“MIC Fest was started as a really cool way for students interested in Music Management and Music Marketing to make their mark and plan something awesome for the LIU Post community,” Bowne said. Besides the live performances by the artists, several Post students will also perform at the festival as a prize for winning a contest held by the Music Industry Club called the 2nd Annual Phenomenon Singing contest. The winner was Savannah Cummings and the finalists included Rick Roberts and Henry Mozard, who will both perform at MIC Fest.
The Como Brothers Band is made up of Matt and Andrew Como, native Long Islanders who grew up listening to Billy Joel and The Beatles. Matt Como described how their band came into existence. “My brother Andrew and I always loved music. Our parents and uncles surrounded us with great music since we were really young. Even when we were babies our mom and mad were playing The Beatles and Billy Joel to us. Starting our band was very natural and organic,” Como said. “It was an extension of what we were already doing. Andrew and I were playing music all the time and we loved writing songs. Eventually we just needed to give ourselves a name because we were already doing music – so we picked ‘The Como Brothers’ because it was genuine. It’s who we are.”
Matt and Andrew thought about performing at MIC Fest when their merchandise manager, Michaella Bowne, suggested the idea. “Michaella Bowne is a great friend of ours and has been our merchandise manager for a couple of years. She was organizing this event with her fellow students and she asked us to play at MIC Fest and we couldn’t be happier to come perform at LIU – it is such an awesome college.”
In addition to performing at MIC Fest, The Como Brothers are going on a tour during the same week with fellow artists Sam Woolf, Dylan Brady and Sarah Barrios. They do not just play events on Long Island and New York City, the band has played up and down the east coast in states like New Hampshire and Florida. Matt and Andrew have other plans besides going on tour in the next coming months. In April they will be recording several songs in Los Angeles with their producer Aaron Sterling, who has worked with artists John Mayer and Sara Barielles. The brothers will then collaborate with Sam Woolf and producer Mike Watts to record another song on Long Island.
When asked about the different songs the band will play at MIC Fest, Como said, “Andrew and I will be playing our original songs. We hope that these are songs everyone can have fun jamming along to. We have a couple of new songs we will perform. Our friend Sam Woolf is playing at MIC Fest with us as well – so we’ll play a couple songs with him also.”
Como explained why students should watch The Como Brothers and the other artists perform at MIC Fest. “It’s going to be a great time! We like to have fun. This is what we love to do. So come down and hear some great music!” MIC Fest will be held on April 9 at 12 p.m. on the Creative Quad outside the Tilles Center. To purchase tickets, contact Michaella Bowne at michaella.bowne@my.liu.edu or purchase them at the door.

The Yankees have been the talk of the town for 20 years. How close are they to winning a championship? It appears now that conversation that was taking place in the Bronx is now taking place in Queens.
The Mets, fresh off a playoff-birth for the first time in nearly a decade and a World Series appearance, are one of the front-runners to return back to the fall classic. How can they not be? They have the deepest rotation in baseball featuring Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz. (All of whom are under contract for multiple years after 2016). Starting pitch will not be an issue for the Mets, even if one of their studs goes down with an injury, but their bullpen is suspect at best. Other than Jeurys Familia, who is a legitimate lockdown closer, the Mets will struggle to bridge that gap between their fantastic starters and their all-star closer.
Pitching will win you games in the postseason, but hitting has to get your there. The Mets offense looks similar to last season with a few exceptions. Postseason hero Daniel Murphy now wears a Nationals jersey and he is replaced with Neil Walker. His double-play partner is now Asdrubal Cabrera. The two are above average hitters and will provide solid defense up the middle which will be an upgrade from last season.
The Mets will lean heavily on Yoenis Cespedes who resigned with the Mets after weeks of negotiations. Cespedes will have to shoulder the offensive load for the Mets and that’s fine with him. Over the last two seasons, the Cuban outfielder has averaged 29 home runs and over 100 RBIs. If he has another season like that and other key contributors like Curtis Granderson and Lucas Duda build on last season, the Mets will be well on their way to October.
If all goes well for the Mets, they will be around a 92 win team and one you do not want to play in the postseason. If injuries start to pile up, then the bottom could cave out. David Wright, the heart and soul of this team, is a huge question mark health-wise and the lack of bullpen depth and consistent offense is what worries fans about this team. At worst, this is a .500 baseball club; somewhere in the 81-84 win range.
Now, on to the Yankees. This is like being in the twilight zone. The Yankees are not the team in New York with all the expectations from the media. Of course their fans still desire a championship and that is what the ultimate goal is from the general manager, but the Yankees are sort of flying under the radar. (If that’s even possible to do with the second-highest payroll in baseball).
Much of the Yankees 2015 group has reconvened in 2016 with a few players acquired via trade. The Yankees upgraded at second base from Stephen Drew, who was barely able to bat .200 last season, to Starlin Castro. Castro is a righty bat who can play three different infield positions and should fare well in a hitter friendly Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees offense is a solid one if they are able to stay away from doctors and stay on the field. Veterans Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira, Carlos Beltran and Brian McCann all have the capability to hit 25 home runs and drive in 75 runs and that has been the Yankees offense for years; use the long ball to drive people home. Speedsters Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner are more under the microscope this season after subpar years one year prior; culminating in the Yankees wildcard loss to the Houston Astros. The offense ranked second in the MLB in runs scored last season and there should not be any problems in that department.
The starting pitch is where things get a little shaky. Unlike the Mets, the Yankees rotation is about as inconsistent as they come. The Yankee starters are injury prone to say the least, with four out of the starting five having spent time on the disabled list last season. Fans still hold their breath every time Masahiro Tanaka throws a pitch; fearing he will tear something in his elbow. Michael Pineada has been a frequent visitor to the disabled list, as has recovering alcoholic C.C. Sabathia. The Yankees have a few young arms in the rotation in Nathan Eovaldi and Luis Severino. The duo are good strikeout guys and pack heat as well; constantly hitting triple digits on radar guns.
The strength for the Yankees is their bullpen. Their key to success will be getting just enough length out of their starters to get to their big three of Dellin Betances, Andrew Miller and newcomer Aroldis Chapman. Betances and Miller have shown what they can do in Pinstripes, (which is pretty darn impressive), but Chapman will be the Yankees closer once he returns from suspension. Chapman has an array of pitches but the most devastating of all is a fastball which topped out at 106 mph. The three men at the back end of the pen will save the Yankees games and get them tightly contested wins.
Best case scenario for the Yankees would be somewhere in the 89-92 win range. That’s if everything goes well though. The Yankees are a very old team on paper and as we saw last season in August and September, this team began to break and wear down. Worst case scenario means the Yankees make a lot of doctor’s visits and they finish around 80 wins.
The Mets will benefit from a much weaker division than the Yankees play in and as a result, I see the Amazin’s beating up on lowly Philadelphia and Atlanta on their way to another NL East crown. For the Yankees, everything needs to bounce right for them and I think it will. They have a tough division and Toronto and Boston are no joke, but they can pull it off if they remain healthy. Ultimately, my gut tells me the Yankees will finish behind Toronto and again be forced to play in a wildcard game.
Is there a Subway Series in October in the making? You never know, but I’ll tell you this. This is the closest we have been to a YankeesMets World Series in a while. Buckle up; this baseball season is going to be fun.

Senior attackmen Matty Beccaris and Ryan Slane battled for the goalscoring throne at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union castle on Wednesday, March 30, as the men’s lacrosse team trumped its non-conference opponent Post University, 19-5.
Beccaris, named the East Coast Conference Player of the Week on Monday, April 4, finished on a season-high nine points, netting five and assisting four; Slane hit the locker room with as many assists, and tailled but one less than his colleague.
Beccaris is now only eight goals short of bettering the LIU Post Athletic Hall of Famer Tom Postel’s all-time goal record, according to liupostpioneers.com. Together, the double strikeforce stood for an eight-goal burst in the first two quarters. At halftime, the scoreboard shone 14-2 in favor of the Pioneers.
The Pioneers dictated all over the turf, in shots (49-31) as well as ground ball totals (38-14). Head Coach John Jez and his squad are looking to keep the momentum while wrapping up the regular season. First off will be neighboring New York Institute of Technology on Saturday, April 9, in Old Westbury. The game starts at noon.

After being hit with some scheduling changes and cancellations due to field conditions and weather, the baseball team returned to the diamond on Saturday, April 2, for a double dip against St. Thomas Aquinas College from the LIU Post Baseball Field.
The Pioneers dropped both ends of the double-header, 4-3 in extra innings and 3-2 in seven innings. In the first game, the Pioneers got off to a rocky start, but rebounded when junior pitcher Jake DeCarli found his rhythm.
Trailing 1-0 in the second inning, the Pioneers snatched the lead on a two-run double off the bat of sophomore designated hitter Lou Doria. Two innings later, Doria found himself crossing home plate on a single by senior outfielder John Bellock to give the Pioneers a 3-1 advantage.
DeCarli, who settled down after allowing a run in the opening frame, buckled down through the first eight innings and didn’t allow another run. However, in the ninth inning, things unraveled.
St. Thomas, trailing by two runs, cut the deficit in half when Giovanni Dingcong launched a home run. Later in the inning, DeCarli struck out a pinch-hitter with the tying run at third base, but the ball got away from junior catcher Thomas Asbaty. His throw to first base got the batter out, but the return throw home was too late and the game was tied at three.
After scoreless 10th and 11th innings, the Spartans broke through in the 12th inning with a run. The Pioneers went down without a fight in their half of the inning and the Spartans came out on top in 12 innings.
In game two, the Spartans plated the first two runs of the game; one via a throwing error and another on an RBI double. The Pioneers responded with two runs of their own in a similar fashion. Freshman infielder Jimmy Mendyk touched home on a throwing error by the Spartans and he also drove in the game-tying run on a single.
In the sixth inning, the Spartans plated a run on a wild pitch and took a 3-2 lead late in the game. In the Pioneer half of the seventh inning, they got the tying run to third base, but he was never able to cross home. Pinch runner Michael Greene attempted to score on a wild pitch but the ball caromed back to the catcher and Greene was tagged out to end the game.
The Pioneers second double-header against St. Thomas Aquinas College, scheduled for Sunday, April 3, was postponed because of poor weather conditions. No makeup date has been announced as of yet. The baseball team will return to the field on Friday, April 8, when they travel to Brookhaven, N.Y. to play Dowling College. First pitch is set for 3:30 p.m.

Queens College reigned over the softball team in their first matchup on Wednesday, March 30. A combined three runs in the opening two frames proved to be enough run support for ToniMarie Valeriano, who tossed seven innings of two run ball and struck out nine Pioneers in front of her home crowd.
The Pioneers only run scoring play came in the second inning when junior infielder Kayla McCoy cracked a two-out two-run single. After that connection, the Pioneers bats went silent and the Knights from Queens College strung together hits and made the most of their four base knocks and won the contest 3-2.
In the second game, the Pioneers were paced by freshman pitcher Hannah Olshevski who continued to dominate; fanning four and surrendering just two hits in a complete game shutout victory.
Senior infielder Maria Palmeri was the offense for the Pioneers; driving in the two runs on doubles in consecutive plate appearances. The Pioneers, backed by Olshevski and Palmeri, won by a score of 2-0.
The Pioneers returned home on Thursday, March 31, and welcomed Southern Connecticut State University to Brookville, N.Y. Powered by junior pitcher Ashley Martin, the Pioneers toyed with the Owls, winning 6-0.
Martin went the distance, allowing zero runs and striking out nine. The Owls barely threatened to score against her; managing a measly two hits. Their best opportunity to score was shut down when Martin stranded two baserunners in the fourth inning.
At the dish, the Pioneers grabbed the lead when senior designated hitter Paige Swantek belted a solo home run. In the third inning, the Pioneers extended their lead to 5-0. The big hit came from freshman infielder Ashley Melendez who came through with a two-RBI double.
In the nightcap, the Pioneers were looking at a 3-1 deficit in their final turn at bat. Their response: a two run seventh inning to tie the game and send it into extras.
After the first two batters reached base safely to start the inning, Palmeri laced an RBI single to cut the hole to 3-2. After that, Swantek plated the tying run on an RBI groundout.
After the Pioneers stranded the potential game winning runs in both the seventh and eighth innings, they came through in the ninth inning. After a Palmeri lead-off single, Swantek moved her to second with a sacrifice bunt. With the winning run in scoring position, McCoy lined a base hit and plated the game-winning run for the walk-off win.
The Pioneers 4-3 victory was another win for Olshevksi who tossed nine innings of three run ball and fanned two. The win is her sixth in a row and her tenth of the season.
The Pioneers Saturday, April 2, double-header against NYIT was postponed due to poor weather conditions. That set of games will now be played on Tuesday, April 12. The weather again did not cooperate on Sunday, April 3, and the Pioneers twin bill against Molloy College had to be rescheduled as well. That matchup is set for Thursday, April 14. The Pioneers originally scheduled opponents for those dates, University of New Haven and Caldwell University, have been cancelled.
Assuming the weather cooperates, the Pioneers will return to the field on Thursday, April 7, for a pair of games against Dominican College from the LIU Post Softball Complex. First pitch is set for 3 p.m.

Q: What about the game of baseball caught your interest and why did you start playing?
A: I started playing baseball like any other kid. My parents signed me up for little league to make me test out the game. What drew me to the game though was how much I enjoyed playing it and working at it off the field.
Q: Describe the moment when you were first named to the All-ECC First Team.
A: At first, I was kind of surprised because I really hadn’t thought about it yet. After Coach Gaffney told me though and congratulated me the first thing I did was call my dad. He’s been by my side through every step of my career and in that moment I was just really excited to tell him and thank him.
Q: Have you always been a first basemen or have you ever played any other positions?
A: I was a good pitcher up until I was about 14 years old when I hurt my arm and had to give up pitching. I played a lot of third base and first base growing up, but I fell in love with first base. Playing first base made me feel cool because of the special glove I get to wear. I would always advise younger kids to play multiple positions when starting out.
Q: You currently lead your team with 18 RBI’s and have a .309 batting average. How does your work ethic in practice and in games translate to your overall performance?
A: In practice, I always make sure to take batting practice seriously and that my swing is good and comfortable. Beyond that, I love to hit outside of practice whether it be off the tee alone or with some teammates. Hitting is definitely the area of my game I take the most pride in, so I love to work at it and constantly try and improve my offense. I have worked really hard with our hitting coach to develop a good mental approach to keep me focused and confident in every at-bat.
Q: Why did you choose LIU Post?
A: Well I am from Long Island and I knew right away I didn’t want to go too far away from home. I wanted to be somewhere that my father could see me play, but I also wanted to play a high level of baseball. I had some offers to play at southern schools, but LIU’s campus and its location drew me in.
Q: How do you prepare for games?
A: I’m not too superstitious on game days. I don’t have to eat a certain meal or do any crazy rituals the day of the game. The majority of my preparation is done in the days leading up to the games, like working hard at practice and taking my swings. Other than that, I always try to prepare by going over the opponent’s statistics before the game, trying to see what kind of pitcher I will face.
Q: Why do you guys think you have what it takes to make a run at the College World Series this year?
A: I think first and foremost, our goal is to make it to and win the East Coast Conference Championship. That is the goal we put in our heads at the beginning of the year. We believe we are a “regional” type team, so winning our conference tournament would get us into the regional tournament. Beyond that, only eight of 200 plus Division II teams make the College World Series every year. For us, we possess enough talent that the sky truly is the limit, because we have two of the top pitchers in our conference and perhaps the region in Joey Arena and Jake Decarli. Then in turn, I believe we have the top catcher in the conference with Tom Asbaty having a really nice year. Just looking at our roster as a whole, we are extremely confident in the group we have. Our coaching staff does a great job in preparing us for every game to the point where we believe we can beat whoever shows up on the field. For the World Series itself, that’s obviously the ultimate goal for every Division II team. However, we are really focused on taking it one game at a time and not looking ahead. The first goal is the ECC tournament, then we know we can play with any team in our region especially with our pitching staff. We just need to work hard and show up every day because there is certainly enough talent here to achieve a great deal.
Q: Favorite Athlete?
A: My favorite athlete is Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees; he is the best hitter to ever play the game of baseball. I love watching him swing.
Q: Plans after graduating?
A: I honestly don’t know yet. I plan to work a few jobs over the summer while taking a summer class or two to finalize my degree, but beyond that I am really undecided about the future. I will interview for jobs this upcoming fall and put myself out there but I don’t have any definite plans. For now its baseball, baseball, baseball, and I just want to enjoy every day of it until it is over.

All winning streaks eventually come to an end and the women’s lacrosse team is no exception. The fourth-ranked Pioneers (7-2) lost in a nail-biter against topranked Adelphi University (8-0) on Saturday, April 2, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
The loss ended the Pioneers six game-winning streak. Trailing 2-0 in the early stages of the contest, the Pioneers defense stepped up and kept them in the game throughout majority of the first half. Eventually, senior attacker Emily Delaney chipped the deficit in half with a goal at the 20:04 mark of the opening half for the Green and Gold. Delaney’s goal would round out the first 30 minutes at the Pioneers were down 2-1 at the intermission.
Freshman midfielder Ryan McKinney sparked the scoring in the latter stanza when she found the back of the net on a free-position shot to tie things up at two.
Adelphi would regain their ground as they scored the next two goals to build a 4-2 cushion. However, the Pioneers battled back as junior attacker Connor Bird scored an unassisted goal with under four minutes remaining.
In the final moments of the contest, junior attacker Stefani Vagelatos’ last-second effort to tie the game was stalled by Panthers goalkeeper Taylor Hayes as time expired, ending hopes of a comeback.
It was a tightly contested defensive battle, as each team had limited scoring chances. Sophomore goalie Olivia Kirk racked up a game-high seven saves, in addition to picking up two ground balls.
Head Coach Meghan McNamara and the Pioneers return to conference action on Wednesday, April 6, when they prepare to square off against the University of Bridgeport in an East Coast Conference tilt at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Opening draw is scheduled for 4 p.m.

Bowling, one of America’s greatest indoor-past times is having resurgence in our LIU Post community. The International Gay Bowling Organization (IGBO) group and The NY/NJ Metro lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) group present the Gotham Open Bowling Tournament. It will be held during the weekend of April 9 to 10 at Farmingdale Lanes, in Farmingdale, NY.
Former Pioneer editorin-chief Danny Schrafel 08’, is a bowler himself in the IGBO league. “ What I love most about bowling in IGBO leagues and events is the camaraderie. Typically, bowlers tend to self-segregate based on their ability level. Having an external force, such as being a league which caters to the LGBT community, bridges that gap.”
The tournament, which is in its 28th year, will bring together bowlers, friends, families, and guests from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C. and the surrounding areas for a weekend of competition, camaraderie, and fun. During the tournament, activities outside of bowling, such as evening hospitality parties, raffle prizes, additional fundraising events, the Gotham 2016 Journal, Promotional Welcome gift bags, and a weekend awards banquet, will be held for the bowlers and their guests. In the months leading up to the tournament, fundraisers have been held throughout the tri-state area, to help with subsidies, and gain sponsorships.
Various sponsor packages are available, including a Bronze Sponsor ($150-$249), Silver Sponsor ($250-$499), Gold Sponsor ($500- $999), and Platinum Sponsor ($1,000 and above). All levels of sponsorships allow for advertising in the official Gotham Open 2016 Journal. To become a sponsor, contact event directors Brian Parsons (bgo0028@ yahoo.com) and Bert Messina (bertmessina@gmail.com).
There has also been a recent interest in bowling on campus. A number of students have gone to the Athletic Department requesting the creation of a bowling team, and in fall 2016, a female bowling team will be established. Edward Raven, an assistant professor in the medical imaging department in the School of Health Professions and Nursing, will be the head coach of the team. “I am excited for the opportunity to be the head coach of the Pioneers’ women’s bowling team,” Raven said. “Bowling has been my passion for many years and I am looking forward to our inaugural season. This is a fantastic opportunity, not only for myself, but for the student-athletes, to not only compete in a sport that they love, but to get the chance at an excellent education at LIU Post,” he continued.
The athletics department sent out e-mails this semester to all female students inquiring about interest in joining the team. Several expressed interest. For the first year, the team will consist of five to eight members, with the anticipation of eventually building up to 12 members.
The athletic department is investigating several bowling centers for practices, and one will be chosen at the home for the team within the upcoming weeks. Once a “home house,” which is what the coach referred to as the bowling ally where the team will practice, is established, try outs will be held to establish the team. The season will be starting in October 2016. Practices will begin as soon as “home house” is chosen.

On Wednesday April 13, Will Mant, the inbound director of Regent’s University London, will visit campus. Regent’s, a study abroad affiliate with LIU for approximately 25 years now, has been a host to Post students studying abroad at their campus every year. Mant is eager to come to Post to talk about the study abroad program at Regent’s and persuade students to consider choosing Regent’s to pursue their education abroad.
“We are really excited for Will’s visit because not only do our students get to meet a London contact before they even get there,” said Patricia Seaman, LIU Post’s Study Abroad Director, “but also because students who might be unsure about studying abroad can find out more directly from the source of our affiliated program.”
Students are invited to stop by on April 13 during common hour in the solarium located in the Winnick House room 100 to learn more about study abroad opportunities at Regent’s University London.

The Lean Six Sigma yellow belt program is returning to LIU Post for the second consecutive semester. The two-day certificate program is designed to improve students’ process management skills to make them more productive in the work place.
The executive education program “improves the way you go about accomplishing a job,” said Dr. Kay Sato, director of The Hutton House Lectures. She used the example of planning a wedding and how people need to manage a variety of aspects, to describe what students learn in the class can be applied to real world situations.
This semester, there will be two sessions offered, one on April 23 – April 24, and the other on April 30 – May 1, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. everyday. The price will be $450 including a down payment of $100 at the time of registration.
According to Dr. Sato, the program immediately filled up, and the students who participated had very positive responses. In addition to the yellow belt program that ran last year, an additional green belt program, which is the next level within Six Sigma, was scheduled for the month of April this semester, but due to low enrollment the program was cancelled.
Sato said that the low enrollment was the result of the university receiving permission to offer the green belt program too late in the semester. The green belt program will be postponed until the upcoming summer or fall semester, but Post will continue to offer the yellow belt course.
Dr. Brian Galli, a professor in the computer science department, has taught the Six Sigma courses before at Stony Brook and now teaches them at Post. “The number one thing I would like students to take away from these courses is that everything can be viewed as a process and we should seek to create an environment that promotes continuous improvement every day,” Galli said.
The program is divided into a “belt” system and like karate; each belt means the person is at a more advanced stage in the process. The yellow belt is “an introductory course for process improvement team members,” said Galli. The next course is the green belt, where students will work on more projects and leadership skills. The black belt means students have more experience leading projects and are even ready to train. The highest level of the master black belt means that students have worked on multiple projects and trained and certified other Six Sigma users. Galli said that some of the classes involve case studies, videos, interactive exercises, and discussions.
“Professor Galli is so compassionate, helpful and thorough,” Dr. Sato said. “He’s the kind of person that engages you and attends to you if you have a problem.” Galli described the response he received from course evaluations last semester as “overwhelmingly positive.” “The students were very pleased with the course, the price the content and were seeking other courses in the field,” he said. Along with the green belt program that will hopefully come to Post this summer, Galli also plans to “build a black belt program in the future as well.”
Students can contact Dr. Sato or Dr. Galli with any questions about Six Sigma at LIU Post.
