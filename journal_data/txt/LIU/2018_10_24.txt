In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

“Between the Lines” by Jodi Picoult and Samantha Van Leer tells the story of unpopular high schooler Delilah McPhee.
Delilah’s life is completely ordinary until she finds a one-of- a-kind children’s fantasy book. Delilah memorizes every bit of the dialogue and illustrations after reading numerous times.
One day, Delilah notices something that wasn’t in one of the illustrations before. Next thing she knows, she is talking to the main character – a handsome prince named Oliver.
Within the book, the characters live their own lives when no one is reading. The characters are nothing more than actors when a reader has the book open, but once it is closed they can be themselves.
The characters’ true selves are sometimes completely different than their roles in the story. While most of the characters are fine with repeating the same story, Oliver is not. He wants out of the book and he wants Delilah’s help in doing so. This leads to a magical adventure as Delilah and Oliver try to get the latter into the former’s world, and where Delilah and Oliver realize that they have fallen in love with each other.
Much of the plot of “Between the Lines” involves the challenges Delilah and Oliver face during their journey to accomplish the impossible and make a fictional character real.
Once in the real world, they realize that Oliver won’t be able to adapt easily, but the readers don’t get to see what Oliver would go through in the real world. His life outside of the fantasy world is explored in the sequel, “Off the Page.”
Delilah and Oliver’s story is full of trials and obstacles as they explore the boundaries between real and fictional worlds.
“Between the Lines” is a great read for anyone who wants to find magic and true love.

“How then is perfection to be sought? Wherein lies our hope? In education, and in nothing else.”
– Immanuel Kant, Lectures On Ethics
When you hear education you think of school in the aspect of taking classes and learning what we are taught by professors, which has some truth. What I am talking about is the ability to comprehend thoughts and asses them, rationally. The education that we give ourselves based off ethics formed from within oneself, rather than the ones formed by society.
Today when people are having a discussion, for example politically, people become offended and defensive if someone has different views. This is when being educated and allowing yourself to take in the opinion of others, critically think about it, listen to them and produce thought provoking questions becomes vital.
Having conversations like these helps build our education. Learning from others is impactful, yet some allow themselves to shut down and refuse to take in others views.
Having an active mind allows us to continue our education building and helps to prevent the animosity people tend to feel towards others based on their different opinions.
According to Kant, people are not born with ethics, rather we use wisdom and education to form them. Kant’s education system is based on the importance of freedom, which allows an individual to use their talents as growth.

Whenever I flash back to the moment I decided to be a commuter, I wonder if my decision paid off and if it was the right choice. Now in my junior year of college, I’m glad to know that this was the right decision for my future.
Owning a car at an early age certainly gives you a taste of freedom, being able to do what you want, when you want. Picking up friends, driving to parties or just going for a drive are a few amenities a 19-year-old guy like me was able to enjoy.
Living in your own home can be more beneficial than sharing a small dorm space with somebody. Who doesn’t enjoy showering for as long as they want without a roommate banging on the door wondering when you’ll be done?
Just thinking about living on campus can be a headache for me. It would be hard to get used to living in a school environment for months at a time and not being able to hang out with friends and family from home.
Cruising and blasting music for over an hour on your daily commute can be the highlight of your school day; or, if you’re like me, my daily commute is where I find most of my critical thinking is done.
Dondre Lemon, a senior journalism major, connected commuting to college with the real world. “In the work world, we can’t dorm at our job; we eventually have to leave at the end of each day,” Lemon said. “It’s important to get used to what the real world is like so were better prepared in the future.”
Lemon commutes from New Rochelle in Westchester, and his 45 minute commute seems effortless, though it also has its draw-backs: traveling on multiple highways and bridges and paying for tolls can be taxing.
“I pay $11 a day to cross the Throgs Neck Bridge, and between tolls and gas, it certainly hurts the wallet a bit,” Lemon said.
Commuting can be stressful, but in the long run, it can better prepare you for the future.

What you’ll need:
 
To make easy-to-construct paper pumpkins, first cut the orange construction paper into strips. For my pumpkin, I used two sheets of orange paper to make a total of 11 strips.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arrange the strips like an asterisk, and staple the overlapping ends in the center.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once you have made the basic shape, lift the strips and begin connecting the other side in the same way you connected the bottom. As you connect this side of the paper, the round shape of a pumpkin should begin to form. Once the strips are entirely connected on both sides, you will have the base for the body of your pumpkin.
Next, make a leaf for your pumpkin using the green construction paper. Trace the shape of the leaf and cut it out. Connect the leaf onto the body of the pumpkin with tape.
 
 
 

Finally, cut four small, short strips of brown construction paper to begin making your pumpkin’s stem. Lay the four strips side by side, connecting them with tape. Bend the bottom of the strips and then connect the bent pieces to the top of your pumpkin with tape to complete your adorable D.I.Y. paper pumpkin.

The issue of mass-shootings is hard to discuss. Very few non-Europeans will think back the events of July 22, 2011 in Utøya, Norway. On this day, lone-wolf far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik detonated
a bomb in Oslo as a distraction, killing eight in the countries capital. Breivik then dove 25 miles, disguised himself as an officer and carried out a shooting, killing 69 children at the Labour parties political summer camp on the island of Utøya.

Netflix released a film inspired by the events on Oct. 10, providing backstory, heartache and the trial of the shooter. The show is based on “One of Us: The Story of a Massacre in Norway — and Its Aftermath,” by Åsne Seiersta, a Norwegian freelance journalist known for documenting everyday life in war zones.
Director Paul Greengrass, known for creating movies covering sensitive topics, goes about this event with empathy without masking the brutality. With only the first 30 minutes covering the terror, the remainder of the film sees the aftermath the survivors, their families and the countries faced.
The movie opens with the events that preceded the terror attack. Anders Behring Breivik, played by Anders Danielsen Lie, is seen concocting his plan, preparing his weapons to the bewilderment of his mother. In contrast, the kids are seen arriving at the camp full of joy and excitement.
Filmed with a Norwegian cast speaking in English with thick Norwegian accents, the authenticity of scenes could not be more real. Using the words believed to be screamed by the shooter himself, Greengrass carefully depicts the changing political climate of Norway, and the growing far-right, Neo nazi party across the whole of Europe.
The nature of the film does make it hard to watch, but the issue at hand is so important. Attacks of this nature in 2011 were rare to European nations, and Greengrass’ translation of these events stands as a teaching point. Sadly, following the events portrayed in the movie, including Breivik’s trial, proves that he is not alone with his political motivation behind the attack.
The film closely follows real life survivor, Viljar Hanssen (portrayed by Jonas Strand Gavli), who sustained four bullet wounds: one to each arm, his right leg and just above his right eye, which left bullet shards fractionally close to his brain stem. Viljar struggles with post traumatic stress, seeing his attacker’s trial on television and living with the possibility that he could drop dead at any point as a result of his injuries.
Senior international business major and Swedish native, Tove Sparrman spoke of the importance of the film. “It’s really important for people to actually realize that terrorism doesn’t have to be based on race or religion,” Sparrman said.
Elin Kvarnemar, (‘18) alumna and Scandinavian native, highlights why American students should watch this documentary, in order to get a broader picture of the world and struggles outside of this continent. “Sometimes they (Americans) forget that the world is bigger than just the United States, and because Norway is one of the countries you would least expect something like this to happen in,” Kvarnemar said.
Greengrass’ movie shows that the people of Norway will continue to honor those who lost their lives in this event. In doing so, he also shows the importance of tragedies like this brining a country together; the people of Norway will continue their lives, like Hanssen, but not forget such cruelty exists in the world.

Creative minds across campus are show- casing their Halloween spirit in the Art Department’s second annual Pop-Up Art Show, “Postmortem: Devil’s Night.”

On Oct. 28, from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., the exhibit will display an array of student art- work in the brick wall garden outside the Fine Arts building.
Hosting and curating the event are art professors, Laura Sweeney and Susan Kelly. Sweeney, a lover of comics, zombies and punk-rock, and Kelly, a pop-art enthusiast, are thrilled to give art students a chance to celebrate their unique imaginations. “Last year’s show was a great success and an opportunity for students to share their creative work on campus,” said Sweeney.
Those encouraged to submit their art are undergraduates, graduates and even faculty members. The department invites all types of creative work including photography, sculptures, ceramics, paintings, printmaking, performances, stage makeup and costuming, short stories and any other creepy creations that are appealing to the eye and mind.
Kelly and Sweeney will also be publishing “Hallozine,” a publication of student artwork and writing. It will be available to those attending the show. The event is open to the public, and family and friends are welcome to join the spooky festivities.

Aaron Cooper, a senior theatre major, is presenting a timeless theatre piece that is powerful in theme and presentation at the Rifle Range Theatre on Oct. 26, 27 and 28.
The play’s message is universal, analyzing the thoughts and actions of the human experience, and by touching on the core of who humans truly are as individuals in a society that is constantly changing

Cooper, a member of the Honors College, received the chance to fulfill his dream of becoming a director by writing his own play in preparation for his honors thesis. He conducted extensive research, combined it with his passions and scripted a compelling piece of theatre. Cooper’s play is a stage reading titled, “A Day on Venus.” He began writing it in summer 2017, after a former roommate told him about an experience living with a woman in Seattle, Wash. He decided to render the script for his Rifle Range lab. The lab is a project designed to allow students to produce their own cutting-edge, experimental theatre productions. “The format of the Rifle Range is to discover the process; discover it for yourself,” Cooper said.
The premise behind his title stems from his experience as a black man facing microaggressions, who must change himself continuously to fit into society. “A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus because the actual revolution of the planet is faster than the actual rotation on its axis,” Cooper said. “Every day feels like a new year.”
The play originally consisted of unusual interactions between a black man and a white woman; however, through research for his thesis, which is independent from the show and studies the black body, he realized that his main character can be male, female, or non-binary. This allowed him to cast musical theatre major, Emmanuella Agoumba, a female, as the leading “male” role. Working alongside her on stage is cast member and musical theatre major, Michaela Fox.
In Cooper’s play there is no set. Some light cues exist, but the stage belongs to just two actors and a reader, with stands and chairs. Instead of showing you what the setting or world of the play should look like, the stage reader tells you. The reader, technical theatre major, Megan Montemurro, serves as a narrator, and provides all stage directions to the audience, cast and stage crew.
Showtimes for Friday and Saturday are 7:30 p.m., and Sunday’s show begins at 3 p.m. The show is open to the public, and tickets may be purchased at the door or in advance for $15 (students receive a discount with LIU ID) at www.tix55.com.

Most college students in their senior year find themselves unsure of the next step to take after graduation, and how to go about doing it. Thomas Pallini, a senior political science major and vice president of the Student Activities Board, has a good idea of what he wants. He hopes to have a career in communications, “particularly either in the field of politics or travel since I’m well-versed and have an interest in both,” he said.
His strategy is to build his connections, improve his writing and spread the word about himself to major players in the political scene and the travel industry.
He already writes about travel. “I write for an aviation publication [AirlineGeeks.com] that allows me to get better acquainted with the travel industry and learn more about the inner workings of that industry,” Pallini said.
Pallini’s career goals will give him a sense of fun, as a work-life balance is essential to him. “I believe in a healthy work-life balance. There’s no point in working hard if there’s no reward in your social life,” he said. “Working in the travel industry would allow me to travel a lot, which I love doing, but working in politics would allow me to work on important issues, so it’s deciding whether fun is more important than fulfilling work,” he explained. “If I can do both, I’ll gladly do so.” He would love to live in New York City or Washington D.C.
Pallini has always had a passion for travel from a young age. “I’ve loved [travel] ever since the first flight I remember taking on a Song Airlines Boeing 757-200 aircraft from LaGuardia to Orlando when I was a kid on a vacation to Disney World,” he said.
Travel at its best is about the discovery in both the journey and the destination, Pallini said. “My favorite part of traveling is seeing something, whether it be a building or monument, for the first time in person after seeing it in photos and movies for years,” he said.
While many people enjoy travel, Pallini believes his appreciation for the transportation aspect of traveling separates him from the rest. “To most, the destination is paramount. For me, the journey is just as equal as the destination,” he said. “I’ve been on trips where it’s taken me almost a full day from origin to destination and I enjoy every second.” Pallini is primarily an ‘aviation enthusiast,” but he also enjoys traveling by train, bus, car or any other thing that moves.
Pallini recently took the train to a conference in Buffalo with SAB. A 10-hour journey, Pallini found in that trip a reminder of his love for train travel. He enjoys the particulars of planning a trip. “The simple things are important to me, like booking a flight, the anticipation of an upcoming trip [or] a new passport stamp.”
He also likes spontaneity in his travel. “I was on a flight to Seattle for a day trip one Sunday and I was asked if I wanted to go to the Middle East that Saturday; I said yes and was on a plane less than a week later to a part of the world I never thought I’d visit.” AirlineGeeks. com was invited to cover the International
Air Transport Association Ground Handling Conference in Doha, Qatar. Pallini was chosen as one of the two members of the staff to go on Monday.
“The flight left that Saturday morning at 10 a.m., so I had five days to prepare for a trip to the Middle East,” he said. He had just returned from three separate trips in four days in Denver, Wash. and Seattle on a mix of school and work assignments.
“Before that trip to Qatar, I never thought I’d visit the Middle East or take a flight longer than nine hours (my longest at the time had been Frankfurt-New York). After that trip, I had accomplished both as the return flight was 14 hours,” he said. “Incidentally, later that day when I found out I was going to Qatar, while
I was in my earth science lab, I found out I was selected for the trip to Israel, but that trip wasn’t until the end of June and was separate from work.”
Pallini has advice for anyone who wants to get the most enjoyment out of traveling. “It’s not hard to travel; it just requires research, some sacrifices and a leap of faith. If you want to travel more, you’re going to have to accept you will be outside of your comfort zone since not everybody speaks your language and eats the same food as you. But most parts of the world are accepting and won’t fault you for that. It’s also not expensive,” he said. He recommends seeking out potential deals on platforms such as SecretFlying, Dan’s Deals and Kayak.
Writing for AirlineGeeks.com has been a route for Pallini to explore his passion for travel writing. Starting out as a copy editor in August 2017, Pallini later transitioned to writing his first article in September about his trip from New York to Boston, thanks to an incredible price. “After that, I guess the higher-ups saw I could write and asked me to write articles on high-level events in the industry such as Air Berlin ceasing operations, and the last Boeing 747 flight for United.”
Unsure of what to do when at you arrive at your destination? Pallini has one simple piece of advice: walk. “Walking around and occasionally getting lost will allow you to discover the hidden gems of a city better than anything. Taking the subway/metro is great for long distances, but if you can walk it, I recommend you do.”
Plus, early to bed and early to rise makes a traveler’s experience appreciative, attentive, and leisurely. It’s a hard rule to follow considering jet lag, “but getting up early allows you to see everything you want to see and not have to rush.”
As for combining his passions for politics and travel, Pallini finds that his journeys bring him new surprises and connections. “Almost everywhere I go, I either get asked about Trump or hear people talking about Trump. I’ve found that most people abroad often just assume you’re anti-Trump and feel comfortable with saying bad things about him.”
Travel gives Pallini a perspective of a global world into which American influence has penetrated. “When coming home from Qatar, we had to go through security twice because of new rules from the Department of
Homeland Security, even though we weren’t in the U.S., but thankfully it was after the laptop ban, which Qatar was affected by, because I had to do a term paper on the plane for CRJ44.”

The homecoming football game and pep rally are traditionally events that inspire school spirit. This year was different. Student turn out was dismal at the events. Approximately 20 students attended the pep rally, which was run as a BBQ on Riggs Lawn instead of the usual school spirit celebration at the Pratt Recreation Center or Bethpage Credit Union stadium.
Due to the announcement on Oct. 3 of the LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn athletic team merger, many students chose to boycott homecoming events.
Matthew Blanar, associate director of events for the office of campus life, and Jean Anne Smith, associate dean of students, said they were unaware of any boycotts, and therefore could not respond to the Pioneer’s questions about it.
Asia Turner, a freshman broadcasting major and member of the women’s basketball team, supported the boycott. “I think that it’s the least we can do, honestly, because we don’t want anything to get out of hand,” she said. “What the university did to us was not okay.”
In addition to boycotting the homecoming events, students have signed an online petition on Change.org about the athletic program merger.
“My teammate, Natalie Hickman, actually started a petition and it has over 4,200 signatures to let the president see the merge and how many people it’s hurting rather than helping,” Turner said. She believes drawing attention to the student concerns will help.
Jessica Competiello, a freshman art education major, although not a student athlete, is friends with athletes on campus.
“I don’t agree with what happened with the athletes, but I think boycotting events won’t do anything,” she said. She believes that the affected students should show the promise coaches or the administration how affected their lives had been.
“If that means making videos of teammates all together or speaking directly to ad- ministration as like a group of people,” she said. “Go out there to show how upset you are.”
Football player Terrelle Cyrus, a freshman finance major, is also sympathetic to the concerns of other athletes on campus and feels that their actions are justified. “I’m not against it; I feel like they have a right to feel
the way they feel, and to express themselves,” Cyrus said. “Honestly, they could continue what they’re doing. Letters always help; getting support from communities outside of Post can help as well,” he added.
Football player Greg Powell, a sophomore psychology major, believes the abrupt nature of the announcement has led to more concern. “I really don’t know how I feel about it,” he said. “It doesn’t really affect my sport, but I under- stand why people are doing what they’re doing at the moment.”
Amber Wright, a junior biotech major and rugby player, supports her fellow athletes as well. “I think it’s understandable, it’s a very upsetting thing for a lot of people because you know they came here to play the sport that they’re playing, and now a lot of them are being told ‘you’re not going to be on the team anymore, after this fall’,” She also suggested that the student athletes talk to their local media and bring attention to the issue so that students cannot be ignored.
The Pioneer covered the responses to the merger first, in the Oct. 10 articles “Game Changer: Athletics Becomes ‘OneLIU’,” “Emergency Meeting Pulls Athletes from Class,” and “Students, Faculty Petition Against OneLIU.”
Anton Media Group published a similar article in their newspapers on Oct. 19, “LIU ‘Unifies’ Athletics Programs.”
Newsday followed with their Oct. 20 article, “Consolidation of LIU Post and Brooklyn athletic teams catches students off guard.”

LIU Post’s newest sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, finished its first campus recruitment drive with a Bid Day on Friday, Oct. 12, welcoming 48 women into the organization.
Although Kappa members participated in the first night of formal recruitment on Sept. 24, Kappa withdrew from the remaining days in preparation for its recruitment week. The organization had its own week of recruitment the week after the other four sororities.
“The Monday after formal recruitment, we officially started our recruitment process. We continued tabling and met with each potential new members individually throughout the next two weeks,” Becca Stevenson, Kappa Kappa Gamma’s leadership consultant from nationals said. “In addition, we had mix and mingles so that the potential new members could meet one another, informational sessions and then finished our process with individual interviews.”
On Bid Day, new members were invited to a final party ceremony in Hillwood Commons, which Stevenson said was similar to the “preference round” of formal recruitment. After the ceremony, the new members had a celebration that included a photo booth, DJ, food and different games and icebreakers. When Bid Day ended, the new members joined the rest of the Panhellenic community for ice cream.
Kappa’s recruitment also differed from other recruitments in that potential members met with alumna from other Kappa chapters and national representatives, instead of sisters initiated on campus. The first pledge class of women will be the first group of Post students in Kappa Kappa Gamma.
As Kappa’s first pledge class, the 48 women will play a significant part in shaping the organization’s role on campus.
“One of Kappa’s three philanthropic efforts is a community engagement project,” Stevenson said. “These members will get to pick an organization to work with and sponsor here on Long Island. Since they are also building the chapter from the ground up, there are numerous ways to get involved in both leadership and decision-making,” she added.
Now that Kappa has taken its first class of women, the organization’s members and leadership are looking forward to their future on campus.
“Right now, we are focusing on our new member programming and educating our members,” Stevenson said. “Within the coming semester, we will be participating in various sisterhood and Panhellenic events. We will be having Panhellenic big sisters as well as founding families within Kappa,” she said.
The new chapter will receive their charter from nationals once they have become actively involved on campus. “Our executive board will be determined by the end of the semester and will be installed at the same time we receive our charter,” Stevenson said.
Taylor LaPorta, a junior childhood education major and new Kappa sister, said her recruitment experience with Kappa was different than in the past when she went through recruitment for the other four sororities on campus.
“I had gone through the formal recruitment process, as well, twice. This year I dropped the first night for Kappa,” LaPorta said. “[Recruitment] was very informal and a great experience. All of the women were so nice and wonderful to talk to. I really felt that I could be myself during the whole recruitment process,” she continued.
LaPorta is excited for the opportunities she will have in the new organization.
“I’m really excited to work with the other girls to establish our local philanthropy work. Kappa’s chapters all create their own local philanthropy in addition to Reading is Fundamental (Kappa’s national philanthropy project),” LaPorta said.

An Instagram post depicting mold in the chicken at Subway in Hillwood Commons has students concerned about the safety of the food they consume on campus.
Deborah Agopian, a junior music education major, submitted a photo to the Instagram account “everything_broken_at_post,” showing the buffalo chicken container at Subway possibly contaminated by grey mold. “Nobody else noticed it. It was late at night,” Agiopan said.
Simone Harper-Register, the Northeast District Manager of Aramark, LIU Post’s food provider, denied that any food had mold. “We completed a full investigation and determined that there was no mold present,” Harper- Register said. “There was frost on the container due to the refrigeration unit.”
Agopian said that she also got food poisoning from Twisted Taco, another on- campus food spot that in Hillwood Commons next to Subway.
“[The quality of the food] makes me angry,” Agopian said, “because I pay so much money to be here and I’m paying for this food and you’d expect good quality food when you come here. This is not acceptable by any standards.”
Matt Goldstein, a senior criminal justice major, noticed the quality of the chicken in the photograph of the chicken on instagram. He said his chicken also looked very pink. “I was sickened to my stomach,” Goldstein said. “I don’t want to eat [at school] anymore.”
The Pioneer reported on student concerns of sanitation at the Winnick dining hall in the Nov. 28, 2017 article, “Cleanliness of Winnick Dining Hall.” The Pioneer also reported about student complaints of food quality at dining hall in the Feb. 21, 2018 article, “Students Complain about Undercooked Food.”
Campus catering isn’t a home-cooked meal, and students are demanding better.

On Friday, Oct. 12, Kay Sato, the director of the Hutton House, known for hosting lecture series and classes for adults, many of them retired residents of the communities surrounding campus, was abruptly fired. A beloved and inspiring administrator to many, her dismissal has caused uproar among faculty and students of the program.
Dr. Sato’s termination was due to the creation of a new School of Professional Studies (SPS) set to begin in fall 2019, in which the Hutton House continued education program will be included, according to a statement issued to the campus community by Dr. Rita Langdon and Lynne Manouvrier, the new dean and associate dean of SPS, in an email following Dr. Sato’s firing that Friday. 
“To propel LIU’s advancement and prominence, we must provide a level of innovative and differentiated programming that drives enhanced community engagement and professional partnerships across diverse audiences. This is the impetus behind the renaming and revitalization of the LIU School of Professional Studies – an ambitious endeavor we are extremely excited about,” Langdon and Manouvrier wrote. 
The email goes on to say the vision for SPS is to create an expansive learning platform that will identify synergies between existing programs, along with additional opportunities for experiential learning. “The school will support current students and diversify its curriculum, delivery approaches, and community engagement, which will inform and foster academic excellence across all of the programs comprising the School of Professional Studies,” it stated.
The Hutton House, launched in 1977 under Director Clair Fairman, will be one of eight programs that will make up the new school, including the Global institute led by Trustee and chairman, former congressman Steve Israel; the Hornstein Center for Policy, Polling and Analysis led by director and professor Stanley Klein; the T. Denny Sanford Institute for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Sanford Education Programs, and Sanford Philanthropy; the Center for Gifted Youth; and certificate programs, enrichment courses and networking opportunities through professional education.
Those involved with the Hutton House were confused by the sudden move, as the program is not a professional study, but rather a cultural enrichment program that Dr. Sato described as “learning for the pleasure of learning” through a broad training of liberal arts. 
More than a dozen faculty members have resigned from teaching in the program, many students – some wealthy LIU alumni and donors – withdrew from their classes and demanded refunds and dozens of letters have been sent to the board of trustees, along with a petition signed by over 130 faculty members (nearly half the full time faculty at Post) demanding the reinstatement of  Sato. Among those letters is one from the Hutton House Lectures Advisory Board. 
One of the points made by the advisory board was that LIU’s leadership should be leveraging the role of Sato, rather than eliminating it. “There can be no question that Dr. Sato has been singularly responsible for the success of the Program – she has not been an “administrator” but rather the heart and soul of the program,” the advisory board wrote. “The notion that she may simply be replaced with a more malleable administrator that will allow for further growth of the program and its financial benefits at the behest of the University’s leadership is ludicrous.”
The advisory board was not consulted about the decision to remove Sato, or to begin the reorganization of the program, which goes against its usual process, according to advisory board member, Hutton House “student” and former professor of education Susan Shenker.
“In the last five years, there have literally been hundreds of people terminated from the university in similar ways. Given that pattern, I was certainly aware that Dr. Sato was not in a secure position,” Shenker said. “Shared governance is a requirement of higher education institutions; we don’t have that at the moment at LIU.”
Gordon Tepper, the university director of public relations, responded to the Pioneer’s inquiries to Langdon, stating that the Hutton House had been “stagnant,” and that Langdon and Manouvrier are “truly energizing and elevating the program.”
“That’s a pure lie,” Sato said in response to Tepper.  “We told the administration for a number of years that we had multiple waiting lists for people who wanted to take classes. We needed more rooms, but they wouldn’t give us more space. So we’ve been rotating two classrooms in Lorber Hall.”
Professors in the program also disagree with Tepper’s statement. From its conception in 1977, Hutton House brought in about 300 adult students per year. When Sato took over in 1995, that number jumped to about 1,300 students. Now, the program brings in more than 8,000 students each year, and has extensive waiting lists, according to Sato. 
“[The program] was already energized,” said Dr. John Lutz, professor and chair of the English department, who has resigned from teaching at Hutton House. “I don’t think the students thought it was stagnant. It was a vibrant program,” he said. “If you don’t say how, that’s an empty word.” 
Shawn Welnak, professor of philosophy, also resigned from the program, describing it as a program of “depth and breath,” under Sato’s guidance. “In a way, it’s not Kay’s loss,” he admitted. “She did more for us than we did for her. Her ability to give was unbounded, it’s astounding.”
“Kay was so eager to find inspiring teachers to set up courses in whatever area inspired them, to her credibly deep respect of the humanities,” Welnak said. “Kay is probably the most dedicated, most intelligent, most beloved person – not just staff, faculty, administrators – no one had a bad thing to say about Kay.”
Students at the Hutton House shared the same sentiments. Peter Gollon, who has taken three to four classes a year for 10 years, said the program was collegial. “The students were all middle-aged or older, who take very seriously what they are there to learn,” Gollon said. “It’s stimulating, whatever the academic hassle was with the administration, I didn’t see much of that,” he said, noting no issues with the program itself. Though Gollon noticed the budgetary issues, even once asking Sato why she was buying supplies out of her own pocket.
The advisory board wrote in an Addendum to the board of trustees that “budgets have been decreased to less than the total costs of materials, office supplies, and hospitality; donations by staff are, therefore, typically made to continue the smooth and uninterrupted operation of all HHL programs.”
After Sato’s dismissal, Gollon is considering withdrawing from his classes and demanding a refund along with several other students.
In the email from Langdon and Manouvrier, they thanked Sato for helping develop Hutton and for her service to Long Island University and to the community. They wrote, “We can assure you that we are now building upon Hutton House’s solid foundation by expanding programming to create a nationally recognized initiative that will have on-campus as well as off-site offerings throughout our region and the world.”
Until that email, Sato said she “never heard any thank you for my service – only from off campus” from her students. The Friday she was dismissed, she was told to leave her belongings and was escorted to her car and seen off campus – a practice done in corporations, not academia. She was also given a severance agreement, but did not sign it so that she can continue to support the faculty and students of the university.
“She was so horribly treated in the way she was dismissed,” Lutz said. “Maybe in a corporation, it’s okay, but it’s not like Kay was holding onto some state secrets.”  
Lutz, along with many others, believes Sato’s firing was unjust. “When you break up teams like this, you undercut the whole educational mission of the university,” he said. “We’ve lost connections to the community – significant connections. It will have a negative impact for sure, not only financial, but [the community’s] attitude for the university as well – it hurts the reputation of the university.”
Sato formed strong bonds with both students and faculty, which Lutz says is unique in regards to the current relationship between faculty and administrators.
“She was such a resource to faculty,” Lutz said, describing how Sato helped faculty with many things from teaching something they’re interested in, to more mundane things like giving them a cup of coffee.
“You really have to value individuals and their contributions,” Lutz said, “and all these announcements are ambitious and exciting, but you have to build the path to it. We’re not going to accomplish them unless more account is taken of the human and the humane element.” 
Sato couldn’t agree more. “I’ve always been pro-professors and students,” she said. “When you forget about them, then you’ve gone down the wrong path. It’s about the students, it’s about the professors, it’s about education – that’s what everyone should be dedicated to. Pledge that you’ll do good for students and professors or get out.”
Though Sato is gone, the program is expected to continue under the new School of Professional Studies. Whether or not the enrollments will continue to reflect the 8,000+ Sato and the professors brought in each year is unclear. 
There is a chance that the students and professors of the program will continue to work together outside of the program. “I suspect [the students] will use their money to reconstitute this program on the side,” Welnak said after speaking to a few of his students who have all withdrawn from the program. “I’ve already been asked to continue teaching and been invited to their homes to do classes and continue – and I will continue to teach Homer to these people.”
As Sato said, liberal arts is the heart and soul of what it takes to learn, and these students have it. “You need to be broadly trained in the liberal arts, you’ll be able to problem solve and take on difficult tasks. That’s what you need to function and go out into the world.”

I am late in learning of Dr. Sato’s firing, but as a student of hutton house since 1979, I am horrified.  LIU’s announcement, “To propel” blah blah blah, is nothing but higher ed. gobbledygook. We all know it when we see it.  Dr. Sato cannot be improved upon.  This is your loss.
Dr. Sato was the fuel, the engine and the transmission keeping the program alive and flourishing. Stagnant is a lie when the classes are filled and people are willing to wait for an open seat, when available. She will be missed but in reality she will be an asset to any school in the metropolitan area. Professionally, only a fool would have let her go. LIU should be ashamed.
I just learned of Dr.Sato’s firing.  I am horrified over it AND the WAY SHE WAS TREATED.  It was savage and below civilized behavior.   Now I know why there were only eight people in the class about Jennifer Jones!  There are other collleges and universities that should snap her up before it’s too late for them.

Coming off of a big Homecoming win 37-6 against Saint Anselm College, the Pioneers defended their undefeated streak in their match against long-time rivals, the Pace University Setters, on Oct. 20. 
The 41-6 win against the Setters marks the 15th straight win since October 1998. Head coach Brian Collins, who was in the middle of his first season coaching at Post when they last lost to Pace, recalled the promise he made, saying, “‘We’ll never lose to that team again.”
The last time the Pioneers started off a season 6-0 was in 2016. Back then, the Pioneers were “a little more explosive defensively in 2016” but are doing better defensively this year, according to Collins. “We’ll compare them after we accomplished what the 2016 team accomplished. Until then we’re fighting hard to win the next game,” he said.
The football team is nationally ranked No. 20 in the American football coaches poll. “It’s nice to be recognized by coaches around the country, and they recognize we have a very strong program,” Collins said. The success of their program can be attributed, in part, to their undefeated record in the regular season. “Now it’s crunch time and it’s Pioneer time,” he said. “It’s October – when the leaves start falling the Post boys start balling.”
The defensive players are putting in the work and reaping the benefits. Nazir Streater, a sophomore defensive back player, made a huge step up in defense. “He’s feeling real comfortable about himself,” Collins said. “He has tremendous skills, he’s an excellent athlete.”
Now more than halfway through the regular season, many defensive players stand out. “I think Zach Cofrancesco (junior defensive back) stands out,” Collins said. “He’s very engaged, he’s smart and he knows what he’s doing, he knows how to play the game. He’s probably the biggest surprise on the entire team, he’s playing at such a high level.”
The Pioneers now sit at 7-0 for the season. Their next game is against Assumption College in Worcester, Mass as part of the NCAA Division II Showcase on Oct. 27. Kickoff is at 1:05 p.m.

One of the concerns that has been raised after the mid-semester announcement about OneLIU is whether student voices are heard by university administrators, and how they can communicate their concerns.
Dean of Students Michael Berthel believes that the Student Government Association (SGA) is an important vehicle for student concerns to be addressed. “The SGA is one of the most important tools that students have,” Berthel said. 
There are several ways in which students can interact with SGA to voice their concerns or comments, he said. “There is a series of events throughout the year [such as] town hall meetings where students have an opportunity to come and talk to university administration and department heads throughout the university.”
Berthel also spoke of the importance of the success coaches in this process.  The success coaches are students’ “point of contact,” he said. “I would encourage students who want to have their voice heard or who have concerns or issues, whatever it’s regarding, to start with their success coach and have that conversation and to go that route first.” 
LIU Promise, Berthel said, has an open door policy. “If students have concerns, they can walk in, they can set up a meeting, no questions asked at any time,” he said. “So at any time, a student can come in here [LIU Promise] and set up a meeting with me or speak with me, or email me and I’ll respond or we’ll meet with them.”
Many students reach out to Berthel via email, he said. “I do get concerns or comments from students, if they have an idea or something they want to bring to campus, they want a new service or program they want offered or they want to make a new club, we get emails like that all the time. Make sure you reach out, make your voice heard,” he said.
Not all students feel comfortable coming to the Promise office or calling on the phone, but Berthel said there are alternatives. “That’s why we keep up on social media and email, and how students express themselves it is important for us to know what students are feeling.” LIU Promise has social media accounts on Instagram (@postliupromise), Twitter (@PostLIUPromise) and Facebook (LIU Promise LIU Post).
The Promise office is always looking to improve how the administration receives and responds to feedback. “Things are more successful if they are student led,” Berthel said. “If students have a concern or have an issue or want to see something different, we’ll make that change.” 
The success coach social held on Wednesday, Oct. 17 was a success, according to Berthel. “The idea was come in and talk to your success coach about an idea you had or something you want to see on campus; Jean and I were available to talk to students,” Berthel said, referring to Jean Anne Smith, the associate dean of students and Title IX coordinator. 
Student feedback is necessary to go about the big changes on campus, Berthel said. “I think that students are everything we do and every decision we make is for students.” He stressed the importance of SGA in this process. “SGA really is there so that they can be the bridge between the students and the administration.”
Some students fear repercussions if they voice their concerns. But there is assurance for students. “There are no repercussions for bringing up comments or concerns,” Berthel said. “We want to hear students’ concerns,” Smith added. “If you don’t tell us, we will never know.”
Erica Ferrara, a senior geology and environmental sustainability major and the vice president of the SGA, said that the group has been working to improve how students give feedback to SGA and to the administration. 
“SGA has been working very hard to have all student concerns heard by upper administration,” Ferrara said. “Our council has been meeting with multiple administrators in the past few weeks,” she added. These administrators include Berthel, director of campus life Ashley John, athletic director Debbie DeJong, President Kimberly Cline and director of facilities services Roy Fergus. 
“We feel that in the past, SGA has not been as active in addressing the concerns of the student body,” Ferrara said, “but our current council is seeking to fix this issue by being more present, and more available to the student body.”
SGA plans to address these issues with tabling events to hear from students. “We have a series of tabling events coming up this week and next week [to hear] from students what their primary concerns are in regards to our campus,” Ferrara explained. “The council will then go through these concerns and bring them to the appropriate administrators and even create petitions for students to sign so that their voices are heard.”
SGA will create a newsletter to increase communication, and an anonymous comment forum. “We have created an anonymous comment form that can be accessed through a QR code that will be displayed all around campus, where students can submit comments, concerns, and suggestions to us,” she said.
In the past, SGA has hosted town halls at which administrators could listen and speak to students. “There will be a series of Town Halls this semester,” Ferrara said, “each focusing on a different area of LIU and so students can come with their concerns on the topics being discussed, and speak to the appropriate administrator. These smaller events will allow everyone to speak and be heard by upper administration.”
Ferrara encourages students to email or contact any member of the SGA executive board. She can be contacted at erica.ferrara@my.liu.edu. SGA is also seeking a Greek Senator and Athletic Senator. “We are also requesting that anyone interested in joining our council or getting involved in any particular initiative, to contact myself or Olivia Kavanaugh,” Ferrara said.

Sadly, the so-called “One LIU” campaign is the penultimate step in the University’s decades-long effort to completely subsume the identity of the C.W. Post campus and rewrite history.  I graduated in 1968 and my diploma read “C.W. Post College.” I didn’t get my diploma laminated for a couple of years, and when I finally did, the studio smeared the printing and ruined the diploma, making it necessary to obtain a replacement.  The replacement, which I received in 1970, read “C.W. Post Center of Long Island University.” The effort had begun.  Since then, my alma mater has been successively renamed the “C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University,” and most recently, “LIU Post.”  Typically, the “LIU Post” rebranding was implemented during the semester break in order that students would not be given an opportunity to voice their opinions and would return to campus to encounter a fait accompli.
With each rebranding, the University has chipped away at our identity and tradition.  The title of the current campaign  (One LIU), while ostensibly focused on the limited goal of combining the two campuses’ athletic teams under one banner, betrays the TRUE objective of the University administration; i.e., erasing forever the identity of C.W. Post by absorbing it lock, stock and barrel into LIU.  Goodbye to our name, goodbye to our beloved school colors of Green and Gold, and goodbye to “Pioneers.”
Lest anyone think that I’m overreacting, one has only to look at the campus website, which describes our campus as a “former Gold Coast estate,” with no mention of C.W. Post, whose family sold the estate to the University, making it possible to establish C.W. Post College.  
Several years ago, at an athletic department function shortly before his retirement,  President Cline’s predecessor, David Steinberg, attempted to explain why our school’s name had been changed in favor of “LIU Post.” His justification appeared to be that it was done in reaction to the fact that Mr. Post’s heirs did not continue to support the University financially to the extent that the administration thought appropriate; as I listened to his justification for the name change (rendered in a somewhat confrontational manner), it was hard for me to come to any conclusion other than that it had been done out of spite.  Needless to say, the attendees were not very supportive of his remarks and made their displeasure known in a very vocal way.  Steinberg appeared to take no notice of the audience’s reaction, plodding on through his remarks until he had finished what he had to say.  Upon finishing his address, he took no questions or comments from those in attendance.  
I am very sympathetic to the current students’ anger and confusion at the Cline Administration’s apparent policy of making decisions without considering input from students, faculty, alumni and other interested parties. It’s no consolation to either you or me to note that it’s part of a decades-long leadership pattern of top-down decision-making that ignores input from anyone who doesn’t drink the Kool-Aid, and attempts to censor anyone or any organization that has the temerity to disagree with the dictates from the ivory tower. 
As students, you always have the option to pull up stakes ( as unhappy a prospect that it may be), and transfer to a school that realizes its responsibility to listen to its stakeholders and take their needs into consideration. This administration must be made to understand that they need to listen to what we have to say.  They need to acknowledge that as a student, you are more than merely a checkbook, and if and when you graduate and become alumni, you will vote with that checkbook when they come around (as they inevitably will) to look for financial support from alumni.

The SAL Gallery had a reception for its latest exhibit showcasing the work of Danielle Savarese, a second year MFA student. “Dive In,” featured artwork by Savarese consisting of themes such as the oceans, sea turtles and ocean pollution.
Most of Savarese’s works were made using acrylic paint with a resin glaze. “I like the resin glaze,” Savarese said. “Not only does it give that shiny, wet look, it also pushes that idea again of the plastic ocean. Using the acrylic paints and the resin isn’t necessarily environmentally safe, but I felt that they were important to use.” 
Savarese also utilized objects that would otherwise be thrown away into her art, like plastic bags as paintbrushes. One of her paintings, entitled “Gnarly Dude,” was painted on a recycled surfboard. 
Savarese, who teaches elementary school students, included a mural drawn by her students from grades one to three in her exhibition, called “World Oceans Day- June 8, 2018.” Savarese’s students drew on the mural, with each class adding to what the previous class drew. “It was just fun getting involved and learning about different types of sea creatures,” Savarese said. The mixed media mural used sharpies, crayon, and watercolor paint to create a childlike affect.     
A science experiment was also included in the exhibit. A piece of a plastic bag and some dental floss were placed in a plastic bottle filled with dyed blue water, to represent a jellyfish. “It’s to demonstrate what the sea turtles see in the water,” Savarese explained. “This jellyfish is obviously not real, but this is what the sea turtles are seeing. There’s garbage floating in the ocean, and unfortunately they confuse the garbage with food.” 
Emmitt Collins, a friend of Savarese’s from elementary school attended the event. Collins’ favorite piece at the exhibit was “Crashed,” one of the acrylic and resin paintings. “I like the material, looks kind of like glass,” said Collins. 
Other visitors to the gallery were there out of curiosity, like Shayla Harris. “I really like kids, so I really like the mural,” said Harris.
Out of the entire exhibit, Savarese’s favorite piece was “Carapace.” The title refers the top of a turtle shell. The piece was painted on hexagon-sided canvases, making each painting appear to be a turtle’s shell. “Turtles are one of my favorite animals,” said Savarese. “They’re pretty much the whole reason behind this whole show.”

The arrival of the colder months means more time for some of our favorite activities: watching movies, drinking hot cocoa and cozying up inside with a board game. While there are many things to look forward to, there are also things to be mindful of. For one, Vitamin D deficiencies are extremely common in the chillier months.

 
Vitamin D is a hormone that our bodies produce when the cholesterol in our skin is exposed to the sun. It’s important for calcium absorption, nervous system functioning and overall hormone balance. 
Some causes of a vitamin D deficiency include remaining indoors during the winter, a diet lacking in fish and seeds, and not enough exposure to our main source of Vitamin D, the sun. 
When UV rays hit our skin, they convert stored cholesterol into fat-soluble vitamin D, so it’s important to spend some time outside everyday. 
People who live in polluted cities, are allergic to dairy products, wear sunscreen everyday and who have darker skin are naturally more susceptible to vitamin D deficiencies.
Additional benefits of vitamin D include proper absorption of magnesium and iron, reduction in whole body inflammation, enhanced immune function and even reduced feelings of depression.
Common symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency, according to the Mayo Clinic, include achy bones, weakness, depression and sore/aching muscles. Luckily, there is something that can be done about it. After a chat with your healthcare professional, some remedies for a vitamin D deficiency include taking a supplement (found at local drug store), increasing consumption of fish and fish oils, and choosing more fortified foods such as cereals, breads, milks and yogurts.
Vitamin D has lifelong benefits, and making sure you sustain healthy levels can ensure proper immune function and even decrease the risk of some cancers that could arise later on in the future.
