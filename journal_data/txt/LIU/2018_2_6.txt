Over the winter break, the office of campus life moved upstairs in Hillwood Commons and was merged with the LIU Promise office. The combined departments are now located in Hillwood Commons 270. An email was issued to the LIU community on Jan. 22 that made students aware of Campus Life’s integration into LIU Promise, and invited students to a “Meet & Greet” during common hour on Jan. 23. Students have mixed feelings about the merger of the two student service departments.
Julia Newcity, a freshman political science major, is pleased. “I think it’s better because don’t they tell you on the tour that everything’s all in one place, and now it’s all in one place. It’s more convenient to just go to one place,” Newcity said.
Other students noted that the combination is nice because it put two offices physically together. “I think it’s actually a good thing, so you can get a two-in-one kind of experience,” Destinee Pierre, a freshman political science major, said. Convenience is another positive for some students. “You don’t have to go here and then somewhere else,” Destiny Dowe, a freshman nursing major, said.
However, other students objected to the merger. “It’s a travesty,” Richard Grillo, a senior psychology major, said. “I liked it when Campus Life concentrated on the life of the campus and Promise focused on the promise they made the students, to be there and to hold us in sickness and in health. I think the two will eventually swallow each other up and become one unit as opposed to a more effective divide-and-conquer approach that they used prior to this combination.”
Although Michael Berthel, the dean of students who oversees the combined offices, would not meet personally with the Pioneer to discuss the merger, he responded to questions by email. “This change has helped us create a more student-friendly and dynamic office that is welcoming dozens of students every day. In addition, all success coaches and staff members received training on how to support students in every aspect of the University,” Berthel said. In addition, during the first week of spring semester classes, “LIU Promise held a series of welcome back events to celebrate the beginning of the semester. These events were designed to greet students and help highlight the new changes for the spring semester. These events were promoted in an email, New Year, New Us, that announced the new model.”
Berthel said that the combination helped unify the team in one central location. “The change allows the LIU Promise staff to be better equipped to connect their students to all aspects of the campus. Several staff members took on more leadership roles within LIU Promise,” Berthel said.
Ashley John, the director of student engagement, said that the merger was intended to serve students holistically. “The merge of LIU Promise and Campus Life was done to serve our students best holistically. Through my role as Director of Student Engagement, I hope to provide different opportunities to strengthen student involvement and student success. Whether you are interested in joining an organization, searching service opportunities, gaining career advice or want to know the movies of the month, the LIU Promise office is your connection. We encourage students to engage with staff and different resources offered through our office for them to best connect to the LIU Post community,” John said.
The office of conference services, which oversees campus functions and events, has moved into the former offices of campus life on the first oor of Hillwood Commons. Aramark has moved into the former offices of conference services down the hall.

With the recent announcement of the new veterinary technology program coming to Post, reported in the Pioneer on Jan. 24 students and faculty can expect to see a new vet tech club on campus in September 2018. The club will be a great way for vet tech students to connect to other members of the Post community, through service-oriented activities, Dr. Robin Sturtz, director of the new vet tech program, said.
“Vet tech students tend to be very compassionate and service-oriented,” Sturtz said. “Many of our projects will be aimed at helping local animal shelters.” In addition to being director of the vet tech program, Sturtz will advise the club. Sturtz plans to have the club conduct collection drives for local animal shelters, for the Post community to donate “towels, blankets, pet food, and toys.” For the students involved in the club, Sturtz said the experience “can show them what shelters are like and what they need, and can help them provide needed services.”
The club will also hold fundraisers for the ASPCA, as well as educational events open to all students on campus, Sturtz said. While Sturtz worked at LaGuardia Community College, the school’s vet tech club sponsored a speaker who discussed domestic violence and animal abuse. “After the event, students from all majors were asking themselves ‘what can I do to help?’ And several of those students went on to volunteer in that field.”
Sturtz hopes that the club will attract students from all majors, as it is not limited to only students involved in veterinary technology. “All students with an interest in animals will be able to join,” she said. She also hopes the club will be a large part of campus life, with plans for on-campus events “giving club members the opportunity to socialize with other students- to get together, have fun, eat, and talk about important topics outside of the classroom.”
Although the club has not yet come to campus, students are already excited about the opportunity to get involved. Julianna Labita, a nutrition major, said she would like to see the club on campus. “I would love to be hands-on with animals. There aren’t many opportunities to do that outside of clubs like this,” she said. “It’s great to be able to help in a hands-on way.”
Ashley Komornik, a freshman radiology major who plans on attending veterinary school after college, said her past experience in the field makes her excited for the club’s potential. “I work at a cat shelter, and I have to give the animals shots and medication, so I am used to it,” she said. “It’s a good field to go into if you love animals. When you see that the animals feel better, you have such a good feeling.”
For Sturtz, that “good feeling” is an integral part of veterinary technology, and a main goal of the club. “With [the club], we plan to do as much good as we can,” she said.

Having a hard time in the love area? Still haven’t found that special person? Or just looking for a friend? This Valentine’s Day, Runway will be hosting their first ever “cupid shuffle” speed dating event from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the End Zone. Though speed dating may seem old fashioned to some, the members of Runway believe it is an ideal way for people to meet. “Whether it’s a quick fling, a friendship or even a long term relationship” Jamal White, senior political science major and designer for the club, said.
The speed dating event promotes the club’s main goal, which is for students to be open and accepting of themselves and others. “[We want] to get students interacting with one another and creating new friendships, although, if there happens to be a romantic spark, that’s an added bonus,” Keolani Williams, senior forensic science major and member of the club, said. Students are welcome to dress to impress, or casual – whatever makes them comfortable.
This is the first major event of the semester for Runway, but they have plenty more in store.
On April 6, Runway will host a fashion show featuring several outside designers, as well as some designs from White. The theme for last year’s runway show was “We The Party,” which featured designers like such as FVN, Traci Lynn Jewelry, Omenka, Wvrri, and many more.
The new executive board of the club features students from diverse majors. Taylor Hill, senior broadcasting major, and Keolani Williams, senior forensic science major, are both responsible for coordinating promotion for the fashion show. White will be bringing back his designed t-shirts and jackets for the fashion show, all featuring an urban theme, while other members will serve as models.
Runway continues to promote the theme and goal of openness and acceptance. The club is open to models of all sizes, ethnic backgrounds, and genders. “We always try to be as inclusive as possible, and runway is a place for you to become more comfortable in your body,” Tarah Simon, a junior political science major and member of the club, said.
Runway meets every Monday and Wednesday from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the Long Island room located in the Winnick Student Center.

The School of Health Science and Nursing offers a bachelor’s degree in social work, a minor in social work and an advanced certificate program in forensic social work. Professor Pamela Brodlieb is the newly appointed director of the program, and is ready to share her experience with students.
Brodlieb worked for 13 years as the director of field education for the social work program, before beginning her position as director of the social work program at the start of the fall semester. This semester, Brodlieb is teaching two classes, SWK I, “Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare” and a master’s seminar, SWK 702-02 “Field in- struction II” in addition to her administrative responsibilities in overseeing the program.
Brodlieb emphasizes the breadth of the field of social work. “On Long Island, we see a lot of substance abuse, but social work is also helping people over the course of a life-span,” she said. There are multiple fields social workers can work in, including, but not limited to substance misuse clinics, mental health agencies, hospitals, child welfare agencies, and other youth-serving organizations.
Before earning her master’s degree in social work at the University of Albany, Brodlieb had a career in college student a airs. She acted as the assistant dean of students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. “I was responsible for the entire orientation program for the university, served as a judicial hearing officer and was the assistant director of women student services,” Brodlieb said.
The social work senior class has just seven students. “The classes are small but the students have a lot of attention from the faculty,” she said. Students benefit from hands-on attention, working one on one with their professors.
Brodlieb described the role of a social worker in a school system. “We have a five-year old in kindergarten who is acting out, and the teacher says that we need to send this kid out. In sending that student out to the principal’s office, it’s the social worker that is educated in training to find out what else is happening that is causing this disruptive behavior,” she said. Social workers like to identify the root cause of a behavior. They are going to ask, ‘did the kid sleep in a bed the night before,’ or ‘did they come to school with or without breakfast?’
Adam Silverstein is a sophomore social work major. “My biggest passion in life is helping other people, so, social work seemed like a good choice,” he said. Silverstein runs the “Be the Change” club, whose mission is to spread kindness around campus.
Tyrese Bailey, sophomore social work major, also shares a passion in helping people. “I just like helping people through their problems and making someone’s life a little better,” he said. Bailey’s plans after graduation are to work with children who come from a tough family background.
One event this semester for social work students to attend is LEAD Day (Legislative Education Advocacy Day) on March 21, 2o18. LEAD Day is sponsored by the National Association of Social Workers in Albany. At the event, the students will be advocating the Social Work Investment Initiative, and protest conversion therapy.

Friday, Dec.1, 2017
On Dec. 1, 2017, at 7:20 p.m., there was an incident of criminal misconduct at Kings Hall. Details were not reported. The disposition was closed.
Monday, Dec. 4, 2017
On Dec. 4, 2017, there was a report of off-campus stalking. The date of the incident was from Nov. 28 until Dec. 3, 2017. The disposition is still pending.
Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2017
On Dec. 12, 2017, the campus shuttle bus rear-ended another car on campus. It is unclear whether the damaged car belonged to a student, faculty member, or other member of the community. It is unknown if anyone was hurt. This incident was not reported by Public Safety, but was submitted to the Pioneer by a witness.
Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018
On Jan. 7, Public Safety was notified by the department of campus electronics of a serious leak caused by a broken sprinkler that hit the ceiling of the outer west vestibule of Post Hall. The resulting flood did extensive damage to the offices in the basement (lower level) of Post Hall. The following offices sustained varying degrees of water damage. Learning Support: E13, E16, E12, E7, E10, and E9. HEOP: C9, C8, C4 (extensive damage), C7, C5. Day Camp: C2 (extensive) and C1 (extensive). Plummers responded and stopped the leak and restored water supply to building. The custodian staff on campus was notified and cleaned up the water.
Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2018
On Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2018, at approximately 6:24 to 6:47 a.m, it was reported by the Pratt Building manager that a lamp post fell down on the East Road in front of Brookville Hall. Upon Public Safety’s arrival, it was observed that the lamp post was partially lying in the roadway. A public safety officer took pictures and moved the lamp post off to the side.
At approximately 2:40 p.m., an officer observed a gray Florida Pilot doing donuts/skitting and driving all over the football practice field/rugby field area. The officer reported that two males were involved, but it was unknown if they were students. It appears that the driver exited southwest of the baseball field. Another witness took a video on the scene as the driver uncontrollably drove on the turf of the field, which was forwarded to Public Safety.

Shaireen Rasheed, professor of philosophical foundations and multiculturalism in the School of Education, Information and Technology enriched her class by allowing them to attend “Jabber”, a play performed at the Tilles Center by Mariana Tayler, Ian Geldart, and David Sklar. The play taught students the importance of not judging someone from a different culture.
“Jabber,” written by Marcus Youssef, tells the story of a young Muslim-American girl named Fatima, who has been perceived as a bad individual in her new educational environment. Jorah, a guy who has a reputation at school, places stereotypical labels on her by making statements such as “What’s the scarf on your head,” criticizing her hijab. Fatima, however, takes a stand and tells Jorah that she isn’t who he thinks she is. Throughout the play, Jorah learns to trust Fatima and vice versa, despite their two different worlds. Fatima has her own beliefs from her country, but Jorah slowly develops a way to understand it.
“Stephanie Turner, the LIU Arts education director for outreach at Tilles Center is a visionary in that she is very committed to shows that will raise the consciousness of students by exposing them to contemporary discourses and struggles in society.” Rasheed said.
With the passion for emphasizing the importance of culture, Rasheed believes that her students in her EDI and EDU courses must be exposed to the current issues. She talks about the importance of theater in her teaching pedagogy.
“Since my classes deal with the social and philosophical constructions of identity as it intersects with race, gender, sexuality, and ability, I thought this particular theatrical performance would be a good example of how such identities get played out in real life; Also, in the current climate, it is important for students to be aware of how some identities are silenced in which educators can be more inclusive in our settings.” Rasheed said.
“The play elucidates the dangers of stereotyping. In the play, “a girl who wears a hijab is bullied because of that and in understanding her journey helps us better understand other students similar to what she has gone through.” Rasheed said. “There were other aspects of the play that are important such as domestic violence, consent, cyber bullying that are brought up in relation to the boy she befriends, all the topics that as educators, we need to be aware of.” she added.
Rasheed believes that the writer of the play, Marcus Youssef, helps students understand how cultures are integrated, especially in the Muslim community.
“Schools, as the writer of “”Jabber”” says, are places where unlike almost anywhere, people of all histories and backgrounds are thrown together, and where young people of all kinds must learn about what they believe in, and how far they are willing to go to defend those beliefs.” Rasheed said.
Dr. Arnold Dodge, chair and associate professor of the department of educational leadership and administration [in the College of Education, Information, and Technology believes the play is a must see for students today.
“I was profoundly moved by “Jabber”,- he said. “The playwright Marcus Youse , tackled what may be the most important subject of our times: the imperative of social justice for all people, particularly for Muslims worldwide.”
“The message is particularly important to widely share with youth who may be disenchanted with our leaders; The actors portrayed their characters with dignity, the relationship that develops between Fatima and her high school friend transcends the meanness that occurs when we demonize the “other,” Dodge said.
Dodge believes that classrooms should incorporate lessons like these that will expose students to other cultures and ways of thinking. “The classroom curriculum must include a potent civics component if we are to defeat the scourge of authoritarianism.” he said.
Dodge recommends that other students see “Jabber” in order to widen their perception. “I recommend that everyone sees the production, especially secondary school and college students who are forming their perspectives of the wider world.” he said.
Georgina Perlata, an American-Dominican, who is a sophomore, majoring in early childhood education with a concentration in Spanish, found “Jabber” to be eye opening.
“Jabber was an eye-opening performance, it loudly spread the message about how Muslims are a targeted group of discrimination; the way Fatima experiences the discrimination in school by being called a terrorist and the way she dresses mirrors what happens in schools today.” she said.
Peralta believes that schools should continue to implement messages like this to students today.
“It is important for educators and students to see plays like this to be inspired to learn about different cultures and be more understanding; once everyone becomes aware of the history behind different cultures, we can get closer to unite as one.” she said.

We all know that Valentine’s Day is “The day of love,” and while the day is particularly enjoyable for couples who like to celebrate their relationship, there’s always a certain amount of stress that surrounds the day. “What if he/she doesn’t like my gift? What if they thought I would’ve spent more money? What if this mediocre gift affects our relationship…?” These questions can be easily avoidable by just giving the day a splash of unique thought.
Since relationships are often based off of memories, experiences and commonalities, why not make the day personalized rather than spending an average of eighty dollars on roses and chocolates. I think we can all agree that that’s not only fattening, but cliche and seems like an easy way out.
There’s a light at the end of this tunnel, though, LIU! Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be the day of debt or the the day of stress! We can all impress that special someone right from our own home. The following are some ideas that won’t break the bank and are sure to impress your loved one.
Homemade memory books. There’s a fantastic website called mixbook.com that not only runs sales very frequently, but allows you to upload photos taken from your phone or computer onto the site and into a photo book template. In addition, to this you can edit the template and add in extra splashes of personalized content. If, however, you’d rather be more involved in the gift, you can take a trip to CVS, print some photos, and then purchase a small scrapbook at Michael’s. You can even decorate it with mementos from your relationship to really go over the top!
Shower your other half with small notes and reminders that they’re your favorite person! Leave them on their car, in their mailbox, on their front door, or in a notebook. Write down on paper things you love about them and every time they nd one on V-Day, they’ll certainly feel loved.
Make dinner for (or with) your loved one and seal it with a heart shaped dessert. With today’s low quality and/or high priced food choices, a trip to the grocery store and a few hours in the kitchen is not only more personal and romantic, but extremely practical. Light a candle, turn on their favorite music and veg out… then tie up the night with a good movie!
Take them out for a night in town and just enjoy the time and atmosphere! This doesn’t have to be a money spending endeavor, but instead could end up creating new stories and some great memories. Pop in and out of a few stores, sight see, and taste some different foods. If you both like to dance, try looking for a dance hall to stir things up.
Valentine’s Day can be a grand celebration or a grand reminder that you’re flying solo, so for a more inside peek at love and its nature, I caught up with Dr. Haeryun Choi, Ph.D, a Philosophy Professor here at LIU Post and got some of her-more qualified than I am-opinion and feelings on love.
Choi says that, “While there are many different types of love, they all have a common characteristics.” As gathered from the works of the famous philosophers Plato and Rousseau, and from knowledge obtained from personal reflections of her own life, Choi says that “Understanding yourself must come first. Self-love, not to be confused with selfishness and selfish desires, is required in order to be able to love another.”
“If we don’t value ourselves as individuals,” Choi says, “then the foundation of a relationship becomes based off of seeking validation and acceptance from the other person. With self love, however, we are then able to value another human being and have a stronger bond.”
In closing, Professor Choi left students with one last view on love: “A relationship shouldn’t be based on the fact that another person is giving you something, because sooner or later you will be disappointed. Don’t, however,” she says, “miss out on a chance at love because of fear. Taking a step towards another person, whether it’s a right or wrong step, will, in the end help you discover who you truly are.”

Tim Dougherty earned a bachelor of arts degree in history and education in 2004 and a master of arts in political science in 2008 from LIU Post. He first started working at LIU in data-entry and administrative positions while in undergrad, he now serves as the director of the department of offices services for the University Center, LIU Post, Brooklyn, and Brentwood. He has worked at LIU for 20 years and makes it his responsibility to deliver the resources the campus requires to improve the lives of its students.
Dougherty supervises a staff of 17 people, and is responsible for managing an annual budget of almost $1 million. The mail office, located in the basement of Pell Hall, is responsible for processing all mail, ordering cases of paper, creating campus directories, brochures, exams, commencement materials, admission material, processing payrolls for all faculty and students, issuing W-2’s and more. “We are here to assist professors in their goals to teach the students, there’s no better job than that and I’m honored LIU chose me to help fulfill its mission,” Dougherty said. As a former student, he understands how expensive a private university can be, which is why he makes it his mission to reduce cost by completing task on their own without the assistance of costly outside vendors.
An important and highly sensitive part of his job is supporting professors during finals week, where he is responsible for preparing exam materials for all of the campuses. What does he do to avoid the cheating scandals that have occurred at universities across the nation? “I value the academic integrity of our university, not only are our doors locked when no one is in the office, all exams are stored in a metal cage and locked at all times, they may only be picked up by the professor teaching the course,” he said. As a director, it can be challenging to supervise staff and making it a healthy environment. For Dougherty, the most important skills are great communication and transparency with his staff.
Dougherty has exciting goals for the future. He would like to open an LIU Office Center in Hillwood Commons, where students may receive the same services they get at FedEx or UPS. “I want students to be able to make colored copies on campus, or send packages directly from the university,” he said. He has earned two degrees from LIU and is honored to give back and serve the same university that offered him endless possibilities.

Christine Henrickson, a clerk in the office services department who assists professors with all of their photocopying needs, has worked at LIU Post for more than 31 years. A native of Manhasset, she chose to work at LIU due to the proximity to her home. Later, she came to know and love the community she works with. She often makes over 1000 copies a week, including printing and binding services, not only for faculty at LIU Post, but also at LIU Brentwood and LIU Brooklyn.
When students receive a syllabus on the first day of classes, handouts, and exams, they are unaware that it is Henrickson’s job to ensure that those materials are ready and accurate for their professors to distribute. “I really love my job, I’m treated well and it’s fulfilling to help the students receive important materials needed while furthering their education,” Henrickson said. Her office in the basement of Pell Hall is equipped with two large, heavy duty machines that must be programmed to handle this type of volume. When asked about the most challenging part of her job, Henrickson mentioned the paper cuts, but also“the fear of making mistakes.” Her job is truly fulfilling for her, its keeps her busy Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and also offers her job security. Despite the move to online classes, professors still distribute multiple handouts.
Liz Follano, a graduate assistant in the art therapy department, relies on Henrickson for her photocopying needs.“When I need something right away, I can always count on Christine, she’s organized, works quickly, and never says no,” Follano said. Departments must send in requests for copies to be made at least three days in advance due to the heavy volume and tight deadlines that must be met. This doesn’t stop Christine from going above and beyond to meet the needs of the campus. She also handles copying for administrators, as well as professors. The biggest events of the year, including open houses, commencement, the LIU gala, and honor society ceremonies are all a part of her work. They are important to the staff of offices services because their audience includes university executives, donors and parents who pay the tuition bills.
Tim Dougherty, the director of office services, has worked with Henrickson as a colleague and most recently as a supervisor. “Christine is a wonderful employee, she’s never late nor calls in sick,” he said. “I can leave the campus and know everything will be attended to with no issues.”.

Need a break in between class or just your regular pick me up in the morning? The LIU Post Starbucks in Hillwood Commons has just that, and more. Not only is this Starbucks serving up drinks but it is serving up smiles as well.
Hidden away behind the counter is one lady who loves her job.
A worker in a green apron and black hat frantically makes each customers drink exactly as they order. She stands directly behind the counter going back and forth between machines to make the drinks. After finishing an order she yells out the name on the cup and as the customer grabs the drink from her hand, she smiles and says, “Hello, how is your day?” As the line grows longer, her anxiety grows with it. Taking deep breaths in between each order. Even though the line is getting longer she doesn’t let that get in the way of her genuine conversations when each customer walks up to receive their drink. The smile never leaves her face.
Marleine Luberiss wakes up at a quarter to 5 and drives thirty minutes everyday to get to work on time and sometimes arrives early to serve the students early. “I like to make coffee for the students, and I try to come early everyday so I can serve them early and make them happy. I know when they have coffee in the morning that helps them a lot.” Being a mother and wife has helped her become the woman she is when it comes to work, it has made her believe that she is here to serve Luberiss said.
She takes her job seriously and can’t imagine being anywhere else besides LIU. “Marleine keeps you on track during the rush she makes life easier and always makes sure everything is in stock and running smoothly,” Co-Worker Sasha Patterson said.
One thing Luberiss may not know is that her smile is contagious and can be the difference in a student having a much better day than they were having before seeing her. Sophomore political science major, Samantha Dunn loves coffee and goes to Starbucks at least 6 days out of the week. Dunn sees Luberiss almost every morning and has never had a bad drink. “Going to Starbucks starts my day off good and gets me ready for class. Marleine always has a huge smile on her face which always puts me in a good mood, and then going to class doesn’t seem so bad,” Dunn said. “It’s also amazing how out of all of the drinks I have ordered throughout my years here, they have always been made to perfection thanks to Marliene,” she added.
“I enjoy to work here,” Luberiss said. She has been serving the community of LIU for seventeen years now, and has every intention on staying and continuing doing what she loves.

Being a student and having a business is an impressive thing to do. Victoria Boccella is a senior public relations major. She and her sister own their own hair and make up business called, Boccella Beauty. The business was started a little over a year ago and they have seen much growth in the past 16 months. Their company is focused on being mobile since they don’t have a store which can be a big advantage, “It really sets us apart from others in the industry”, says Boccella. Although it might sound like a lot to handle, going to school and running a business, Boccella says it is a lot easier when you are your own boss. If she is not available to do someone’s hair and make up she can pass it over to her sister to do, “Although I never want to say no to a potential client, one of the perks of owning your own business is that you have the liberty to do that and make your own schedule”, Boccella added. Boccella ultimately gets to choose when she works and still is able to keep up her schoolwork.
Boccella’s aunt is a celebrity makeup artist. She has worked with celebrities such as Adam Sandler, Alec Baldwin, Kate Moss, and Brooklyn Decker. Her aunt was nice enough to take her and her sister along on her gigs and that is how Boccella realized she would love to start her own business, “Making people feel beautiful is a pretty cool thing!” said Boccella. Although she is currently doing something she loves she would like to pursue a career in public relations. “It is a great gig to be able to do on the side. Ideally, I would like to get a full time job in my major but I know I always have hair and makeup to fall back on,” Boccella said. Follow her business on Instagram to see the work that they do @boccellabeauty.

With the hustle and bustle of school life, deadlines and athletic commitments, students may often forget that there are many things within a short distance from campus to do for fun.
Broadway Mall in Hicksville is six miles from campus and only 15 minutes away via the Pioneer Wagon. The shuttle has hourly services free of charge. “I practically live there for the food, shopping and [the] movie theater,” Tiffany Reyes, a senior criminal justice major, said. The Broadway Multiplex Cinemas is located inside the Broadway Mall and features cushioned reclining chairs and shows the latest movies. Students can spend a few hours immersed in a film and briefly find relief from their academic responsibilities. The mall is open from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday.
AMF Syosset Lanes is a bowling alley six miles from campus. Students were enticed by the deals the business offers on Tuesday nights.
“We go every Tuesday night because of $2 beer and $3 games. It’s something fun to do at the beginning of the week,” Reyes said. A Tuesday night at AMF Syosset Lanes includes a game and shoe rental for $6, and they are open from 4p.m.to 1a.m.
“It’s something to do that’s not on the weekend if you just need a break from campus,” Elin Kvarnemar, senior international business major, said. AMF Syosset lanes also has “College Night” on Wednesdays. Students may bring their university ID and enjoy unlimited bowling for $11 from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.
For those over 21, there are a number of local bars that students frequent. Rockville Center is home to a number of bars including Cannon’s Blackthorn Restaurant, Parlay Gastropub and Kasey’s Kitchen and Cocktails. “We’re a small campus with not a lot to do on the weekends,” Reyes said. “Something we like is the ‘bar scene’ and the bar strips where we can go and have fun with each other.” Rockville Center is an easy place to meet new people. There are options that are a little more relaxed than the “bar scene.” Book Revue an independent bookstore in Huntington, is a 20-minute drive east down 25A. This discrete shop is filled with thousands of old and new books, and it has some of the most accredited novels in history on sale such as “Catch 22” by Joseph Heller and the latest Stephen King novel, “Sleeping Beauties.”
“You can enter the bookstore not looking for anything in particular and within five minutes you’ll have settled in a chair and be a chapter deep in the latest book,” Kvarnemar said. The numerous bookshelves are accompanied by seating areas and a cafe that encourage customers to find a book and stay awhile. The store is open from 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday to Thursday, from 9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m Friday to Saturday, and from 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday.
Whether it be diving into a new novel, watching the latest blockbuster, or taking up bowling as a new skill; there is different off-campus activities that any and every student can enjoy.

What started as a honors thesis project will continue as a live performance. During the fall 2017 semester, Veronica Nguyen, a senior vocal performance major, showcased part of her Vietnamese culture to members of the department of music. She sang traditional Vietnamese songs and taught her audience history behind the country’s music and culture. Nguyen performed on Nov. 21, 2017 in the Great Hall for 36 attendees. After Nguyen’s performance, Dr. Jennifer Miceli, chair of the department of music, asked Nguyen to perform again for a larger audience.
Nguyen used her thesis project as an opportunity to explore a side of her heritage that she knew little about; she is half Vietnamese and half Caucasian. Although her father and his family are Vietnamese, she decided on her own to learn the language and the music. “Originally, I just wanted to write about the music, learn it and perform it, but during my research I realized that there were only a handful of books in our own library here at Post about Vietnam that wasn’t focused on the Vietnam war,” Nguyen said.
Despite the lack of resources on campus, Nguyen continued to conduct research online, working with music professor Stephanie Watt. Realizing that the lack of resources in the library could be linked to the lack of knowledge on Vietnam by Americans, Nguyen decided to pursue a new goal. “[I want to] open up American minds to Vietnamese people and their culture so that Americans could know Vietnam beyond the scope of the Vietnam War,” she said.
Nguyen believes she has accomplished that goal. “I thought I should go [to the performance] being that I’ve never learned about Vietnam outside of the war, and I completely loved it,” Joseph Quin, a junior English major, said. He attended Nguyen’s fall performance. “She has such a pure and beautiful voice that made you want to listen, and overall it was just a peaceful lecture, it really made me wish I could visit Vietnam one day,” Quin said.
“I think that my message got across, and people walked away with a new understanding of Vietnam, after my fall thesis performance.” Nguyen said. Nguyen has already started to apply for graduate school for vocal performance, and has auditions lined up during the month of February. She is looking to continue on the performance track and hopes to one day have a career as an opera singer.
Nguyen will perform in the Hillwood Recital hall on Monday, Feb. 12 at 12:30 p.m. Admission is free and all students are welcome to attend. Students in the honors college can earn one merit credit by attending.

On Nov. 22, 2010, Nicki Minaj debuted her first studio album worldwide. In December of 2010, she appeared on “The Come Up Dvd,” a platform built to bring awareness to new and upcoming rappers. Minaj had already started selling her mixtapes out of the trunk of her car in Queens, N.Y. and Atlanta, Ga., so by the time Lil Wayne reached out to sign her, she was widely-known on the hip hop scene in New York and Atlanta. Minaj signed with Cash Money Records in 2009.
Minaj went on to collaborate with artists from all genres, performing at award shows and helping songs reach the top of billboard charts. She quickly made a name for herself within the music industry where female rappers were previously scarce. The absence of females in hip hop was normal before Minaj debuted her first studio album to mainstream music. “I remember hearing Itty Bitty Piggy for the first time and right there I knew female rap was going to make a necessary comeback, and it was going to be great,” Jola Oke, a senior biology major said.
With new success comes new enemies. Minaj experienced conflicts with other artists such as Lil Kim. “I believe people love to watch females fight, even if there isn’t a clear reason for them to be fighting. Entertainment, that’s what it is,” Taylor Hill, a senior broadcasting major said. “And it completely sucks because there’s a whole bunch of men getting along and making music, why can’t the girls do the same without pressure to fight with each other?”
Minaj’s fame spread worldwide after several successful album releases and television appearances. “The PinkPrint,” Minaj’s third studio album, was released in 2014 and contained songs that were vulnerable, open and darker than what fans would expect from the artist. “‘Four Door Aventador’ is one of my favorite songs on the album, it gives me Biggie vibes and reminds me of why I love Nicki Minaj,” Jazsmine Kerr, a senior musical theater major said, comparing Minaj to the rapper Notorious B.I.G.
Minaj’s fourth studio album is highly anticipated, and has been on the radar since 2015. It is scheduled to be released before the end of 2018. Minaj is more than an ordinary female rapper or artist; she is a businesswoman who knows her worth. “This album is going to be it. Just watch, she’s going to remind all the people who doubted her, exactly why she is Nicki Minaj and the queen that she is,” Hill said.

The women’s basketball team improved its season record to 10-1 in conference play and 15-6 overall on the season after a 78-51 win on Jan. 31 in Bridgeport.
The Pioneers did not give up the lead during the entire game and forced 28 total turnovers, giving the team an edge with 30 points off mistakes. Five players scored 10 or more points, including 14 points from sophomore sports broadcasting major Mikaiya Moore, 14 points and 10 rebounds from senior political science major Sasha Patterson, as well as double-digit outings from sophomore health science major Asia Turner (13), junior computer science major Shannon Doyle (11), and 5th-year broadcasting major Kylie Garrett (10). Patterson recorded her eighth double-double of the season.
The Pioneers’ 27-point margin of victory was their largest of the season. The matchup with the Purple Knights marked the end of a three-game road trip for the team, as they will play their next two games against Mercy College and Molloy College at home.
“It was one of our best victories of the season,” said sophomore sports broadcasting major Mikaiya Moore, whose 14 points and 10 rebounds helped fuel the Pioneers’ win. “All of us were in sync and scored a lot of points… we all had fun out there.”

Head men’s soccer coach Andreas Lindberg left LIU Post after the 2017 season for a new position at Seton Hall University, a Division I school. Michael Mordocco, the coach of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s men’s soccer team will replace Lindberg, who was head coach for the Pioneers for seven years. Mordocco will begin coaching Feb. 19. 
“I think Mike is a great hire with a lot of enthusiasm and experience,” Lindberg said about his successor. “I hope that the Pioneers can continue to be a national championship contender under his guidance.”
Mordocco has coached many men’s soccer teams, including SUNY Oneonta for four years from 2003-2007 and Stony Brook University for four years, where his team won the America East Champions in 2009. After Stony Brook, he coached at the University of Connecticut for three years, where he earned his bachelors degree in Economics. At UConn, his team made it to the NCAA Elite 8 three straight years. Mordocco will leave the University of Massachusetts, Amherst on Feb. 16 after three years as associate head coach.
Mordocco’s 2017 season at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, a Division 1 team in the Atlantic 10 conference, was nothing to be swept under the rug. The team had a record of 15-4-3, which put them in first place overall.
Although the players are going to miss Lindberg, they have high hopes for their new head coach. “Of course everyone is gutted that Lindberg has left because a lot of memories and history was made with him,” Charlie Ledula, a junior mid field psychology major, said. “But moving forward, it’s pretty exciting because it’s a new challenge not only for us but the new coach. It’s going to take some time to adhere to his philosophy, but it’s definitely something the team and I are looking forward to!”
Mordocco is looking forward to his new position. “ I’m really excited to be part of the program and looking forward to working with the guys, meeting people on campus, the faculty and to getting there,” he said. Mordocco plans to recruit eight more players for next season and to maintain the success that the soccer team has had.

At a home game on Saturday, Feb. 3, the women’s basketball team had a landslide victory against Mercy College, with a final score of 78-40.
The Pioneers started the game strong from the opening tip, with a strong offense, putting up eight points and limiting Mercy College to zero points until the halfway mark of the first quarter. With two seconds left in the first quarter, senior guard, broadcasting major and journalism minor, Kylie Garret added three points to the score, ending the first quarter with the Pioneers ahead of Mercy College, 21-8. In the first half of the game, the Pioneers racked up 39 points, with 21 of those points coming off of turnovers from their exceptional defense.
The second half of the game was no different for the Pioneers as they totaled another 39 points, nine of them from Shannon Doyle, a junior guard, computer science major, giving her a total of 15 points in the game. The defense too was in favor of the Pioneers, limiting Mercy College to 21 points again in the second half, due to Doyle’s two steals, and a pair of blocked shots coming from sophomore forward, broadcasting major, Mikaiya Moore, and sophomore guard, health science major, Dominique Williams.
The Pioneers will play their next game at home against Molloy College on Wednesday, Feb. 7 at 5:00 p.m.

Women’s swim team member Laura Bendfeldt, a senior international business major, is a two time All-American and four time scholar All-American, who is ranked 11th in the 100 backstroke prior to the Division 2 NCAA Championships in March 2018 in North Carolina. It will be the fourth year Bendfeldt will attend the event. 
Bendfeldt accumulated her seventh, eighth and ninth wins of 2018 in a tri-meet against Kutztown and Millersville on Jan. 27. That meet also saw her undefeated during the dual meet season in the 50 yard freestyle. Along with being an outstanding athlete, Bendfeldt also swims past the competition in the classroom. Reaching the end of her bachelor’s degree in international business, Bendfeldt holds a cumulative GPA of 3.97.
“Swimming is basically a full time job; you have to have enough rest, food, time to stretch; it’s more than the 20 hours in the pool,” she said. “Sometimes the academic community is less understanding of that; that’s when you have to rely on your coach to help you out.” Head swim coach Kristen Foley commends Bendfeldt for her work ethic both in and out of the pool.
Bendfeldt spoke humbly of her successes during the four years she has been on the swim team at Post. “You can’t achieve anything without a team behind you, supporting you,” she said. “Everything I have achieved so far has to be due to my teammates and friends, and for that I will always be grateful to them,” she added.
Bendfeldt has high hopes for the end of her swim career at Post. “My goal is to come in top five at nationals in either or both the 100 yard and 50 yard freestyle,” she said. But, she added that every athlete faces adversity, and not everything goes swimmingly. “Even though there have been setbacks and I don’t regret going here. I’ve met people who are going to be really hard to say goodbye to,” Bendfeldt said. Upon graduation, the German native intends to take on the business world. “I want to continue working abroad, and hopefully use my business degree to work for a non-profit organization,” she said. “I want to leave the world better than it was when I came into it, that is my goal.”
[Editor’s Note: The author of this article is a teammate of Bendfeldt’s on the swim team.]

The game opened with a missed jump shot by Mercy College followed by a rebound from senior guard Aary Bibens, an international business major, that led to a 3-0 lead for the Pioneers from a three point shot from Bibens. The Pioneers were able to hold a 14-0 score against Mercy College for just over three minutes, converting seven of their first 12 shots. Ten minutes into the first half, the Pioneers were ahead of Mercy College, 23-7, which continued as they held the lead at a score of 48-26 after the first half.

Bowling team member Patricia Kelly, a freshman business major, earned a spot on the All-Tournament team during the Red Flash Invitational, a tournament at Saint Francis University in Loretto, PA on Jan. 28.
Coming in to the last day of the Red Flash Invitational, the Pioneers were in 11th place of 17th and remained in that spot after the weekend ended, but the matches were suspense filled.
The Pioneers were swept in four games by Mount Aloysius College, Cresson, PA, but in their next match, the Pioneers rolled a strike against St Peter’s University, Jersey City, NJ, with a sweep. Kelly helped her team with a strike percentage of 47 percent, averaging just over 200 points a game. Commenting on her success, Kelly said, “I always hope and expect to do my best, and it’s nice when all my hard work pays off; but, I’m more proud of how my team did.”
The bowling team will participate in the Gold Bear Classic at Kutztown University in Kutztown, PA from Feb. 9-11.
