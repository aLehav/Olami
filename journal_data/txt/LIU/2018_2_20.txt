Nuvaera Mumnoon, a freshman, biomedical science major with business minor and Humdia Barakzai have recently been approved by SGA in the formation of the Middle Eastern Student Association. The first meeting took place on Feb. 20th during common hour.
The goal of the club which currently has 23 members is, according to Mumnoon, to “learn about different heritages and cultures and to put the Middle Eastern culture out there.” Nuvaera Mumnoon, who is Pakistani, feels that there’s not a Middle Eastern presence and that her efforts are intended to be a balance to the Greek life on campus.
Although Nuvaera is a freshman, she’s not inexperienced in club formation. “When I was in high school, I started a bunch of clubs like Middle Eastern Ethnic Awareness, but this is college so it’s a bit different because we have a wide range of people of different ages, different mind-sets,” Mumnoon said.
Nuvaera Mumnoon already has plans for what her club plans to do. “We’re gonna have a bunch of bake sales, we might have henna nights, as well as a ball gown,” said Mumnoon. In addition, Nuvaera wants to address the problems that Muslim women who wear the hijab might face. “Then we have some Indian holidays like Divali, as well as a Palestinian night,” Mumnoon said.
Regarding food, the club will primarily rely on catering. “We’re gonna have Afghan food, Indian food, Pakistani food, Egyptian food, a lot of different food, so we’ll try to cater so we don’t have to do it all ourselves and also we have health cautions we have to be aware of,” said Mumnoon.
As for meeting plans, the club has not settled on a date. “So as of now the first meeting will be Tuesday. After that we might just do a biweekly meeting or even more,” Mumnoon said.
Nuvaera Mumnoon is confident that her leadership experience in high school will help her at college, but she will face challenges. “One of the biggest challenges is because I’m only a freshman and I do know a wide range of people, the toughest [challenge] is that we have a lot of seniors here and I’m in competition with them. I feel competition between us when there really isn’t. They’re just intimidating, I guess” Mumnoon said.

Since we are a technology based society, it’s fair to say that we’ve all come across at least one advertisement on a website ashing that “THIS FOOD WILL KILL YOU” or claiming they know a “Secret way to lose half your body weight in one week.” There’s always so much being thrown at us from so many places and oftentimes we don’t know what to believe. Because of this, I decided to do some research and compile a list of facts that can be useful to know for life long health. The following points have been studied by world famous institutions like the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Huffington Post, and independent health advancement research facilities.
Studies have shown that eating every 2-3 hours actually does NOT speed up metabolic rate. It was originally thought that by having small, frequent meals throughout the day, that we’d keep our metabolisms at a constant level. While this isn’t completely incorrect, it’s been proven that simply eating when you actually feel hungry is the best way to treat your body.
Next, a good thing to know is that “Gluten free,” “Vegan,” and “Organic” DO NOT mean “healthy.” It’s a common misconception that these terms mean the product is good for you and that you can indulge with no limits. The truth is that often things labeled “Gluten free” are high in sodium, sugar and fat to enhance flavor. Similarly, since vegan products don’t use butter or dairy, many on-the-shelf items have palm oil as the first or second ingredient. Palm oil is extremely high in unhealthy saturated fats and will slow digestion faster than you can say “oops.” Lastly, “Organic” simply means that the product was made without the use of pesticides or herbicides, it doesn’t vouch that the product is at all healthy.
 
The third thing I found is that although adding dried fruit to trail mix is convenient, it decreases the healthiness of the snack drastically. Dried fruit actually has 30%-80% less antioxidants than fresh fruit and often contains added sugars to enhance taste. The process of applying high heat and pressure to dehydrate fruit strips not only flavors, but also beneficial properties and nutrients.
With so much fake news, ashy advertisements, and rouge information being thrown at us, it’s important to not give up hope of figuring out what is healthy and what isn’t. The key is to be educated consumers so we can make the best decisions for ourselves and our lives.

Being secure with yourself and loving everything about you is such an important thing to do. Knowing your self worth and understanding that you are capable of almost anything is what you need to remind yourself everyday. 
Feeling insecure about yourself can really hold you back from all you can achieve in life. Although it can be hard, you need to gain the confidence that you can do whatever it is that you don’t believe you can. Whether it is going out of your comfort zone, to wearing an outfit you’ve always wanted to wear or even being able to talk to someone you have been too nervous to before. No matter where you are in your life, there is always time to work on yourself to become the best version of yourself possible. It takes time and dedication but the outcome is worth the happier life.
Visualize yourself doing what you are scared to do. If it makes you feel happy and you feel like yourself, then go out and make that a reality. Constantly tell yourself everyday that you are worthy, you are perfect, and you are capable of anything. Giving yourself affirmation is a way to build your self-confidence; if you say it enough you will soon believe it. Treating yourself well is another way to build up your self-love. Eating healthy foods, exercising, and creating a positive mind can allow your mind to grow and become a happier version of yourself. Doing what makes you happy is the most important thing, never settle for less. You can have the self-love and confidence to go out and make it happen for yourself.

Currently happening in Pyeongchang, South Korea is the 2018 Winter Olympics. The games are going as most Winter Olympics go, except for one unusual guest, a delegation from North Korea headed by none other than Kim Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo-Jong. But, what does this unlikely presence mean?
North and South Korea have long been fighting and have seen each other as enemies over the past several decades. In recent events, North Korea appeared to be building up its nuclear arsenal showing no signs of potential collaboration with the south. Suddenly, North and South Korea are working together at the Olympics, with North Korea sending Kim Yo-Jong. Yo-Jong’s presence at the Olympics was an unusual sight, as no member of the Kim family had been to their southern counterpart since the Korean War. Many saw this as a signal that North Korea is ready to move on.
But not everyone is pleased with North Korea’s display. Many see North Korea’s goal of unification as a threat; after all they want unification on their terms, not South Korea’s. North Korea has seen unification as the final victory in the Korean War which is still technically going on, as in 1953 it only ended in an armistice. This new role North Korea has is trying to bring more support to there side as they have been primarily viewed in a negative light. For example, hailed by some as an impressive display from the North Korean cheerleaders, many were quick to point out that it is likely they were forced to do this and that it was all staged to be appealing.
After asking several students what they thought about North Korea’s role in the Olympics, many did not know that North Korea was playing a part or indicated that they did not watch the Olympics. If so, then what makes this so significant?
It is impossible to discuss North Korea without mentioning the human rights abuses they have committed such as causing famines and forcing labor, which are only a few of the things this regime has done, much of which is mostly unknown due to the secretive nature of the state. With North Korea building up a nuclear arsenal and trying for reunification, it begs the question, “how much of a threat is North Korea to us?”

How often do people get to see what others dream when they are asleep? From Feb. 13-17, Madelynn Ehmer and Ruth Mistretta showcased a unique perspective of their own dreams in the Student Art League Gallery in the library. Some dreams they illustrated were ones they believed to be attainable, according to both artists, and some works were the projection of pure imagination. “The exhibition is really about just embracing your dreams and allowing them to influence and motivate you throughout life,” Mistretta, a sophomore art therapy major, said. Alongside photographs and illustrations, the exhibition featured a diorama of fairy village.
“The sonogram piece was one that showcased someone dreaming of family while other pieces were more imaginative and can’t necessarily be seen in every day,” Ehmer, a sophomore art education major, said, “But through our show, [they] were able to be seen, such as the fairy village.”
Reading books and creating images in a person’s head is not as difficult as viewing an image and trying to decipher what it means, according to Thembi Lawrence, junior fine arts major. “I’ve never been one to just pick up and understand what art is and what the art I’m looking at is portraying,” she said. “But with this gallery, I can say that I not only enjoyed the photos, but I understood what was going on, or at least I believe I do.”
Ehmer wanted viewers to feel as though they could enter her pictures. “While looking at the photos of my little cousin, I wanted the viewers to be able to enter the mindset of a child’s imagination as they are playing.” Art doesn’t just come together overnight, the process for both Ehmer and Mistretta was long and sometimes exhausting, “It was a long process getting all the pieces done, there are times both of us would start working, and it would take hours longer than we thought,” Ehmer said. Mistretta and Ehmer spent hours working on the art together, some days longer than they expected and wanted, but overall they are grateful for the experience and outcome.
“I have a very wild and vivid imagination which inspires most of my pieces and use of bright colors. I also just have really big dreams which inspired my pastel piece of the northern lights,” Mistretta said.

Emmy award-winning writer and actress for the Netflix series “Masters of None,” Lena Waithe, wrote the script to a brand new series on Showtime called “The Chi.” The show tells the story
of separate families living on the south side of Chicago that become connected by coincidence. They bond through the need for connection and redemption. The plot focuses on a group of working class African-Americans on Chicago’s volatile streets, and it reminds audiences that no matter what, the human spirit is strong, and hope never dies. It also gives viewers insight to the perspective of being in the wrong place at the wrong time having life-or-death consequences. 
Jason Mitchell, known for his role “Eazy- E” in the Oscar-nominated lm “Straight Outta Compton,” plays the older brother of “Coogie” (Jahking Guillory), who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Now, Mitchell is on the hunt to find out who is at fault. From the very beginning of the show, action is packed, leaving audiences at the end of their seats to discover what happens next.
Kevin Williams, portrayed by Oscar-nominated actor Alex R. Herbert, plays a young student who knows how the streets work, but witnesses what happens to Coogie and now fears for his own life.
The Chi is interesting and well-written, and each episode will keep viewers in suspense to find out each of the characters’ fate. So far, the show is promising. It has gotten a lot of feedback because of “unnecessary cursing” by the cast, including the younger actors, but given that the show is in its first season, there is much more to find out.

Just a few weeks into the new semester, MFA theater students are preparing for a mainstage production with the Post Theater Company (PTC). The department usually hires outside directors for mainstage shows, but this year will be the first time master’s students direct the undergraduate students in the program. “It’s a bit [of an] experiment for the department,” Kayleigh Jacobs, second year MFA student and director of “In the Wake,” said. “They’re trusting us with their kids, which is a big deal, so that’s why I’m a little frantic and want it to go very well.”
Three different plays, “In the Wake,” “Glengarry Glen Ross,” and “Dead Man’s Cell Phone,” will be directed by Kayleigh Jacobs, Brady C. Ness and Chamila Priyanka respectively. The shows will run in repertory form starting March 23-25 to March 29-31. “We have three plays that are going up at the same time which is a little [crazy] and chaotic,” Jacobs said, “We’ve got three rehearsal rooms and three full casts.”
Jacobs is both nervous and excited about directing her first play in spring 2018. She came across the play by accident and immediately felt a personal connection to its message. “We were told to pick something we are passionate about, and I really feel like I connected with this play a lot,” she sad.
“In the Wake,” written by Lisa Krone, is set in the year 2000. Jacobs chose the script because she recognized parallels between events that happened in that time period and events that are happening now. The play highlights topics including 9/11, LGBT issues and politics concerning the presidential election of George W. Bush. “My plan is to keep it classic,” Jacobs said. “I think the message of the play, politically and personally, is super important.”
The show is about protagonist Ellen, portrayed by sophomore musical theatre major, Sarah Franklin, wanting the world to change for the better, but she is not willing to change it herself. “She’s not willing to change herself or the way that she lives in order to help make the world a better place, and I think a lot of people can relate to that,” Jacobs said.
Ellen continually experiences ashbacks throughout the play. “She’s realizing that it’s not one decision that you make, that it’s a bunch of different decisions that lead you to where you are,” Franklin said.
The cast spent the first few rehearsals getting to know each other better. “A lot of what makes this play so special is that it really attacks [the] idea of family,” Isabelle Rutens, junior musical theatre major, said. “It’s a really loving environment. The whole cast just clicks; it’s like we already have that family energy.” Rutens plays the character Laurie, a chef married to a woman named Kayla, portrayed by Laura Gilchrist, sophomore musical theatre major. “I’m really excited to do nothing but eat, sleep and breathe this crazy, complicated production,” Rutens said.
“I feel like this is a very important show,” Gilchrist said. “[With] the politics that are being brought up, it’s a handful for people to take in.” She is in the process of researching matters her character addresses in the script in order to deliver an honest performance. Gilchrist is excited to be performing for the first time in a PTC mainstage production.
“I hope I can communicate to my actors, who are all much younger than me, how important it is to recognize what you need to change in order to change the world,” Gilchrist said. “We have to sacrifice a lot in ourselves to make the world better.”
“In the Wake” will be performed at the Little Theatre on March 23 and 29 at 7:30 p.m. and March 25 at 3 p.m. Tickets are available online at www.tix55.com/ptc700. Prices are $15 for general admission, $12 for seniors and $10 for students.

On Friday, Feb. 16, the women’s swim team traveled to Piscataway, N.J. for the Metropolitan Collegiate Championships, a three-day event held at Rutgers University, N.J. where the best division I, II and II swim teams compete for the conference title.
The Pioneers have had a season to remember, with a record of 7-1, improving from last year’s record of 3-4. “I think that the freshmen have impacted us because we are now a team of 19 and last year as 11 people it was hard to compete with teams of 20,” team member Jessica Argelander, a sophomore childhood education major, said. “Having more people, we have a more variety of people to swim different events and we have more people entered in every event.”
Elizabeth Law, a sophomore physics and math major, agreed about the positive contribution the new members of the team have made. “We have more depth in events. So we have the ability to have multiple girls swim every event, rather than last year when we only had 11 girls,” she said.
This year’s Metropolitan Collegiate Championship marked the last for senior, international business major, Laura Bendfeldt, who has been a mentor to the team. Alexandria Cordova, freshman public relations major hasn’t had the best of luck in her first year in green and gold. At the Eastern College Athletic Conference, (ECAC), Cordova was competing in her first event of the day when she had a back spasm in the middle of her race. After getting an MRI, Cordova was told that she had two herniated disks and a degenerated disk in her lower back. Luckily, through some cortisone shorts in her L4 and L5 vertebrae, she did not have to undergo surgery. Cordova however attributes a lot of her recovery to Bendfeldt, “The two who have helped me the most are Karis Fuller and Bendfeldt. I cannot imagine where I would be this season if it wasn’t for them. They always say that it’s better to be hurt now but be able to compete in my next three years here at Post,” Cordova said. Since coming back from her injury, Cordova had to change her style of swimming. Originally, she swam butterfly, but since January, she has been training in breaststroke and backstroke.
This is the first time some of the teammates competed in the Metropolitan Conference Championships with seniors. “It feels weird this could be the last time swimming with the seniors because last year we didn’t have any so the same team came back,” Argelander said.
Bendfeldt was excited for the Metropolitan Conference Championship. “It’s really great to see the results of everyone’s hard work throughout the year, especially for the freshmen who haven’t experienced the special feeling of the Metropolitan Conference Championship. I’m going to enjoy every race I have in that pool. It’s one of the last ones I have and I hope to make the best out of everything,” she said.
The first meet for the Pioneers began on Friday, Feb. 16 and it was a good one. Their first event was the 200 yard medley relay; with the combined effort of junior sociology major, journalism and political science minor, Karis Fuller, Argelander, sophomore business major Tove Sparrman and junior, chemistry major, Caitlin Johnstone.
The Pioneers took first place again in the 200-yard individual medley coming from Fuller’s effort.
Another win for the Pioneers came from Bendfeldt in event seven, the 50-yard freestyle.
After the first day of the three-day event, the Pioneers were in 1st place with a score of 362, with Rowan College in 2nd place with a score of 341 and The College of New Jersey in 3rd with a score of 320.
Day two started off strong for the Pioneers with a win in the 200- yard relay medley with Fuller, Bendfeldt, Sparrman and junior chemistry major, Caitlin Johnstone. However, in event 17, Rowan University was able to close in on the void by taking 2nd place just behind Montclair State University, N.J. Eventually, in event 15 of session 11, Rowan University took the lead by coming in 4th in the 400-yard individual medley, while the Pioneers took ninth place. With that win, Rowan University jumped into 1st place with a score of 841 and the Pioneers in 2nd with a score of 784.5.
As the end of the final session approached, Rowan University was holding on to their 1st place lead with a score of 1264 with the Pioneers still in 2nd with a score of 1085.5.
After the final race, with a 1st place win by the Pioneers in the 400-yard freestyle relay; it unfortunately wasn’t enough to take 1st place overall in the MCC. When the scores came in, Rowan University had taken 1st place overall with a score of 1320, the Pioneers in 2nd with a score of 1149.5 and in 3rd, The College of New Jersey with a score of 909.
While Rowan University won the event, they’re a division III team, while the Pioneers are division II making the swim team division II champions.
Bendfeldt commented on her team’s success through the weekend, “ I’m super proud of everyone here and how they fought for every possible point we could get.”

On Saturday, Feb. 17, the women’s basketball team went up against St. Thomas Aquinas College, holding onto a five game winning streak before the game and a first place spot in the East Coast Conference.
St. Thomas started the game hot, taking an 8-3 lead with under four and a half minutes into the game. However, after strong offense coming from senior forward, political science major, Sasha Patterson, the Pioneers were able to bring the game back together. Sophomore forward, broadcasting major, Mikaiya Moore was getting it done from inside the paint too, by converting on a layup and a close jump shot. Junior guard, computer science major, Shannon Doyle added to the first half score with a total of nine points and one assist. Senior broadcasting major and journalism minor, Kylie Garrett tacked on another nine points in just eight minutes.
The second half was even better than the first for the Pioneers. They recorded eight points in less than three and a half minutes. However, with one minute left in the second half, St. Thomas was able to cut the Pioneers’ lead down to six points, but fortunately for the Pioneers, it wasn’t enough. The game ended with a score of 77-66. With that win, the Pioneers are now ranked first overall in the ECC. The team holds onto an undefeated record of 9-0 within the conference.
The next game for the Pioneers will be against Daemen College at home on Friday, Feb. 23 at 5 p.m. for Senior Day, Honoring Garrett, Naya Williams and Patterson. This game will also be their second to last game of the season. The Pioneers’ final game will be at home against Roberts Wesleyan College on Sunday, Feb. 25 at 1:30 p.m.

After a storming performance with 19 points against Queens College on Feb. 10, Women’s Basketball Captain Sasha Patterson, a senior political science major, is the athlete of the week. 
Patterson knew she had a responsibility to perform for the team in the game against Queens College. “We needed a push, so being the person that gave that push was really amazing,” Patterson said, adding “everyone was counting on me, and I didn’t let them down”.
Although she is not a superstitious athlete, Patterson knows from her first touch of the ball that she’s on form. “Usually as soon as I tip off, and it’s a good tip, I’m ready,” Patterson said.
In terms of facing adversity, Patterson acknowledges that she is her own worst enemy. “At times, I beat myself up; I am my biggest critic,” Patterson said. Above all she says her teammates are the thing that drive her to do her best. “If I’m tired, they make me want to do another transition, that makes me want to score, that makes me want to be there to let them know I have got their backs,” she said. “They push me to want to do better, when I see them cheering and telling me ‘we need you’, that makes me want to do better.”
Women’s Basketball Head Coach Deirdre Moore attributes the hard work of Patterson and her teammates during the off season to their success this season. “She [Sasha] put in work during the off season and is seeing that pay off for her,” Moore said. “Her production is the direct result of team play,” she added.
What does the rest of the season have left for Patterson? She and her team look to close out the regular season in style. “We definitely have a space in playoffs; we are just trying to finish out strong,” Patterson said. Patterson has personal goals as well. “My personal goal is to reach my 1000 points and 1000 rebounds,” Patterson said. “I only need around 260 more rebounds and about 80 more points.” She has another year of eligibility to exceed these goals, before she goes on to her academic goal of attending law school. “I’ve wanted to be a criminal lawyer since I was six years old,” Patterson said, but she has not ruled out playing basketball after college. “I really don’t know, my friends and family members want me to, but it’s an ‘up in the air’ question for me!”

The women’s bowling team came in fourth place out of six teams at the Metro Classic at Babylon’s AMF Lanes on Saturday, Feb. 17.
Junior biology major, Sarah Busse, led the Pioneers with a 182.8 average game, including a team-high 203 score. Freshman nursing major, Emily Cavanaugh, who was named ECC co-rookie bowler of the week, added a six-game series of 953 for a 158.8 average, while freshman business administration major, Patricia Kelly, added a total score of 939 for a 156.5 average.
After a second place finish on Jan. 21 at the Westchester Community College Invitational, the Pioneers lost their touch. They finished eleventh of 17 at the Red Flash Invitational on Jan. 26 and twelfth of 16 at the Golden Bear Classic on Feb. 11 before their most recent outing at the Metro Classic.
“Being down these past couple weeks has definitely been hard but we are going to just use that as fuel to dominate the next tournament,” Kelly said before the Metro Classic. “We are planning on coming back strong and we’re gonna do that by just staying locked in the whole day and picking up the spares.”
The Pioneers return to action on Saturday, Feb. 24 and will look to bounce back at the Molloy Invitational at AMF Lanes in Mineola.

The men’s basketball team remains in fourth place in the East Coast Conference after losing a close game on their home floor to the Saint Thomas Aquinas Spartans on Feb. 17. The Pioneers came out strong in the first half, jumping to a quick lead due to awless shooting from behind the arc. The Spartans, who trailed by five in the first four minutes of the game, were quick to answer back towards the end of the first half, gaining a lead and making the score 43-26 at the half.
Leading the Pioneers was sophomore Jared Rivers, who scored just under his average of 18. He had 17 points, shooting three of five from three-point range. Right behind rivers were seniors Aary Bibens and Kyle McLeggan.
McLeggan had 12 points in 30 minutes while Bibens had 11 and shot a stunning 50 percent from the field. The Pioneers, who struggled scoring inside, only scored 12 points in the paint all night, while the Spartans scored almost half of their points in paint, 36.
Within the first six minutes of the second half, the Pioneers went on a 10-0 run, bringing them within seven points making the score 49-42. The Spartans fought to keep the lead, and the Pioneers’ attempt to rally again fell short. According to McLeggan, the team struggled offensively. “We struggled hitting shots as a team. We rely heavily on our ability to get stops on defense, but if we don’t score, it makes everything harder for us,” McLeggan said.
Statistically the game was close, but in the end LIU couldn’t keep up with STAC. The Pioneers made a couple of big runs in the second half that kept them in a close game, but that first half deficit was something they couldn’t come back from.
The men’s basketball team returns to the Pratt Recreation Center for a matchup with Daemen College on Friday, Feb. 23. Tip-off will follow a ceremony honoring the three senior Pioneers, Kyle McLeggan majoring in economics, Aary Bibens majoring in business management and Hunter Powell majoring in criminal justice.
