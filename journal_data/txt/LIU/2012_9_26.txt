Resident students moving back into Brookville Hall and the South Residence Complex at the beginning of the school year may have noticed several parking spots behind the Blue/Yellow Suites were missing due to a construction site. William Kirker, Director of the Facilities Department, explained that a hole was dug in mid-August “to find and fix an underground hot water leak.” Hot water is used to heat the buildings on campus. Facilities wanted the leak to be fixed before the fall semester began, but testing revealed a second leak and another hole was dug for it to be repaired. A tree from the Brookville parking lot was also re¬moved because the roots were growing into the pipes, which compromised the integrity of the school’s pipelines.
Students that live in residence halls know how hard it is to get a parking spot in the Brookville and the SRC parking lots since they are the most sought after. Most of the students that park there are those who live in Post Hall, Riggs Hall, SRC, and Brookville Hall. “It’s definitely caused an inconvenience,” said Information Systems graduate student Matt Aronberg. “No one likes to park far from where they live, but it’s better than not being able to take a hot shower or brush my teeth because of a broken pipe.” 
Other students such as senior Psychology major Alyssa Apgar worry about the size of the holes and the safety risks regarding them. “I’m glad they have fences up, but what if it rains hard one day and the road just collapses?” Kirker assured the Pioneer that all safety precautions for students and vehicles have been taken. 
No other repairs have been scheduled, but leaks do occur from time to time due to the school’s underground infrastructure. Kirker expects the existing holes to be filled in by Friday, September 28.

Some trees that were knocked over by the severe storms that Long Island experienced over the summer have not been cleared from the sides of Chipmunk Trail yet. The trail extends from Post Residence Hall all the way to Hillwood Commons. It is the main shortcut to class for many students. 
“It’s just a matter of manpower,” William Kirker, Director of the Facilities Department, answered in response to the Pioneer’s inquiry about why the tree limbs have not yet been removed. He explained that they are trying to maintain important areas of the campus first, and the trees are not an immediate danger to anyone. The campus Facilities Department prioritizes other projects that are time consuming, like maintaining the facilities for fall athletics, residence halls, and keeping the different lawns around campus short and green. The fall is always chaotic with multiple events happening at once, but winter is just around the corner, and that will give the Facilities staff free hands to focus on other facilities as the lawns and other fall-related tasks become less important. Then the snowfall arrives, and their hands will be tied up with snow removal and similar maintenance again. 
To maintain a campus as large as Post, about 350 acres, costs both time and money, and the more expenses one puts out there, the more the tuition will rise, which is something Kirker does not think they should put the students through. “Money is always a challenge,” said Kirker. Money and manpower seem to be the main reasons why we are currently witnessing an untidy Chipmunk Trail. He believes the trees will be removed by December, although he does not promise anything. 
“I wondered why the trees were still there,” said Nicole Urbonas, a Junior marketing major. She passes the trees every day when she walks to class. She does not think that the trees are a huge issue. They are not in her way, and she believes that most students do not care. “I don’t think the trees bother anyone.”
Gine Soerboe, junior chemistry major, did not know about the trees. “I haven’t noticed that at all, and I walk there every day!” 
Katy Cheung, junior chemistry and forensic science dual major, has a different take on the fallen trees. Cheung thinks that the cam¬pus should be more environmentally oriented. “The fallen trees have been left to naturally decompose and bring its nutrients back into the soil for future growth,” she thought. When Cheung was told the reason why they have not been removed, she changed her opinion. “Money and manpower are necessary to remove these trees, but with the debt, LIU Post has to take it slow.” She agreed that the trail has been cluttered for the past weeks.
The purpose of the fallen trees on Chipmunk Trail is not to go green, as Cheung hypothesized, even though it may sound interesting. The Facilities Department is working as hard and as quickly as possible, according to Kirker. Many students think the campus looks appealing in general, and it is something for students to be proud of. The trees by Chipmunk Trail are a minor detail compared to the rest, but it is important to address the issue, especially when students start questioning it.

September is a month dreaded by many. Summer is at an end, the weather begins to grow colder, and classes are back in session. As we pack away the butt-cleavage inducing short shorts and Old Navy flip flops of summer, we start to don the pieces that make fall such a fashion-friendly season. 
Boots, sweaters, and jackets return to us like old, forgotten friends. There will also be new pieces that we add to our autumn wardrobe to stay on the cutting edge of fashion. The question of what is trendy or chic may elude many of us. Thankfully, there are designers out there to help us along. Several new trends have emerged for the season to choose our ultra-stylish new pieces from. So what exactly are the looks à la modes?
Deep, dark reds dominate the runways. Whether it was in the form of a sweater, jacket, or a pair of shorts, the color had definite presence. Black, always en vogue, was a main staple of the shows as well. The two are definitely going to be the mainstays of this sea¬son, along with colors like mustard, chocolate, viridian, eggplant, and olive. Even tangerine made a few appearances.
The next trend is one that I am a definite fan of: leather. Whether real or faux, the material is the perfect tool to bring an ordinary outfit to the next level. Biker jackets, pants, and skirts found their way to the runways. Be sure to err on the side of caution with this trend, though.
Sophistication is not without place this fall. Many designers make use of gold metallics, sequins, lacy designs, and peplum tops/dresses to add a demure flair to this fall. Black, strappy heels are also popular, particularly with gold embellishments.
Boots tie up the fall look. This season you can really play with any length. Whether knee-high riding, slouchy, motorcycle, or ankle-cut; boots definitely define the season. But the perfect outfit is nothing without the right hair and make up.
I made my way down to The Studio, New York in Babylon village for the latest beauty trends. This salon is home to some of the most talented stylists, colorists, and make up artists that Long Island has to offer. I interviewed three gurus about their favorite fall looks.
More of a magician with make up than an artist, Donna Griffin is the owner of the salon. The most important piece of advice she gives for this season is to pay attention to your skin health. “Flawless skin is always in,” she stresses. She recommends drinking plenty of water, using a good exfoliator, and always using SPF.
As far as products, Donna suggests using a beauty balm, or BB cream as they are commonly known. BB creams are light coverage foundations that contain moisturizers, antioxidants, and sun protection. Garnier and Dr. Jart both produce excellent creams. In addition, Ms. Griffin recommends defined eyeliner, dramatic lashes, and either matte color or nude glossy lips to stay on trend.
According to master stylist Cher Guthenburg, straight and smooth is out. “Big, messy waves are the look,” she said. To get the effect, try using a triple barrel waving iron, some beach spray, and your fingers to tousle it. “Don’t be afraid of looking too wild,” she said with a smile. “That’s what the style is all about.” She mentioned an¬other look for the season is a far-to-the-side part paired with an over the shoulder pony.
Thomas Suhrland is The Studio’s in house color expert. Thomas tells us that the ombré trend, which has been present for the past few seasons, is definitely falling from grace. “The look is more natural,” he says. Balayage, or hand painted highlights, are all the rage. “They produce a similar effect as ombré, but it’s less dramatic.” The technique has a sunkissed result, more broken up than the dark-root to blonde-ends that many girls have been sporting.
This season is all about the feisty, frisky edge that is inside every girl. Your confidence is your sexiest accessory, so experiment the new trends with pride. Maybe try a pair of burgundy pants one day and a faux leather skirt the next. Who knows, you may stumble upon your new favorite outfit in the process.

With the rebranding of LIU Post that started at the beginning of 2012, a new clothing line entered the campus as well. The new line is in the bookstore featuring tee shirts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants displaying the school’s new name and logo. The clothing line has a fresh look and modern style that is very different from the previous C.W. Post line. Students seem to have mixed feelings about this new design. 
Several students do not like the LIU line and prefer the C.W. Post line better. “The old style is better because when the new one came out it looked plain and empty,” said Kamolochanok Koonvisal, a sophomore business management major. Koonvisal says she has bought nothing from the new LIU line. Other student expressed similar feelings. “The new style is very plain, I don’t plan on buying anything that says LIU Post,” said Ashley Harloff, a junior computer science major. Harloff says she has a few items of the C.W. Post attire. Many of the C.W. Post sweatshirts have multiple colors on each one and contain a stitched CW. Post. The LIU Post sweatshirts are one solid color with a press on LIU. The C.W. Post line was more colorful and it contained different shades and patterns. The LIU Post line features a lot of solid neutral colors; it is more basic with no patterns. 
A few freshmen prefer the C.W. Post line as well. “I like the C.W. Post styles better and want to buy stuff in that line,” says Kim Balskey, a freshman who is undecided in her major. “I like the C.W. Post color combinations better,” said Amanda Viteritti, a fresh¬man psychology major. 
The bookstore is still selling what is left of the C.W. Post line at a discounted price. There is not much left of the old line, one rack of clothing in limited sizes. Balskey and Viteritti wanted to buy C.W. Post sweatpants but couldn’t because their sizes were unavailable. The only sweatpants available in the bookstore in the C.W. Post line are size XXL. Apparel from the LIU Post line is avail¬able in the bookstore and online at liunet.bncollege.com. 
However, there are also other students that like the new LIU clothing line. “It’s more modern, new and fresh,” said Lindsey Passaro, a junior music education major. She says she has not gotten anything from the line yet, but she plans to do so. “I like the new shades, their more trendy and up to date,” said Passaro. 
“I like the LIU Post clothing line better; this new look is more modern and clean,” said Angela Aiello, a senior speech mythology major. Many feel the same. “I like the LIU Post line better, it looks brand new and the C.W. Post line looks old. I feel like we’re stepping up,” said Alex Lopez, a graduate clinical lab major. 
It took time for certain students to embrace the new line and logo of LIU Post. “At first, I saw the line and didn’t like it be¬cause it was too blocky,” said David Armas, a junior sociology-anthropology major. After a while he changed his mind. “Now I like the basic colors and delta signs on the sweat¬shirts,” said Armas. 
Christopher Silva, a sophomore, agreed. “At first, I thought the logo didn’t fit the campus which is homey. The shirts are not,” said Silva, who is undecided on his major. He then came to a realization. “The new logo is more modern and fits the time period we are in,” he concluded. “The new logo is grow¬ing on me now that I’m seeing various types of it on the clothing. I like that aspect of it.” 
Some students have suggestions for the LIU apparel. “They should make more girl style color combinations in the new line,” said Viteritti. She likes the color combinations of pink and gray in the sweatpants from the C.W. Post line. Another student has a suggestion to improve the new line. “I’m not against the new LIU Post brand, but if they can make the design more appealing then maybe it will attract the students to buy it more,” said Koonvisal. 
Will students buy the new line? There is an assortment of tee shirts, long sleeve shirts, sweatshirts and sweatpants in the LIU line. But if students already have the C.W. Post merchandise, what would make them want to buy items from the LIU line now? Harooff says she is still going to wear her C.W. Post attire. “I don’t plan on buying anything that says LIU Post; it doesn’t make a difference to me and it is very expensive,” said Haroof. 
No matter what your opinion on the LIU Post clothing line is, the reality is that it is here to stay. We are now and will continue to be LIU Post.

Do you like going on a chainsaw rampage against hordes of the undead while listening to a soundtrack including “Oh Mickey Your So Fine” by Toni Basil? Would you like your main character to be a popular cheerleader that was raised by a family of zombie hunters? Well, Lollipop Chainsaw may be for you. The game may look absolutely ridiculous but it’s actually stylish, quirky, and just insane. 
The game is hack and slash with mini-games, quick time events, and a score. Juliet, a popular cheer¬leader who is secretly a zombie hunter, lives in a town overrun by zombies thanks to an evil high school Goth named Swan, who summoned five zombie overlords to destroy the world. Juliet’s boyfriend was attacked by a zombie and she saves his life by cutting off his head so the virus wouldn’t turn him into the undead. Basically, for the whole game, the guy’s head is hanging like keychain on Juliet’s clothes. Believe me, this game is not at all serious, it’s just so stupid that’s its funny. 
The weapon of choice to kill zombies is a chainsaw while performing acrobatic moves to stun enemies. As you go on, you can buy new attacks and upgrade your character to deal more unique attacks like spinning in the air as you decapitate all the zombies in one swoop. Also, the zombies change from each stage. Sometimes there are zombie football players or farmers which add a lot of variety. One of my favorites is the boss battles. Each is different in style and how you defeat them. One is a punk rocker that would shout words at you (quite literally) and scream tons of profanity. The soundtrack is awesome with lots of metal and punk music playing to ramp up the game as you slaughter hundreds of zombies. 
However, there are some drawbacks. The mini games aren’t that great. The worst is zombie base-ball because the control for this section was done so poorly. I had to re-due this mini game multiple times before I was able to move on. The other mini games like zombie basketball, Nick Toss, and a few others are not too bad but they could have been a little less repetitive. There is nothing innovative about this game. It’s just taking your basic killing zombie genre with some flare and a mainstream style. The achievements aren’t worth much except for the costumes and there is no multiplayer so you’ll be moving on from this game rather soon. The biggest issue is that the game is really short, only a couple of hours. It uses extreme amounts of profanity and has a lot of sexual themes, which is not a bad thing, but for those of you who don’t like these themes, you may not like the game too much. This is NOT a game to give your little brother or your grandma for the holidays. 
It’s a good game overall with some flaws and it doesn’t have much longevity. It was released at around $60 and it would make more sense to be $30 or $40. I’d say wait for the price to drop or just rent. I give this silly and extremely outrageous but sadly short game a 5.6/10.

The LIU Post Pioneers men’s soccer team remained undefeated this past week. The boys defeated rival, Dowling College (4-1), on Wednesday September 19, and followed that up with another win against Roberts Wesleyan on Sunday September 23, by a score of 3-2. The Pioneers, who are currently ranked third in the nation, move to 8-0 on the season and 3-0 in East Coast Conference play. 
During the matchup against Dowling, the Pioneers jumped onto the board just 55 seconds into the game when freshman midfielder Per Forgaard scored off a cross from junior forward Cemil Turan. The Pioneers repeated the play in the ninth minute with Forgaard and Turan switching roles. Forgaard played setup man for Turan to make it 2-0 in favor of the Pioneers. 
In the 14th minute, sophomore forward Eivind Austboe scored unassisted off a free kick from 20 yards out. The Pioneers added its fourth goal of the match in the 60th minute as Turan scored his second goal of the game off a pass from senior forward Andreas Olson. 
The Pioneers gave up the only goal of the game in the 77th minute, but that would be all as the Pioneers took the game easily 4-1. Junior goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen made three saves in the win, and LIU Post outshot Dowling 21-9. 
LIU Post capped off a successful week with a victory over the Roberts Wesleyan Redhawks. Turan had another two-goal game, but it was a match that saw the Redhawks score the game’s opening goal.
Sophomore forward Stephen Stewart scored for RWC in the game’s opening ten minutes on what would be their only shot of the half. The Pioneers answered back five minutes later as graduate mid-fielder Bas Beverwijk headed a cross from junior back Eirik Bjoernoe to tie the game at one. 
The Pioneers came out of halftime looking to break the tie and they did just that. Turan netted his first goal of the contest in the 49th minute to put LIU Post up 2-1. Fifteen minutes later, Turan scored again to give the Pioneers a two-goal cushion. 
However, the Redhawks would not go down without a fight as sophomore forward Michael Cunningham scored in the 83rd minute to cut the lead to one. The Pioneers were able to hold off their opponent to secure the eighth win of the season. LIU Post outshot RWC 24-3 in the win and sophomore keeper Mathias Spinnars earned his first win of the season. 
The next game for the Pioneers is on the road on Saturday, September 29, against the Saint Thomas Aquinas Spartans (2-2-2).

The storylines were all written: Two undefeated teams looking to remain perfect. Two high-powered offenses going head to head. The game even featured the eleventh ranked team in the country, the Bloomsburg Huskies. 
The Huskies were looking for revenge on the Pioneers for their upset late last season. In October of last year, the Pioneers shocked the Huskies, who were ranked second in the country at the time. However, the game played this past Saturday did not go according to the Pioneers’ plans. The final score resulted in a 42-27 win for the Huskies (4-0). With the loss, the Pioneers dropped to 2-1. 
Despite winning the turnover the battle for the third consecutive week, the Pioneers were unable to capitalize on the Huskies mistakes. The Pioneers defense forced Huskies freshman quarterback Tim Kelly into his first two interceptions of the season. Pioneers junior defensive back Donovan Edwards was the beneficiary of both of Kelly’s mistakes. 
Although the Pioneers forced the Huskies into four turnovers, the Pioneers could not stop the connection between Kelly and senior wide receiver Kyle Fisher through the air. Fisher had six catches for 196 yards and three touchdowns. The Kelly-Fisher duo accounted for more than 80 percent of the Huskies total yardage through the passing attack. 
The defense of the Pioneers also had a difficult time stopping one of the most powerful running games in the country. Led by junior running backs Eddie Mateo and Franklyn Quiteh, the Huskies totaled nearly 300 yards on the ground against the Pioneers. Mateo had 17 carries for 118 yards and one touchdown, and Quiteh ran the ball 18 times for 115 yards. 
At the end of the first quarter, the score was knotted up 7-7 after a two-yard touchdown run by sophomore quarterback Steven Laurino. The Huskies would add 14 points in the second quarter, highlighted by a 73-yard pass from Kelly to Fisher. However, as the first half came to a close, the Pioneers would strike and make it a one-score game. Battling a broken thumb on his throwing hand, Laurino fired a strike to senior wide receiver Ryan Derham for a 47-yard touchdown. Der¬ham now has a touchdown in every game to start of the season. At the half, the Huskies led 21-14 in a competitive matchup. 
The third quarter was dominated by the Pioneers; mainly by junior running back Anthony Brunetti. He evened up the score at 21 on a five-yard touchdown run. On the following Pioneers drive, Brunetti caught a 21-yard pass from Laurino, and somehow juked, spun, found a way into the end zone to give the Pioneers a 27-21 lead heading into the fourth quarter.
Unfortunately for the Pioneers, Brunetti’s two touchdowns were the last plays to get excited about during the game. The Huskies showed why the team is ranked eleventh in the country with their fourth quarter performance. The Huskies scored 21 unanswered points in the fourth quarter, including two big plays that shifted the momentum. The Kelly-Fisher connection was seen again, this time a 60-yard strike for a touchdown. Following that score, Mateo broke off a 42-yard touchdown run that deflated the Pioneers. The Pioneers offense could not muster any solid drives together in the final 15 minutes of play as there were multiple three-and-outs for the normally high-powered offense. The Huskies ended up handing the Pioneers their first loss of the season by a score of 42-27.
The Pioneers next game is at home on Saturday, September 29, against Edinboro University of Pennsylvania (1-2). Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org to hear all the game coverage. Pregame is at 12:30 p.m. and kickoff is scheduled for 1:00 p.m.

The LIU Post women’s volleyball team moved to a .500 record (8-8) on the season with its win over Bentley University on Saturday, September 22. The Pioneers cruised to a 3-0 win (25-15, 25-9, 25-21) over the Falcons (3-9).
Junior middle blocker Makamae Namahoe led the Pioneers with 10 kills and freshman libero Rachel Ringor led the squad with 10 digs. The victory against Bentley was the only win in the NE-10/ECC Challenge for the Pioneers who went 1-2 during the tournament.
On the day the Pioneers defeated the Falcons, the team also lost to the University of Massachusetts-Lowell 3-1 (25-18, 16-25, 25-20, 25-21). In the loss, the Pioneers’ sophomore middle blocker Heather Adams led all players in the contest with 14 kills. Four players in the loss accounted for double-digit digs: freshman outside hitter Harlee Meyers (17), Ringor (16), Namahoe (12), and freshman setter Monica Amador (12). For her performance during the tournament, freshman middle hitter Melissa Hansen was the only LIU Post representative and the only one of nine total players named to the NE-10/ECC Challenge All-Tournament Team. In the three matches against Merrimack College, UMass-Lowell, and Bentley, Hansen totaled 19 kills. 
The Pioneers begin a three game home stand starting on Saturday, September 29. On Saturday, the Pioneers face off against Roberts Wesleyan College (5-6) and the College of Saint Rose (7-4). The Pioneers’ next game after that is on Thurs¬day, October 4, against winless Queens College (0-12).

The LIU Post Pioneers women’s soccer team managed to edge archrival Dowling College, after junior forward Alexa Niciforo scored the game-winning goal in the second overtime on Wednesday, September 19. 
The Pioneers took the lead early in the game when fresh¬man forward Susanne Vistnes scored only 15 minutes into the contest, as she took a pass from freshman midfielder Hanna Westerling to beat the Dowling goalkeeper one-on-one. The Pioneers were able to hold on to the lead all the way until the 64th minute mark, when the Golden Lions of Dowling College scored off a set piece to even the score at one.
The second half of the game was an even match as both teams had big opportunities to come away with the win, but failed in the last moment. Niciforo came extremely close to putting the Pioneers ahead when she tried to chip the ball past the Golden Lions’ goalkeeper, but missed by only a few inches. 
In overtime there was no doubt who wanted to take home the game. The Pioneers pressured the Golden Lions, tallying four shots, while allowing only one attempt from the Golden Lions. However, the Pioneers had to wait until the 104th minute to win the game, as Vistnes hit a hard shot forcing the Golden Lion goalkeeper to give up a re¬bound, and setting up Niciforo’s game winner. 
“It was an amazing feeling to see Alexa putting the ball in, after such a long game,” said Vistnes, “We worked so hard all game long, and the goal was just meant to be.” 
Niciforo stayed composed when the ball landed in her feet. “It felt great, I felt it coming, and when the ball landed in my feet, I could just put it in,” Niciforo explained. 
Niciforo stated that the team is ambitious moving for¬ward, “We want to win back the conference title and make a good run in the national tournament. We belong in that company.” 
The Pioneers winning ways continued as they rolled past the Robert Wesleyan Redhawks 3-0 on Sunday, September 23. The game remained scoreless until the 12th minute when Westerling rebounded her own shot and put the Pioneers ahead 1-0. The score would remain that way until the second half when senior midfielder Prudence Ryd¬strom scored to put LIU Post up by two. The Pioneers put their third and final goal on the board in the 66th minute off a header from Vistnes. 
The Pioneers moved to 6-1-1 with the two wins. The next game is on the road against Nyack College on Wednesday, September 26, at 3:30 p.m.

Junior forward Carlee Dragon and freshman forward Keliann Margiotta scored a combined six goals to lead LIU Post to a 7-3 win against Kutztown University on Friday, Septebmer 21, in a PSAC East field hockey clash at Hickox Field. 
The Golden Bears scored the first goal of the game in the eighth minute when freshman forward Anna Behm chipped a shot into the lower right corner on a right cross from senior forward Emily Labowitz.
LIU Post went on to tie the game when Margiotta scored her first goal on a tip-in shot out front in the 15th minute of play. Kutztown took the lead once more in the first, this time with Behm assisting on a goal from Labowitz that was shot out front past the Pioneers charging goal¬keeper Becca May. 
The Pioneers bounced back with a 5-0 run that carried into the second half, which included a pair of goals from junior forward Carlee Dragon and three goals from Margiotta to give the hosts a 6-2 lead. Pioneers sophomore forward Karina Fleming scored the game’s final goal when she gathered the ball out of a scramble and shot it into the cage. 
The Pioneers outshot the Golden Bears, 25-4, and held a 16-7 advantage on penalty corners. LIU Post improves to 5-2 overall and 2-1 in conference play, while Kutztown slips to 3-5 overall and 1-2 in the PSAC East. 
Dragon now has 11 goals and five assists in seven games as an ace forward. “I have good teammates, and my team is getting me the ball out front. That’s why I’m always in good condition,” she said.
“We gathered and passed the ball very well,” said head coach Raenee Savin. She has preached high intensity and quick ball movement to the team. Those practices proved their ability.
The Pioneers next game is on the road on Friday, September 28, against Indiana University of Pennsylvania (7-2).

Situated along the banks of the Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires is South America’s most complex, energetic, and seductive port city. Buenos Aires was born with its eyes looking to-ward Europe, as it is sometimes referred to as the “Paris of South America.” Porteños, as the multinational people of Buenos Aires are known, possess an elaborate and rich cultural identity. They value their European heritage highly, as Italian and German names outnumber Spanish, and the lifestyle and architecture are markedly more European than any other in South America. This capital city is divided into 48 districts that attract millions of tourists each year. 
Airlines: Known as Argentina’s international gateway, Buenos Aires is easily accessible from North America, Europe, and Australia, as well as other capital cities in South America. The main airport used to and from Buenos Aires is Ezeiza International Airport. Airline carriers that fly non-stop to EZE are American Airlines, British Airways, Aerolíneas Argentinas, LAN Airlines, Delta, and Iberia. 
Hotels: Buenos Aires has a great selection of hotels ranging from budget-priced to luxurious. Accommodations are sprinkled throughout each of the districts. For example, in the district of Palermo, there are hotels on the higher end while San Telmo boasts budget hotels and hostels downtown. Tourists can find common name hotels such as the Hilton and Sheraton in Puerto Madero, an old port area. Apartments are also popular as pricing is very good and living space is larger than an average hotel.
Attractions/Sightseeing: In a single trip, it’s nearly impossible to experience everything Buenos Aires has to offer. During the day, take a stroll through the gardens of Plaza Francia, which fills each weekend with dancers, living statues, street artists, and astrologers with the future in their hands. Buenos Aires is the site of the Teatro Colón, an internationally rated opera house. There are several symphony orchestras and choral societies. The city has numerous museums related to history, fine arts, and modern arts. In Palermo, one of the most exclusive districts, are the city’s most expensive restaurants intermixed with the bars of the Feria Plaza Serrano. On weekends, the Palermo Woods and Rose Garden are ideal spots for walking, playing soccer, and boating. Other nearby attractions include the Jardín Zoológico, the Galileo Galilei Planetarium, and tea offered in impeccable Japanese gardens. Take an evening stroll down Avenida Corrientes (Corrientes Avenue), a bustling street, symbolic of Buenos Aires. It’s full of cafés, theaters, pizzerias, and bookstores, some of which are open past midnight on the weekends. Stop by the city’s oldest and most elegant cemetery, the Cementerio de la Recoleta (Recoleta Cemetery). Nearly 15 acres in size and graced with elaborate marble mausoleums, the remains of former presidents, Nobel Prize winners, and even Eva Perón rest here. Lastly, the Festival Internacional del Tango is held bringing tango dancers from around the world to strut their stuff.
Cuisine: Argentine cuisine is famous for having a Mediterranean blend with Spanish tradi-tional tasting. Argentinians are known for their high protein diet, especially beef. As a result, the most popular meal is “el asado” or “parrillada,” a mixed grill of steak and other cuts. A traditional parrillada includes meat, sausages, chinchulines (small intestines), riñones (kidneys), and morcilla (blood sausage), but don’t let that put you off unless you are a vegetarian. It is pre¬pared over charcoal or a wood fire and accompanied by chimichurri, a tasty marinade and often served with different types of salads and/or fried potatoes. There are also restaurants often referred as “Parrilladas” that strictly serve barbecued meat and chicken. Some of them are called “Tenedor Libre” and they are “All You Can Eat” for a fixed price. For des¬sert, it is common to see Porteños having fresh fruits, ice cream, or flan with “dulce de leche” (sweet caramel). The flan is quite popular because it is delicious and is a renowned delicacy.

500 feet beneath the ocean’s surface, the U.S. ballistic missile submarine Colorado receives its orders. Over a radio channel designed only to be used if their homeland has been wiped out, they’re told to fire nuclear weapons and destroy Pakistan. When Captain Marcus Chaplin (Andre Braugher) and XO Sam Kendal (Scott Speedman) demand confirmation of the orders, the Colorado is targeted, fired upon, and hit by one of their own. With nowhere left to turn, Chaplin and Kendal bring the men and women of the Colorado to an exotic island where they find refuge, romance, and a chance at a new life. 
“Last Resort” is a mixture of action and drama with a little mystery and suspense. Each blends together creating an epic story with visually stunning scenery. The show plays on current fears, the threat of nuclear war and government cover ups. Even top officials are confused by the purposely covered up attack on their own fleet. Chaplin’s deep and dramatic monologue at the end of the pilot sets the series up so you know where the characters are headed in the upcoming episodes, to start their lives over in a new place they call home under dangerous and dire conditions. This speech reminds me of those spoken by Harry Korn on NBC’s “Harry’s Law,” NBC’s second most-watched drama, which was cancelled due to low viewership among viewers ages 18 to 49. With “Last Resort” focused at a younger audience and this combo, ABC’s certainly got a hit on its hands. 
Take a trip to the Colorado’s new island home and be careful that she isn’t attacked. If the crew is, they will open fire “and we will all burn together.” Tune in to “Last Resort” on Thursdays at 8 p.m. on ABC. Let us know what you think of “Last Resort.” Email your letter to the editor at Paul.Kalis@my.liu.edu so we may publish your response.

I’ve written this column for just about a year and half now. I’ve also written about a plethora of different things ranging from chivalry to sex. To this day, I stand by everything I have ever said. I believe that for the most part, chivalry is dead. Guys just aren’t as respectful as they used to be. I’ve written a lot about the lack of male intellect. I haven’t really spoken much about the female part in this inevitable equation. 
I think it’s mostly because I am a girl that I haven’t taken the time to talk about the female component of this issue. I honestly believe that girls need to take at least half of the responsibility for guys having lost some of their chivalrous ways. Men don’t respect us as much because girls don’t respect themselves as much. 
Think about it, once girls get to college they tend to go a little bit overboard. It’s like they’re being thrown into a vast ocean of new experiences and an excess of new guys and they just can’t seem to navigate; some merely lose their way. Not to mention that clothes seem to get skimpier and skimpier each year. The age of the girls wearing these “baby clothes” seems to get smaller each year as well.
Guys will respect girls only when girls do something worth respecting. Wearing what would have been classified as a bathing suit 50 years ago out in public is not acceptable. I know I’ve seen it, especially in the dorms; girls leaving campus for a night out and all I think is, “One wrong move and we’re all getting a shot of her ‘good girl.’” It’s kind of gross. 
What’s worse is the next morning, when girls wake up from a night of partying and they remember all of the idiotic things they did, they just shrug their shoulders and say, “YOLO.” Really? Saying that you only live once is not exactly an excuse to repeatedly act stupid and irresponsible. Also, prior to this YOLO phenomenon, were you under the impression that you are able to live more than once? It’s nonsense.
Of course the entire female gender has not succumbed to this craziness. Some of us have some dignity left. My point is this; yes I still think boys, especially college boys, are inconsiderate and walking around with their head in the clouds, but it’s not completely their fault. Ladies, you need to step up and realize that maybe you are not being treated the way you feel you should because of something that you are doing.

Imagine graduating from college, thousands of dollars in debt from loans, no job or a job that does not pay well. Unfortunately, this is the case for many students. Approximately half of the country’s new graduates were either unemployed or underemployed in 2011, according to an April 2012 ABC article by Rudabeh Shahbazi.
More than 37 million Americans owe student debt, and a majority of these students took out loans to finance their college educations, according to an August 2012 article entitled ‘President Obama, Mitt Romney Address College Financial Aid, Student Loans On Campaign Trail’ by Tyler Kingkade in the Huffington Post. With the student debt reaching a record breaking $1 trillion, something must be done to improve student funding without ‘breaking the bank.’ Some of us are wondering how we are going to pay our debts when we graduate, while other students are concerned with how they are going to be able to finance next semester’s cost. Because of this, it is important for students to be aware of the policies being pushed by the presidential candidates. 
Romney on Student Aid and Loans:
“A flood of federal dollars is driving up tuition and burdening too many young Americans with substantial debt and too few opportunities,” said Mitt Romney in his white paper “A Chance for Every Child.” Romney openly admits that students should not expect him to boost Pell grant awards or help pay off student loans. He explains that even though it is very tempting for politicians to promise more money when asked, Romney explained he would not lie to the public. He also said that giving students more money would only be taking money from your pocket and giving it to the other, according to Kingkade’s article in the Huffington Post. 
What he means by this is that if more federal grants were allowed, the people themselves would ultimately finance the program. Romney added, “I’m not going to promise all sorts of free stuff that I know you’re going to end up paying for. What I want to do is give you a great job so you’ll be able to pay it back yourself. And I want to get the government off your back, so you can keep more of what you earned,” said Romney.
The problem with this, critics say, is that many students would otherwise not be able to afford to pursue the careers they wish. The Ryan budget would cut Pell benefits, eligibility, and freeze the maxi¬mum grant at $5,550 per student per year, apparently on a permanent basis, writes the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Romney believes that this could help in the long term by making students more aware of the debt they incur when they go to college.
“Hey, I’ll loan you more money,” Romney said earlier this month according to ABC News and Emily Deruy. “Here let’s loan you — I don’t want to overwhelm you with debts. I want you to make sure you can pay back the debts you’ve already got and that will happen with good jobs and that’s why my five-point plan to get 12 million new jobs in this country is the best thing I can do for you and for the students of America.” 
Romney also has a reform program called “A Chance for Every Child.” In his white paper, he explains that he does not want to spend more borrowed money, like he accuses the current administration of doing. He expresses that he wants to consolidate duplicative and overly complex programs within the Department of Education. He also explains that he wants to focus on giving students and families with financial need proper information about schools they wish to attend, thus educating them about future earnings and loan repayment rates, allowing them to weigh the risk and benefits of attending the schools students choose.
Obama on Student Aid and Loans:
“Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is no longer just a pathway to opportunity for a talented few; rather, it is a prerequisite for the growing jobs of the new economy,” according to the official White House website, Whitehouse.gov. Because of this, initiatives have been taken in order to make school more affordable. In the past four years, President Obama has doubled the student Pell grant from 16 to approximately $30 million. According to his website, he also claims that by doing this, more people will be eligible for a Pell grant, thus helping them with their college cost.
Obama is also proposing the ‘Know Before You Owe’ program, which is essentially a form that will include the average loan default rate and will also differentiate between grants and scholarships, allowing students to know exactly what they will be paying, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the U.S. Department of Education. The form would be introduced as a universal Financial Aid document that all colleges would be urged to adopt by the year 2013-14, if approved. This would allow students to see what they are being offered and how much they could possibly pay, before they accept the college’s offer.
Also, Obamas ‘Pay As You Earn’ program, which came into effect this year, caps monthly federal student loan repayment at 10 percent of monthly income. In essence, what this means is that students will not have to struggle to pay their federal loans. With this program, the federal student loan is capped at 10 percent of your monthly income. This is so students have more money to spend and invest in the economy, thus improving it, according to Barackobama.com, President Obama’s re-election site. Also, in this program, a student can choose the college they want to attend based not only the price of tuition, but on their career goals. He also has an education calculator on his website where students can calculate how much they can pay for school based on what career they choose.
This segues into Obama’s proposed loan forgiveness program. Also, according to Obama’s site, “If you are a responsible borrower and make 20 years of on-time payments, your remaining debt will be forgiven. If you are in public service, like teaching, nursing, or serving in the military, your remaining debt will be forgiven after 10 years of on-time payments.”
“The Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012, introduced to the House by Representative Hansen Clarke (D-Mich.), would reduce the debt of students who have already repaid a substantial portion of their loans over the past decade.” according to an article in June of 2012 in the Huffington Post by Gregory Kristof.
According to hansenclarke.house.gov, if the act is passed, the amount of forgiveness will have a cap for new borrowers, and none for those that took out federal loans before the act would go into effect. According to The Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012 F.A.Q, the act has an approximately $45,000 cap for new borrowers to incentivize students to make cautious financial decisions while encouraging colleges and universities to lower the cost of their tuition. The Act aims to stimulate the economy by relieving students of their financial debt, thus increasing the amount of available income students have to spend and invest in the economy. 
What Romney and Obama Agree on:
What Obama and Romney do agree on is the extension of the dis¬counted interest rate on subsidized federal loans. The Stafford loan was set to increase from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st for unsubsidized and subsidized loans. With both of their cooperation, the current Stafford loan has remained at a 3.4 percent for subsidized rates and at 6.8 for unsubsidized and graduate rates according to Staffordloan.com, which are in effect until 6/30/2013.
The issue of loans and education financing is an important one to college students. The candidates have different positions. The choice is ours. Vote 2012

Once again it is time for elections, which stirs up a whirlwind of emotions. The media brings up controversial topics for the candidates to dispute about and people tend to get heated with political debates. It’s a fun time of year because it unites Americans, stirring up feelings of patriotism. However, it can be difficult for busy college students to keep up with. 
My number one rule with following the elections is to pay attention to different mediums of news. Many college students, like myself, have limited time during the day to dedicate to the kind of research it takes to weed out the fabrication and lies associated with politics to get down to the truth. Luckily we have technology to make this process a little less time consuming. 
DVRs, YouTube, and other media outlets that can allow you to watch TV at later dates in time will be your best friend during elections. Record debates. When candidates are debating they often say exactly what is on their mind—sometimes by accident—making it an excellent way to figure out what they are really about. Plus, when you record it you can skip over commercials, which saves time in your busy schedule. The next debate is October 3rd at 9 p.m. 
Social media is another outlet that can be resourceful during the elections when used appropriately. Both Romney and Obama are on Twitter—follow them! (Barack Obama’s Twitter- https://twitter.com/BarackObama; Mitt Romney’s Twitter- https://twitter.com/MittRom¬ney) It may not be the actual candidate sending all their tweets, but it’s a short and sweet way to find out what they are all about. If you are not a Twitter user you can also follow the presidential campaign of both candidates through their websites. (Barack Obama’s Website- http://www.barackobama.com/; Mitt Romney’s Website- http://www.mittromney.com/) Post questions or comments about the candidates on the social media site of your choice and have a debate or two with friends and family. The most important part about the debate is listening; you never know when someone who sees a situation differently will enlighten you. 
Another technique I like to use is watching the news. As boring as it sounds, it’s a great way to stay on top of the latest actions of the candidates. News broadcasts can get information out quickly, so they usually have the latest scoop about the presidential candidates. However, you must make sure that you don’t limit yourself to watching the same broadcasters repeatedly. Although most news industries claim to be neutral, many favor one side over the other. Since time is precious I try and watch a different broadcast company every morning while I am preparing to start my day. I usually choose FOX one day, which tends to have a conservative view of politics, and then a channel such as NBC, that is more liberal the next. 
But most importantly, during elections remember to embrace your American right to go out and vote!

Less than 33 percent of LIU Post students use the state of the art Pratt Recreational Center for exercise, according to Martin Guillet, Associate Director of Recreation. The facility is free to all current students. 
“Students use the gym very frequently only during the first two weeks of the semester and the two weeks before spring break,” said Brooke Aksens, a trainer at the Pratt Recreational Center. 
Kerianne Ingram and Jonelle Peterson, students working at the Pratt Recreation Information Desk, have observed that most of the people who come regularly to work out are members of sports teams. 
“If students went to the gym just four times a week for 45 minute sessions they would be well on their way to looking and feeling better,” said Aksens. 
Guillet believes this trend happens because only a small percentage of students use the gym simply for living a healthy way of life. He added that most college students use the gym to improve their body whether it is to gain or lose weight. He said that this occurs because many college students worry about their appearance. 
Free nutrition assistance is available to students who make an appointment through the Dietetic Internship Program, which is run by graduate interns and directed by Sandra Sarcona, associate professor of nutrition. The program is designed to help students learn how to eat healthier and achieve their personal goals. 
Aksens said, “Students are looking to learn how to eat at Winnick. The foods avail¬able at night are high in fat and sugar.” 
The dietetic internship program is designed to help guide students to make better choices when put in this situation. Guillet wishes it were possible to inform students of every program that Post offers. He said that many students have outside gym memberships regardless of the fact that the gym in Pratt is free to them as students. To people who reside in the community, membership can cost up to $600 a year.
“I am always surprised that some students don’t know where the gym is after three to four years [at Post],” Guillet said. He is determined to get the word out to more students by using social media outlets, such as Face¬book, and by meeting with students. 
Jeff Beck, a trainer at the Pratt Recreational Center, said that he thinks it would be a good idea if they made a website for students who don’t feel comfortable going to the gym. He envisioned a website, possibly with a video blog, that showed students exercises that they can do for 15 minutes in their dorm room. 
Beck thinks this would be helpful to students because many students have difficulty fitting the gym into their busy schedules. However, he said that the Pratt Recreational Center tries to attract students by bringing in new state of the art equipment. 
The Pratt Recreational Center was donated by Edmund T. Pratt, who gave Post about $14 million to build the center. Today, Pratt is operated by the college’s general funds, ac¬cording to Guillet.
Along with the state of the art workout room in Pratt, there is also an array of other ways to exercise in the recreation center. There is an indoor track, a swimming pool along with fitness classes, and intramural sports. 
Beck said that a lot of people take the fitness classes, but they are always looking for more people. He added that they are trying to accommodate more people by adding additional times for classes such as the new TRX class (suspension training) and more abs classes. 
“Exercising and being fit are excellent ways to get through college stresses. It radiates positive energy,” Beck said. 
Guillet said that the Pratt Recreational Center is always open to suggestions for improvement in the facility. 
For more information call the information desk at (516) 299-3250 or visit their website at liu.edu/post/recsports. The Pratt Recreational Center is open from Monday through Thursday from 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m., Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., and weekends from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.

Imagine waking up to the sound of a kookaburra bird on your windowsill; you stretch and wonder whether today you are going to head to an Australian Rules football game or go on a mini road trip to Sydney with your mate. The possibilities are endless, and these are the types of decisions you just don’t mind making. This was my life for five months, all because of my decision to study abroad. It could be yours too; LIU Post students can create memories basically anywhere they can imagine. According to Study Abroad Director Patricia Seaman, “Our students have the unique opportunity to study in London, Turkey, Thailand, India, People’s Republic of China, Costa Rica, Australia or Taiwan through our affiliated programs and LIU Global.” I have been home for a little less than three months and every single day since then has still been shaped by my amazing experience abroad.
It was this time last year, as a junior, that I looked into the process of going abroad. I attended the study abroad fair in Hillwood Commons, met with the study abroad advisor and eventually found myself traveling 23 hours to my home away from home — Melbourne, Australia. Thanks to Patricia Seaman, my dream became a reality. Seaman and her staff help guide you in the right direction in choosing the school and city perfect for you, and that’s just the beginning.
Although it is no lie that studying abroad can put a small dent into your wallet, there are many financial aid opportunities for students to take advantage of. Many schools abroad offer scholarships, and if you study with a school that affiliates with Post you may even be entitled to the same scholarship that you receive here. If it comes down to it, even taking out a loan is worth the experience. Seeing Seaman would be a great step in finding out even more information about the financial aspect of going abroad. From loans, applications, visas and much more, the study abroad office is there to help you throughout the whole process.
I’m not the only one who feels that way either. Senior Public Relations major Brittany Scelza, agrees “Patricia Murdock [Seaman] and her staff were EXTREMELY helpful, they led me in the right direction as soon as I had let them know I was interested and took me step by step until I was nearly on the plane!” Once you get to your destination, you will have someone to turn to in the case of any problems as well. As I got settled in Australia, I met friends who truly became my soulmates and traveled to such beautiful places that I had to ask myself “Is this real life?” multiple times…and I mean multiple. So, start now!
You don’t exactly have to go 10,000 miles away from home to experience life abroad. For some students, going to Europe can be a dream come true. Scelza, took on Europe for a semester just last semester. “Apart from seeing some of the most beautiful places there are to offer, I really feel like it was such a life changing experience. I traveled, met some amazing people and saw the most breath-taking places with hardly anything but a backpack on my shoulders,” Scelza said. Now, that’s living.

For me, Australia was a place that was almost a bit of a “fantasy world” for so long. It’s so far that you barely ever meet any Australians here in America and most American families don’t just go on vacation to Sydney. But the few people that you ever do come across who are either Australian or have been there, will leave some kind of an impact on you. The native Australians are so different from most of the Americans I know. Being laid back, funny and easy going is just something that comes naturally to them. It really is the land of ‘no worries’.
I went out on a limb when I decided to spend a semester at La Trobe University in Melbourne, without knowing a single person there before I arrived. However, I wouldn’t recommend doing a study abroad program any other way. I believe that if I had gone with a friend I wouldn’t have had to go out of my way to talk to people and join organizations that interested me just to get to know people. When you go to a place like Australia, making friends really isn’t much of a challenge though.
There are just no words in the English language that are perfect enough to describe the amazing and life changing experience one gets abroad. You participate in activities that may seem so out of the norm to you, but to others are a way of life. (Like having a professor reward the class for a good week of work with drinks at the campus bar, his shout (which means he’s paying, thanks Steinar!)) Classes are sometimes a struggle, but once you find your happy medium even those can be rewarding too. For example, I wasn’t crazy about the amount of group work Australian students were expected to do, but once I accepted it, I was able to meet some really great people in the process.
When you come from another country, people want to know you. They want to know what you’re about and what it’s like where you come from, just as much as you want to know about them. I was lucky enough to be able to work as an editor with an Australian magazine for emerging journalists, which proposed some of the most difficult situations I’ve ever had to deal with, but the experience is one I will never forget. A daily deadline is stressful enough, now mix in Australian English (I almost wrote travelling instead of traveling in this article itself because it’s so imprinted in my head) and an Australian social life and you have the recipe for one hour of sleep a night. But, I wouldn’t change my experience for the world. In fact, I’m looking to go back to the land down under and get an internship after graduation.

Not only was I exposed to Australians and their lifestyle, I also met amazing people from states in America that I can’t wait to visit. Texas, Chicago and California just to name a few. When you are exploring a new city and going on vacations to Thailand (our spring break spot!) with people that you’ve known for a very short amount of time, you can’t help but get to know some amazing people, and get to know yourself better than you thought possible. I now know that I am petrified of heights, for example. After I spent a whole day trying to comfort a friend about doing a ‘tree-top adventure’ in Thailand, I didn’t think about my own phobia. Needless to say I got 500 feet in the air and cried for the next hour as I was zip-lining, tight rope walking and climbing an obstacle course where, trust me, if you fell, no one was coming to save you.

Kangaroos, koalas and the great barrier reef are all breathtaking things to experience, but the fun doesn’t have to be limited to Australia. Scelza wouldn’t trade her European adventure for the world. “I studied abroad in Florence, Italy. I traveled to Rome, Venice, Pisa, Napoli and dozens of islands, I went sky diving over the Swiss Alps, dancing in Barcelona and shopping in France!” And you thought what you did last weekend was cool?
Many students might be hesitant to study abroad; it can be stressful to know you are leaving your loved ones behind for so long. Life as you know it will be turned upside down, but once you come back — they will all still be there, and that is what students need to remember. Scelza is a great inspiration for those of you who don’t want to damage a relationship. She left for the semester even though she is in a serious relationship with her boyfriend, and in the end she says, “it undoubtedly made our relationship stronger!”
If you’re bored of your life or just looking for something fun and adventurous to do while earning school credit, then studying abroad is probably perfect for you. The deadline to study abroad next semester is October 15, so start planning now. “All students in good standing, with the approval of their departmental chair and the LIU Post Campus Director of Study Abroad, are eligible for study abroad after one full-time semester at Post,” says Seaman.
If being away for a semester doesn’t sound like something that you want to do, remember that Post offers many winter and summer sessions abroad as well. Don’t hesitate to go see Seaman at the study abroad office, in the Winnick House, Room 221, and pretty soon you’ll be on your way to the best adventure of your life!

To some, living in dorms is an experience they have been dreading. The thought of having to share a room with one or two others, perhaps strangers, may seem uncomfortable. The showers are just about small enough for the whole shower curtain to stick to your body. Everyone in the crowded bathrooms can hear you urinate in the morning. There is no way of cooking your own meals. Occasionally you will not have to stand more than 30 minutes in line at Winnick. Only a couple of the dormitories have air-conditioning.
For many, this is also their first time living away from home. Expectations really have everything to do with how you are going to thrive. Expecting the dorms to be just like your room at home will be too much to ask. It is often wise to not set a standard, so you are not easily disappointed. We all have hopes and fears when moving in, but living in the dorms can be one of the most positive things about going to college. It is how you get the whole experience; you live within walking distance of your friends and classes, write on each other’s whiteboards, go out to eat, party, and just sit around having a good time together. There is always a lot of help to receive if you live on campus, whether it is school or socially related. It is a place where we meet people who become some of our closest friends.
If you ever find yourself sitting around being helplessly bored, you are doing something wrong. There is always something to do around campus. You just might have to make some effort to take advantage of the opportunities. Buy a basketball to use the outside courts. Get playing cards and invite people over. You can go to the Pratt Center for a workout, and rent equipment with your ID card. Whether you enjoy working out or not, there are so many opportunities in there to make exercising fun. You can go swimming or running, and play basketball, tennis, soccer and so on. Another source of social activity can be joining a club, or make your own if they do not offer any of your interest. Fraternities and sororities are available on campus if Greek life is something you are attracted to. If you want, you can also go to the Hillwood Art Museum or use the student discount to see shows at the Tilles Center.
Living only 50 minutes away from Manhattan, you should also take advantage of the opportunity to go there whenever you feel like it. The school shuttle takes you to the Hicks-ville train station, where the Long Island Railroad takes you to NYC. Whatever you do, do not waste these wonderful years. They will go by so fast.

“It’s not about being a twin, it’s about being a family,” said Adina Oditt, TWIce as Nice Public Relations Coordinator, about LIU Post’s new club,. The first meeting was held in the Pioneer Room in Hillwood Commons on Thursday, September 20, at 5 p.m.
“When we heard about how many twins are on cam¬pus, we thought we needed to start a club,” said Bria-Letã Greene, twin and co-president of TWIce as Nice. Some letters in TWIce as Nice are written in capitals purposely, according to the club’s Executive Board, because the capital letters spell out twin. The Executive Board of TWIce as Nice consists of Co-Presidents and twins Bria-Letã and Tia-Monã Greene, Co-Vice Presidents Natasha Dunbar and Ivanna Fortunado, twins Adina Oditt, Public Relations Coordinator, and Serena Oditt, Secretary, Treasurer Denell German, and Special Events Planner Con¬nor Carey, who has a twin that does not attend LIU Post.
Tia-Monã Greene explained that it was at the ACP club that the board members became good friends. “That club got re¬ally close over the [last] year,” stated Greene, “because we all stayed in the club and went to every meeting, and now that club – we’re like one big family. And, that’s another reason we started this, because we wanted to bring the whole campus really close, like a family.”
The E-Board, who has two and a half sets of twins, ex¬presses that the club is not only for students who have twins, but it is also open to students who wish they had twins, as well as students who just have friends and are looking to make more. “We started [the club] together,” said Dunbar, “because it’s not only about twins. I thought I would feel just as good and welcome to be a part of the club.”
The club’s E-Board began the first meeting with a few ice¬breakers, beginning with facts about “twinning,” like the fact that conceiving twins does not skip a generation and that there are approximately 20 students at Post who have a twin that does not attend the school. The group’s membership consists of approximately 20 students, containing two sets of twins, two other members that are twins but their twin does not attend LIU Post, and a student who is one in a set of quintuplets. They then segued into a game where the club’s E-Board and members participated. During the game, you could feel the initial nervousness of new¬comers evaporate.
“The club’s actually cool and upbeat,” said Jessy Pierre, club member and non-twin. “The club has a lot of activities planned and it’s interesting.” 
During the meeting, the E-Board for TWIce as Nice announced many upcoming events planned for this year, and others it wishes to plan with help from the other members. The club has planned twin obstacle courses, where you must complete the obstacle course while being tied to your partner; campus twin day, where friends can dress alike and come to the club for photos and souvenirs; twin Q & A, where people can ask twins questions about being a twin; speed dating; a male auction; and a snow ball, a formal event where the E-Board, along with other organizations, will host a ball for students, and more. The E-Board was also open to some events that members suggested during the meeting such as a scavenger hunt, a car wash fundraiser, and a murder mystery. Dates for these events soon to be disclosed. 
“The club appealed to me because it has a sense of community,” said member Shannon McCarthy, whose twin is also a member of the club, “I enjoy being able to share our special bond [as twins] and meet others on campus.” McCarthy added that she was really ex¬cited for the club and its up¬coming events. TWIce as Nice meets on Thursdays at 5 p.m. in the Pioneer Room in Hillwood Commons. For more information, you can contact the TWIce as Nice E-Board for more information at twiceasnice77@gmail.com.

The CEO of Muse Games, an indie development studio located in New York City, was a guest speaker for the Game Industry class on campus. Howard Tsao gave a lecture to the aspiring game developer students on the challenges of the industry. 
He discussed topics including marketing, adapting games to different systems like iOS and Stream (an online video game market website), partnerships, finding inspiration, how to reach out to the online community, and when to release games into the market. 
One of the main points of the presentation was to express the mistakes and failures of the business. Mr. Tsao stated that you must expect things not to go as planned and some ideas and plans to possibly end up blowing up in your face. One example he made was when they introduced a multiplayer option on one of the games and it ended up having problems, which had to be patched up after receiving a lot of complains from players. 
Another thing he expressed to the students was that more ports are not always a good thing. Having your game on every website or platform leads to tons of maintenance and version updating issues that could soon be out of your control. The fewer platforms you use, the better, in Tsao’s opinion. 
Muse is currently working on a new upcoming project that will soon be available on Steam called Guns of Icarus Online. It is a team-based, post-apocalyptic and steampunk themed, multiplayer shooter that involves controlling airships and engaging in combat against other players. There will be three different classes (player options) to use: the engineer, the gunner and captain, which each have different tasks to maintain the ship. The game will have two modes to play, which are skirmish and adventure. The game is set to be released this fall. 
Muse Games has eight employees, which includes interns, with only one room to act as their workplace. Unlike larger companies, there is no chain of command. The group works together, combining ideas on a limited budget but with a goal to focus on games first before the profit, according to Tsao. One of Muse’s most popular games is “CreaVures,” a platformer game. This is a game that involves side-scrolling and jumping puzzles with stunning 3D graphics. It won the Independent Propeller Award for Best Mobile Game and is currently available on Steam and the Mac App Store. 
Tsao ended his presentation with saying that promoting is usually better than relaying on publishers and distributors that you will have to make contracts with. Using programs like “Kickstarter,” an online pledge system to help small companies raise money for creative projects and making key giveaways are ways to reach out to the online community. Also, aspiring game developers should learn to experiment with different kind of themes, mechanics, and ideas, to make your vision come to life. 
After the lecture, Courtney Aiello, a sophomore video game design major, said that Mr. Tsao, “had some valid points and it was nice that he showed some of their failures.” Tsao concluded with one last piece of advice: “If you have an idea, try to push that idea.”

LIU Post’s chapter of the NAACP is ready for a new semester with conversations and heated discussions about controversial topics. Racism and diversity were discussed during the organization’s first meeting on Tuesday, September 18, in Hillwood Commons. 
Every Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the Cinema in Hillwood Commons, the NAACP will host events touching on difficult topics in the college community. The first one was devoted to cultural diversity and racism, and the discussion at times reached a heated level, with freshmen and upperclassmen coming together and sharing their experiences. 
“I believe it is imperative for newcomers and freshmen to have someone to talk to, because it helps them feel more accepted in a new environment,” said NAACP President, senior Sociology major Ara McPherson. “I also wanted them to know it is okay to step out of one’s comfort zone and try new things.”
The NAACP is a National African-American civil rights movement that was founded in 1909. LIU Post’s chapter of NAACP’s Youth and College Division confronts various issues affecting people of all races, religions, and backgrounds. The NAACP members actively strive to be leaders and trendsetters on cam¬pus and in the classroom, by reaching out to the surrounding campus community. 
The first meeting had a crowd of 15 in addition to the eight in the board who hosted the event. McPherson was satisfied with the first event, and liked the fact that everybody present got a chance to give his or her opinion without being judged. She further explained that finding an arena where students can be open and honest is often difficult in large college communities, and often the newcomers have difficult issues and questions they want to share. “These kinds of meetings allow them to understand that many of their fellow students have the same issues, and can make it easier to for them to adapt,” McPherson said. 
From Scandinavia to China to South America, the diversity at LIU Post is broad. Roommates from foreign countries were mentioned among the students, and the variety of opinions was wide-ranging. Some said it is hard to adapt to foreign roommates, while others claimed international students are the best roommates. The group also discussed what is, and what is not okay for a room¬mate to do. Where should we draw the line? Students shared stories from almost being poisoned by their roommate to a sweetest roommate who brought cookies from home every Monday. 
The different views on certain topics are exactly what the NAACP and McPherson want to highlight for the college community. “I hope the meetings can provide a better insight on culture, campus, and life issues. I also hope the meeting can be a vessel to bring the students at LIU Post a little closer and to gain more understanding of the cultural differences we face in our campus society,” said McPherson. 
Moving forward, the NAACP has some upcoming events planned. HIV/AIDS, the presidential campaign, and how music and media affects us, are some of the topics laid out for this semester. The meetings are held in a conversational way, by the executive board of the organization. The group values all students’ opinions and encourage participation. All students are welcome, and no membership required.
