Now that summer is over and it is officially fall, it is time to put the shorts and flip-flops away. The change in weather means there is a change in the clothes we wear, the trends we see, and the drinks we find to be popular at Starbucks.
For those who try to stay fashion forward, it’s important to know what’s trendy this season. “Fall is the best time for fashion,” said Monica Peralta, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “It is just starting to cool down; you can layer, layer, and layer, without looking weather confused.”
“There are a lot of fun new trends this fall. Shift dresses, sock boots, pajama dressing, patchwork, and new Victorian pussy bows are the hottest trends right now,” said Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “This season we are seeing a lot of fringe, a lot of burgundy, and a lot of suede,” Peralta added.
“The color I’ve seen everywhere and a color that I really like is olive green,” said Jawaan Smith, a senior Arts Management major. “From pants to jackets, it’s a great color.” While there are new trends every season, some trends are timeless. Fringe, military style, layering, neutrals, velvet, and bohemian are just a few of the trends that will be carried over from years before, this fall, according to Bray.
Fashion for men tends to be overlooked, however, both Bray and Peralta made sure to include trends that men can totally rock this fall. “They should focus on layering,” Bray said. “3⁄4 zip sweaters, a button down under with a skinny scarf and a vest.”
“We are also seeing a lot of Monochrome happening,” Peralta added. “Which is super easy to pull off.”
Fall, to some, is also known as the season of pumpkin spice everything. Starbucks officially has their famous pumpkin spice latte back for the season. “I have yet to fall under the magical spell this pumpkin spice has put every girl in the world under,” Peralta said.
“Pumpkin spice kind of unofficially announces the beginning of the fall season,” Smith said. Bray agreed, but added, “Pumpkin spice isn’t bad, but I think there’s too much hype. A classic chai latte and caramel macchiato will do the job just fine,” she said.
To help those who don’t understand fashion trends, Bray and Peralta both gave some of their “must haves” for the season. The boyfriend jean, over the knee boots, plaid scarves, black booties, turtle neck sweaters, and duster coats are some of Peralta’s recommendations for women this season. Bucket bags, velvet booties, and fringe skirts are a few of Bray’s must haves this season.
For men, Peralta suggests: joggers, khaki denim, light denim, wool topcoats, chukka boots, bomber jackets, and brown leather sneakers. “Everyone must get their hands on a pair of beige Nike Air Max Thea Leather Sneakers and Adidas classic superstar sneakers,” said Bray. Smith suggests that everyone should own a pair of black jeans, colored pants (burgundy, navy, olive), and brown boots.
“Every season is a great season for fashion. You make it the way you want it to be,” Bray said. “There are limitless amount of options to wear in the fall. Personally, it’s my favorite time of the year to dress up.”

It doesn’t matter if you think Americans should or should not own a gun; what matters are the facts.
According to the ‘Every Town Research Organization,’ an organization “dedicated to understanding and reducing gun violence in America,” there have been an estimated 142 gun-related incidents on school campuses alone, since the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2014.
That’s an average of one school shooting per week.
Not to mention, there were 216 people killed in Chicago just in the first half of 2015. According to Megan Crepeau’s article published on The Chicago Tribune website, more than 65% of these homicides were gun related (July 1).
Perhaps this is just one of the many reasons why Chicago has earned itself the nickname “Chiraq.” According to Michael Thompsons WND article entitled, “Chicago Murders Top Afghanistan Death Toll,” published on Jan 16, 2013, between the years 2003 and 2011, 4,797 Americans have been murdered, compared from 2001 to present day, 2,166 Americans have lost their lives in Iraq.
That being said, America is at a crossroads regarding gun control, and management of firearms. On the one hand, guns are a staple of American culture. Without guns, the Revolutionary War would have just been another failed uprising you read about; an uprising where the side with guns, in this case the British, suppressed the people of colonial America since they were too ungrateful to pay taxes to the mother country. What’s the “Wild Wild West” without a revolver? Heck, who’s Buffalo Bill? Without a gun, he would probably be your weird neighbor who moved to South Africa to hunt big game.
You get the point, but there’s a bigger point to be made. The tool that helped forge America into the greatest country in the world is now tearing us apart. According to Every Town, the murder rate regarding
a gun is a whopping 20 times higher than that of all other developed countries.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013, “firearms (excluding BB and pellet guns) were used in 84,258 non-fatal injuries (26.65 per 100,000 U.S. citizens) 11,208 deaths by homicide (3.5 per 100,000), 21,175 by suicide with a firearm. 1.3% of all deaths that year were caused by a gun, both registered and non-registered.” We find ourselves blaming the mentally ill for these mass shootings, but the people we really should be blaming are ourselves.
I will tell you, I am pro-gun. I believe Americans should be fully entitled to their right to bear arms. Guns are essential for self-defense, but also, for sport, such as hunting or skeet shooting. However, I will also tell you I am totally against an American purchasing an AR-15 semi automatic assault rifle at a gun show in South Carolina, with no questions asked.
I believe every gun should be registered, on both the federal and state levels. I believe if an individual wants to own a gun, he or she must pass a mandatory physiological exam, take a mandatory gun safety course, re-register the weapon every 5 years, and yes, be forthcoming if there is a mentally-disturbed individual taking up the same residence.
Now, should there be restrictions on what type of gun an American should be permitted to own? Well, I believe that is relative. For example, if you live in suburban Suffolk County, where the largest threat is a rouge lawn mower, then no, you are not entitled to own a semi-automatic (or automatic) rifle.
However, if you live on the Texas-Mexico border where Mexican gangs and drug cartels cross over daily, often carrying an AK-47 or AR-15, then, I believe American citizens should have the right to bear a semi-automatic weapon (Rifle) of the same caliber in the name of self-defense.
In the Second World War, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto of the Japanese Naval fleet once warned the Emperor of Japan that, “If we (Japan) were to ever invade America, there would be a rifle behind a blade of grass.”
Times have changed; we no longer have to protect ourselves from foreign invasion, but rather our children when they go to school. Therefore, we should make it a priority that weapons such as guns stay in the hands of the responsible, and out of the hands of criminals, and whoever else is not fit to own one.

Our generation seems to have a lack of interest in politics; only 45 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds voted in 2012, according to statistics from the US census Bureau.
This shows that less than half of first time voters actually vote, which isn’t a lot if you think about the vast number of people in this age bracket. Have times changed from when our grandparents could actually make change by protesting through the streets of Manhattan? I think they have.
In 2014, there was a ‘free Palestine’ march outside the Israeli embassy in London at which 15,000 protesters, many of them between the age bracket above, attended to voice their disgust in the unjust bombings and killings of innocent civilians by the IDF in occupied Palestine. In this huge protest throughout London, which disrupted many public transportation routes, the BBC only aired the protest in a one minute bulletin.
The constant violence and political problems in Gaza and the West Bank are still as treacherous as ever. This is not a new problem; there have been hundreds, if not thousands of protests that haven’t been covered or that haven’t gained any action from political parties.
If our generation is going to try and voice their political views or their worries about societal matters, for them just to be snubbed and chucked aside by the leaders of their country, then what hope should we hold for any change at all?
I believe that it isn’t our “laziness,” or “lack of interest” in current affairs, but mostly down to the ignorance of the puppets in charge of making change in the world. Many of us young adults just don’t think we can make a difference when it comes to our opinion on politics, so why vote? Although I strongly believe in the naivety of leaders, and their obstinacy not to listen to our generation’s thoughts and worries, I still think it is crucial for us all to keep informed about current affairs and politics around the world, whether this be for our classes at school, or just for general knowledge.
It’s important for us all to understand what is going on in the world that we live in, and most importantly in the countries we live: when the election is, what battles America is in, who’s going to be the next president?
These are types of things I think that all of us here at Post should take interest in, even if you don’t think it’s needed because no one cares what you think. The reason keeping in touch with politics is so important is simply because politics dictate everything!
It’s behind the college shootings that are happening all the time; should guns be made illegal? It’s behind all the lives that are lost in war; should we have gone into Iraq? It’s behind the recent legalization of cannabis in some states; should it be legal?
These are just some of the huge social changes that have, or are, affecting us all, and we should know some of the answers and debates behind then. Many of these issues will affect our lives in the future! There are some many easy ways that we can all just catch up on a little bit of politics and important events.
For example, there is a New York Times on every newspaper stand around school. If you haven’t ever seen a newspaper stand around school, I would be worried. They are the black rack things with paper stacks on them…not too hard to find.
Although newspapers can seem daunting, you don’t have to read the whole thing; maybe you could just learn one thing a day? That means, by Friday you have learned about five different political issues, problems and situations that are going on in the world. So easy!
Another simple way to stay informed is to just looking stuff up online! We all have electronic devices. All phones and iPads are capable of downloading apps, or searching on the Internet. Use these amazing resources to further your knowledge and interest in political matters.
Going to different lectures or groups around campus will really help increase your knowledge in politics. And by showing just an ounce of interest in the politics that run your life, you will be so surprised at how many conversations you can join into, as well as the self-confidence to speak about something other than how many tequila shots you had on the weekend. Give it a go!

Picture this: you and a group of friends decide to go out for dinner on a Friday night. You all haven’t seen each other in quite some time, and feel the need to catch up. As soon as you’re seated at a booth, someone pulls out his or her phone, then another person. Eventually, you’re the only person not on your phone, so you decide to check your texts too; why not? Now, all of you are so wrapped up in social media and texting, no one is actually speaking to each other.
Unfortunately, this isn’t an uncommon scenario. Technology has taken over our generation and become something that interferes with our daily lives.
Smart Phones, iPads, laptops and iPods are some of our constant companions just to name a few. Technology, though seemingly wonderful and helpful, has taken the place of friends and real conversation. It also has stunted our ability to socialize face-to-face, without us even noticing or caring much.
Thirty LIU Post students with varying majors and ages were surveyed in an independent study made by The Pioneer, and 22 of them said they believe that techology is more hurtful than helpful to our generation. The other eight did not see the harm in technology.
Kylie Garrett, a junior Broadcasting major, admitted to being dependent on her cell phone. “I’ve never been without it for as long as I can remember; it’s just what I’m used to,” Garrett said. She added that friendships would be stronger without the meddling of technology because we tend to lack the desire to be entertained by friends in person.
Katelyn Cotto, a sophomore Dance major, agreed, saying, “We get so caught up in technology that we tend to forget about our surroundings.”
I personally use my phone throughout the day and find myself surprised, and frankly disappointed, each time new technology is introduced. It’s as if there’s always a new technological craze for people to obsess over, especially college students. Sometimes I think the world would be a happier, less crazy place without it all.

We envision life to only exist in our world. Whether it’s cultivating in our oceans, swimming in our currents, growing on our land, or inhabiting our lives, life is prevalent in every turn.
However, what if life existed beyond our world, beyond our atmosphere, further away than we could ever fathom? Would you believe it? Prepare to be amazed because planet Earth may not be the only planet sustaining life.
Enter Mars: one of the key planets in every alien invasion movie to come across the big screen. For many living organisms, it’s essential to our existence to have a constant water source on this planet we call Earth.
In NASA’s most-recent discoveries, it has been found that there is “liquid water” that “…flows on the surface of Mars,” according to Loren Grush’s, The Verge article entitled, “We’ve found water on Mars, but finding life still won’t be easy,” (Sept. 30).
Grush delves into NASA’s recent findings of water streams on Mars, which have sparked eager excitement throughout the world. If you’re wondering why everyone is so excited the answer is quite simple: where there’s water, there is potential for life! Thus, sparking the ques- tion, do you believe in aliens or life elsewhere?
“It’s scary to think about,” said senior Public Relations major, Julie Abbruzzese. “Living in a world where you feel like you’re the center of the whole universe, it’s like, how can it be possible to have other life out there?” like life isn’t what it seems, that we as a species, or any other species that prospers on our planet, are so insignificant compared to the potential of what’s out there.
No matter how small or how large, the concept of life being sustained anywhere else is shocking in itself. According to Grush, any life on Mars will most likely be microorganisms, but that doesn’t mean these findings aren’t significant. This is a BIG deal. Didn’t we start out that small? Weren’t we just as tiny?
“I believe there is life out there,” Tina Schwartz, senior Adolescent Education major, said. “I am not at all surprised it’s on Mars, I feel like it has been a long time coming hearing this news. I wouldn’t be surprised if whenever NASA does on land Mars with whatever special machines they want to use, that it would be something that none of us will ever be able to comprehend.”
It’s hard to imagine that Earth isn’t the only planet with inhabitants. Perhaps these water streams found on Mars will lead us into a discovery that can change the world. According to Grush, whatever they may find, may not be anything that we’ve ever seen before.
Whatever the case may be, NASA is going on this mission with high hopes, determined to search for potential life, the only thing stopping them is they don’t even know where to start. All we can do is wait in anticipation while NASA, along with other countries and their space programs, work together and send their probes to the big red planet. One can only hope that whatever life is out there, that they come in peace.

As a part of the university’s 60th Anniversary festivities over Homecoming Weekend, late night host and Saturday Night Live alum, Seth Meyers, graced the Tilles Center Mainstage to perform stand-up comedy on Friday, Oct. 9.
Meyers is most well known for his 13-year stint at Studio 8H; for eight of those years, he sat behind the coveted “Weekend Update” desk.
Meyers co-anchored with notable Saturday Night alum, Amy Poehler, for two seasons before he was given the privilege to be the sole anchor in the sketch. It was here that the comic made a name for himself in the entertainment world, gaining enough traction in the eyes of the White House to be invited as the keynote speaker for the Correspondents’ Association Dinner in 2011.
Meyer’s recalled this experience in his act on Friday night, applauding his own performance as the speaker. He told the audience that his keynote speech, which was given on a Saturday, would be all over
the Monday news – if it hadn’t been for the successful mission completion by SEAL Team 6 in assassinating Osama Bin Laden that Sunday.
He joked that Obama knew “Monday would belong to Seth Meyers,” so the president plotted an even bigger stunt to steal his thunder. “I think I was the only American who was disappointed that we had shot bin Laden,” he joked.
The rest of Meyer’s set was a hit with audience, as he seamlessly mixed his thoughts on current events with his own personal anecdotes.
He touched on the presidential primaries, obviously naming the media circus that is Donald Trump. He likened the candidate to “a chimp with a switch blade duct taped to his hand,” and how this bravado would intimidate anyone else running.
He also talked about the potentiality of a second Clinton presidency, setting a role-reversal scene for the audience. “Could you imagine Hillary coming home from a day at work? Bill would ask her how her day was, and she’d respond, ‘it was hard…not sleep-with-an-intern hard, but difficult. I just worked my stress out on the treadmill.’”
Meyer’s also discussed domestic policy issues that Americans are apathetic about. President Obama has held a fervent stand on both climate change and gun control in America, and Meyer’s stated that “if a tornado were to form and somehow swoop up every gun in this country, and it would start shooting everything, causing irreparable damage, Americans would still find a way to blame it on gay marriage.”
He talked about the refugee crisis in Europe, as well as the inability of the countries to come to an economic agreement, comparing it to trying to make brunch plans with friends. Meyer’s mentioned that he had lived in Europe for two years – specifically in Amsterdam. “If you live in Amsterdam long enough, you’ll notice that you slowly turn into Matthew McConaughey.”
One bit that had the audience hunched over in laughter was Meyer’s demonstration of the cycle of emotions one goes through while waiting for a picture to be taken, only to realize moments later that they had been recorded the whole time.
Another segment involved Meyer’s interest in video games, and how the advent of Xbox Live had ruined the hobby for him since he had come to the conclusion that he was worse than 12-year-olds. From this he found a Segway to discuss his own experiences as a 12-year-old boy, declaring that when he was growing up kids his age had to work harder to “get off,” deeming that this had helped developed his generation’s work ethic – their “stick-to-itiveness” (pun, intended).
He let the audience in on some other fond memories from his life, one being his appearance at a baseball game where he had been invited to sing during the seventh inning stretch. He acted all big before his performance, only to confess that he had forgotten the lyrics to “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” as soon as he took the field.
He also admitted that while he’s drunk that he’s “prone to sarcasm” – this funny flaw, he said, earned him a punch in the face in a Vegas nightclub. He talked of his relationship with his wife, and even delivered some stand-up from her perspective. One of his favorite things to do with her is mess with her Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: “I will never get bored,” he said.
Meyer’s concluded his stand-up by sharing some jokes that didn’t pass the censors for Late Night, all of which were a hit with the show-goers. His energized and obligated presence on stage was well received and similar to the stature he brought to the “Update” desk – an amiable yet informed funnyman.

Last week, LIU Post was fortunate enough to receive a visit from an alumnus who is proud to follow his dreams. Derrick Davis, who graduated in 2000, is now playing the roles of Mufasa and Scar in Disney’s “The Lion King” on Broadway. During his visit to LIU Post, Davis gave a lecture to various students, and focused not only on what stage presence can be defined as, but also on how he achieved his role on Broadway.
Davis’ way up to the top of the Lion King production started in 2009 when he was in the Las Vegas ensemble and understudied the role of Mufasa. After receiving the role of Mufasa as an understudy, the production crew asked him to go on the tour and play the role of Mufasa, which he did for several months. In 2012, they asked him to come to New York to cover both roles.
Davis is the second person in the show’s 18-year history to cover the roles of both Mufasa and Scar. “You have to be a specific individual to go back [and] forth in-between both roles’ energies at the drop of a hat,” Davis said. “It takes a lot of work, a lot of discipline, and they saw that in me and I am very grateful for it.”
Davis shared a few important tips to the LIU Post students. “I think it’s important for you to be able to see the strengths and the weaknesses of somebody who is successful,” Davis said, as he showed the audience how nervous he gets when talking on a stage. “Because you need to be able to see that just because I’ve made it to a certain place doesn’t mean that I don’t have struggles.”
Davis believes that stage presence is very important when trying to transform into a character. “…there has to be life in order for there to be presence,” Davis said.
He believes that while you are in college, it is the best time to decide what works best for you. “Everybody learns, everybody processes, everybody behaves and acts different from the other person so it’s up to you to figure that out,” he said.
Davis didn’t start working for The Lion King until 2009. From 2000 and 2009, he said that he auditioned for multiple shows. He realized that auditioning is a completely different process than performing. “When I auditioned for The Lion King coming out of college, I didn’t do well at all,” said Davis. “I was a good performer but I wasn’t good at auditioning.”
In Davis’ experience through auditions, he did not have much income. Because of this, he decided to work two jobs. One job was at a church and the other was for State Farm insurance. “I took a few years off to pay off my debts,” he said.
“But then my heart started to beat again, in a way, saying ‘listen this is what you were designed to do, it’s not just what you want to do it’s what you must do it’s your calling in life.’ So I went back to the vocal and acting coaches and then I auditioned for The Lion King again and it was the right time and it just happened.”
Davis was inspired to pursue this career at a young age. His inspiration developed when he watched The Secret Garden. “I was in awe. I was like, ‘I want to perform, I want to do that,’ ” Davis said. “At the time I wasn’t processing it as I want to create emotion but that feeling is what was happening on the inside and so I went home and told my parents I wanted to be an actor.”
When asked what he wished he did differently as a student, Davis said he wish he was braver. “Now is the time and here is the place to be as daring and as brave as you can,” he said. “Be completely fearless, so what if you fall? It doesn’t matter. I learned that the only thing that stops me is me. You guys can do and be anything you want the world is literally yours, nothing is impossible unless you call it impossible “
As a performer, knowing how to sing, dance, and act is very important, but Davis claims that it’s also very important to know which talent is your strongest and which one is your weakest. “Know all three but know your strengths and play to your strengths,” Davis said.
Davis believes that it’s extremely important to challenge yourself during college, “Let your professors push you, let them stretch you, this is your season, this is your now, this is your present so be present in your present,” he said.
“Exhaust your present, draw everything out you can out now, tomorrow will take care of itself, and then when you get out of here its going to be a different chapter of your life, but don’t worry so much about that now cause then you will be stealing from today. “
When asked what gives him motivation to get through the tough times of this career, Davis said it was the love for the craft he creates is what motivated him to keep going. “What gives me permission to be motivated is that I have made a decision that at some point of my career I am not going to want to continue do this,” he said.
“I am going to want to slow down and do something else. Maybe open up my school of music and give to the next generation what I ‘ve learned and that gives me the permission to push myself really hard now because once I decide it’s done, I’ve done it all.”
Sean Collins, from LIU Advancement, planned the event. “Part of what the university advancement group does is to engage alumni in all parts of the university by asking them to come back to school to speak to students to be mentors to connect students with internships and job opportunities,” he said. “It’s always great to have a bigger crowd, but it was great turnout and all the students were really engaged with what he had to say.”
Students seemed to enjoy the event very much. Junior Dance major, Rhaamell Bulke, claims Davis was very inspiring.
“Honestly, it was inspiring. Especially as a performer here at Post, it was something that I really needed to hear, wanted to hear, and accepted,” he said. “Our professors know the preparation and how to get into the business, but coming from someone like this; he is in it, he is doing it, so it’s awesome to hear what he has to say so I can apply it to my life now. So when I go to auditions I can land that job.”

Last Spring, the College of Arts, Communications and Design (then called SVPA) developed new efforts to create collaborative networks among art students on campus. A Dean’s Student Advisory Committee was created, opening up a sounding board for ideas to flow upwards from the student base to department heads and Dean Zahler himself. At the Assembly for the Arts, representatives from each department within the CACD discussed as a group ways in which to network and build in-roads among the artistically inclined on campus.
Now, in perhaps the most ambitious cross-department collaborative effort, senior Arts Management major, Hannah Fitch is unveiling the Festival of the Arts — an honors thesis, and honors conference for this year.
“It’s basically a celebration of the arts on campus,” explained Fitch. “To celebrate each art entity that we have at LIU Post and to show that we are a very strong arts community.” The festival will be taking place campus-wide on Oct. 16, 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and will feature a myriad of arts events, talks and showings to enjoy. The event has its own Facebook page and fliers have been distributed on campus and through LIU email.
“There is going to workshops, presentations, lectures, performances. There is a PCDC performance and then the [Post Theater Company] Venus show that night, which is nice,” said Fitch.
“There are art shows and professional panels, people coming in from outside of school. Actually, professionals from the Walter Finley Gallery in New York City, which is one of the oldest galleries there is. So they are going to do a presentation. There is also a food historian who is coming in at night to compare art to food, which is pretty cool, and you wouldn’t think of that.”
Fitch began brainstorming ideas for her thesis last February. She realized that such a project had not been tackled before at LIU Post. “From there is spiraled into what it is now,” continued Fitch. “Barbara Applegate is my thesis advisor and she’s been wonderful in helping me prepare for this. I’ve gotten support from the Dean and the new CACD. Of course the Honors Program is on board.” Applegate is the museum director for the Steinberg Museum.
The day is meant to unify artists on campus, and spread knowledge of the arts on campus — Fitch stressing that this is a collaborative effort. In the organizational phase, Fitch contacted the CACD Dean, and from there was able to cooperate with individual department heads who rallied students and assets to join in.
“Previously I had never, ever seen a student film. So that’s why I’m excited to go and see what that work is about. And people don’t even know what the Arts Management major is about, so there is a student panel, students talking about what it really is to be an arts manager.”
Up next, Fitch has big plans to travel to Denmark. “I’m going [there] to set up a video installation exhibition for professor Benjamin Gerdes, one of the media professors on campus,” she said. Fitch landed the project after being contacted by Gerdes, who was seeking a curatorial assistant.
“I’ve been contacting artists from around the world trying to culminate this exhibition,” continued Fitch. “Video isn’t something I am completely familiar with, so it’s nice to explore a new discipline. I really like it so far, and I get to spend ten days in Copenhagen!” Following graduation, Fitch hopes to attend graduate school for a Masters degree in Art History. She plans to become an art museum curator.

After spending most of its second season hovering between renewal and cancellation due to low ratings, Sleepy Hollow has been re-booted, once again capturing the magic of the first season when Ichabod Crane was resurrected after 250 years.
When Sleepy Hollow concluded its second season last February, the final episode served as a potential series finale. Two main characters were killed off, and the bulk of the main story was wrapped up with the surviving main characters going off into the unknown.
Season three picked up six months after the events of season two’s finale. As the episode opened on Oct. 1, we were introduced to our new villain, Pandora. This mystical creature effortlessly defeated the Headless Horseman, using her box of chaos to absorb him and create a new creature. It’s only a matter of time before our main characters and the television audience confront a new threat to the quiet hamlet of Sleepy Hollow.
After last season’s events, Abigail Mills has left the Sleepy Hollow Sheriff’s Station and is now an FBI agent, pursuing a career she put on hold after discovering she and Crane are Witnesses, individuals who must stop the apocalypse.
The chemistry between Tom Mison and Nicole Beharie is outstanding. Since season one, their friendship has only increased, as different characters have entered the storyline.
Crane and Abbie become immersed in the investigation of two mysterious deaths and soon discover that evil has returned to Sleepy Hollow.
The arrival of Pandora triggers the second of seven tribulations in their mission against evil. When Ichabod and Abbie return to the old archives, they catch up with Abbie’s sister, Jenny and discover the location of the secret to destroying Pandora’s monsters. The location of the secret is a general store called Colonial Times.
Another strength of Sleepy Hollow is the show’s ability to constantly create situations that play on Crane’s Rip Van Wrinkle syndrome, having him make fun of modern technology and behavior.
For this season premiere, it was having him visit a restaurant with a Colonial era theme, and feeling right at home. He even reprimanded a worker who was wearing a tri-corner hat the wrong way. This gave a nice humorous tone to an episode foreboding more evil for Sleepy Hollow.
Eventually Ichabod, Abbie, and Jenny discover the demon’s weakness and devise a trap to draw it in. In the ensuing fight with the creature, Abbie’s boss is injured but she succeeds in killing the creature while protecting Crane. After the demon’s defeat, the two Witnesses are kicking back in a bar when Pandora appears and shows interest in Ichabod.
Season three of Sleepy Hollow is off to a good start. After removing several troublesome characters, the action and the show’s main story arc once again focuses on the core characters and their mission as Witnesses.
New episodes of Sleepy Hollow air on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. on Fox.

Coming off a loss against Adelphi University, the Pioneers looked to bounce back when they welcome Lindenwood University to Pioneer Country. The non-conference matchup featured three total goals, but it was the Pioneers who claimed the 2-1 victory.
After a scoreless first half, the Pioneers got on the board first on a tally from freshman forward Emily Miller. About 10 minutes later, senior forward, Keliann Margiotta, followed Miller’s goal with one of her own, doubling the LIU advantage. Lindenwood added a goal later in the contest and nearly tied the game at two, but junior goal keeper Ericka Parks kept the visitors at bay.
The Pioneers are back at it on Wednesday, Oct. 14, when they travel to play Southern Connecticut State University. Game time is set for 6 p.m.

Everyday, Post students stroll along the sidewalks of campus en route to class. Recently, our normal daily walks to class have been inter- rupted by interesting new contraptions that a handful of students are zooming by on. These aren’t bikes or skateboards, but something new.
Churchill Okorie, a sophmore Health Science major, said these new ride buddies go by many names, but are often recognized as Sky- Walkers.
They look like little hover boards, often with colorful lights. They’re big enough to fit underneath the rider’s feet, and are similar in shape to a skateboard. But unlike skateboards, these new inventions re- quire no push, or energy from the rider. They do all the moving for you!
However, SkyWalkers are not cheap. Okorie purchased his Sky- Walker for $360. “It’s small in size, which allows me to carry it on the bus or train,” he said.
The price of the transportation method varies, depending on the brand, according to numerous websites, such as skywalkerusa.com and the levelboards.com. One version of the SkyWalker is called a Level Board. The Level Board can be purchased online, and cost $500.
On SkywalkerUsa.com, it is stated that the SkyWalkers can go reach the speed of 10 mph. The site also states that it is not recommend- ed to use the boards in inclement weather. The SkyWalkers can support up to 300 pounds and is said to be an “effortless experience,” according to the same website.
Students have mixed opinions about moving around campus in this manner. Katharina Muniz, a senior Dance major, feels that these boards are unnecessary and dangerous. “I think they’re a safety hazard to the rider if they’re not fully paying attention,” Muniz said. “They’re also a safety hazard to the people surrounding them because if that per- son falls off it could cause injury not only to the rider but others as well.”

On Saturday, Oct. 10, the men’s soccer team played a double overtime game against Post University and finished with a 1-1 tie. After a scoreless 45 minutes, the Pioneers got on the board first in the 67th minute. Sophomore midfielder, Harry Pearse, sent a lead pass to sophomore forward, Jason Lampkin, who beat the keeper to give LIU to the 1-0 lead.
However, the Eagles from Post University responded, and in the 83rd minute, scored on a header from a corner kick. In the overtime sessions, both teams had their opportunities, but neither was able to connect for a goal and the victory. The 1-1 score stood.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his team return to action on Saturday, Oct. 17, when they welcome Mercy College to LIU Post. Open- ing kick is set for 2:30 p.m.

The Pioneers served up a weekend set of games starting on Saturday, Oct. 10, against Daemen College from the Pratt Recreation Center.
The Pioneers came in with a four game winning streak, but that streak was snapped when Daemen outlasted the Pioneers in five sets. With the score knotted at two, and the victory just one set win away, Daemen and LIU went back and forth until Daemen scored eight out of ten points en route their 3-2 match win.
The Pioneers returned to the court on Sunday, Oct. 11, to play Roberts Wesleyan College. Perhaps eager to get back into the win column, the Pioneers dismantled Roberts Wesleyan in three sets. The team set the tone from the first set, as it dominated and won by a score of 2-11.
The next two sets went like the first one, as the Pioneers cruised to a 3-0 victory. Sophomore outside hitter, Danielle Rachel Londot, totaled nine kills to go along with six digs.
The Pioneers are back at it again on Thursday, Oct. 15, when they play Mercy College at their house. Game time is scheduled for 7 p.m.

After a first half filled with turnovers and miscues, the football team (4-2) turned the engines on and erupted with 20 unanswered points to open up the second half as they edged out Northeast-10 Conference foe, Merrimack College (2-4), 27-24, on Saturday, Oct. 10, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
Trailing 3-0 coming out of the break, junior quarterback Jeff Kidd and the Pioneers anchored a 10-play drive, resulting in their first points of the contest as he hooked up with red-shirt sophomore wide-out Kyle Ward for a 21-yard touchdown.
Things continued to pick up when junior defensive back Clarence Sears intercepted a pass off of Merrimack quarterback Nick Davis. LIU would keep the wheels rolling as Kidd connected with junior running back David White for a five-yard score, giving the hosts a 13-3 lead.
Shortly thereafter, red-shirt freshman running back Malik Pierre, found the end-zone once again for the Green and Gold on a 29-yard rush, extending the Pioneers advantage to 20-3 with 5:12 remaining in the third quarter.
However, the Warriors refused to go down without a fight, and made it a 20-17 game with 12:26 left in the contest. As the tides seemed to be turning, LIU struggled offensively, but came up with two critical third down conversions on the following possession to senior tight end Sean Binckes and red-shirt sophomore wide receiver James Higgins. Kidd and the offense finished the job as Hubbard caught a 20-yard touchdown at the 7:41 mark.
With just under four minutes to go, Merrimack scored again, narrowing LIU’s cushion to just three points. The Pioneer defense was clutch on the final two drives though, putting any comeback hopes to bed. Merrimack kicker Stephen Camarro missed the potential game-tying 51-yard field goal as time expired. Even with red-shirt senior linebacker Brandon Cheney sidelined due to an injury suffered earlier on in the game, other players stepped up and held their ground.
Red-shirt junior defensive lineman Kenny Scotland was a nuisance for Merrimack quarterback Nick Davis, recording two sacks and a pass deflection to go with his four tackles. Red-shirt junior line-backer Wayne Harris also looked sharp making 10 stops and one sack. Cheney collected eight tackles before leaving the game. Although Kidd’s struggles continued, the ground attack was strong as Pierre rushed for 97 yards on 20 carries.
With their third conference win under their belt, the Pioneers, led by Head Coach Bryan Collins, will travel to Pleasantville, N.Y. on Saturday, Oct. 17, to take on NE-10 rival Pace University. Kickoff is slated for noon.

The majority of LIU Post students either commute, or keep their cars on campus. With a total of 22 designated parking lots that can be found on the campus map, you would think parking is the last thing anyone would have to worry about. Yet, many students and faculty have either received a summons from Public Safety for parking improperly, or have found the available parking on campus to be inadequate.
The Office of Public Safety would not respond to questions about parking violations on campus, and referred inquiries to Barbara Mlawer, LIU Post’s Chief communications officer. She sent the Pioneer’s questions over to Kelly Walles, Associate Director of PR & Social Media Long Island University and replied with a response from Gale Haynes, LIU’s VO, and COO & Legal Counsel. “With over 3,400 parking spots open to students, there is ample parking for all,” Haynes said.
“However, many lots are under used (i.e. Gold lot) and consistently have empty spots throughout the day,” and “In the instance that a student or faculty member’s car receives a ticket and subsequent fine, failure to pay that fine might result in a security block, obtaining transcripts or receiving their Diploma until all fines are paid in full. Further administrative action can also result from non-payment of summons fines.”
Despite the ramifications to parking illegally on campus, people continue to do so.
There are a few parking lots around campus where people often park outside of the white lines, or in faculty spots, particularly the Brookville, suites, and Library parking lots.
“I don’t understand why students park illegally,” Commuter and senior Digital Arts and Design major Marissa Pisicchio, who usually parks in the lot between Hillwood and Post Hall, said. She explained how often she sees cars parked outside of lines and on the grass.
If there are so many parking lots, why do people risk parking illegally? A senior named Stephanie who asked that her last name not be used, had an answer. “They are lazy and don’t want to walk,” she said, about fellow students who park illegally.
The parking lot west of the library is heavily affected by the plague of parking violations. A stroll around the parking lot during common hour revealed a parking nightmare. You do not have to look far too spot obvious violations. The two rows of cars along the west wall of the library were immediately noticeable. The first row of cars was parked on top of the sidewalk, and the second along the fire lane. Many cars were parked at the end of rows outside of parking spaces.
The LIU Post website states, “A legal parking space consists of two parallel yellow lines.” On a day in early October, two cars narrowly squeezed past each other around a corner, obstructed by one of these illegally parked cars. In addition with the high level of traffic in the lot at this time, it was far from an ideal situation.
An owner of a red convertible Audi a4 parked on the sidewalk on the west wall of the library was the first violator spotted by the Pioneer on Tuesday, Oct. 6. She immediately appeared to be aggravated over the subject, and insisted on remaining anonymous.
A student who also chose to remain anonymous was parked on the outside of the row, and admitted to being in violation of parking rules. When leaving the parking lot, the owner of the red Audi drove past and said, “the problem is that students should not be parking in this parking lot.”
A librarian walking into the building from the parking lot was willing to talk but also chose to remain anonymous, having admitted to parking illegally in the past. She explained that this parking lot is for faculty and staff only. She made the point that faculty and staff need parking in close proximity to their destinations, since they often have a lot of things to carry, such as course materials and books.
Commuter Lupe Flores, a junior Art Therapy major, disagrees with this argument. She believes that there is not enough parking spaces for commuters close enough to their classes and sees herself taking the risk and parking illegally in the future. Lupe said, “it is unfair for me to walk back and forth to my car, which is so freaking far away.”
Another librarian, Jean Uhl, described the parking situation to be “like a free for all” and “a dangerous situation” since illegally parked cars make it difficult to navigate the parking lot. Often times, it is hard for her to find parking any later than 9 a.m. Since many other faculty and students have already filled the lot.
There used to be a security guard in the currently empty booth, whose job was to allow only faculty and staff to enter the lot. The job no longer exists, believed to have been cut in order to reduce spending. Now, anyone can enter without being stopped, despite the clear sign that the lot is for faculty and staff only. The sign reads, “Reserved parking for faculty and staff only, authorized vehicles will be towed away.” Despite the absence of the guard, the situation has not gone completely unregulated.
Everywhere you look, you will see cars with summonses on their windshields; a sign that Public Safety is making somewhat of a conscious effort to correct the issue. But, is it enough? Many staff claim that students who park illegally in faculty and staff spots need to be ticketed more persistently until they understand not to park there.
Are the gains from cutting one security guard worth the backlash that has occurred? It must be considered that LIU Post is trying to save money in an attempt to better the school, and has been successful in doing so.
According to the National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute, LIU Post’s endowment has gone up from $78.3 million in 2012 to $96.9 million in 2014. Is it possible though, that the school has gone too far in cutting jobs, which has led to problems such as the illegal parking in the faculty parking lots?
Obviously, writing up tickets isn’t working so maybe there is something more that Public Safety can do. Perhaps, the students need to just stop being lazy and understand the rules. The problematic conditions in the parking lot west of the library are reflected in other lots across campus. Until the issue of illegal parking is resolved, the parking tickets will no doubt continue.

“I was always interested in going global,” said Robert Valli, the new College of Management Dean, in an interview with the Pioneer in the new College of Management offices in the library. Valli’s appointment was announced in May 2015 and he is currently in his first semester as Dean of the College of Management, which is made up of the School of Business, the School of Professional Accountancy and the new School of Computer Science, Innovation, and Management Engineering.
Valli was most recently at the University of Illinois, where he served as director of Illinois Business Consulting (IBC), the largest student-led consulting organization in the United States. “I was one of the first people to invest in private enterprise under the new Russian-American treaty, which is actually out of Cyprus (Republic of Cyprus) in 1991,” Valli said.
It is this multinational approach that he wants to bring to the College and its students. He plans to begin a program at LIU Post called the Innovation Immersion Program (IIP), which has local organizations on campuses all over the world, including the University of Illinois.
“The Innovation Immersion Program is a student-run, global consultancy that bridges interdisciplinary gaps to connect students to technology and entrepreneurial companies, creating international networks for lifelong bonds. Students participating in our expanding network develop professional skills and collaborate with like-minded colleagues from all over the world to accelerate the growth of technological ventures in a multitude of industries,” according to InnovationImmersion.net, IIP’s official website. On campus, the program will be called
LIU IQ.“IIP is a way for us to form alliances globally because it is made up of science and technology universities from Israel, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, Sweden, just to name a few,” he said with excitement. Students will be trained alongside industry executives for roughly 16 weeks in collaborative teams to identify and solve business venture problems.
The collaborations will be through virtual meetings. Students could work with other IIP scholars from “Taiwan or Singapore,” Valli explained. “Imagine going into an interview, and saying: I did LIU IQ, and I worked with a big conglomerate in New York City, and this is the type of problem we looked at, here are the actions we took, I learned to work in a group, here are the results.” It is this edge that the former director of the Kauffman Global Foundation wants the students in his College to have.
“Dr. Valli is at home in business, technological innovation, and higher education,” said Dr. Jeffrey Kane, LIU vice president for Academic Affairs in a May 2015 statement announcing Valli’s appointment. “His understanding of the intersection of these aspects of the College of Management will generate new opportunities within the College itself and for LIU Post as a campus. To put it simply, Dr. Valli’s appointment will be a catalyst for powerful new programs, partnerships, and transformative experiences for students.”

A second undergraduate Nursing program will be introduced during the spring 2016 semester. Previously, Post only offered one undergraduate nursing program, which was only available to registered nurses. This new program has been in the making for two years now. The B.S. in Nursing is based on the balance between practical field experience and class room lectures.
This is new program is a result of requests from students, according to Stacy Gropack, Dean of the School of Nursing. It was added “due to the increased interest from enrolled and prospective students and to build upon the already existing RN to BS in Nursing programs,” she said.
In addition to servicing current students, Post is matching the trend in the growing nursing field. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Employment of registered nurses is projected to grow 19 percent from 2012 to 2022,” while in other fields the average growth rate is 11 percent.
The original B.S. in nursing was for registered them looking to prepares nurses to “assume advanced clinical and management positions in a variety of health care settings, including hospitals, home-health programs and public health agencies,” according to LIU Post’s website.
In addition to the two undergraduate programs, Post offers several graduate nursing programs, including M.S. in Family Nurse Practitioner, M.S. in Nursing Education, Advanced Certificate Family Nurse Practitioner, and Advanced Certificate Nursing Education.
The B.S. in Nursing requires 129 credits, like several other majors at Post. Unlike most majors, nursing students will be taking nursing classes during their freshman year. The first nursing course will be NRS 100, which is Introduction to Professional Nursing. The first time they get hands on experience is sophomore year.
Nursing students take NRS 130/130C, Fundamentals in Nursing, which includes a practical component for three weeks. This is done through “practical learning in the simulation laboratory where real-world events are safely reproduced using high fidelity patient simulators,” according to Gropack. Nursing students’ junior and senior year will be filled with actual real world experience with a Post affiliated clinic at the North Shore-LIJ Health System.
In order to be eligible for the new nursing program, incoming freshmen must have a solid B average and an average SAT score of 1000, according to LIU Post’s website . Transfer students need a 3.0 to be considered. If you are a current student who has completed fewer than 24 credits, you must also submit high school transcripts and SAT/ACT scores.
LIU plans on funneling students into the program through LIU Promise. The Dean of the School of Health Professions and Nursing trained the Success Coaches on the new program and its requirements.
Senior Associate Director of LIU Promise, Ali DiBona said, “We communicate regularly with students about their interest in Nursing through individual meetings and advising sessions.” According to DiBona, many students are interested in the program, and they are looking to have 30 students enrolled for the spring semester.

All incidents that take place on the Post campus are, by law, a matter of public record and can be found at Public Safety. The Crime Blotter is provided by the Pioneer as a public service for the campus community.
Criminal Mischief
The Post Hall campus circuit board was tampered with on Sept. 11. Before the wires were disconnected, the camera caught two pictures of one male and one female climbing up the camera poles showing intent to tamper with the camera.
Fire
On Sept. 12, a fire alarm was set off due to a student burning incense in her room. The Roslyn Fire Department arrived at campus shortly after the alarm sounded to reset alarm.
Theft
A student realized she had been pick-pocketed while she was on line for Starbucks in Hillwood Commons on Sept. 15. A wallet was stolen that contained cash, multiple credit cards, and a student I.D.
On Sept. 15, the PlayStation in the Hillwood Commons Game Room was reported stolen. Apparently the PlayStation had not been seen since July.
A Microsoft Surface tablet was reported stolen on Sept. 16 near the Life Science Building. A student had her tablet in a black and blue bag sitting on a bench. When 9:30 classes started, the student got up and went to class, forgetting the tablet on the bench. When she returned about an hour later, the bag and tablet were gone.
Property Damage
On Sept. 23, a student reported that her camera had been run over in the faculty parking lot. Her camera had fallen out of her car and as she tried to stop traffic to gather her belongings on the ground, one car did not stop and crushed the camera.
