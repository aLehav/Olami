Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

On a warm autumn Saturday afternoon, the C.W. Post menís soccer team went to battle against rival Dowling University. The intensity level was high for the entire length of this conference game.
Going into the match, freshman back Joakim Ohlson, was a little nervous about the Pioneerís opponent. ìThey’re in the top of the conference table and they are also aiming for a spot in the NCAA playoffs. So a win Saturday would put us in a great position for the future,î he said.
Unfortunately just minutes into the game, Dowling got off to a fast start by scoring off a header by midfielder Jonathan DeFelice. However, less than three minutes later Post responded by tying the game off a goal by forward William Lindbergh who has scored three goals in the last two games.
Both teams had several opportunities to break the tie, but strong defense on both sides left the score at 1-1 after the first half.
With both offenses struggling since after scoring at the beginning of the game, Dowling surged ahead with about seven minutes left to play. After a controversial penalty was called against Post, Dowling capitalized by converting their free kick to take the lead 2-1, which would prove to be the final tally.
ìIt was a tough loss,î stated forward Rumen Kerekov. ìOur whole season was focused on that game and we lost it. Everybody tried hard but it wasnít enough. We must win all games and even then, we might not qualify for the NCAA. We will definitely aim at winning the conference for our pride.î
Following the tough loss, the Pioneers (4-5-1) will have to rebound quickly as they face Caldwell College (5-7) at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at home. In addition, later in the week, Post will have to take on first place in the ECC St. Thomas Aquinas College (9-1-1) on the road.

—with Heather Norris
With Homecoming just days away, all eyes are on our football team.  The Pioneers have seen a great start to the 2010 season, staying undefeated in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference East and boasting a 4-2 record overall.  Leading the Pioneers in their success is Senior quarterback, Erik Anderwkavich.  Named the East Coast Athletic Conferenceís Player of the year in 2009, his first year at Post, Anderwkavich rushed for a conference-leading 715 yards and six touchdowns and is widely recognized as one of the best offensive players in Division II.
Name:  Erik Anderwkavich
Major: Criminal Justice
Sport: Football
Hometown:  Queens, NY
How long have they been playing at Post: “This is my 2nd season at Post. I transferred from a Junior College in California called Allan Hancock.”
What did they first think about Post:
“I liked it because I was back home. That was the first thing I thought about Post, but then coming to the actual school and living on campus was different. It was like starting all over; I didnít know anyone, I didnít know what to do, really. It was such a small school, it was a real change”
How do they feel about Post now:
“I like Post a lot, Iím glad I made the decision I did to come here. My family comes to my games and Iíve met some great people here that I will never forget.  My coaches and teammates are great, weíre one big family.î
Lessons they will take from Post: ìAlways work hard and donít let up. If you work hard enough for what you want, you will achieve your goals.”
Best memory with the team/at Post: ìAs of now, the best memory I have with the team is our triple-overtime win over West Chester University. We showed great character, we could have easily fallen apart but, instead, we held together, and that was great to see. Iím hoping to have an even better memory though, one where we end this season with a championship!”
What do they want to do after Post: ìEnjoy life. I hope Iíll take what Iíve learned from my coaches and be a successful man, a great father and husband.”
What will they miss from Post: ìMy team, everything weíve done, Iíll miss it all.  The crazy Gil, meetings, punishments, practices, games. Iím going to miss all the close friends Iíve made here and all the fun weíve had together.î
What did it mean to him to be named the East Coast Athletic Conference Player of the Year in 2009?  ìWinning the ECAC Player of the Year award was a great honor. To come in here my first year and win an award was great. I couldnít have done it alone either, so I thank my team very much for that.î

The C.W. Post University Menís and Womenís Cross Country squad saw action away from the New York area for the second consecutive week.  They competed in the Disney Classic Invitational this past weekend at Walt Disney Worldís Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando, Florida.
There were several breakout performances on the menís side allowing them to place 8th out of 21 teams. Finishing first for the men in the 8k race (5 miles) was sophomore Christian Altamura, who placed 15th overall and finished in 25:39. Altamuraís time was the fastest by a Pioneer in the Disney classic since the early 1990ís. ìI knew what I wanted to do today and I went for it,î said Altamura. ìThatís what you have to do in order to win.”
Finishing second was graduate student Vince Giambanco who posted a time of 26:08, just shy of his personal best. Coming in third was Matthew OíKeefe who posted a personal best time of 26:33. Following OíKeefe shortly after was freshman Joseph Lasher. For the second week in a row, Lasher set a personal best time clocking in at 26:45. Rounding out the top five for the menís squad was Thomas Speicher who ran 27:17.
The lady Pioneerís competed in a 5k race (3.1 miles) and placed 18th out of 25 teams. Sophomore Caitlin Smith once again crossed the finish line first posting a time of 20:38 placing 95th overall out of 225 runners. Coming in second was freshman Jenn McLaughlin who clocked in at 20:57. Right on her heels was freshman Angelica Price, who ran a time of 21:01. Rounding out the fourth and fifth spots was graduate student Erin Lusenskas (21:13) and Katherine Wilkens (21:26). ìWe had several breakout performances this week,î said assistant coach Christa Morris. ìAll the hard work that these runners have put in over the summer and throughout the season is paying off when we need it to.”
The Pioneer’s will be back in action on Saturday October 23rd when they compete in the St. Josephs Invitational in Kings Park, NY.

Homecoming involves all different types of activities but the main focus is on the football game. Itís the game on the schedule that all the players circle, and anticipate.
This Saturday when the Pioneers host East Stroudsburg, the Pioneers should expect the largest crowd of the season. ìYou feel better because there is a big crowd,î said senior team captain Will Strano. ìItís easy to get excited and hyped up for the game because you want to perform at your best.”
Of course the players love being a part of the game but that isnít the only thing that they like. Strano enjoys meeting the alumni who come back, while senior defensive back Aaron Hall is a fan of the pep rally that they hold for the team in the Pratt Center.
Since both are seniors, Hall and Strano have experienced the joys of homecoming before. One of Stranoís favorite homecoming moments was last season when the Pioneers beat the eventual conference champions Shippensburg in front of a packed Hickox Field. Hallís favorite moment includes the support that he gets from his family and friends who attend the game.
The game itself should be in the Pioneersí favor. Post comes into the game with a record of 4-2 and exploded on offense this past weekend against Millersville in a 49-21 victory, while East Stroudsburg comes into the match up at just 1-5.
The Pioneers stumbled a bit out of the gate, but a victory on homecoming would solidify their contention this season. Senior Quarterback Erik Anderwkavich continues to be a game changer this season with both his legs and arm. Anderwkavich has rushed for 431 yards so far this season while throwing for over 1100 yards. One of Anderwkavichís favorite targets this season has been Darnell Williams who has averaged over 90 yards a game while catching four touchdown passes this season. Thomas Beverly has also had a nice season compiling 449 yards and three touchdowns, while battling an ankle injury.
Although the offense has been great for the Pioneers, the defense has been solid all season. Line backer Billy OíConnor has lead the team in tackles with 69, but 15 other players have recorded 10 or more tackles so far this season. Ronnie Modik has three interceptions so far, and Xavier Brown has a team high six sacks.
If you canít make it down to support the Pioneers, coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com begins at 12:30 p.m., while kickoff is scheduled at 1 PM.

Last week we talked about the Amethyst Initiative, which is a group of college presidents who joined together to call for a debate about the alcohol age in the U.S. A total of 135 college presidents have already signed the initiative, but C.W. Post has failed to endorse it. Around the campus, students gave their opinions on the Amethyst Initiative.
Junior Music major, Brad Turow says the Amethyst Initiative is understandable. ìI donít think most people obey it now anyway,î remarked Turow. Senior Film student Martha McCann agrees, ìI think it should be lowered. Weíre the only country with the drinking age of 21. When I reached 21, drinking wasnít a big deal anymore.î
Other students completely agree that the Initiative would be a great idea to iinstall at Post. ìWhat better way to prove yourself than by getting adults to actually agree with you,î stated junior Art major Kathleen Catterson.  Another student agrees that this would reduce the amount of binge drinking as well.  ìI donít think kids are mature enough to handle themselves,î sophomore Film major Robert Tippin.  He continued to state that by taking some of these restrictions away, kids wonítwould not  act so irresponsible.
Most people had a positive view on the initiative and do not understand why C.W. Post has not signed on yet. Jenna Petrocelli, a SUNY Purchase alumnus says: ì I donít understand why a school like Post,  a private university, hasnít signed on. Even Purchase signed on and theyíre a state school.î When asked if she remembered if the school advertised they signed on she said, ìit was mentioned, but I donít really remember it. Maybe I just didnít give it much attention since I was already 21 by then.î
Most adults are not too fond of the idea. ìWhatís the point? Kids already drink before 21 and probably before 18. They get their friends or even parents to get it for them,î says a C.W. Post alumnus David Gathers. ìI donít think this will make much leeway.î  Martha Nugent another CW Post alumni says, ì I think itís awful. This just makes me more cautious on the road and even for my kids when they grow up. I think itís best just the way it is. I really donít see things changing anytime soon.î
One must really think of the way society would change if this ever came to be.  We as young adults must learn to be more responsible if the government will allow it. It may take quite a few years for the federal government to reconsider the law. But us college students can try and attempt to start the change.  So always drink responsibly and have a designated driver- it is better to be safe than sorry. Having a DUI or a DWI on your record could tarnish your job opportunities.  After getting a DUI or a DWI your license is taken away and you have to pay a fine that could cost over two thousand dollars, which does not include the lawyer expenses and getting back your car after it is impounded.  Be smart and safe and maybe we can finally have something to show for it.

The new common hour has now begun to settle in. Since students have a real opportunity to get involved on campus, a new issue has arisen: Do students have the right to complain if they make no effort to get involved?
Several different factors determine the individual studentís involvement in extra-curricular activities. Commuting seems to be one of these factors. There are many who say that commuters are at a disadvantage, and that it is much easier for residents to get involved. However, it is not as easy as commuters may think.
Senior Matt Marando lives on campus, yet, due to his work schedule he goes home most weekends, yet and he says students should still have the right to voice their concerns. ìWe are still students, we still have a right to say what we think,î argues Marando. Others disagree with him.
Junior Annalisa Crecco has two jobs that take up most of her out-of-class time. Crecco has a different view on how to get active on campus, ìI come here to learn, and I have an outside social life. That is why I donít get involved,î she says. When asked whether her degree of campus involvement should affect her right to have a say, Crecco thinks involved students should have a greater say. ìI donít complain because it is not my place to,î she concludes.
ìIt is the same as when people complain about how politicians are doing their jobs, yet they did not participate in the election by votingî says junior, Clay Wade. Working as a residence hall assistant, Wade says getting involved in school helps him lead a healthy social life in college.
It seems that both residents and commuters struggle with the question of getting involved and having a say in their school. All of the students agreed that being active on campus is not for everyone. For some, getting involved is just not possible or just not a priority, however, the questions still lingers.
Email  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.com and tell us who you think has the right to complain.

One of the most important improvements C.W. Post has recently made is the effort to “Go Green.î  Our campus facilities analysis service, Slightlines, informs us that CW Post ìhas been ranked among the most energy-efficient colleges and universities in the Northeast.”  Also, “Our campus consumes 83,000 British thermal units per square foot, which is far below the average 138,000 btu among comparable campuses in the region,” according to the Post Press.
Throughout any given day on campus, students are sure to see numerous signs and posters advertising the campaign. To promote going green C.W. Post now has a P.E.A.C.E Club which stands for Protecting Every Aspect of the Environment. Also, there is an arboretum on campus, new recycling bins, and rewards for being green (especially on Tuesdays), among many other movements.
A major development has taken place in many of the dining halls, by incorporating sustainability to their operations. The C.W. Post Sustainability Committee is chaired by Dr. Scott Carlin, who received the Award for Environmental Vision in Sustainable Development from the Long Island Progressive Coalition, a nonprofit, community-focused organization, according to PR chairwoman, Rita Langdon.
The movement to go green has been taken seriously and adjustments have been made. For example, instead of using dining trays Winnick now uses dishes that are washed and reused. According to Post dining services, ìWe partner with J.Kings Food Service, a local foodservice company, SYSCO Foodservices and Sid Wainer & Son for local products.†We also purchase many of our baked goods from local bakeries.î  Supporting local farmers as well as the community is a great step in the right direction.
Our main coffee go-to spot, Java City, has also joined the action by selling reusable mugs (made from recycled materials) and providing a discount to those that use them; Hillwood Cafe does the same. Other efforts in the dining services department include buying items in bulk to help reduce the amount of packaging as well as using green cleaning supplies. The use of non-toxic, green cleaning supplies is not only beneficial for the environment but for everyoneís health too.
Going green on campus has gained much support from the students as well.  “Seeing C.W. Post taking some steps in a greener direction makes me proud to be a student,î says sophomore Corinna Sacchetta.  ìEven noticing the smallest effort to be greener puts a smile on my face.”
Academically, CW Post offers many educational options for students who choose to take a green path. The Honors Green program began its second year this September and allows students to take a variety of classes, including Conservation of Nature Environmental Resources, which allow students to be aware of the issue. Students that take part in the Honors Green program have the ability to participate in field-base learning and visit parks throughout America through Partners in the Parks Program. Angela Calise, an Honors Green student, went to Zion National Park in Utah with the program in the spring. ìIíve always been attuned with nature, but this experience definitely opened up my mind,î Angela mentions.
To help advocate this movement the P.E.A.C.E club has taken an initiative to get the word out there. At Hillwood Commons we can see a ìGreen Boardî that often has advertisements and information about helping the environment and what we can all do to help. Right next to the board there are recycling bins, which cannot be missed, to motivate everyone to help do their small part in keeping CW Post as environmentally friendly as possible. Recycling has also been extended to the halls of Suffolk, Queens and Kings, which can now recycle mixed paper, plastics and aluminum.
Fun environmental fact:
The energy saved by recycling one bottle will power a computer for 25 minutes. Another initiative that was taken by those at CW Post is the community arboretum; the campus is home to 4,000 trees on 307 acres.

After speaking with many students on Campus, it is brought to our attention, that many people are not very politically up to date. When asking students about the primaries, we are received with blank stares and  unknowing responses. Here’s where we come in. Each issue, up until the midterm elections, we will be giving you your healthy dose of politics for the week. So, if you have no idea who won the primaries for New York’s new governor, or you know but you’re unsure of who to vote for because you don’t know much about the candidates on the ticket, no need to panic, The Pioneer is here to save you from your political absence.
PALADINO:
Tea party Candidate, Carl Paladino, 64,  served as Chief Executive officer of Ellicott Development Company. Paladino is also a senior managing partner in the law firm of Paladino, Cavan and Quinlivin, a firm that specializes in corporate and real estate law. In 1999 he was honored by the city of Buffalo as Buffalonian of the Yyear and in 1993 as Alumnus of the Yyear by St. Bonaventure University. Paladino is currently running on a republican ticket, h. However, was a registered Democrat from 1974-2005.
Paladinoís main concern is, in his words, “To take a baseball bat to Albany.” Paladino promises the people of New York he will weed out all of the corrupt politicians. He also thinks that some of the people running New York should be put in jail, starting with aAssembly woman Shelly Silver.  He vowed to send the state police into New York City . and, “every other sanctuary city in the state to pick up illegals and turn them over to the feds.” There are however many skeletons in Paladinoís closet which need to be brought out into the open as well. If you vote for someone you need to know who they are outside of the limelight.  Carl Paladino cheated on his wife Cathy, and even fathered a child out of wedlock. This all came out the same week their re 29- year- old son, Patrick, was killed in a car accident. There were also the sexually explicit and racist emails he sent out through the years to friends and colleguescolleagues which came out in April. The messages included what appeared to be a video of Africans dancing in traditional dress that was titled “Obama Inauguration Rehearsal.” Though Paladino admitted some of the emails he is being accused of sending are authentic, others aren’t, and the site that broke the story has been accused of email scandals such as this in the past. The most recent issue is the allegations Paladino made against running mate Andrew Cuomo. He accused Cuomo of cheating on his  ex-wife years ago. “When he was married — or asked him why his wife left him or threw him out of the house? Has anybody ever done that?” Paladino demanded. “What are they doing intruding on my life?” No proof of this has come out yet however, showing how nasty this race is truly getting. ìFor some reason, I look at you and Iím not sure youíre a bridge-builder,î Lauer said, in an interview with Ppaladino on October 5th on the Today show. Bill O’Reilly on his show on Ffox Nnews said, “Paladino tends to drop these names (Sheldon Silver, Andrew Farkas et al) as if viewers across the state and the rest of the country read CapCon four times a day. Alas, they do not. ” This shows both sides are a bit skeptical about where Ppaladino will stand during the elections.
Carl Paladino believes he can cut state taxes 10% in his first six months and taxing spending 20% in the first year. Pink slips would go to state employees who he refers to as “well-connected brothers-in-law,” “leeches” and “wall-to-wall crooks.”  He’s pro-gun, pro-life and highly against a mosque near Ground Zero. A fiscal conservative, Carl Paladino has won the primary for the Republican party over Rick Lazio to run as the next New York Governor.
CUOMO:
Andrew Cuomo is the democratic primary election winner for New York’s next governor. Politics in his blood, Cuomo is the elder son of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, and the older brother of ABC News journalist Chris Cuomo.
Appointed to the Department of Housing and Urban Development as Assistant Secretary in 1993 and as a member of President Bill Clinton’s administration, Cuomo, it seems, has his interests in the right place. Attending Fordham University, he received his J.D. from Albany Law School. He was a top aide to his father during his father’s 1982 campaign for Governor, going on to later joining the Governor’s staff as one of his father’s top policy advisors, a position he filled on and off during his father’s 12-year governorship. Cuomo became active in issues affecting the homeless and housing policy in New York during the 1980s and 1990s. He also founded a non-profit organization focused on homeless and housing issues, Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged (HELP).
Andrew Cuomo has implemented student loan inquiry during his years of being in politics.  Many universities steered student borrowers to preferred lenders, which resulted in those borrowers incurring higher interest rates. This has led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities. Many universities have also rebated millions of dollars in fees back to affected borrowers, thanks to his policy. He has also made sure that Facebook is a safe siteght for minors. Cuomo cited an investigation by the Office of the Attorney General, which discovered deficiencies that stand in contrast to the reassuring statements made on the web site and by company officials.  On September 18, 2009, Advisors to President Barack Obama informed Paterson that the President believed Paterson should withdraw his 2010 gubernatorial candidacy, stepping aside for “popular Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.” On January 23, 2010, the New York Daily News reported that Cuomo would announce plans for a gubernatorial campaign at the end of March.
During the campaign, Cuomo has received criticism from the black community, who have accused him of ignoring them and not campaigning in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York or with black elected officials. Back in January of 2008, Cuomo did a talk radio interview and was caught saying what some believed was racist comments. “It’s not a T.V. crazed race. Frankly you can’t buy your way into it,” Cuomo said, according to Albany Times Union reporter Rick Karlin. He then added, “You can’t shuck and jive at a press conference. All those moves you can make with the press don’t work when you’re in someone’s living room.” H Though he denied this as being racist, saying it was not geared toward President Obama, but simply meaning to say ëbob and weaveí. Many people, such as black Council member Charles Barron, say he is only out to help those who are white.
Strongly opposing the death penalty, promising to cut overtime for union workers to save tax money, and having a strong involvement with the homeless, Andrew Cuomo is currently leading his republican opponent Carl Paladino by double digits, with 4 percent undecided in a Marist Institute poll conducted Sept. 27-29.  Only time will tell whatís in store for this democrat.

The first homework assignment many incoming freshman at C.W. Post receive in their Freshman Seminar classes is to log into and activate their My LIU student account.  My LIU is the student and faculty computer system that allows students access to information about financial aid, class schedules, billing, grades, and e-mail. While these accounts may seem convenient and helpful, C.W. Post students are not unanimous in their use of them.
ìI actually donít use mine,î said sophomore Chloe Schwartzapfel.  ìWhen I came to school I already had my own email account.  I just feel like it would be too much work to switch over.î For many, the idea of having to start a new account or having to maintain two separate accounts simply doesnít seem worth it. Some, however, think the school account is useful.  ìI always use My LIU email,î said junior Nutrition major Devon Trenkle.  ìItís not that I really chose to use it though, it just makes school so much easier; it’s what all my professors use.”
Professor Abby Dress, agreed, saying, ìItís a fast and easy way to contact a whole class.î  She even speculated as to why these accounts seem so popular among students and faculty.  ìThe more professors use Blackboard, the more students will check their LIU accounts.î
As the the website emerges, s, professors are using it the website even more to connect with students and post assignments online.  So, tell us what you think for our student survey.  How many of you use the website?  What changes would you like to see?  Email the Pioneer at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.com.

Universities across the nation participated in a National Ethnic Studies Week in response to recent Arizona and Texas legislation, changing K-12 curriculum to exclude ethnic studies. C.W. Post took part by holding a three-hour event on October 7th in the Hillwood Lecture Hall.  The event included educators and students from all over Long Island, spanning all areas of education from elementary level to collegiate. The main purpose of this event was to analyze the recent actions taken by Arizona and Texas and to discusssing the importance of ethnic studies in our own curriculum.
Of the dozen or so speakers, a few were from Post’s very own campus and academic programs, speaking out on how their ethnicity has played a roll in their experience on and off campus. Sophomore Nicole Goonetilleke who grew up in Freeport, spoke of her experience of growing up as a bi-racial child there.  “Race was not an issue for me until I was much older,” said Goonetilleke. “Freeport is a real melting pot and race is not really an issue.î
Adjoa Osei and Surrenca Albert, both in the PhD psychology program at Post, spoke on the disparity of minorities in their field of study. “Seventy-seven percent of those who receive a PhD in psychology are white,” said Albert. This has caused a trend of acculturation amongst minorities in the field of psychology.  ìThey become perceived as white as they progress through their education and career, thus adopting the culture of this predominantly white institution,î said Osei.
Jeanne Attie, head of the History department at Post, spoke about the history of ethnicity in America and its contradictions.  ìOne hundred years ago people accepted that there were separate Italian, Irish and Slavic races; presently those unique and separate ethnicities are now grouped under the white race. There was no white race before the black race,” said Attie.  ìYou cannot have one without the other.”
Ethnic studies week, a nationally coordinated week of actions to defend ethnic studies and academic freedom, started October first and goes through to October seventh.October 7th.

C.W. Post’s online class registration system has been out for it’s first two major semesters. It’s initial introduction, which was not isolated to just C.W. Post but to all of Long Island University’s campuses, was met with diverse reactions from both university faculty, staff and the student body.
Director of Academic Advising, Bill Polaski, says, “It has definitely helped us breathe easier,” when asked how it has changed registration and advising operations on campus. “It is a much more efficient system that has been saving us a lot of man hours.” Advisors are more available than they previously were and now have a faster registration process. “It used to be an absolute zoo,” said Polaski, “kids were skipping class just to see an advisor and, thatís obviously not what we want.”
The adoption of the new system does not require students to sit down with advisors for every add/drop change they need to make to their schedule. The real advancement with class registration is hnow there is a self-service system in place.   Post students expect off-site self-service, and with today’s technology that is available. ìThose who feel they are making a good decision on their own can now do so without our signature on a card,” said Polaski.  ìThis does not mean we want to stop students from coming in for a simple Add/Drop, but now itís no longer a requirement.”
Kathleen Christman, senior English major, said, ìThis was a long overdue transition to online registration. Many schools have had this process for sometime now.” Despite her enthusiasm for the system , “online registration should not replace meetings with advisors,î Christman said.
The new software allows for advisors to analyze data of the student body and pay more attention to at risk students and contact students that may have not yet registered for the semester.
Nick Petty, a senior History major, disagrees and wants to see improvement. “There are a lot of glitches with online registration,” said Petty, “classes saying they are full when they aren’t or with electronic transcripts.” Petty also feels that there can be a real lack of communication suggesting upper classmen should be doing online registration and under classmen should be with the academic advisers.
“Academic advisers can get beyond the bounds of their office and form more meaningful relationships with other departments to meet the needs of students,” said Polaski. “Whether with the academic departments or the registrar we can communicate so that we can all reach the same end goal: the success of our students.”

On October 6th, students, faculty, and members of the community piled into the Great Hall for a trip back in time to study the life of Marjorie Merriweather Post.
Kenneth G. Mensing, the Universityís historian, presented the group with an abundance of information, which he traveled over three states to acquire. Photographs, advertisements, and even architectural blueprints were displayed to better understand the estate, and the socialite who inhabited it. ìMensing knew so much,î said Mike Greco, a junior ttheater major. ìHe was so enthusiastic about the history of Post.î
From 1921 to 1951, the mansion was home to Post Cereal Company heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post. She purchased the land for $400,000. The estateís Tudor style was an icon of Marjorieís extravagant social and financial status. The mansion served as a retreat for her family and friends to escape the chaos of New York City.
Mensing spoke of famous individuals such as actress Billie Burke (Glinda, the good witch in The Wizard of Oz) and the Grand Duchess of Luxembourgís frequent stays at the mansion during the first half of the 20th century. Marjorie loved to entertain, and had frequent social gatherings at the mansion. She was generous in inviting her guests to stay as long as they liked, and supplied them with anything they might have needed. She used to tell anyone who stayed with her,  ìIf there is something you wish for, but do not ask for, it is your own fault.î
Those in attendance were able to see what the mansion looked like before Long Island University bought the estate in 1951. Photographs of the kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, dining rooms, and solarium helped to set the scene. All of these rooms today, however, make up most of the administrative offices in the building.
The Provostís secretaryís office is covered with the original wallpaper that adorned the walls when the room was used as a bedroom. To the side of one of the desks is the opening to what used to be a bathroom. The walls of this tiny turquoise tiled room are plastered with old Christmas cards from the 1930ís.
Parts of the gardens are still in existence today. The rose arches and the patio overlooking Humanities Hall are all original foundations. “Going on the tour was a lot of fun,” said Ali LaRocca, a junior public relations major. “I learned a lot of interesting facts about Post history.”
To find out more, you can pick up a copy of “Hillwood: The Long Island Estate of Marjorie Merriweather Post,” the only known comprehensive history of the Brookville residence of Marjorie Post. The book is co-written by Mensing, and on sale in the campus bookstore.

Jack Lopez, a 21-year-old senior, sits by himself at an extremely large round table in Hillwood Commons reading The Devil You Know before his shift at the Pratt Center. He wears white shirt, a pair of jeans, and a pair of sneakers. Visible on his arm was the recent tattoo of a cross that he got over the summer, which was black against his caramel colored skin. In Egypt the color black symbolizes life and the cross symbolizes faith reminding Jack that he wouldnít have been able to live his life without the deep faith he has.
ìThe next one [tattoo] Iím thinking about getting are the words ëout of orderí down both my legs. My friends think it would be cool and look great.î Jack was diagnosed with spina bifida at two days old and confined to a wheel chair since the age of 12.
The definition of spina bifida, according to Medicine Net, is ìa birth defect (a congenital malformation) in which there is a bony defect in the vertebral column so that part of the spinal cord, which is normally protected within the vertebral column, is exposed. People with spina bifida can suffer from bladder and bowel incontinence, cognitive (learning) problems and limited mobility.î According to Reisa Doyle, a Nurse Practitioner at the V.A. Medical Center, people with spina bifida can live a very productive life as long as they have a good support system.
Jack recalled a conversation he had with his mother years back. ìMy mom once told me a story of how when I was only a few days old, one of the doctors told her that I wouldnít make it past the age of five,î Jack explained. ìAnd if I did, I would never be a mainstreamed child. When I heard that story, it pretty much lit a fire under my ass and made me want to prove them wrong. To say that I was able to defy what an expert said about me would be one hell of an accomplishment.î
Jack beat the odds and he was offered an academic incentive of $10,000 to come to Post. He took it and now Jack holds a 3.0 grade point average. Jack plans to graduate in the spring of 2011. He currently works at the Pratt center answering phones, swiping I.D.ís and helping set up events.
Choosing to go to Post was not as easy for Jack as it might have been with the other students that attend. When looking for colleges, Jack had to make sure that the college he attended was handicap accessible, which Post is. According to Daniel Capalbo, Senior Assistant Director of The Learning Support Center, most buildings are accessible with a wheelchair as well as the classes. Some of the dorm buildings have elevators and others have single medical rooms for the wheelchair bound. Capalbo makes sure that if there are handicapped students, that they are given accommodations.
The shuttle bus can hold up to one person in a wheelchair and will stop anywhere, even if itís not at a designated stop, if a handicapped person flags them down. The only thing the student has to do to get these services is to identify themselves as handicapped to Capalbo and show documentation.
Jack recognizes that he is disabled but does not feel the need to use the handicapped services available. Being in a wheelchair for nine years, Jack has learned to accommodate himself.
When not in school, or working, Jack likes to play basketball and is even on a wheel chaired basketball team called the Nassau County Kings. He started playing not before but after being fitted for is first wheelchair.
At any moment that someone sees Jack, it wouldnít be the wheelchair that they see first.  He is usually in the center of the crowd, surrounded by mostly girls. The girls do not seem to mind Jackís wheelchair and Jack said he has never had to worry about getting a girlfriend or driving her around.
Youíll find Jack behind the wheel of a 2004 Saturn Ion. The fact that he drives, Jack says, surprises a lot of people. But his is no ordinary car. Instead of pedals on the bottom of the car, Jack drives with a lever. It sits right under the steering wheel and it is connected to the gas and brake pedals. All Jack has to do is pull back on the lever to hit the gas and push down on the lever for the brake. Itís one of the many things his family gave him to make Jack feel more “able-bodied” than handicapped.
ìItís because of my family that I am the person I am today,î Jack said. “My family has always been right there with me, throughout everything.”

Week Four: Reap the Benefits
We are reaching over thirty days of healthy living here with Week Four of The Pioneer, go you!  We together have been making several changes to our daily regimes, and we are sure the results are now beginning to show. Not only do we begin to look good, but by living a healthy life style we most importantly start to feel good. As time increases, the changes in our diet and lifestyle become a lot easier, and sooner or later they will become almost natural. We will eventually want to eat an apple rather than a chocolate bar, because we have now witnessed first hand how such choices truly affect our bodies. We begin to see how water and natural foods become a big part of our daily intake –for the energy and refreshing feeling become more than addicting. What this weeksí nutritional column intends to do is to congratulate those who have been following, and to prove to you that such choices are truly rewarding.
The Benefits of…
Avoiding sugar and flour: One of the most important tips The Pioneer emphasizes is to avoid excess sugar and flour. Although such substances can be addicting, the results of avoiding them are exceptionally rewarding. In simple terms, sugar is a toxic. Why? Foods high in sugar cause the overproduction of insulin into the blood stream, transforming the sugar into FAT for storage. Refined sugar found in white flour, pasta, potatoes, candy, etc., slows our bodies down causing unwanted responses. We break out, we feel overstuffed, and our hunger is never quite satisfied. By consuming unprocessed, unrefined sugars and whole grain, we have an immediate boost of energy, a surge of vitamins and nutrients, and such calories are stored properly rather than turning into fat cells. A big difference right?
Water: Water is the utmost important aspect of a healthy lifestyle; it is a nutrient vital to our health and such benefits should never be underestimated. Especially for those trying to lose weight, water should never be ignored. Water flushes out the by-products of fat, diluting the bodyís waste products and toxins stored in the kidney and the liver. Water also fights against head and body aches, muscle spasms, fatigue and anxiety –all typically caused by dehydration. When the body is properly hydrated, benefits are shown all over (even in our skin!).
Exercise: We all know the obvious benefits of exercise, but here are a few that we donít recognize too often: 1) it improves your mood 2) fights chronic diseases 3) boosts energy level 4) promotes better sleep and 5) fights depression. Continue making exercise part of your daily regime, and for the who still canít get in the swing of it, below we even included some motivating tips to get you there!
Overall a healthy lifestyle is the simplest and easiest way to stay physically fit, feel good, and reduce the chances of illness. By living well, we are able to maintain a healthy weight, which lowers the chance of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Yes it is true that we live in an age of obesity, but we also live in a world of information where we can take it upon ourselves to learn how to live the right way. There are no excuses! Learn, live, and love your body –after all, it is your temple.
For those of you who e-mailed me at  HYPERLINK “mailto:Katieshealth@gmail.com” Katieshealth@gmail.com, I appreciate you comments, questions and suggestions. As promised, I took one particular question several of you had asked and decided to feature it in this weekís issue. The question read: ìI have been following the nutritional column as best as I can eating wise, but I just canít get myself to the gym, any suggestions?î YES! This is a typical concern for college students, especially (as explained in last weeks issue) as the cold weather dwells upon us and the work oad starts to kick in, we become lazy and way too busy. Well luckily here we have a few tips that will make your initiation to get up and go much easier, enjoy!
Wake up and GO! By working out first thing in the morning, you have absolutely no time to contemplate it. Plus, youíll feel great and accomplished all day long.
Just get dressed. Put your sneakers, jam out to a good song and trust me youíll get in the mood to work out.
Tell yourself youíre only going for a quick fifteen minute jog. Once youíre in the vibe, youíll probably wind up staying longer than you thought.
Train for an event. Knowing that you have something to go to, you become more motivated. Maybe mark HALLOWEEN as your big hurrah –get motivated to look good in that costume.
Make your ultimate playlist. As stated in last weeks issue, music is pure motivation. As you get ready for the gym, play your favorite song and get pumped.
Google your favorite celebrity and find out their professional work out plan. Look in awe at their awesome bodies and go get it. Thereís no reason you canít have what they have, they just want it more!
Make working out enjoyable. Donít feel pressured to go run on a treadmill –spice it up a little. Take a kickboxing or yoga class, or better yet go for a swim. Those are all fun and enjoyable ways to workout and theyíre things you can look forward to.
OK so you donít have time, no big deal. Simply implement exercise into your daily regime. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk the extra long way to class, avoid sitting on your lunch break by taking it to go and walk the park!
Working out can be fun, remember that. Any which way you plan to do so is great. The greatest thing of all is that not only do you burn calories, but working out relieves stress. Take advantage of it, use it as a natural medicine.
All in all, at the end of the day the most important thing is that you are happy with yourself. No matter how great a job, how high a GPA or how much weight you can bench in front of your friends..none of it truly matters in comparison to whether you are happy with who you are and how you feel. When it comes down to it, you will always be with yourself. People come and go, but itís your body that will remain your sanctuary. Take care of your body, respect your body, and do your best to stay healthy. But please, if you take one thing from this column, donít take life too seriously and donít be so hard on yourself. Yeah of course eat well, get to the gym, but go out and have fun, you only live once!
Until next time, have a HAPPY, relaxing and healthy week.
Katie 🙂

Senator Kemp Hannon is urging all college students to exercise their right to vote this year in the mid-term elections –encouraging all to vote for the candidate who best represents their beliefs, whatever party that may be. Here is the critical information you should know:
On November 2nd, college students throughout New York will together have the power to influence the direction our government will take. Since the Obama wave that swept across college campuses from New York to California, college students were united in his message of hope and promise for the future. But were these promises fulfilled as you envisioned?
Mid-term elections typically have a lower voter turn out, often resulting in a surprised win that may encompass the less qualified. This in itself is extremely dangerous, for we are lacking to fulfill our duty to exercise the right we were granted, which ultimately gives us the power to make a difference. We are college students who study, learn, research, analyze and debate every day. Being such well equipped and highly qualified individuals, why donít we further our research and truly look into who is hoping to run our country, and who is best qualified to do so.
Please take a moment to look at who is on the ballot this year. Discover which candidate not only fulfills your expectations of government, but who truly meets the standards of our forefathers, remaining consistent with the ideals of our nation. See which candidate is capable of taking our country back by creating jobs within our own country so we can feed and support our families, create our own merchandise, and earn the money to educate and better the youth of America.
What is the mid-term election?
Historically, mid-term elections always switch power. Typically the party in power is the party at greatest risk to lose seats.
Right now the New York State Senate has Democratic majority by two seats. We are currently controlled by one party rule due to the Democratic Governor, Democrat controlled Assembly and Democrat controlled Senate. If Republicans pick up the two seats in the New York State Senate, the dynamics of the current governing process in Albany will completely change –causing a huge transition that will affect us all in some way or another, for better or for worse.
With the immense population of our student body here at C.W. Post, we together can essentially determine the outcome of an election. College students are known to be opinionated, independent, and extremely involved with contemporary politics and how it directly affects our lives. We have strong voices that need to be heard, but no matter how loud we scream, nothing will make a difference until we vote.
For those who registered: The elections will be held on November 2nd. For more information and locations, please contact your local Assemblymen or State Senator.
