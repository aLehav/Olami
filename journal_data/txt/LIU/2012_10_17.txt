LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

Shortly after what would have been his one-year anniversary with LIU Post, Residence Hall Director Carlyle Hicks is no longer a member of the administration. On October 4th, news about his departure circulated around the campus.
Hicks was responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the Residence Life program, making sure students are comfortable with their living environment and ensuring student safety, among other duties.
In an interview with the Pioneer on October 3, 2011, when he was first hired, Hicks said, “It is my responsibility to promote the mission of the Office of Residence Life as well as overseeing the goals and mission of the Post Campus of Long Island University.” 
Hicks has not responded to the Pioneer’s inquiry for comment. His departure seems untimely; on October 3rd, the day before his departure, Hicks held an open public discussion regarding the dorms.
After students began to question the issue, the Pioneer requested information from the Office of Residence Life. On October 5, 2012, the Pioneer received the following statement from Dr. Jessica Hayes, Associate Provost for International Student Services and Community Development: “The Office of Residence Life is a critically important service that provides for the safety, security and rich learning environment for our students. We are moving ahead with a new framework for ensuring a residential community that is in touch with the 21st century. With regard to individuals in the department, we do not discuss personnel issues.”
Without much information being shared with the Post community, students have begun to question the issue on their own. “I feel like it’s suspicious that he was fired, or left his position and no one was told about it,” said Adwoa Boateng, a senior Psychology major. “And I think it’s interesting that this happened while there are rumors of Post declining and losing funds…it makes you wonder why,” she added.
Others simply want to know why. “It’s kind of shocking that he was let go because he just started working here not that long ago,” said Ashley Abney, a senior Public Relations major. “I don’t really know what happened but it must have been serious.”
Currently, the Residence Hall Director position is still vacant. “There currently isn’t a new Residence Life Director,” said Jennifer Fuoco, Associate Director of Residence Life, before directing the Pioneer to the Division for Student Success Office for personnel related inquiries.

New York City in autumn means fall fashion, Central Park glowing in beautiful colors, sports events including the Yankees and Knicks, soulful concerts at various ven¬ues, and so much more. Here’s a to-do list for a city visit in the upcoming months:
“New York City in the fall means warm, comfy, fashionable clothes, with hot choco¬late from Starbucks. Walking around with my girlfriends admiring all the skyscrapers and the pulse of the city,” said Bianca Rahimza¬deh, a sophomore public relations major. This October she can enjoy the fall exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art at 1000 Fifth Avenue for a student price of $12. The Met is exhibiting Andy Warhol’s influence on contemporary art, including45 of his works, accompanied by 100 works by various artists, as well as a show called Manipulated Photo¬graphs Before Photoshop. For a full schedule and more exhibition-information, visit www.metmuseum.org.
If you want more art and history, move towards the Bart Graduate Center Gallery, lo-cated between Central Park West and Colum¬bus Avenue.

With over 200 artifacts, such as posters, photographs and costumes, you can explore the stories of P.T Barnum and John Bill Ricketts, and the stages of New York’s first circus. 
Cold temperatures do not mean that the city can’t be enjoyed outside too. “This is my first fall in New York City, and so far I love it,” said Christine Stronegger, a sophomore film major. She describes a perfect October day in the city with a hot cup of coffee under colored leaves in Central Park, followed by window shopping in Soho’s many vintage stores. On October 31st she could also catch the Village Halloween Parade walking from 6th Avenue and Spring Street, through16thstreet, exhibiting costume-clad people celebrating Halloween. It’s free and runs from until 8:30 pm. “Finally I would go downtown to the Brooklyn Bridge and take pictures with my camera of the breath taking sunset,” she said. This fall the third pier has opened, with 73 picnic tables, 22 barbecues, and three outdoor sports fields, all with a view of lower Manhat¬tan across the East River. 
Both Brooklyn and Manhattan offers various venues for concerts this fall. “The musicians on the streets are doing their thing. I like meeting strangers, and going to music bars such as The Bitter End (137 Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village), enjoying new undiscovered talents while having some good wine,” said Ramizadeh. As usual, the New York music scene is filled with known and less known artists and performances in all genres.

Go to nycomedyfestival.com for a full schedule and the opportunity to buy tickets to the shows. 
“A perfect fall day in the city would need to include sun, and it should not be rainy or windy,” said Mimmi Montgomery, a junior journalism major. “A stroll in Central Park with friends, lunch in a nice place, and shop¬ping for really nice autumn clothes after,” she described. Stores such as ZARA, Topshop and Urban Outfitters are filled with the trendy colors of this fall, including lots of grey, bur¬gundy, French roast, honey gold, and green, to mention a few. Knits, coats, scarves, and boots have arrived to present a warm and trendy look. At Topshop, students get a 10% discount by showing their school-ID cards.

We’ve pretty much heard it all. Jesus was from Africa, Jesus was black and then he was white. Jesus went to America, and then went to India. Jesus was gay, but then Jesus was straight. Then Jesus hated animals and then Jesus loved them. Humanity has consistently and persistently turned the real Jesus into a cartoon character that people keep drawing, erasing and re-drawing to fit their liking. Now an ancient piece of papyrus has led to hypotheses, debate and analysis about Jesus’ marital status. 
In recent news, an ancient fragment, of 1.5 inches by 3 inches, piece of papyrus was presented by Karen L. King, a Harvard scholar, at an international conference of Coptic scholars in Rome held earlier this month. The ancient fragment was dated from the fourth century and is said to have eight and six lines on each side. Dr. Kingstates that the piece was found on the antiquarian market and not through a “dig.” For permission to publish the fragment, the owner, a private collector of antiques and ancient findings, wishes to remain anonymous. However, in Dr. King’s article about the papyrus posted on the Harvard Divinity School webpage, she states that the fragment was presented to her on Harvard grounds in December 2011 personally by the collector. With further testing and analyzing the genuineness of the piece, King finally presented it at the Coptic scholar conference. Nothing further is known about the circumstances of its discovery. Despite lack of familiarity of its origin, many have become interested by the words on this ancient fragment. One of the more controversial lines in the piece, “then Jesus said to them, my wife,” has caught the eye of the world and how they perceive the Son of God. Dr. King states that in the rest of the piece, Jesus was in dialogue with his disciples about Mary and whether or not she is worthy. In turn, Jesus replied, “she can be my disciple.” 
In Dr. King’s article about the fragment posted earlier this year, she stated that she does not imply that Jesus had a wife or was married but rather that she now questions the marital status of Jesus. A week after Dr. King presented the fragment, Francis Watson, a scholar at Durham University in England, disagreed, stating that the text was a fake and pieced together from the Gospel of Thomas. A week after that, the Vatican stated in the New York Times that it is indeed a “clumsy forgery.” 
Christina Mals, a junior political science major at LIU Post, wonders why people are so quick to believe the media and so fast to judge by their own instincts. She says, “People will believe what they want to believe, but faith comes from God.” Junior Bo Bankewitz, a nursing major, questioned its validity, stating“if it was real and important, it would be in our bibles. Why wait 2,000 years to bring something like this up?” He said he doesn’t need a piece of old papyrus to believe something about Christ, and that his Christian faith is what he needs to believe, for by faith is how we believe and not by sight. Jack Salti, a University of Damascus 1982 Alumni and educated gospel researcher, says, “If Jesus was married, one of the four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke or John would have mentioned it in their writings.” He also says that this shouldn’t move a Christian if his or her faith is strong. Salti also said, “This fragment doesn’t change the reason or message that Christ brought to earth.” 
Reading this news about an old fragment was weightless for me. I was asked by my peers about my thoughts of its authenticity. My honest response was simply that I don’t care. If some¬one took the time to read the Bible, he or she would find that it wouldn’t be odd for Christ to say “my wife.” God put His relation¬ship with Israel in simple terms for us to relate to, like marriage. In the Old Testament, God joined in a covenant with Israel, like a vow, much like in a wedding. In fathomable terms, Israel was like God’s wife. God was faithful, and kept to his part of the vow, however, Israel did not. She was unfaithful. With any other marriage, a divorce would take place in a situation like this, but God considered a new covenant, Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Christ talks about His bride, who are the believers of Christ, who will be joined together at the Resurrection, joined to be “married.” 
So what’s the big deal? Why is everyone running around trying to defend Christ and his marital status? Here’s a news flash, Christ doesn’t need our help trying to defend him. Whether or not this piece of papyrus is real or not, it doesn’t change what Christ did for the world. It doesn’t change who he is or what he is doing. It’s really the other way around; we are the ones who need Christ to come to our defense. The only thing I see this ancient papyrus doing is getting people to talk, if not think, about Christ, which isn’t a bad thing at all.

Being a one-hit-wonder hurts, especially for Ellison Oswalt. Years after the success of his Capote-like true crime hit, “Kentucky Blood,” the writer, played by Ethan Hawke, takes his unwitting wife and children to live in a murder house, seeking the story that he believes will be a saving grace for his family. When he ventures to the attic, he uncovers a box of Super 8mm film recordings showcasing scenes from a gruesome series of ritualistic murders and child abductions. Thereafter, we see Oswalt crumble mentally, take up some alleviating liquor swilling, and eventually unravel the juicy story he was chasing from the start. But just like a bad dream, the author cannot remove himself from the nightmarish and (dare I say) sinister forces barraging him and his family. 
This concept may seem a bit familiar to you. Sinister is a Frankenstein-like, mixed-breed that slabs together bits and pieces of the horror master class. Oswalt is eerily similar to Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining in profession and experience. Both characters undergo a suspenseful mental collapse when trying to write their next hit book. These exasperated men find themselves in a tug-of-war between their personal (and increasingly) twisted sense of the world and the attempt to maintain a family life. We also see the influence of films like Blair Witch Project in the (occasional) use of “found foot¬age” exposition.
It comes, then, as no surprise that the man behind the Paranormal Activity franchise and Insidious, Jason Blum, produced this film. In an attempt to step back from a full “found footage” film, Blum, with Scott Derickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) at the directing helm and have managed to make a film that narrowly misses its target. The creepiest moments are largely seen in the films trailer and the plot becomes very predictable. Commendable acting by Hawke and onscreen wife Tracy, played by Juliet Rylance, is stifled by a somewhat rushed ending that invalidates many of the long term struggles the family of characters endure. 
Sinister is ultimately just a look througha horror pinhole: its conflicts are unjustified and small as a means to the end goal of scar¬ingan audience. It remains to be seen if this film will leave a mark at all the horror genre. Akin to Oswalt, Blumnow must scale up to his prior successes. After all, beinga one-hit-wonder hurts. Verdict: 6/10

“I usually get chills just looking at the setup of the field the day before the game,” says Pioneers’ senior captain defensive back Antonio-Powell Fields. There is no day quite like Homecoming. For players, families, students and alumni of a college or university, Homecoming is a time to unite, have a good time, and support athletic programs, especially football. 
“The Post Pride that shows from students is a true emotion that is great to see at a small private school like LIU Post,” senior wide receiver Ryan Derham explains. Although an exhilarating day for most, this day can also be bittersweet for others. This Saturday will be Derham’s final Homecoming game. “I have kind of grown to enjoy everyone having most of the same interest on that one day which is everyone being social and attending a football game.” This season, Derhamleads the Pioneers with three touch¬down receptions. 
The Pioneers (2-4) started off the season on a strong note winning its first two games in blowout fashion against Clarion University and Cheyney University. However, since then, the team has dropped four consecutive games and has decreased its scoring output each week as the season progresses. 
With Homecoming approaching, some players might feel pressured to play above their heads and above what they are capable of for this week with so many people cheering them on. “We don’t really change our routine,” notes junior linebacker Rob Bright, who has a team-high49 tackles. “Same thing goes for winning. We would like to win every game equally but winning in front of a large crowd and alumni is very nice.” 
“It is important to win every game, but a win on this day is special because Homecoming is about the school, and we are representing it,” explains Powell-Fields, who has 45 tackles on the season, second-most on the team only trailing Bright. The players prepare for this game like any other, but winning on this day gives a feeling no other game can provide.
The Pioneers will look to bounce back and avoid losing its fifth consecutive game on Saturday as the team gets set to face the Millersville University Marauders (2-5). Last week, the Marauders snapped a five-game losing streak crushing Clarion University by a score of 35-0. In the first game of the season, the Pioneers also cruised to a victory over Clarion, 46-26. The Pioneers are coming off a lopsided loss to the West Chester University Golden Rams on Saturday, October 13, by a score of 41-6. The Pioneers will aim to make the proper adjustments necessary to win on Homecoming. 
“It is extremely important to get a win this year on Homecoming not only because there are a lot of people that we don’t want to let down, but coming off of a four game losing streak the sense of urgency to get a win is over¬whelming,” declares senior tight end Pat Fitzgerald.
“We need to get this win to get our sea¬son going in the right direction and seeing a huge crowd against a tough team should give some chills,” junior outside linebacker Chris DiIorio states. 
“Winning is most definitely the top priority because we realize how many of our fans will be there, and we don’t want to let them down,” says senior linebacker Anton Rukaj.
Up until last season, the Pioneers had won three Homecoming contests in a row. Unfortunately for the Pioneers, last season the team lost to Kutztown University of Pennsylvania 42-30 in an exciting contest. In that battle, the Golden Bears started off the game with21 straight points. However, the Pioneers would make it a game and answer back scoring 17 points to close out the first half.
Before the loss to Kutztown last year, the Pioneers defeated East Stroudsburg University in 2010 (28-17), Shippensburg University in 2009 (40-24), and Millersville University in 2008 (55-28) on Homecoming.
The Pioneers will try for a similar result against Millersville this year on Homecoming in front of an overflowing crowd at Hickox Field. “When Homecoming comes along and you see packed stands it adds a lot of emotion to the game, which I love,” an excited Derham describes. “I’ll talk to the stands at times and yell and scream and it’s all positive when you see a response.”
“I love playing in front of a packed house. Crowds play a large part in football, so the more fans we have the better it is,” states Bright. 
“It’s really important to get a win on this day just like every other Saturday of the season,” says senior defensive back D.J. Young. “It feels awesome to see a packed house at a game. It makes me feel comfort¬able and less nervous to play.”
“The fans provide that extra motivation and passion in a big game like this,” says senior wide receiver Grayson Laurino. “Not very many people are given the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans while representing something bigger than yourself. We are thankful for this opportunity and can’t wait to proudly represent LIU Post on Saturday.” 
“I love playing in front of a packed house. Crowds play a large part in football, so the more fans we have the better it is,” states Bright. 
“It [the crowd] gives great energy to the team during the game, which optimizes players’ performance,” says Rukaj. 
Powell-Fields echoes the same sentiments from his teammates. “The atmosphere is great. It gets the team’s adrenaline going to be on the field and hear the crowd when we make plays.”
“Having the crowd on your side allows you to really feel the momentum and energy, which can be tough for the other team to overcome once that momentum shifts to the home team,” explains freshman tight end Sean Binckes. 
Homecoming is important for the entire University. Everyone on campus has the ability to get together to have fun rooting on your friends and classmates. “Overall, Homecoming is a great experience for everyone to socialize with each other and show Post Pride and support athletics. I love what I do, love my teammates and love putting on a show for the people who watch,” explains Derham. 
Take Derham’s advice and show your Post Pride and attend this year’s Homecoming on Saturday, October 20. The football game starts at 1 p.m., but events are scheduled throughout the day. Pregame is slated for 12:30 p.m. You can listen to the game on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org.

The LIU Post women’s soccer team seemingly refuses to lose and now holds an eight-game winning streak, giving them the number one spot both in the East Region and in the East Coast Conference. On Thursday, October 11, the Pioneers beat Wilmington University 2-1 at home, before traveling down Northern Boulevard on Saturday, October 13, to beat New York Institute of Technology by a score of 3-1. 
The Pioneers kicked off the week by hosting the Wildcats from Wilmington University. They started the game strong, as it took sophomore defender Rebecca Swedberg19 minutes to find the back of the net to give the Pioneers a 1-0 lead. The Pioneers controlled the first half, outshooting the Wildcats 13-3, but went into halftime with only a one goal lead. 
The Wildcats answered in the 65thminute as a free kick was lofted into the box, and junior midfielder Jordanne Hoesli- Atkins evened the score at 1-1. It took the Pioneers two minutes to put themselves back ahead, as junior forward Alexa Niciforo slipped a pass through to junior midfielder Jeanine Ambrogi, who put the ball in by the post, to seal the game at 2-1. 
The Pioneers then traveled to neighboring NYIT to face off on Saturday, October 13. They did not waste any time in the first half as Niciforo put the Pioneers on the board early as sophomore midfielder Solveig Bjordal fed her the ball. Only three minutes later, freshman midfielder Hanna Westerling set freshman forward Susanne Vistnes up one on one with the goalie. Vistnes scored her thirteenth goal of the season as she found the back of the net. 
It took another 60 minutes before another goal was scored in the game, when NYIT’s senior midfielder Natasha Arana cut the Pioneers’ lead in half. However, it did not take long before Vistnes scored her fourteenth goal of the season, when she found an openingby the near post, giving the Pioneers their third score of the evening. 
Vistnes was delighted to get on the scoreboard again: “It was good to finally score some goals again, after I didn’t score earlier in the week,” said Vistnes. With14 goals and eight assists, she leads the Pioneers’ attack together with Niciforo, who has seven goals and seven assists on the season. “It looks like we have found a good link in the offense, between me, Alexa (Niciforo) and Hanna (Westerling), and it looks promising,” Vistnes said after the game. The Pioneers’ offense is one of strongest offenses in the country, as the trio has scored 28 out of the teams 37 goals so far. 
The Pioneers are currently 11-1-1 for the season and boast a perfect 6-0-0 record in the conference. The team returns to action on Wednesday, October 17, as it travels to Rockville Centre to face off against Molloy College (4-5-1) in another ECC matchup.

On Saturday, October 13, the LIU Post football team lost its fourth consecutive game to start the season against the West Chester University Golden Rams (5-2) by a final score of 41-6. The big story of the game was West Chester’s junior running back Ron¬dell White. On the ground, the play maker had 28 carries for 167 yards and one touchdown, as well as six receptions for 176 yards and three more touchdowns. 
Unfortunately for the Pioneers (2-4), the trend of scoring fewer points each week continued against the Golden Rams as the Pioneers scored only six points. The only points came early in the second quarter when sophomore quarterback Steven Laurino lofted a beautifully thrown ball to junior running back Anthony Brunetti for a 13-yard touchdown pass. The following extra point was unsuccessful, making the score 7-6 in favor of the Golden Rams. It seemed impossible at the time that the Golden Rams would be able to rattle off 34 unanswered points…but the team did just that. 
The Golden Rams, led by White and senior quarterback Mike Mattei, made quick work of the Pioneers’s struggling defense. On the afternoon, White had a ca¬reer-high343 all-purpose yards, good enough to be fourth all-time for West Chester University in a single game. White showed quick bursts, as well as the ability to shake off defenders with ease. It took more than an arm tackle to bring down this shifty back. Although completing below 50 percent of his passes, Mattei managed the game efficiently, not turning the ball over and passing four touchdowns. 
For the third time in his last four games, Laurino passed for less than 200 yards. Against the Rams, he was 22-35 for 189 yards and one touchdown. Yet again, there was not much to get excited about on the offensive side of the ball. Brunetti led the team in rushing on 14 carries for 49 yards. Junior running back Jeff Mack had six carries for 33 yards. Junior wide receiver Joe Botti led the teamwith85 yards receiving on five catches. 
One of the strengths all year for this Pioneers team has been the play of the special teams unit. However, even this group had its difficulties against a solid team like West Chester. Freshman kicker Tim Sternfeld had two kickoffs booted out of bounds, and missed an extra point attempt. In addition, on the initial kickoff to open the second half, sophomore defensive back Devon Levesque coughed up the ball to give the Rams great starting field position. If that was not enough, the Rams also blocked a punt during the game. 
For the first time this season, the Pioneers lost the turnover differential. The Pioneers fumbled the ball twice and turned the ball over on downs twice. Meanwhile, the Rams were nearly flawless and turned the ball over on downs once. 
LIU Post will look to rebound from the stinging, blow¬out loss against West Chester University as the Pioneers’ next game is Homecoming against Millersville University (2-5) on Saturday, October 20. Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org to hear all the game coverage. Pre-game is at 12:30 p.m. and kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

No. 2 West Chester University took the win over No. 8 LIU Post, 1-0, in overtime on Tuesday, October 9, in a PSAC East field hockey contest at Hickox Field. West Chester Golden Rams’ senior midfielder Michele Schrift shot the game-winning goal into the cage on a 10-yard shot out front in the 81st minute.
With the loss, LIU Post fell to 6-7 overall and 3-4 in conference action. The teams played through two scoreless halves before forcing an extra frame. The Golden Rams out shot the Pioneers, 22-15, and held a 21-7 advantage in penalty corners, including a 16-1 margin in the second half. 
Pioneers’ sophomore goalkeeper Becca May made a season-high15 saves in goal for LIU Post. On the other hand, West Chester University’s goalkeeper Kristin Arnold stopped nine shots to preserve the shutout win. 
In another home contest on Thursday, October 11, Pioneers’ junior forward Carlee Dragon scored a career-high five goals to lead eighth-ranked LIU Post past Mercy College in a 5-0 victory.

The men’s soccer team had their perfect season come to an end on Saturday, October 13, after a 2-1 loss to the NYIT Bears. Prior to the loss, the Pioneers had won 12 straight games this season. 
The week started off well for the Pioneers, when they defeated the sixth ranked U. Mass.-Lowell River Hawks by a score of 3-0 on Wednesday, October 11. It took just 15 minutes for LIU Post to get on the scoreboard. Junior back Eirik Bjoernoe put a shot past River Hawks goalie, Chris Malerie, and into the lower left hand corner of the net. 
The score remained the same into the second half. The Pioneers controlled the play for most of the game and eventually scored their second goal of the game in the 74thminute. Junior forward Cemil Turan fired a shot from the top right of the box and gave the Pioneers the 2-0 lead. Junior midfielder Jonathon Watkin added one more goal for LIU Post in the waning moments of the game to make the final score 3-0.
Pioneer junior keeper Marco Jorgensen made four saves in the win. It was also his fourth shutout of the season. LIU Post also held the advantage in shots, 18-9. 
But, the Pioneers’ winning streak came to an end on Saturday, October 13, when they traveled up Northern Boulevard to take on the Bears. During the first half, neither team produced a goal; the first 15 minutes of the second half rendered the same result. 
The Bears eventually opened up the scoring in the 64thminute off an unassisted goal by Herve Valcourt. NYIT added a second goal in the 78thminute to give them a 2-0 lead. The Pioneers cut the lead to one, when Bjoernoe scored off a penalty kick, but the team could not find the tying the goal. 
NYIT has always given the Pioneers a run for their money. Last season the Bears forced LIU Post to a 2-2 tie in their only regular season matchup, though they fell to them in the ECC Championships. The loss to rival NYIT was the first in five years during the regular season. 
The Pioneers did hold a slight shot advantage in the loss. They out shot the Bears 18-15, as well as held a 7-4 advantage in corner kicks. 
The loss was the Pioneers’ first of the year and first against an East Coast Conference team. The Pioneers still have the 7thranked offense in all of division two soccer. Their next game is against Philadelphia University in Philadelphia on Tuesday, October 16.

Chart-topping Rayna James (Connie Britton) is a country legend who’s had a career any singer would envy, but she’s not packing the arenas like she used to. Rayna’s record label thinks a concert tour, opening for up-and-comer Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere), the young and sexy future of country music, is just what Rayna needs. Sharing a stage with that disrespectful, untalented, little vixen is the last thing Rayna wants to do, which sets up a power struggle for popularity. 
ABC is going country with the drama Nashville and comedy Malibu Country starring Reba McEntire. Both new shows focus on two older darlings and their struggle to make it in the business. You have a choice in the country genre. If you have a hankering to experience some southern music, tune in to Nashville. The actors and actresses will be recording their own songs so viewers can get a taste of the country music capital of the world. You don’t have to love country music to go head over guitar with Nashville. The songs are plentiful along with tons of blackmailing and trickery as Rayna and Juliette compete to the top while trying to forget their demons from the past. “Nashville” was written by Callie Khouri (“Thelma & Louise”) who’s an executive producer. 
Nashville airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on ABC.

Helpful, effective and makes your life easier; these are three characteristics that every student looks for in any new product or service provided by their college or university. I must add “optional” to the list, since one thing students absolutely dislike is to be forced to do something, regardless of whether or not they would independently do it. How about the opportunity to access your courses and course materials online? Not during class time, not during your professor’s office hours and without having to wait for your professor to answer your emails. It also will not add to your workload, and will most probably make your life easier. Please allow me introduce you to…Blackboard.
Blackboard is an online tool that enhances learning and course management outside of the classroom. It is a big step away from traditional classrooms, enabling the communication of course requirements, materials, as well as projects in a virtual setting where physical presence is not required. Not only does it supplement on-campus courses, it also makes it possible for schools to offer fully on¬line classes, and thus, online-based degrees.
At LIU Post, Blackboard is used for both methods. Most commonly, professors utilize it to make course materials; including the syllabus, PowerPoint slides and any assignments; available to students anytime, any¬where. Some professors believe it is a good way to “Go Green”, leaving it at the discretion of the student to print out the materials. In addition, professors might upload optional readings that they believe would benefit students outside the classroom.
All the students I have interviewed believe that Blackboard is an extremely helpful and necessary educational vehicle. They believe it has numerous benefits and absolutely no flaws. Svetlana Martynovich, a senior in the international studies program, says, “I think Blackboard is useful and students need it because it organizes schoolwork and they can connect with their professors.” She says that “about half of my professors use it,” some more than others. She also claims that there are no inconveniences resulting from professors using Blackboard. Rather, when they do use it, it is very helpful and beneficial.
For most students, Blackboard is a lifeguard. When you see it listed on your syllabus, you wonder why the professor would bother to mention it if you are never required to access it. Just like the lifeguard sitting up there on the wooden pedestal, appearing to be doing nothing other than enjoying the nice ocean breeze. However, when that gigantic swell wave engulfs you, you will find the lifeguard right beside you pulling you onshore. That is Blackboard. When your car breaks down and you miss class, Blackboard will be waiting with the PowerPoint slides and assignment sheet. When you lose a handout that your professor gave you, Blackboard will already have a copy made for you. Also, if you were not present on the day your midterm exam was handed back, you don’t have to worry about emailing your professor or waiting until next class to get your grade. Just go online, login to Blackboard, and there it will be staring you in the face.
Of course, this seems too perfect to be true. It doesn’t have to be -it just depends on the professor. Some professors use Black¬board more than others, so how easy your life can get will be under his or her mercy. Alyssa Sciarratta, a senior in the accountancy program, says, “Not all of my professors use [Blackboard] and I wish they would because there may be many different assignments throughout the semester and I like how Black¬board keeps track of them for me.” She adds, “I would hope that eventually all professors would use and take advantage of the system, that way I don’t have to always check my email because if there is an announcement, I know it will be there.” Sciarratta also believes that Blackboard is just as convenient to professors as it is for students, “because professors can send out one mass message rather than keep track of emailing each student.”
I tend to agree with both Martynovichand Sciarratta. I believe Blackboard is an invaluable learning tool that is accompanied with many advantages for both students and professors. I love the fact that I can access and print the PowerPoint presentation for each chapter before class starts so I can follow along with the professor during class. I also love it when professors post grades on there, this way I don’t have to keep waiting until the next class or (if it is the end of the semester) I don’t have to email my professor and ask him or her for my final exam grade. In the future, I hope that many more professors start using Blackboard for more than just posting the syllabus, which as of now, according to our Information Technology Resource Center, is their only requirement.

Social media has its useful purposes. I’ve spoken before about people who become obsessed stalkers over their boyfriends/girlfriends Facebook or Twitter. Now I’m going to talk about the people who docu­ment their entire relationship via status updates. In my opinion, these people need to get it together because no one cares. Sorry if that’s a little harsh but, it’s the truth.
I have found that it is usually girls who commit this heinous crime to humanity. They post update after update, status after status about a fight they had with their boyfriend. They rant and rave about what a jerk he is and how he continually does stupid things that make them angry or upset. It usually ends with something like, “I just don’t know what to do.”
Guess what girl, we don’t either. I personally have a very busy life/schedule and do not have the time or the interest to read about your ongoing relationship crises. What baffles my mind though, is that these girls actually think people care. Maybe they don’t think people care, perhaps they are just looking for an outlet. That’s still not much of an excuse; these are highly personal occurrences. These are things you should talk about with your closest friends in private, or better yet talk to your actual boyfriend about them.
But, please, for my sanity, stop blowing up my news feed and time­line with this crap. It’s incredibly annoying and makes you look like you’re just looking for attention. It’s stupid and unnecessary.
Post’s like, “My boyfriend sucks…my life sucks…FML,” are the worst. Your life doesn’t suck; you suck for putting everyone you know through the agony of having to see this nonsense on a regular basis. If the situation were really that bad, you wouldn’t keep changing your status from“in a relationship” to “it’s complicated” to “single” and then right back to “in a relationship”. You would just break up with the idiot and get yourself together. Save the drama for you mama and leave ev­eryone else alone.

Are you a morning bird or night owl? Some students function better during the day and others function better at night. The stu­dents interviewed by the Pioneer were divided by their preferences for day or night classes. LIU Post offers classes from8:00-9:20 a.m. to 5:45-8:25 p.m. for undergraduate students. This allows students to choose what time is best for them. Students have mixed feelings about what time they prefer to have classes, with differing reasons. Some students say they favor night classes. They concentrate better at night and night classes allow them to work during the day. Others feel that they focus better during the day and would rather get classes over early.
Several students said they prefer classes at night because they are able to work better at that time. “I like my night classes better. It’s easier for me to concentrate during the night; I fall asleep easier during the day,” said Elina Viitasaari, a senior dual major in Criminal Justice and Psychology from Fin­land. Mikhail Grayaznov, a sophomore Busi­ness major from Moscow, Russia, agreed. “I want all of my classes at night; it’s hard for me to focus in the morning because I’m not awake yet,” said Grayaznov. He said he has one night class this semester, Business Law, from5:45 to 8:25 p.m.
Grayaznov’s other four classes are during the day. He says it is hard for him to focus in his two morn­ing classes at 8:00 to 9:20 a.m. and 9:30 to 10:50 a.m. “For me, it’s hard to wake up in the morning for class; when I do I am really sleepy and come back to my room to sleep after class because I stay up late at night,” said Grayaznov. He said he feels he would do better in his classes if they were all at night and that he will register early for classes for the spring semester to try to make this possible. Grayaznov said he stays up late at night and has a hard time falling asleep early. “I always stay up late and usually go to bed at 3 a.m. One of the reasons is that I speak to my friends and family in Russia,” said Grayaznov. There is an eight-hour time difference in Moscow.
Viitasaari agreed that there are many advantages to night classes. “It’s more conve­nient to go to classes once a week, do home­work once a week and the teachers usually let you out earlier,” said Viitasaari. She added that she thinks professors are more laid back at night. Viitasaari has three night classes this semester, Methods of Criminal Justice Research, Criminal Law and Experimental Psychology. “I enjoy my night classes more because there are older students at the class­es, there are teenagers in my day classes,” said Viitsaari. She said her other four classes are during the day and she finds it more dif­ficult to concentrate in them.
Yet other students disagree, preferring class during the day. “I like day classes better because I like to get everything over with and enjoy the rest of my day,” said Jessica Love­land, a junior Nutrition major. She said she has four classes during the day and one class, Statistics, at 5:45 to 8:25 p.m. James Grady, a sophomore Criminal Justice major agreed. “I prefer day classes because it’s not too early where I can’t function and it’s not too late that I’m stuck at school all day,” he said. Grady said he prefers classes from11 a.m. to 4:50 p.m. He has three classes during the day and two classes at night.
Although Loveland and Grady say they can tolerate night classes, they have reasons why they don’t prefer those classes. “I don’t like night classes because they interfere with my dinner; I eat early before my class and then I’m starving after,” said Loveland. However, she said she can pay attention in both her day classes and night class. Grady has a different reason why he prefers classes during the day. “When I have a night class, I feel like I’m stuck at school and my whole day is gone,” said Grady. He commutes to school and feels he is unable to do anything else when he has a night class.
Some students do not have a choice be­tween day and night classes. Graduate classes at LIU Post are generally available from5 to 7 p.m., 7 to 9 p.m. and 9 to 11 p.m. Many graduate students enjoy having only night classes. “I prefer classes at night, so I can do a lot during the day; I would not like classes during the day,” said Mina Tang, a graduate Nutrition major from China. Tanghas classes during the class periods of 5 to 7 p.m. and 7 to 9 p.m. “Even though it’s tiring, there are things I have to do, like work, during the day,” said Tang. She says she works at International Student Services and does homework for classes during the day.
So when you are picking your classes for the spring semester, think about whether you function better during the day or night. The time of your classes can make a differ­ence in how well you do. Depending on your major and class, the choice could be up to you. As a Journalism major, I have never had a class at night because I never found a class for Media Arts available at this time. I am not a morning person, so I would have liked to experience a night class to compare which time I focused better in. Certain classes are only offered during the day and other classes are only offered at night. Generally, I found that Business, Statistics, Law and Criminal Justice classes are offered at night. Then there are some core classes that are available during both the day and night.

Are you having trouble managing your classes, workload and that very small amount of time at your fingertips? Is this your very first semester in college and you just don’t know how to adapt to the fast-paced, demanding environment? Or do you currently have a job that takes away from precious time you could spend reading your textbooks or completing assignments? I’m going to let you in on a few invaluable methods that will help solve your problems and achieve as many “A’s” as possible in your college years. I have used these methods while attending college for the past three years, both at Suffolk County Community College and here at LIU Post, and as a senior with a perfect grade point average, I can tell you they really do work.
1.Take advantage of RateMyProfessors.com
Before you enroll in any class, you must access the ultimate website for information about almost all the professors teaching in just about all the colleges and universities in the United States, reviewed by students just like you and me. One of my professors once said, “You must shop around for your professors,” and he was absolutely right. This is how I look at it: if I had the option of taking a class with an easy and understanding professor who would give me a moderate work load and is fair in the grading of exams and assignments, versus another professor who is very strict, gives too much work, and will only give you an A if you agree with his opinions, I will definitely choose the former. Why? Simple – it makes my life easier. A good professor will probably make you like (some¬times even love) the course, even if it is a liberal arts elective that you absolutely have to take. From experience, I have found most of the reviews on the website to be accurate and very helpful. For one of the classes I took this past year, I had the option of choosing one of two professors. Bothhad good reviews, but one was said to be more difficult and requires more work than the other. Since I had a heavy work load for that semester, I decided to take the easy way out in order to pay more attention to my other classes. Balance is the key. However, remember to not take these too literally, students can be harsh and unfair critics sometimes.
2. Balance your courses
You should try your best to choose your courses for each semester with a balance between very hard and very easy. What I mean by this is if you know you will be taking a very challenging class next semester, when preparing your schedule try to choose other classes that will be less challenging. For example, accounting majors begin their core requirements in their second year and as a result, when they get to their junior year they have to take three accounting classes, such as inter¬mediate accounting, taxation and cost accounting, in each semester. Since this is a part of the accounting program, you don’t have much of a choice. However, you should take advantage of that freedom and try to strike a balance between their levels of difficulty with an interesting free elective course.
3. Map out your week
This is one of the most important techniques I have learned in college and I highly recommend that every individual makes the most of it, whether they are still in school, in college, or out in the business world. This will help you in organizing, handling and succeeding in your classes as well as work and life in general. At the end of each week, I rip a sheet of paper out of my notebook and write down, whether from memory or from my planner, any homework due, any tests I have to study for, any pending projects, any papers I have to write, etc. I try to write it in order of importance, or just star the ones that are most important. I put this on my desk or hang it on the wall. As I complete each assignment, I put a check mark next to the number. As more assignments are due, I add them to the list. I don’t always finish all of the assignments I have for that weekend, so those that I don’t finish I carry forward to the next sheet of paper for the next week. I usually have “work on ____ project” on for a few weeks to remind myself to perform little bits of it over an extended period of time rather than cramming it all to the weekend before its due (hey, you never know, you might have an exam that week as well). I highly advise you to try this and am sure you will find it to be a crucial time-management and organization tool. This list (or map) will show you the magnitude of the work you have for that week and will help you in deciding what you will do when and whether or not you can treat yourself to a day off on the upcoming weekend. 
4.Weigh your priorities
School can make having time for yourself very difficult. Not only do you have to go to your classes, you also have to read chapters, do homework and other assignments or research projects, study for exams, or work a part-time job. As a result, most of the time you can’t watch your favorite TV shows, go to the theater to watch the new releases, or even attend career fairs on campus! Of course this depends on your course load and what year you are in. The closer you get to graduation, the less time you will have to do those things you love. But you definitely need to take out time for yourself, whether it’s once a week or once a month. You need to put the entire “college student” on the side and be able to have fun without thinking about studying for a whole day. As a senior, especially considering that I am in the process of writing my thesis, I laugh at myself for even thinking this, but I try to make it happen as often as possible. However, you need to weigh your priorities. Say you haven’t went out with your friends for two weeks, but on Monday you have an exam. Are you going to go out this weekend? It depends. Do you have the time? How much studying do you have to do for that exam? Have you already reviewed the material you learned in each chapter or did you not even look at it? Do you have any other assignments due? These are all things you need to consider before deciding. Look at that list you made and see how much you have to do. If you can afford a day or half a day off, take it!
5. Don’t wait until the last minute
Yes, I know you always hear this and that you are probably sick of hearing it. Everybody is always telling you not to leave things for the last minute, especially your professors. Marissa Lant, a sophomore speech pathology major said, “Every night, recall what you have taken in all your classes for that day” and as a result, when you study for the exam, “You’re not relearning the material, you’re just reviewing it.” At the end of each say she thinks about each class and remembers what was discussed. As a result, come the day before the exam, she just goes over her notes and is good to go. No pressure, no stress. As for me, I like to make index cards for the classes with a lot of memorization. Make them for each chapter as it is discussed in class so you don’t have to do the mall in one day (which takes forever). Then, take them with you and review them whenever you can: in a break between classes or while eating your lunch. Take advantage of every minute – it will pay off in the end! Khadejah Bhutta, a sophomore in the early childhood education program agreed. she said, “You usually find out that you’re having a test a week or two before the actual date, so don’t leave studying for it until the last minute.” She also likes the index card approach and says that study sheets are great. Bhutta also advises that you spend “30 minutes each day to go through them.” Basically, don’t cram all the information to the day before the exam and you will be less stressed and much more prepared to get an A.
6.Finally, do what you enjoy!
I’m sure you’ve heard it before: “If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.” By this they don’t mean get a degree in “your favorite hobby.” Rather, make sure you truly enjoy what you’re studying because it will be what you do for the rest of your life. Right now, these years you spend here in college, they will decide your future. Take me as an example. I am an accounting major and I absolutely love it. It is truly my passion and so many people tell me they can see that in my eyes when I talk about it. I enjoy all the accounting classes I work very hard in them because I care about learning the material and I do very well in the end. I volunteered to prepare tax returns last spring, and I enjoyed it so much I cannot wait to do it again this upcoming spring. I am writing my Honors thesis and am enjoying the research process and finding the information to be very captivating. I plan to pursue my master’s degree, get certified as a CPA and then pursue my PhD. I cannot wait to start my job, not because I need the money, but because I cannot wait to start a career I know I will enjoy for the rest of my life. Do you truly like your major? Do you see yourself dealing with this information for the next thirty or forty years? Most importantly, never think “it’s too late to change my major; I’m already two or three years into this.” Two or three years now is nothing compared to twenty years down the road
Other Tips:
-Try to show up to every class so you don’t miss the professor’s explanation of the material
-Put aside time to read the chapter and go over some questions at the end.
-If the course requires a lot of memorization, use index cards!
-Forma relationship with your professor by participating in class or talking to him or her at the end of class.
-Get your work in on time and do extra credit work if your professor allows you.
-Work hard in the beginning and it will pay off in the end.

Just admit it; most students think about food rather often throughout the day. Towards the end of class, on our way to our next class, even driving away from school or walking to the dorms, the thought of what to eat is right there with us. I think it’s safe to say we put a lot of emphasis on what we give our bodies as fuel to get us through our school days. “Fall is all about change! Changing leaves, changing weather, so why not use it as a time to change your eating habits,” says Shelbi Thurau, Nutrition Club President, “These recipes sneak in healthy ingredients like vegetables, fruits and whole grains while still providing a delicious taste.” So what are the best foods to get in our systems this fall? 
As the brown, orange and green leaves fall ever so lightly off the branches of the trees, I’m thinkingwe should feel as light as they do, without sacrificing the ‘good stuff.’ The Nutrition Club at LIU Post held its Fall Student Open House on Tuesday, October 2 in the Nutrition Department of Pell Hall. The members of the club prepared some fall foods that I’m starting to crave. 
One of the nine dishes was roasted local butternut squash with cranberries that had me going back for more. Mandy Li, a nutrition major, has given The Pioneer the recipe. 
Ingredients:
2 butternut squashes (peeled and diced)
1 large red onion (julienned)
½ cup of dried cranberries
¼ cup of chopped parsley
4 tablespoons of olive oil or canola oil
salt and pepper to taste 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Toss butternut squash, 3 table¬spoons of oil, salt and pepper together and spread onto a rimmed sheet pan. Roast for 30-45 minutes, until squash is caramelized and fork tender. While that’s happening, sauté onions with the rest of the oil, when the squash is ready, toss onions, cranberries and parsley together in a bowl and dig in. Thanks Mandy! 
Butternut squash is one of those foods that you can do a lot with: a soup, a salad, or even a side dish. My personal favorite is creamy butternut squash soup with a piece of whole wheat toast. It also provides great nutrients. Each cup of cubed butternut squash gives us almost 300 percent of our daily intake of vitamin A, which is great for our skin eye pigment and teeth; 50 percent of vitamin C, for our immune system and overall health; 7 percent calcium, for strong bones; and a whopping 3 grams of fiber and 16 grams of carbohydrates! So grab one, try this recipe or make up your own. But that wasn’t the only dish that tasted like fall. 
Shelbi prepared a mushroom and asparagus quinoa salad that rocked a party for my taste buds.
Ingredients: For the Salad
1 small red onion
1 tablespoon of olive oil
1 clove of garlic (chopped)
1 cup of white button mush¬room(sliced)
1 cup of red bell pepper
8 asparagus spears (cut into ½ inchpieces)
½ cup of pecorino Romano cheese
1 cup of dry quinoa
½ teaspoon of fresh thyme
¼ teaspoon of ground pep¬per
2 cups of low sodium chicken broth
For the Dressing:
1 tablespoon of olive oil
4 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon of lemon juice 
Sauté the onions in olive oil until tender then add the garlic for another minute. Add the sliced mushrooms, asparagus and peppers, cook until soft. Add the quinoa, thyme and pepper and cook for two minutes. Add the chicken stock, cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until the quinoa is al dente. For the dressing, combine and toss with the warm salad and enjoy. 
There are so many different salads that are suitable for the fall that just give you a warm feeling and are surprisingly good for you. Quinoa is a whole grain that is a great source of complex carbohydrates, a powerhouse for protein with8 grams in one cooked cup, 5 grams of fiber and 39 grams of energy packed carbohydrates. It’s low in cholesterol, has a nutty taste and chewy texture. A cup of cooked quinoa also offers 15 percent of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance of iron, which helps to deliver oxygen to the blood, boosting energy and brain power. Quinoa’s vitamin B content can help keep our minds sharp, maintain our brain volume and stabilize our mood. That sounds like a good choice for students. Now how about something for that sweet tooth? 
Energy bites are exactly what they sound like, a bite full of energy and whole lot of goodness. Carolyn Leonard, a senior nutrition major, gives us this peanut butter and chocolate chip recipe for you to enjoy: 
Ingredients:
1 cup of oatmeal
½ cup of peanut butter
1/3 cup of honey
1 cup of coconut flakes
½ cup of mini chocolate chips
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 
Mix everything in a large bowl. Then chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. After it’s chilled, roll into circular globes of your desired size. Store in an airtight container in the fridge, let them set into their ball shape and then pop those bad boys on the go. 
Oatmeal is another one of those super foods that fill you up and has lots of benefits. One cup of cooked oatmeal gives us 11 grams of protein, 56 grams of complex carbohydrates and 8 grams of fiber. Oatmeal is definitely something I always have around the house. It’s a great way to start any school day and get amped for a long day of classes. 
If you’re looking for a quick pump me up bite or a warm bowl of fall, these recipes go a long way. The Nutrition Club has many more great fall recipes. Visit them on the third floor of Pell Hall or email them at nutritionpresident@gmail.com.
