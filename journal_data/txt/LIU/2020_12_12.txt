With Winter break quickly approaching, students are not only preparing for finals, but preparing to return home.  This will look different for many students at Post this year due to the pandemic. 
“I will be travelling a whole 2,459 miles to my home in Tualatin, Oregon,” said Sophomore musical theatre major Saffron Cooper.
Cooper has some exciting plans for the break.
She said “I plan to spend time with my family, consume content and play games like ‘Mario Kart’ and ‘Minecraft’.”
Cooper will also be continuing her studies independently at home.
“I also will be continuing in my individual artistic work by applying to work opportunities and auditioning,” she said.
Other than working, she also looks forward to relaxation time.
“I am looking forward to slowing down and taking some time to rest, following what has been such a hectic semester,” said Cooper.
Freshman adolescence education social studies major Sara Conroy has been planning her Winter break as well.
“I am very excited to have a long break before a stressful Spring semester,”  said Conroy.  “My plans include preparing for Spring semester and moving on campus.”
Conroy, like Cooper, will be traveling.
“I will only be travelling once for a weekend to visit my family in Florida,” Conroy said.
Conroy and Cooper have plans to keep themselves and others safe during and following the break.
“As someone who is immunocompromised, I urge everyone to be mindful of others.  I will be social distancing, wearing a mask and practicing good hand hygiene, as should anyone else.” said Cooper.
Conroy agrees, “Although I will be briefly travelling, I think it is important to practice social distancing, wear a mask, and limit travel when possible.”
After break, they will be returning to campus, and plan on doing this as safely as possible.
“I plan on both quarantining and taking a COVID test prior to moving in,” said Cooper.
“I will quarantine before moving on campus and get tested,” said Conroy.
Both of them plan to have a safe, yet fun Winter break, and are appreciative of LIU and their respective programs for allowing them to enjoy their time off.
Cooper said, “I am inspired every day by the resilience and strength of my colleagues in the Post Theatre Company.  I know I will enjoy my time at home, but I will also be eager to get back to working together in February.”

Black Friday is one of the most well known days of the shopping season. People storm to the stores in hopes to get a majority of their holiday shopping done with major sales. This year on Friday Nov.27 Black Friday was held a little differently. Most stores did not open until Friday evening when usually they open Thursday night in anticipation of thousands of shoppers looking to make big purchases. Along with opening much later than usual some stores switched to strictly remote shopping and deals to deal with Covid-19. 
Johnson Scoggins, an LIU sophomore majoring in Music Technology Entrepreneurship and Production stayed home from the stores this Black Friday. Johnson said, “For Black Friday I looked for deals for a few select electronics, saw that no place in the store was selling them so I decided to shop online.”“While shopping online I got emails for a bunch of other stuff I ended up buying from Vineyard Vines which had 70% off their site world wide, a few things on Amazon, Patagonia, and greek letters. Originally I was just looking for the PS5 and Xbox Series X deals anywhere, and didn’t find them because they are new and stores didn’t want people crowding to try and get the very few that were available in stores so they just sold more amounts online for less discount.” 
The new PS5 and Xbox were being sold on numerous sites at a specific time to avoid the lines of crazy shoppers and to maintain social distancing. Walmart was one of the many stores to offer the online drop of the PS5 at 9 p.m.
Johnson also said, “It wasn’t like I didn’t want to go out and shop in stores but the stores just didn’t have what I was looking for so I went online for more of a variety and they had the same deals as in store.”
Olivia Fanntigrossi, a freshman majoring in business administration said, “I shopped online this Black Friday and also went out. Although I did both, I liked shopping in person a lot more because I could see and feel the clothes better, but three were also really good deals online.” 
Although Black Friday this year was a socially distanced one, stores still managed to get people online or safely in the stores to spend some money and get themselves and others’ holiday gifts.
