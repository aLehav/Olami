Dear Readers,
Due to the onset of Snowstorm Juno, The Pioneer has opted out of publishing a print version for our first issue. Instead, we’ve published an abbreviated, online-only issue this week to keep the campus community informed despite the blizzard. Look out for our special double print issue on campus and online next Wednesday, Feb. 4. Stay safe, and stay warm!
Sincerely,
Alyssa Seidman & Maxime Devillaz

The Office of Campus Life has big plans for the spring semester. “We’re not about maintaining the status quo. We’re not about maintaining programs that have been here year after year. If it’s a program that has been successful, we’re going to keep it, and we’re going to continue to make it better. I think that’s what we’ve been lacking: the new and innovative ideas that keep Campus Life looking fresh,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life.
Spring Fling Week is going to be built up, centering on Relay for Life and the Spring Concert. The week will take place in the third week of April, and the artist performing at the concert will be announced in the upcoming weeks. Campus Life also has plans to revitalize Pratt After Dark, a late night carnival in the Pratt Center that will take place on March 20. There are also two chapters being added to Greek Life – both Delta Zeta and Sigma Alpha Epsilon has agreed to come to Post in the spring.
A community service month is planned for the spring semester, but the dates have not yet been announced. Relay for Life, a walk to raise money for cancer research, will also return in the third week of March, and two community outreach trips are planned for the spring. There will be an alternative spring break in Costa Rica from March 8-13, which has already closed out with 12 students attending the service trip. There is also going to be an overnight trip to Washington D.C., where students will help to feed the homeless and work in soup kitchens. The trip is set to take place on Feb. 27-28. Information for the trip will be released soon, and is expected to be an affordable trip for interested students.
Campus Life works hard to create new events and activities each semester. During the Fall 2014 semester, Campus Life created Midnight Madness, a late night basketball game that had over 1,000 attendees and an overwhelmingly positive response from students. Additionally, Holidays in Hillwood were revitalized, moving the event to the evening and even adding an ice-skating rink in the Fishbowl.
Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major, makes it a point to get involved in several activities across campus. O’Connell is a student ambassador and president of CHATS, an organization meant to help international students assimilate to being in a new country by pairing them with American students. “I go to all of my CHATS events! Karaoke is my favorite, but origami was awesome too. I like to go to all of the big events on campus like Holidays in Hillwood, Pratt After Dark, and this year I went to Midnight Madness. I try to make it to all the welcome events too, as well as any events my friends hold – like the Snow Ball.”
The Office of Campus Life is also involved in upgrades being made to the residence halls this semester. They brought in a new vending machine company, added coffee machines and Dippin’ Dots machines in all of the dorms and in academic buildings across campus last semester. They have worked to add flat screen televisions in the common rooms of all the dorms, and replaced old furniture in the study lounges to make them more inviting.
Perhaps the biggest improvement has been their effort to tackle the issue of broken machines in the laundry room that have long been a major complaint for residents. This semester, machines will be replaced and new services will be offered once the process of reviewing different laundry services is complete.
“I know Riggs just got a new TV for one of its lounges, along with the new furniture, and vending machines. There’s lots of those kinds of updates happening; we’re going for Res Halls for the 21st century. And really I love these changes; even the fresh coats of paint just make the buildings look better. Also, I know that Riggsians and everyone across campus can look forward to another Riggspocolypse,” said Ian Boswell, a senior Film major, who is a resident assistant in Riggs Hall. Last year, Riggspocolypse, a zombie themed relay race that took place on Oct. 27, was an immediate success. Over 40 students attended the event.
The Office of Campus Life is located in room 102 of Hillwood Commons. To find out more about all the activities and programs this semester, check out tinyurl.com/liupostcampuslife, or follow them on Twitter and Instagram @PostCampusLife and on Facebook at LIU Post Campus Life.

The Fall 2014 semester ended with a blunt reminder of Mother Nature’s stormy strength. On Dec. 9, the excessive rain unleashed multiple leaks and floods on campus. There were three sizeable leaks in the roof of Hillwood in front of Subway and the café. Also, there was flooding in the north end of the basement of Humanities. The front stairway to the basement was closed, and about three to four classrooms were redirected from the flooded area and relocated upstairs.
“It seems like the money being spent to improve the campus is going to the wrong places,” said Angelo Pellegrino, a senior Computer Science major. “They should have fixed the leaky ceiling at Hillwood and any drainage issues on campus, instead of planting new bushes.”
“The flooding in Humanities was not serious,” said William Kirker, Director of Facilities Services. “It only affected the lower level on the north end [of Humanities]. There was a drain in a window well that was backed up due to the excessive rain we had on that day. It did not cause any damage. It was just an inconvenience for a couple of hours. It was primarily contained in the hall, but did go under a couple doors to classrooms.”
The water in Humanities was removed using wet vacuums and mops. Kirker explained, what happened the classes that were held in the basement when the flooding occurred. “A couple of the classes scheduled at the time, at that end of the building, were relocated upstairs in Humanities. The problems that occurred on Dec. 9 were limited in size and location. Things were isolated and made safe.”
“There was no flooding in Hillwood,”Kirker said. “There were leaks that were contained. There was no flooding like in Humanities that had much more water coming in. In Hillwood, the leaks were primarily in front of Subway and in front of the server entrance.”
“They should fix all of the roofs. The theater building floods when the snow starts to melt or when it rains,” said Jane Gemmell, a senior Electronic Media major. However, Kirker was not aware of any problems with flooding or leaks in the theater building. “I’m not specifically aware of this. I assume [she] is talking about the Little Theater building.” Kirker recommends students to “go to the building/program director to have them report…with some details” any leakage or damages they may notice along campus so they can investigate the problem and fix it. “I will try to follow up with whom I think manages the building,” Kirker said.
Despite the leaks and floods, Kirker added that Post is prepared for any emergency thrown its way. “The campus is prepared for a major storm as best as any place can be. Every storm presents its own issues that must be dealt with. You learn from what has happened in the past, and are ready to react to what may or may not happen.”
As to whether the problems are fixed as they occur, or whether there are future plans for renovations to prevent similar problems (such as fixing the roofs), Kirker responded, “The answer to this is yes to both. We fix problems as they occur every day. We also are constantly planning to make repairs/renovations to deal with aging buildings so that problems are addressed before they occur.”

It has been an unfortunate start of the spring semester for some of Post’s commuter students. On Jan. 20, the first day of classes, the off-campus shuttle did not show up either in Hicksville or on campus until after noon. Meanwhile, the shuttle’s limited amount of seats is continuing to force some students to pay for alternative transportation, or to be late for class.
Last semester, The Pioneer reported that the free shuttle, which travels between campus, Broadway Mall, and the Hicksville train station, is a popular transportation method for commuter students. However, its 25-person occupancy limit has made it a daily battle for students who want to get a spot on the shuttle and make it to school on time. In Oct. 2014, Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life, said that SGA and Campus Life are considering making changes to the shuttle service, but explained “it is not going to happen overnight.”
Due to a misunderstanding between LIU Post and Abraham’s Transportation Services – the company who own and run the shuttle – the shuttle did not show up before noon on Tuesday, according to Berthel. Rebecca Tigerholm , a junior Finance major, was waiting for the expected 9 a.m. shuttle for over 30 minutes before she decided to take the N20 bus. “I ended up being 40 minutes late for class. My friends decided not to go to class at all because they were too embarrassed,” she said.
Berthel confirmed the mistake, and said the shuttle has been running according to schedule since midday Tuesday. However, students are once again experiencing a lack of seats.
The least expensive transportation alternative for students who can’t use the shuttle is the N20 bus, where a ticket costs $2.50. However, according to junior Economics major Oliver Hollingsaeter, the bus is often late and inconsistent. The other option is to take a cab, which can cost up to $15 per person.
Berthel said that the school is still looking at options on how to solve the transportation problem, and that the community will be informed as soon as something is decided.
Siri Birkeland, a junior Political Science major said the shuttle situation is a daily problem for commuter students, and she described it as urgent. “Most students simply can’t afford to take a cab to school every other day,” Birkeland said. “We need a transportation system that works, and where we can be sure to get to school on time.”

The Music Department, in conjunction with the Rockley Family Foundation, held a public instrument sale at the Tilles Center during the weekend of Jan. 2, to raise money for new instrument donations to the department. The foundation provided the instruments for the sale, including pianos, keyboards, guitars, and orchestral string instruments. The foundation then used the funds to provide gifts to the music department in the form of new instruments.
The Rockley Family Foundation is a nonprofit organization geared towards promoting music education through music scholarships and donation of instruments. They hold similar sales with other schools and organizations around America in the hopes of enriching the music education and experience of students.
“Tobin Rockley approached the department last spring,” said Jennifer Miceli, the chairperson of the Music Department. “And it was agreed that we would work together to hold an instrument sale at the Tilles Center.” As a result of the sale of the instruments, the Rockley Family Foundation would provide a donation in the form of musical instruments and equipment to the department.
Although Noel Zahler, Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts is not sure how much money was raised, the sale was a success. When he walked into the Tilles Atrium on Monday, Jan. 5, a good number of pianos were tagged and waiting to be delivered to locals. One Post student also worked with the foundation at the sale, which, Zahler said, was an opportunity for students to find well-paid work, and also to be a part of a unique experience. Zahler is optimistic that an event like this might occur again in the future. “Anytime we can accommodate a good cause that has benefit for the campus, we should probably do it,” Zahler said.
“I think the sale was a great idea, especially for promoting the Music Department,” said Emily Plunkett, a junior Music Education major. Plunkett, along with Joe Donnolo, a junior Instrumental Performance major, agreed that the sale would be beneficial to the department since new instruments for LIU would mean students would not have to scramble to use and share the few instruments the department already owns.
“Unfortunately for percussion instrumentalists, our school has only one set of the instruments,” Donnolo added..Donnolo hopes the donations to the department will include percussion instruments.
Aside from percussion instruments, Plunkett and Donnolo would like to see more string instruments available in the Music Department. Not only are they small enough to transport to different buildings on campus, they would also give non-music majors and musicians without their own instruments a chance to learn the instruments by taking advantage of our music ensembles and private lessons.
The instrument donations from the Rockley Family Foundation will indeed include string instruments and a very expensive wireless system that “otherwise [the Music Department] wouldn’t be able to purchase,” Zahler said.

Many students do not keep a car on campus. Using the shuttle requires following a schedule, and calling for taxis can be expensive. In Oct. 2014, LIU Post made the Zip Car service available as another option for students who need a mode of transportation on campus. For students who actively need a car and cannot afford to use a taxi service every day, the Zip Cars are a useful alternative.
In order to use these cars, available in the residential parking lots on campus, students first have to make an account and get approved by Zip Car for the car service. Once approved, students will receive their own “Zip Card,” available on their cellphones, and they can begin to reserve cars. The “Zip Card” unlocks one of the available cars, and gives students access to use them.
The cost for students to join Zip Car is only $25, with additional rates starting at $7.50 per hour for the use of a car or $69 per day. Zip Car rates will increase to $35 after the first year of membership. This membership allows students to use the car service wherever Zip Cars are located or available; it is not restricted to the cars available on campus. Gas, insurance, and roughly 180 miles of driving per day are included in the monthly rates.
The Zip Car service was launched in late October by the Sustainability Committee at Post, and is available to all students, graduate and undergraduate. However, many students are still unaware of the new service. The Zip Cars have received mixed reviews from the students. To some, the Zip Cars seem unnecessary, while to others they seem useful.
“I don’t think that the Zip Cars [will] be that useful for the students that commute because most students already have their own cars, so I would only really see a need for dormers to use them,” said Mariel Bourie, a commuter student, and freshman Music Education major. “Personally I would rather just use a taxi; it’s cheaper and more convenient.”
“I think the Zip Cars are useful for dorming students because a lot of us don’t have cars to drive, so it’s hard to go off campus,” said residential student, Amber Castle, a sophomore Public Relations major. “I would definitely use the Zip Cars provided by the campus, once I get my license.”
There are currently two Zip Cars on campus, but that is subject to change if the new service becomes popular enough among its users. Students can find out more about the Zip Cars by going to www.zipcars.com/liupost.

In lieu of the Paris shootings this month at the satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo, the issue of offensive speech has become a hot topic. Around noon on Jan. 7, two terrorists with a plan to silence a loud voice in French media took their guns and opened fire at the magazine’s offices, killing 12 people.
On Jan. 8, a policewoman was shot and killed in Paris; the murder of the policewoman was linked to the terrorist attacks. On Jan. 9, another terrorist, allegedly associated with the Charlie Hebdo killers, emerged and took several hostages at a Jewish supermarket in Paris, killing four people. On Jan. 9, the two terrorists responsible for the shootings at the magazine were captured and killed outside of Paris, ironically at a printing press. The third one was killed in the Jewish supermarket that same day. Seventeen innocent people were killed in those three days of terror.
How far can you go with words and drawings? Is it okay to offend people and their religion in order to make a statement? I say that the more restrictions that are put on the media, the further we move towards a closed society, which is NOT a good thing. The media should be able to comment, write, and draw whatever is needed to make a valid point or to contribute to a social debate.
The media is not supposed to take sides in any story. It should only promote the unbiased debate. If this is done using satirical, comical drawings, or using the power of the spoken and written word, then that is a good thing. It helps to keep our society open and holds people in power responsible. If religion is made a taboo for the media, then how do we expect to have an open debate about issues that surrounds it?
This unforgivable act of violence against innocent people was all done because of a loud voice that exercised its rights of freedom of speech and expression. To maintain the open debate and our free society, the media — and others — need to be able to offend people. Whether that be politicians, celebrities, people who belong to a religion, atheists, school officials, whomever, as long as it serves the greater good and keeps our society open, our social debate alive, and our freedoms protected.

We are now in the thick of awards season, with the Golden Globes already behind us and the Academy Awards coming up on Feb. 22. Bradley Cooper, Steve Carrell, Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep are just a few of the familiar faces one can easily spot on magazine covers, as wild predictions are made about just who may win that coveted Oscar.
Yet, there are always films and actors that receive much less press attention, at least to the casual viewer. Foreign and independent films often deal with themes and stories that don’t typically fit the mainstream palette, but deserve attention just as much as their big studio film competitors. Here are four (hopefully) worthy films that may not have shown up on the radar of the average filmgoer in 2014.
“Force Majeure” is perhaps the most sociological comedy flick of the year. This Swedish film chronicles the weeklong stay of a family who take a skiing trip in the French Alps. They are, by all means, regular people. Tomas (Johannes Kuhnke) is a businessman, taking some time off from work with his wife Ebba (Lisa Loven Kongsli) and their young children. Tomas’ masculinity is plunged into question when his survival instincts get the better of him – he runs away from a controlled avalanche that seems like it may overtake a mountainside café, leaving his family to fend for themselves. He returns soon after, but denies his actions.
This is a film of questions. What defines manhood? What defines parenthood? These concepts may seem heavy, but “Force Majeure” plays them out in a subtle, comedic way; compounding the humor in awkward and tense situations, driven by a choice lingering within the frame of the cinematography. The film was snubbed for an Oscar nomination, but received attention at the Golden Globes. “Force Majeure” can be viewed on iTunes and Amazon Prime.
“Ida” is a Polish drama, nominated for both Best Foreign Language Film and Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards. The film, set in the 1960s, tells the story of a young nun named Anna (Agata Trzebuchowska), who is tasked by her superiors to visit an estranged relative before taking her vows. This story has the complexities allowed by simplicity: the lead character sets out on a clear objective, but weaved into her innocent interactions with a somewhat foreign world are rich insights into her religion, family, sexuality, and the looming presence of the Stalinist regime of the time.
While shot in black in white, “Ida” seems to suppress the innate colorful peppiness of 60’s culture – one scene involving a band that plays in a bar is exciting, but demands color and is never given it. Perhaps this all works to the effect of creating a sketch of post-war Poland filled with uncertainty as well as change. “Ida” can be viewed on Netflix, iTunes, and Amazon Prime.
“Virunga” is an Academy-Award nominated documentary that first appeared at the Tribeca Film Festival in April. Director Orlando Von Einsiedel weaves the stories of four characters, all of whom struggle to protect the Virunga National Park – a region of the Democratic Republic of Congo that has highly sought after oil beneath it, but is home to a family of endangered mountain gorilla, as well as other wildlife, and a fishing village. Opening with the funeral of a park ranger, the doc centers on the ongoing involvement of European interest groups with African countries with precious resources, and their dealings with the violent and constantly changing political groups taking power.
Tensions escalate as armed conflict approaches the park borders. Gorilla caretaker André Bauma displays the very human qualities of the animals that face the threat of poachers and the incoming militants. The park is spearheaded by chief-warden Emmanuel de Merode and head park-ranger Rodrigue Mugraka Katembo; the pair work tirelessly with their men to protect the park from the involvement of the British Company Soco International, a group that appears to be capitalizing on conflict. Mélanie Gouby, a French journalist, unearths evidence of corruption. Her investigation leads to conversations with representatives from Soco. The film is, above all, a story of how nature in the Congo is at risk, and yet still being protected by a select few despite harsh adversity and turmoil in the country. “Virunga” is now streaming on Netflix.
“The Babadook” is an Australian psychological horror film unlike the majority of scare fare that has come out in the last few years. The film focuses intensely on the relationship between a very troubled young boy named Samuel (Noah Wiseman) and his single mother Amelia (Essie Davis). After the imaginary creature from a bedtime story seemingly becomes too real, the duo spiral down into a world of isolation and disbelief. The titular villain is the epitome of childhood nightmares, the type of thing that you thought you saw in the dark corners of your room in the middle of the night.
Where many horror films rely on cheap pop-out thrills, “The Babadook” anchors the fear in its main characters, and has more than one deep moment of sadness that ups the stakes and tension. “The Babadook” is available on Amazon Prime and iTunes.

There are as many interests as there are people on campus. With a healthy creative milieu, students can indulge themselves in the world of art and entertainment, both for credits and for fun. The privileges range from hands on work in a professional radio station, an on-campus TV station, theatre, art lectures, guest speakers, and other events.
The Post Television Club (PTV) is holding its first meeting of the semester on Thursday, Jan. 29 at 12:30 in the television studio on the second floor of Humanities. Tom Finn, senior Broadcasting major and co-president of the club, said they’re looking forward to seeing fresh faces and hearing new ideas.
“We have two set things going. A news cast every week and a comedy show, sort of like a funny or die-type thing made for the Internet,” Finn said. He emphasized that they want new ideas and people coming in, not only Broadcasting majors, but also students from different backgrounds and majors.
Christina Kay, assistant station manager at WCWP, the campus radio station, wants something similar for the radio this spring. They’re planning to have events on the Hillwood Commons rooftop as soon as the weather gets warmer. “We have a lot of events planned, including a scavenger hunt that we had a lot of success with the last semester, and we’re also having our barbecue outside the station,” Kay said.
Kay said that most of the students coming in to do shows aren’t Broadcasting majors at all. The radio shows are student-run, including talent and guests, and they’re open to anyone who has an idea or wants to be on the radio. WCWP’s first meeting is on Wednesday Jan. 28, at 12:30 in Humanities room 20.
Another outlet for creative students on campus is the Art and Art History Club. The club, aimed at Art majors, artists, and people interested in the field, hosts panel discussions with professionals such as museum directors, curators, and local artists.
“For the non-artists, we still host fun events like art-related field trips and performance art events to engage the whole campus,” said Stacie Zucker, a junior Digital Art and Design major and president of the club. “We always say that you don’t have to be a Picasso to fit in well with the club. As long as you have an interest in art, the club is for you!”
Zucker mentioned they already have one panel discussion lined up for the spring. The guest speaker is Michael A. Brown, the Associate Curator of European Art at the San Diego Museum of Art. The panel will be held at the Steinberg Museum in Hillwood, on Feb. 11, during common hour. All students are welcome, and it’s free admission.
Zucker continued, “Other events we’d like to host include an art auction at the end of the semester, another performance art event, and hopefully a community service trip to the Nassau County Museum. But since we are still in the process of planning out the semester, we are always open to new ideas for events.” The Art and Art History Club’s meetings will be held every Wednesday during common hour in room 114 in Hillwood Commons.
The Pioneer newspaper is another gathering for creative students who want to get hands-on experience in a real newsroom. It includes different sections, including but not limited to: News, Arts and Entertainment, Features and various Opinion columns. There is also a magazine, published on a monthly basis, which includes more in-depth articles and features happenings and events off campus. The Pioneer meets every Monday at 12:30 in room 199 Hillwood Commons.
The Pioneer is also interested in other, smaller clubs that haven’t been on the radar in the past, both to give these clubs publicity, and also get a better view of the creative corners of the campus. If you are in one of these groups, please email us at liupostpioneer@gmail.com with some info about your club or organization.

Steven Laurino, a fifth year senior majoring in History Education, is the starting quarterback for the football team. Laurino grew up in Boise, ID, but is originally from New York. The Boise native is a four-year starter at quarterback for the Pioneers and demonstrates outstanding leadership skills both on and off the field.
Q: How did it feel to win the NE-10 Championship last season?
A: Winning the NE-10 championship was amazing. For us as a team, it was incredible because it really showed how tough we were. We came through so much after two rough seasons. Bouncing back and coming together the way we did was truly special. We needed that win, American International was a team that we had struggled against over the past few years and that game got us over the hump.
Q: What is your favorite thing about playing football at Post?
A: The team atmosphere. Football is the only sport where people physically sell out for each other. You have to rely on others.
Q: What goes through your mind when you’re down late in a game?
A: Stay calm. As a quarterback, I have a lot of control over the game. I’m always asking myself what I can do to make a big play.
Q: How has Coach [Bryan] Collins challenged you to keep winning and improving?
A: In the season, I don’t work directly with Coach Collins a lot because he is our head defensive mind. It’s really just a process and a massive chess game every week working together and trying to figure out the best ways to do things that week. Coach Collins and all of the staff put in massive amounts of effort and time, and their preparation rubs off on us as players.
Q: What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of the team this season?
A: We are very experienced and we are a tough team. Countless times this year, everything has gone wrong, but we didn’t fold. We found a way to claw back and make plays when we needed to. Our only weakness is that we haven’t strung together four amazing quarters both on offense and defense. We make plays when we need to and that’s why we win, but if we did it for the whole game, we would be dominant.
Q: What is one thing that people would be surprised to know about you?
A: I’ve broken over ten bones playing sports and I’ve had four surgeries with probably a few more to come after football.
Q: Describe growing up in Idaho
A: Growing up in Idaho was amazing. I was granted a lot of freedom growing up in such a safe place. We were always outside playing sports. Idaho has a massive culture of outdoorsmen; it’s an active community that promotes all different activities. I wouldn’t change growing up there for anything.
Q: What is your plan after graduating from Post?
A: After this season, I do intend to take my shot at the NFL. We will see how that goes and eventually when I am done with football, I will have my masters in History Education. With that I will be able to teach and coach either middle or high school.
Q: Why did you choose to play the quarterback position?
A: I didn’t choose to play the quarterback position. I was a receiver and defensive end my first two years playing football. Then in junior high school, I was a running back/middle linebacker. In high school, I was a receiver and a safety until my junior year. After my brother graduated from high school, we simply did not have a quarterback and I was asked by my coach to do it. I never had any desire to play quarterback; I liked to hit people, hence the way I play quarterback.
Q: Whom do you admire most?
A: In terms of athletics, I admire many people. As far as quarterbacks, I have many people that I love watching and many that I believe are great role models. My favorite is Tom Brady. I just believe that he handles himself the right way and, of all the big time quarterbacks, I just relate with his personality the best. He is very passionate and he shows it on the field. It’s all business, but he’s not afraid to let you see his emotion. I think his teammates feed off of that. It’s a sense of vulnerability to your teammates that lets them know you’re in it with them.

On Saturday, Jan. 24, the men’s and women’s indoor track and field teams had a handful of runners compete in the Metro Team Challenge, hosted by New York University at the New Balance Track and Field Center in New York.
Three different runners qualified in the top-15 in individual events on the women’s side. Of the three, junior Elizabeth Stirling placed best, clocking a ninth-place time of 10:32.69 in the 3,000 meter run. That mark is significant in another aspect, as it broke a 10-year-old school record held by Trisha Stavinoha. Stirling beat the record by over six seconds. Freshman Talya Williams finished 10th in the mile with a time of 5:11.84, while graduate Robin Lynn had a 13th place showing in the 1,000 meter run.
On the men’s side, sophomore Mike Scott led the way with a 4:23.80 mile time, which was good enough for 15th place. In the same event, red-shirt junior Steven Arnone added a time of 4:40.11.
Rob Morris, who is the head coach of the men’s and women’s teams, is looking to continue the success that the Pioneers have had in competition in the recent years. The Pioneers have dominated the East Coast Conference of late and have taken home titles at both levels. Both teams are back in action this Friday, Jan. 30, when they take part in the two-day Armory Track Invitational at the familiar New Balance Track and Field Center in New York.
After their two-day Invitational, they have one more invite, that against the Lions of Molloy College in early February. Then, the Pioneers have the East Coast Conference Championships to look forward to, which starts on Feb. 21.

The men’s basketball team (9-9) clicked on all cylinders as they shot an impressive 54 percent from the field and 56 percent from beyond the arc in Saturday’s 82-69-victory over the Redhawks from Roberts Wesleyan College (7-9) in the East Coast Conference battle at the Voller Athletic Center in Rochester, N.Y.
Senior forward Tyuan Williams recorded 16 points and 12 rebounds for his fourth double-double in six contests. Junior guard Dillon Burns also had a 16-point outing along with five boards, three assists and two steals. Junior guard Akosa Maduegbunam chipped in with 14 points.
After holding a 14-12 edge midway through the opening stanza, the Pioneers went on an 11-1 run in a three-minute juncture to expand their lead to double digits at the 8:18 mark. Maduegbunam nailed three straight three-pointers to pave the way. However, the Redhawks responded with a run of their own. The hosts closed out the half on a 25-6 run to carry a 38-31 advantage into the locker room.
As the Redhawks built their lead up to 11, the Post squad found itself reeling. With the momentum hanging in the balance, the Green and Gold were able to find a way to climb back into the contest with a 17-2 outburst in a five-minute span to re-gain the lead, 62-60. Burns led the assault with a fast break lay-up, and back-to-back three-pointers.
With the score deadlocked at 62, the visitors pulled away with a 17-4 run. The streak was capped off with a trifecta by senior guard Isiah Stokley that sealed the victory for the Pioneers.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers return to action on Thursday, Jan. 29, when they kick off a critical four-game home stand at the Pratt Recreation Center against UDC. Tip-off is slated for 7.30 p.m.

The women’s basketball team (11-7) came home with a 1-1 record after a two-day visit to upstate New York on Jan. 23-24. The team’s two-game winning-streak in the East Coast Conference came to an end on Saturday, Jan. 24, as the Green Machine lost the battle at the hands of Roberts Wesleyan College (12-4). The loss came 24 hours after a ten-point victory against the Wildcats of Daemen College (8-8) the night before.
Senior guard Chelsea Williams counted for 52 points over two games and topped the 20-point mark in both games — her 12th time in total this season.
The Green and Gold earned a 79-69 win on Friday, Jan. 23, after a long-fought, even battle with host Wildcats. Williams’ sturdy play helped the Pioneers seal the deal, but the senior guard was not alone in finding the basket this evening. Freshman forward Alexis Been scored her first career collegiate points, a lay-up that gave the Pioneers a seven-point lead in the middle of the first. Overall, both teams were very even in shooting percentage and on-field goals made. The Pioneers were sharper on three pointers though, which explains their double-digit victory.
The next day, the team headed to Rochester, N.Y. to do battle against Roberts Wesleyan College. Despite less than 24 hours of rest, Williams did not seem to show any sign of fatigue as she eclipsed her game-high of 21 points from the night before by ten. Besides that, the remainder of the afternoon did not go as planned for the Pioneers. The Redhawks had a strong day on their home court and ended up with the win by a score of 79-67.
Head Coach Deirdre Moore and her squad will return to action on Thursday, Jan. 29, when they play host to the University of the District of Columbia in an East Coast Conference game. Tip-off is set for 5 p.m.

On Saturday, Jan. 24, the swimming team produced a magnificent 141-121 win against Wagner College. The day to remember for the seniors saw seven new pool records and nine NCAA qualifying times.
The first event provided an explosive start, as the four woman relay combo of senior back Johanna Pettersson, senior breast Caroline Rademacher, junior fly Joyce Kwok, and junior back Meghan Brazier flew to a new pool record and NCAA qualifying time of 1:44.53 in the 200-yard medley relay.
The Pioneers did not want to let the tremendous start go to waste, so in true Green and Gold fashion, they continued to rip through race after race, record after record. Petterson shined again later in the day, breaking a Natatorium record and another NCAA qualifying time in the 100-yard backstroke. Petterson didn’t stop there, as she broke another record in the 200-yard backstroke. “I felt really good going into the meet,” Petterson said. “After our training trip to Puerto Rico there was a great vibe amongst the group, that combined with all the hard work we put in the last couple of weeks is why I think we saw so many great swims.”
Fellow senior Rademacher also had a successful senior day, breaking a pool record in the 200 yard breaststroke. “Senior day is bittersweet,” Rademacher said. “It’s a day us seniors are celebrated by our amazing teammates, but it also begins to mark the end of what has been a truly memorable collegiate career” Rademacher added.
Kwok, a two time NCAA champion, also got in on the action by posting a time of 54.88 in the butterfly, which, to fit in with the days theme, also broke a pool record.
After an evidently productive training trip to Puerto Rico, the day proved both exciting and memorable for the Pioneer squad. The team is next in action on Saturday, Jan. 31, when they travel to Pennsylvania for the East Stroudsburg Invitational.
