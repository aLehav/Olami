The C.W. Post softball team has seen a solid start to their season, which began earlier this month at the Rebel Spring Games tournament held in Kissimmee, Florida.  The team returned to Long Island boasting a record of 6-4, but has since improved its play, going 3-1 since their homecoming.
Most recently, the Pioneers faced East Coast Conference rival Queens College, splitting a double-header with the Knights on Sunday, March 27th.  Both team’s conference records currently rest at 3-1 after Sundays matchup.
Coming off a two-game win streak, the Pioneers looked good to start the first game of the day.  After four scoreless innings, freshman third baseman Nicole Hagenah converted a pitch on a 3-1 count into a solo shot past left centerfield, giving Post a one run lead.  Hagenah’s homerun proved to be the only run the Pioneers scored though, as the Knights quickly responded, scoring four runs in the fifth and adding one more in the sixth to finalize the score at 5-1 Queens.
The Pioneers managed to redeem themselves in the final game of the day, walking away with a 3-2 victory over the Knights.  This time, Post took the lead early and never let go.  RBI doubles from Hagenah and junior centerfielder Kerry Fisher combined to put the Pioneers ahead 2-0 in the bottom of the third before Queens managed to score two on a homerun by Anniela Vaccaro and tie the game.  The Pioneers ended the threat quickly in the bottom of the inning thanks to a walk-off homerun by Hagenah, her second homerun of the day.
The games put the Pioneers’ record at a respectable 9-5 overall as they head into their next matchup, against American International College in Springfield, Massachusetts on Wednesday, March 30th at 3p.m.

The C.W. Post men’s lacrosse team suffered their first loss of the season on Saturday, March 26th, falling 8-7 in overtime to the rival Dowling Golden Lions (6-1). The Pioneers were unbeaten in their first nine games, but the Golden Lions presented a tough challenge for the top-ranked team in the ECC standings.
The Pioneers jumped out to the early lead after a goal from senior attacker Nick Coric with 8:52 left to play in the first quarter. Just 38 seconds later, senior midfielder Mike Messina tacked on another goal to give Post a 2-0 advantage. At the end of the first quarter, the Pioneers led 3-1, but the second quarter was a much different story. The Golden Lions dominated every aspect of the game and took over the second quarter. The Lions shut out the Pioneers in the second quarter 4-0 behind two goals from junior midfielder Vito Demola, who now has 23 goals on the season for Dowling. At halftime, the score was 5-3 in favor of Dowling, and everyone knew that this game would come down to the wire.
An early third quarter score by Dowling made the score 6-3 Golden Lions, but Messina did all he could to keep the Pioneers in the game. He scored two goals within one minute of each other to make it a one-point game entering the fourth quarter of play.
Late in the fourth quarter, Demola added another goal for the Golden Lions, making it a 7-5 game with 3:35 seconds left for the Pioneers to make a comeback. The Pioneers did just that. With just over 30 seconds left to play, Coric sliced through the Dowling defenders to give the Pioneers their sixth goal of the game, only one behind the Golden Lions. The Pioneers weren’t finished there as junior attacker Eddie Plompen notched his 32nd goal of the season with a game-tying goal with only three seconds left in regulation.
However in overtime, the Golden Lions quickly ended the game when only 12 seconds into the overtime session, Dowling won the faceoff and Louis Riley ended the game with his first goal of the year to give the Pioneers a tough 8-7 overtime loss.
The Pioneers’ next game is scheduled for Saturday, April 2nd at 12 p.m. at home on Hickox Field against the NYIT Bears (4-2). The teams will face-off against each other almost exactly one year to the day since their last meeting. In their last matchup, the Pioneers won 13-11.

On Sunday, March 27, the C.W. Post Pioneers swept the Dowling College Golden Lions in a double header at C.W. Post. The Pioneers were coming off of back to back losses to the Golden Lions in the previous two games, losing a heartbreaker 2-1on Friday, March 25th, and losing 6-0 on Saturday, March 26th, at Dowling.
The Pioneers had their work cut out for them after starting conference play 0-2.  Going into game one of the doubleheader, the Pioneers gave the ball to junior Paul Bischoff. He was shaky in the first inning, allowing three hits, but he managed to find his composure and get out of the inning without any runs. Bischoff only allowed one run the rest of the way through, keeping the Golden Lions offense quiet.
It was in the sixth inning that both teams earned their first runs of the game, with the Golden Lions scoring on the top of the frame. The Pioneers responded in the bottom of the frame when freshman Tom Tolan led off with a bunt single and advanced to second on an errant throw by the Dowling third basemen. Tolan then walked his way to third on a wild pitch. Three batters later, sophomore catcher Anthony Corona drove Tolan home with a base hit to left.
The game remained tied into the tenth inning when Tolan once again started the Pioneer offense with a base hit to left. He then advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by junior Matt Simone, moving the winning run into scoring position. Junior Nick Compito pinch hit for the Pioneers, lacing a base hit to left and moving Tolan to third. The Golden Lions walked Corona to load the bases to face senior first basemen Dan Mende. Mende was hit by the first pitch he saw, walking the Tolan home and winning the game for the Pioneers. Senior Marshall Kapson took the win in relief of Bischoff, pitching one inning and escaping a bases loaded jam to keep the Golden Lions off the scoreboard.
Game two proved to be just as interesting as the Pioneers gave the ball to sophomore Kevin Chenicek. The Pioneers took the lead in the first inning after Corona singled to left, advancing to second on an error. Freshman first basemen Phil Loprete then singled to left center to score Corona and give the Pioneers a 1-0 lead. Chenicek had a solid start to the game, retiring the first eight batters he faced. The sophomore pitcher did not face any danger until the fourth, when he let up a leadoff single and a walk. The Golden Lions only scored one run to tie the score in the inning on a sacrifice fly. The Pioneers responded in the bottom of the fourth, scoring another run to pull ahead 2-1. Junior James Stone came on in relief of Chenicek after allowing a leadoff single. Stone got the first two batters out, until a costly throwing error by the Pioneers sent the game into extra innings. Once again, the Pioneers got their leadoff man on when freshman P.J. Jennings worked a walk. Freshman Rich Maccarone followed up with a single and Tolan reached on a fielder’s choice. Simone came to the plate and was hit by the first pitch to once again win the game for the Pioneers.
The Pioneers return to action against Bridgeport on Friday, April 1st at home at 3p.m.

Having mid-semester blues? Are you looking for ways to lift your spirits? Seniors, especially, are inclined to experience these emotions. Even though you may not be among those counting down the days until graduation, it is probable that you may already feel the need to keep your spirits up. Not to worry; we have got you covered on the issue affecting many students in the C.W. Post community. According to YourTango.com, there are a variety of happiness boosters people can try in order to promote happiness.
As a graduating senior, there are many thoughts lurking in your mind. Preparing for final exams, revising term papers, attending activities during senior week, and the possibility of finding a rewarding career after graduation are many possible things preoccupying you. Well, you’re not alone. As a matter of fact, there are many students graduating this year who are having the same concerns. Anthony Cosenza, business administration major, said that he is “just trying to get through it.” Common hour, which is held Mondays through Thursdays from 12:30 to 1:50 p.m., is another great way to release concerns and disturbing thoughts. However, Cosenza said, “common hour is stupid and just holding people back.” Another student, Vinod Reddy, a biology major, agreed by saying that “common hour forces people to go on a break.” Reddy further added, “some people would rather get all their classes done with, rather than wait through common hour”
One way to alleviate your mid-semester blues involves planning a trip. Although going on vacation right now may not be appropriate, AOL Health stresses that the actual planning is what counts. In a research study that measured the happiness levels in adults living in the Netherlands, researchers found that those who took the time to plan their vacations were happier, even before they left for their trips. Can’t afford a vacation? Are you in need of something right now? Need a quick fix? Try therapy. Therapy is another happiness booster featured in AOL Health. As a matter of fact, the Student Counseling Center on campus is available by appointment Mondays through Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Although keeping your spirits up is what matters right now, the Student Counseling Center is available to talk about any issues affecting students on campus. The Student Counseling Center can help you with eating disorders, crisis intervention, physical and psychological abuse, among numerous other troubles and concerns.
Are you worried about those final exams? Check out the departments tutoring services to help you grasp those concepts. Need help revising term papers? The Writing Center is available by appointment while school is in regular session. The Writing Center has even expanded its services by incorporating “After Hours,” which runs Mondays through Thursdays from 8 p.m. – 10 p.m. when you can call in to ask quick, specific questions or chat on Skype. There are no excuses. Worried about finding a career after graduation? Check out Career Services in Kumble Hall, where you can find a variety of helpful resources. These resources include workshops to help you prepare for job searches, as well a Job Bulletin where job postings are available. Graduating from Post can bring about many feelings of happiness and also of anxiety. Just remember the many resources mentioned to help lift your spirits.

Often times, when you hear about a problem in any couple, it can result from a disconnect between these people or simply a difference in opinion. No matter the case, there’s always this one constant, and that is communication. I happen to look at communication as gas. You could truly have the best car in the world, but on an empty tank, it does next to nothing. That car needs gas to run effectively. The same goes for communicating in relationships. When communication lacks, so does the relationship, and, eventually, this car will simply stall.
Our relationships have that similar effect on us. It ranges from the initial attraction to being curious about the person and then actively trying to get to know them. This mainly happens through conversation, be it in person or via texting. Early on, there may not be many inhibitions, and everything flows smoothly. There is always the hope that this free flowing discourse remains the same throughout the relationship, but the truth is that it doesn’t.
It is often said that as humans, we’re creatures of habit, and we do naturally grow comfortable. “I find I sometimes have problems being vocal,” said senior Matthew Waters. He went on to say that communicating may be “something you have to consciously commit to.” Conversation may wane a bit, and the problem really begins to arise when you notice that but don’t say anything about it. At the moment something isn’t going right, you immediately need to speak up.
I usually say that when things get too quiet or there hasn’t been any recent conflict that there’s a calm before the storm. This basically means that sooner rather than later, something is going to “pop” off.  Junior Stephanie De La Cruz said that she’s not the type to really hold her tongue for anyone. “I have found, though, that there are times when a relationship does get a bit stagnant and not much is said,” De La Cruz said.
Whatever the quarrel, it may have more than likely been bottled up for a good amount of time. Not voicing frustrations (in a respectful and mature manner) can open a whole can of worms in the long run. There are major ill effects to bad communication. Cheating is a huge result of just two people not communicating or being on the same page. Many times, the act is criticized, but, really and truly, there’s a cause for everything. If ignorance is involved and you’re ignoring your partner’s needs, then you’re almost asking for it.
When you begin to feel a disconnect in yourself or your partner’s distancing himself or herself, it’s definitely a cause for concern. I’ve been in situations just like that, and the problem really was that I didn’t know how to stop it or help myself. Really and truly, someone else came along more appealing to my partners’ circumstances, and in both cases, I had no idea how agitated or unhappy either of these ladies was. After the fact, I realized there were major moments of silence; maybe I was busy and into my work in some cases, but the signs are always there. Many times, a timely conversation can change the tides, but this requires you to pay attention to little details. Knowing what I know now, I’d be way more proactive in initiating those types of conversations if I had an inkling that something just wasn’t right.

On March 24, 2011, the Xi Chapter of Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha, Inc. hosted their fourth annual One Heartland Banquet. For those of you who don’t know, a banquet is not a fancy dinner and dance, but a fundraiser supporting a very serious cause. Every sorority on campus supports a cause, and this one is for HIV/AIDS, which has no cure; although, they do have medicine to treat HIV, but there is no cure of vaccine for AIDS. Sadly, it affects millions of people worldwide every year.
All of the proceeds from this banquet went to One Heartland summer camp. In this summer camp, for one week, children affected with HIV/AIDS get to have fun and interact with other children who are going through the same thing as they are. In 2003, SIA adopted One Heartland as its national philanthropy and has been raising awareness of HIV/AIDS ever since. Every semester, SIA holds a fundraiser to raise money. This allows it to sponsor a few children to go to the One Heartland summer camp who cannot afford it and helps One Heartland continue to offer their services.
The summer camp was founded in 1993 by Neil Willenson, whose mission was for to allow children infected with HIV/AIDS to get a chance to see that there are other people who  are going though the same thing and to let them be normal kids for one week. One Heartland is located in 40 different states, and all of its programs and services are free of charge to all participants. It serves thousands of suffering and those at risk of being infected in the United States. The foundation also helps those affected by poverty, grief, foster care, Tourette’s syndrome and other obstacles.
Throughout this program, the sisters of SIA did an excellent job of showing us how devastating this disease really is and how to take precautions. They read letters from participants who have attended One Heartland, and innocent children explained how much pain they were in and how people were treating them differently just because this disease affected them.  HIV/AIDS is a problem throughout the world, and millions of adults, children and even babies are infected with it every year. At the end of 2009, there was an estimated 33.3 million people infected with HIV/AIDS.
After leaving the program, students said it was “informative and supporting a great cause.” Someone even said, “I highly recommend attending this banquet next semester to support this cause and [to] help change the lives of people affected by this disease.” You can help support One Heartland summer camp and give these children an amazing opportunity to not think about their disease for one week, when they can  enjoy themselves and have fun. If you are interested, you can visit One Heartland’s website, www.oneheartland.org , to get more information on their summer camp, to donate money or even to volunteer as a counselor at the summer camp.

The last you heard of your C.W. Post cheerleaders was that the rocky season had ended, and competition was out of reach due to the lack of girls on the team. However, the remaining twelve cheerleaders decided that their dream of competition was still possible this year. They joined a local All-star gym named Island Xtreme in Plainview, New York.
All-star gyms are strictly dedicated for competitive cheerleading teams only. The twelve remaining girls had been placed on Island Xtreme’s open co-ed level six team. The Post cheerleaders joined the existing members to create a team consisting of 23 members. They had only two and a half weeks as a new team to learn, hit and master the routine before the first competition.
“We only had a short amount of time but sometimes it’s best to work under pressure, we all wanted it so bad,” said sophomore Chelsea Parsons who is a member of Post cheerleading team.  Many practices occurred within the short amount of time, confident and ready the team left for their first competition in National Harbor, Maryland.
The competition took place on March 12th and 13th; it was called “Battle at the Capitol” and consisted of many tough competitors.  The Co-ed level six team was up against other teams like Elite Cheer Sensation from Newport News, Virginia and Rockers All Stars from Blacksburg, Virginia. All the teams competed for two days and the judges took the better of the two scores for the results.
The team waited on stage Sunday night for the final results. It was between Elite Cheer Sensation and Island Xtreme for first. Island Xtreme came out on top and won their first competition. “Just the feeling of knowing how hard we worked finally paid off and even through all the ups and downs it was such an amazing feeling to know we finally did it!” said freshman Nicole Deruvo.
The following weekend Island Xtreme attended the “2011 Pot of Gold Nationals” in Hartford, Connecticut. With a final combined score of 8.22 out of 10, Island Xtreme’s open co-ed level six team had yet another championship title under their belt. The twelve Post cheerleaders on this all-star team finally got to carry out their goal of competing. They never expected to immediately take home two championship titles but now they are confident and have goals of being undefeated with all four competitions. With two down, the team is half way there.
April 2nd and 3rd the team will be in Ocean City, Maryland for the “Reach the Beach Nationals.” The weekend after that the team will be competing at a local “ECC All-star Nationals” hosted by St. Johns University.
The Post cheerleaders joined Island Xtreme to prove that anything is possible when you stay dedicated and positive. “I think more girls will want to be a part of the Post cheerleading team because they see how committed and motivated we all are and now we will be appreciated by other athletes in the school,” said sophomore Lisa Sanzo, who hopes that next year these twelve girls can create a successful competitive cheerleading team. They wish to eventually bring home championship titles for C.W. Post, and get our school’s name out there for high school and transfer cheerleader recruits.

On Thursday, March 24, 2011, despite a brisk evening, a group of students gathered at C.W. Post’s Interfaith Center to show their support to the people of Japan.
With a bundle of sage burning slowly in the background, the candlelight vigil focused mostly on meditation, and using breathing as a tool to send warmth and love over to those affected by the disaster in Japan.
Pastor John Dornheim began the services saying, “We gather this night to light our candles and raise a prayer to whoever the god you believe in is,” acknowledging the various faith backgrounds represented in the group.
As Father Ted Brown spoke, he stressed the importance of the power of willing the warmth of our breaths over to the cold, disaster stricken area.  He addressed the group solemnly, “This morning we had snow, and it was cold.  We remember shortly after the earthquake and tsunami, it snowed; it was cold in Northern Japan.  So let us breathe and let our warm breath send warm wishes and regard to Japan.”
The students breathed deeply as a group for a few moments taking in what Father Ted had said, and trying to will warmness to northern Japan.  Students were given the opportunity to get up and speak, in whatever language might be native to them, and as a few students brave enough to share their thoughts spoke, emotions ran high.
Ayaka Katakawa, a senior arts management major, is one of the international students from Japan who studies at C.W. Post.  Originally from Kawasaki, she said it takes only 10 minutes for her to travel to Tokyo from her hometown.
Following the tragedy back in Japan, Ayaka said that she was fortunate in that she was able to communicate quickly with her family and loved ones.  She explained, “Since my mom called me as soon as possible, I could figure out quickly whether my family was safe or not. However, I could not get in touch with some of my friends because the signal was really bad and the phone line was really busy in Japan. I was so scared because I thought they got into trouble somehow. When I could reach them, I was so glad and relieved.”
Katakawa explained that it’s frustrating for her to be here in the United States while there is so much happening back in her home country, however she says that she is trying to make the best of the situation.  “This situation makes me disappointed, frustrated, and irritated. However, now, I try to think positive. What I can do is to just study hard and enjoy staying here [with] full of smile and happiness,” added Katakawa.
Ako Ando, a senior arts management major, is another international student from Japan.  Her hometown, she explains, is beach side, so there were added concerns for her about her friends and family.  “My hometown is beach side. So they were afraid of the tsunami coming, and some of my friends who live near the beach evacuated temporarily just in case. However, the direct effect is power cut. On the day of disaster, electricity was down in my hometown, and now, their electricity is sometimes cut on purpose based on the plan,” Ando said.
She explained that each area has designated times where they have no power.  Japanese utilities companies, like Tokyo Electric Power Company, introduced the rolling outages in order to cover electricity shortages following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  At maximum, the power shortages last for no more than 3 hours at a time.
Like Katakawa, Ando was frustrated, though she said that the compassion of the student community has helped her to be more optimistic.  “I was so glad that [many] people cared about Japan…also, I really appreciate ISS and ISU giving us the opportunity to have a charity campaign,” said Ando.
Both Ando and Katakawa stressed that they will be participating in a fundraising campaign that will take place during common hour in Hillwood from April 5th-7th to raise disaster relief funds.  Ando even added that, “Some of us will set the table in Hillwood and teach how to make origami cranes. Also, some of us will walk around campus with donation boxes. Some of us will wear Japanese traditional clothes [for summer]” said Yukata.  “Also, I’ll perform a Japanese traditional dance on Thursday, April 7th at the Top of the Commons.”  According to Japanese lore, folding 1,000 cranes allows for a wish to be granted.
Katakawa wanted to extend a message to the Post community and said, “We need your warm help. Please share your love and let’s stand together for Japan.”

During my first two years at C.W. Post, I went to class, went to work, and then went home.  Just a boring two years, I didn’t even bother to find my niche or any friends for that matter. I don’t blame commuting, but then again I do.
As commuter students, a lot of us may have a bit more trouble making friends at school than those who live on campus. Living on campus, you’re around the same people 24 hours a day, compared to commuter students who are only there for maybe two to six hours a day. So how do we connect with people?
The greatest way to find friends, I found, was by declaring my major and taking classes with the same people in my major. After a few classes with them, you talk and get to know each other. By now, you two have things in common such as your major and you’re taking the same class. Joining clubs connected to your major is a good way to get involved and make friends, although it seems a little obvious.
Even random things can help you make friends. I was sitting by myself reading the paper and I saw a girl who was reading the Pioneer, so I struck up a conversation with her about what she thought, what she was going to school for, etc.
Maybe some of us are all right with just going to school and going home to what we have at home. Try to break out of your shell and find different ways to get involved. Little by little you could find out different things about yourself and meet the people who may become life long friends.

Thinking about this week’s edition, I decided that I wanted to interview someone of importance within the community and get a look into what’s going on, what’s coming up in Brookville’s calendar and share anything that might be relevant to you, the people who live and commute here everyday.
When I called the village offices, however, I was given the runaround (as one might call it).  I spoke with a woman named Winnie who informed me that speaking with the mayor required first scheduling an appointment (a task that I had anticipated), but that it would be some time before she would be able to fulfill my request.
She went on to explain to me that Brookville’s mayorship is a volunteer position, and because of that fact, Mayor Caroline Z. Bazzini was out of the office quite a bit.  Winnie added that Bazzini “goes into New York [City] and travels a lot.”
Bazzini’s travels are for good reason too, I suppose, as she has owned and managed her own marketing company for the past 35 years.  Her company, Zimmermann Agency, has had many big list clients such as Chase-Manhattan Bank, Time Inc. Magazines, etc, and would naturally create the need for Bazzini (or Zimmermann as she’s known professionally) to travel at least into New York City.
Having served as a community volunteer for many years prior to her appointment it’s understandable why she may have been picked as the village’s mayor. However, considering the fact that I called to make an appointment to speak with her and was informed that doing so would not be possible until, at the earliest, the middle of April (and I made this call in the middle of March), I’m left with only one question: who’s really running Brookville?

There are more than 80 student clubs and organizations that are provided on campus, but students on campus have still yet to express their concern for a lack of activities.  So how involved are our students? When asked about their own student involvement, commuters and dormers have their own opinions.
“There’s got to be more activities to do. Living on campus is boring,” John McNealy, a senior history education major said. McNealy lives on campus, and says he’d like to be more involved, and would like to see more shows at the Tilles center. “There’s nothing else to do on campus on the weekends except party,” says senior Joe Finizio, a sociology major, adding to McNealy’s opinion. Not only do they feel like they are missing out, commuters have their own set of campus involvement issues.
“I’m not around enough to get involved. I go to class, and I go home,” Jaime Silverman, a senior English education major. “There’s not enough advertising [of events or clubs].”
Although Silverman is a commuter, she would love to be more involved on campus. Other students feel that school and work get in the way of being more involved on campus. “Being a commuter is tough because [on campus activities] interferes with the job I have afterwards,” says Victoria Lipman, a senior English writing major. “Students also have a lot of homework and studying to do.”
Another reason why students don’t get involved could be a combination of all three. “Students don’t want to, they don’t know, or they don’t have enough time,” says Andrea Deignan, a junior English writing major.
Faculty and Student Advisors feel that student involvement is better because of the Common Hour. “With the help of Common Hour, I have seen a definite increase in attendance at student events,” said Graduate Advisor Jackie Russo. “More people are getting involved, but we are always looking for more people to participate.”
English Professor John Lutz was able to provide some insight. “I think the obstacle for people getting involved is because they need to work,” says Lutz regarding student life. “I don’t think it’s a desire of not to get involved. In the past this was an issue, and Common Hour is to overcome that obstacle.”
“We should have more events that bring us together, like homecoming,” said senior Stephanie Muffaletto. “We’re at Post, we should celebrate it!” Students such as sophomore Christina Mayor were adamant. “There should be something that should bring the campus together, and should be advertised heavily,” said Mayor. “We should have a drive-in movie in the Pratt parking lot. They should be shown once a month to bring the campus together.” Others have mentioned that they would like to see more clubs being offered during the Common Hour.

By the time you read this we will only have 20 more days left of classes for the semester, and that’s counting if you’re the rare few who have classes on Fridays.  Twenty more days of classes EVER if you’re a senior not attending grad school – like me.  Just a few more weeks left of ingesting Winnick grilled chicken after looking for uncooked pink parts.  Oh you never did?  Bad move, kid. Let the count down begin!
Our entire staff has worked extra hard to deliver a special issue of the Pioneer this week!  Not only are we featuring weekly news and events on campus, but this week we’ve inserted the Bottom Line, C.W. Post’s magazine.  For those of you who are familiar with the magazine, we deeply apologize for the long stretch.  But for those of you who are NOT familiar, I’ll let you in on what it’s all about.  The Bottom Line was created by one of my dearest friends and alumni, Connie Karambelas, who believed it was important to not only provide the student body with information on campus but outside of Brookville too.  The magazine’s goal is to inform students about international and national news, opinions, sports, features, and entertainment.  Interested? Just turn to the middle of the newspaper to get your own inserted section of the Bottom Line.  Enjoy!
As for the rest of the paper, we have a lovely tribute to the victims of the Japan tragedy with coverage of the gathering Thursday March 24th at the Interfaith Center.  Our hearts go out to those who are suffering.  We also have our weekly commuter and community columnists back with some new issues up for discussion.  Are you in or are you out? One staff writer reports on why our student body lacks in enthusiasm for events and activities on campus.  In opinions, we have our relationship columnist who discusses the importance of communication in relationships.  I agree, Kahlil, it is fundamental, yet the most difficult in all relationships.  Loomings is here again this week with some interesting movie reviews. And as always we have the latest in what’s going on in the sports department.
Three more issues left of Pioneer this semester!  We thank you for all comments, suggestions, grievances etc.  This is YOUR paper and our aim from the beginning was to create it just for you.  Don’t hesitate to tell us what you need at cwpstpnr@gmail.com!
 
Oh, and by the way…HAPPY BIRTHDAY MATTHEW URENA!
