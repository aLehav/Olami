For “Game of Thrones” fans, it has been 569 days since the show’s last episode “The Dragon and The Wolf” aired on Aug. 27 2017 on HBO. The long-awaited finale left fans to create theories and ideas as to who they think will sit on the iron throne, and now what writer George R.R Martin has planned is finally in our sights. 
Season eight will have six episodes averaging around one and a half hours long each. As for the storyline, in true “Game of Thrones” style, we know way more than the characters, and are just waiting for them to catch up. All of the action continues in this season with what looks like the night’s watch coming to the end as the wall that guarded the North for thousands of years is slowly crumbling. The wall won’t last long when going head to head against a giant ice breathing white walker dragon. 
Season eight marks the last installment
of the epic fantasy drama, and with the date quickly approaching, students anticipate what’s going to happen to the characters, the story line and who they think will occupy the iron throne. 
Senior theatre production major Katherine Keaney is skeptical when it comes to the show ending happily ever after. “There will be no iron throne, no one gets to sit on it. I don’t think the chair itself will be destroyed, butI believe the battles between Kings Landing and Westeros, and Westeros and the dead will cause enough death and destruction,” Keaney said. “A monarchy can’t be in place anymore. There is nothing to rule. The highborns are dead and the lowborn are dead.” 
Alumna Elin Kvarnemar (‘18) shares Keaney’s skepticism. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the white walkers just kill everyone and take over the world,” she said. 
As for Kvarnemar’s predictions of who will claim the iron throne, she’s uncertain “I don’t know what will actually happen but I hope that Jon [Snow] will win,” she said.
When the show’s pilot episode “Winter Is Coming” aired in April 2011, the show was
chapters behind Martin’s books. Now, after the
phenomenal success, the HBO series surpassed
the plot of the books. Even the most savvy
readers will struggle to predict what the writers
will install. The season premiere airs April 14 at
9 p.m. on HBO, so buckle up because winter is
coming… and fast.

Most Marvel fans can agree – it feels like “Captain Marvel” has been in production for a long time, even for a superhero movie. Until the official announcement that the movie was made, I didn’t think much of Carol Danvers (played by Brie Larson), the given name of Captain Marvel. Anticipation boiled for the movie when the post-credit scene for “Avengers: Infinity War” showed Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) paging Captain Marvel as humanity’s last hope. 
I haven’t seen much of Larson since she starred in “Room” in 2015. Her big transition to a lead superhero role was bold, but it worked. Larson’s acting showed a lot of eagerness, similar to Luke Skywalker in “Star Wars” when he was trained by Yoda. Unfortunately, the eagerness is met with confusion after a dramatic plot twist makes it hard to decipher where the film’s climax is. 
It took awhile to figure out the plot of the
movie, up to the point where I felt like I was
watching a DC superhero movie. I wanted to
get up and walk out of the theater.

The plot is slow to develop; Larson’s
character smashes into a movie rental store
that is now a relic due to the birth of digital
downloads. The humor following her crash
landing on earth kept the movie alive, and
fortunately didn’t over-saturate a shoddy story
into a comedy.

All Marvel movies are a part of the same canonical timeline, so Fury is in this film as well. Jackson’s character adds familiarity to the film and is used almost as an archetype to emphasize the importance of Larson’s character in the next film, “Avengers: Endgame.” 
Viewers can tell Captain Marvel wants to do what is right, but this realization comes without depth. The lack of a backstory in the film makes it harder for non Marvel comic book fans to understand the reasoning behind her actions.
The movie is more desirable to the dedicated
Marvel fans because they know who the
characters are. A movie should be for the entire
audience, not half of it.

Cedric Sanz, a junior astrophysics major
thought the movie separated the audience. “It’s
not a bad movie and if you’re a big fan of
Marvel films then you’ll love it, but most
people will come out of it wanting more,” Sanz
said.

Unfortunately for “Captain Marvel,” even
though Larson had great performances here
and there, it wasn’t enough for me to want
to watch it again. Instead, I felt like I had to
Google, “Who is Captain Marvel?”

The ‘Women are Lit’ read-in will take place during common hour on March 20 in the Great Hall in Winnick House. The event will celebrate women and their uniqueness in society. Mary Pigliacelli, director of the writing center, organized this event for the second time after last year’s success. 
The event encourages women to share
their favorite pieces of written work by other
women, whether it be an essay, a tweet or a
stanza from a poem. Pigliacelli explained how
the event came to be.

“We received so much good feedback on last year’s event, which was a celebration of the diversity of women’s voices in the world and on our campus, so we’re very excited to be holding the event again,” Pigliacelli said. “Last year, students and faculty read authors such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Rosario Castellanos, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich, and many people shared their own writing as well.” 
As for this year, there are several sponsors involved in running the events. The Black Student Union, the Rainbow Alliance, the Writing Center, and the Dept. of English, Philosophy, and Foreign Language will all co-sponsor this event. 
Pigliacelli believes that the event encourages women to share not only their favorite work, but gives them the confidence to spread their own unique pieces. “I really believe that coming together to share the poems, the essays, the words that move us can very powerful,” she said. 
“As Audre Lorde explains in her essay “Poetry is Not a Luxury,” poetry is “a vital necessity of our existence,” Pigliacelli said. “It forms the quality of light within which we predicate our hopes and dreams toward survival and change, first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action. Poetry is the way we help give name to the nameless so it can be thought.” Pigliacelli hopes that students, faculty and staff come and share their favorite literature or just listen and enjoy the event.

Happy National Nutrition Month! While NNM may not sound as exciting as National Doughnut or Taco Day, it’s far more important, and stands for a bigger picture of health and wellness that we as college students too often forget. 
As young adults we tend to blindly consume whatever food is in front of us without taking simple steps like thinking about its nutrient composition or even making sure we are actually hungry. NNM was devised by the American Dietetic Association in order to increase mindfulness, promote conscious eating, and draw attention to food and mealtime. 
Some of the many key messages of NNM include “choosing foods and drinks that are good for our health” and “discovering the benefits of healthy eating,” however these points are vague and require elaboration. For starters, we can all benefit from learning about the nutritional composition of some of the common foods and drinks we consume, and work on making more informed decisions. 
I often see students walking around campus with the fruit drink, Naked. Many students believe Naked is a healthy alternative to water. While full of phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals, a typical bottle of Naked has 285 calories and a whopping 58 grams of sugar. Naked drinks may suffice as a snack consumed in moderation, but they don’t fulfill the daily water intake requirements. 
Another key message of NNM is “discovering the benefits of healthy eating,” but what constitutes as “healthy” when it comes to eating? One component of healthy eating is portion size. A general rule of thumb to balance our plate is to limit portions of grains and meats to about the size of our palm, and to load up on fresh vegetables in every meal. Also, the more colorful the meal, the better since different colored fruits and veggies are packed with vital vitamins and minerals. It’s important to rotate our diets, too, since consuming the same foods day in and day out is a recipe for nutrient deficiencies. 
The last goal of NNM is to draw attention to the quality of food we consume. Fast food and packaged foods tend to be less nutritious and filled with salt, harmful fats and sugar. We rarely think about the quality of produce we are consuming; there’s an environmental effect on food that affects the nutrient bio-availability of produce as well as the nutritional composition. 
This is evident when considering the effects of travel on food. Produce with a large amount of “food miles” will inherently have less vitamin C and A and other minerals; these components are sensitive to heat and other conditions that come with travel. A batch of grapes that were grown in California, then gathered, packaged, transported by truck or plane, and put onto the shelves at our local grocery store won’t have the same nutritional composition as those that were grown on the east end of Long Island. It’s beneficial not only our local farmers, but also our own bodies when we choose to consume local produce. 
If you’re interested in learning more about
National Nutrition Month and reading some
of the other key messages we should all be
thinking about, visit eatright.org and click on
National Nutrition Month. There are power
points, worksheets and articles available to
educate the public on food and nutrition. The
more informed we all are, the healthier and
better we’ll be.

Members of the Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) and Kappa Kappa Gamma (KKG) fraternities collected over 500 books at their Dr. Seuss themed book drive on March 6 in Hillwood Commons. The books will be donated to the Boys & Girls Club of Long Island. 
The theme was inspired by a friend’s little sister who didn’t know who Dr. Seuss was, according to RJ Ayroso, a junior nursing major and member of TKE. There were several Dr. Seuss cardboard cutouts for students to take pictures with. The drive accepted any type of children’s books. 
TKE is a fraternity “built on the honest convictions of love, charity, and esteem,” according to its mission statement. KKG is a sorority that “seeks for every member throughout her life bonds of friendship, mutual support, opportunities for self-growth, respect for intellectual development, and an understanding of and an allegiance to positive ethical principles.” 
The book drive is one of several events these Greek organizations host on campus. TKE raised money for St. Jude’s Children Hospital last September during the St. Jude walk/run, an event where teams of volunteers completed a 5K walk or run to raise money for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. KKG recently joined campus in September 2018, and its members plan to participate in more events in the near future.

The Tilles Center continues to be known as
the largest employer of students on campus,
according to Daniel Coners, the Tilles Center’s
director of business operations. Approximately
thirty students work at the Tilles Center.

“Students employed at the Tilles Center do
meaningful work in customer service, theater
production, marketing, fundraising, education,
and event management,” Coners said.

Coners said the experience is enriching for
those who need to seek experience and to learn
manageable skills for the workforce.

“We pride ourselves on the resume building work that our students perform and many of our student employees have gone to gain meaningful employment in the performing arts
and entertainment industry with the experience
they have gained here,” Coners said.

In addition to the students employed by
Tilles, a number of the full-time staff members
are LIU Post alumni. Milankumar Patel, senior
biomedical science major, was employed by the
Tilles Center from Sept. 23, 2017 to May 16,
2018 as an usher. Patel also worked from May
16, 2018 to Sept. 15, 2018 as an event attendee
(EA).

As an EA, Patel ensured patron safety in the facility and prepared and ran pre-show performances, including stage set up. Patel also had other responsibilities as an EA such as concessions setup, which involved coffee making, snacks and sometimes bartending. 
“We would also use surveys to find out what current attendees value and I would guide the patrons if they need any help finding their seats, I also arranged the seating for the handicapped so they don’t have any problem,” Patel said. 
Patel said there are roughly 25 ushers and 10 to 13 event attendees. “The Tilles Center has a [large] budget and they always hire more students, for example, sometimes events/shows are almost full and the total number of seats we have is 2,242,” Patel said. 
To work at the Tilles Center, students must
be in a bachelor’s or master’s program. They
must be able to work well under pressure, in a
fast paced environment, must have customer
service experience, cash handling experience,
and good communication skills.

Students interested in employment at Tilles
can contact Amanda Dupuy, the operations
manager, at amanda.dupuy@liu.edu, through
jobs.liu.edu.

As LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn merge to become OneLIU, so will their school colors. The arrays of green and gold across Post’s campus will soon become a distant memory, and shades of blue and gold will take their place this fall to represent a unified LIU. 
Green and gold have given Post an identity for over half a century; they served as a base for building a sense of belonging among students and faculty; and they’ve been an expression of the Pioneer school spirit at sporting and recreational events. The Pioneer theme is everywhere: on the walls and furniture, in the tiled floor patterns, upon the banners aligning the campus roads, and printed on school merchandise, uniforms and the gymnasium floor. 
Some students are left wondering when the color changes will take effect and how much it will cost. Academic halls and athletic facilities will have to undergo renovations to reflect the merger. Freshman business major, Alec Salgado, has concerns about the transition. “Since the colors are changing, it’s going to be a huge financial thing for the school. A lot of the buildings are going to be changed because we have a lot of green and gold stuff around. It’s everywhere. It’s going to be really hard,” he said. 
The Pratt Recreation Center, where the merged athletic teams will practice, is saturated with Pioneer colors. According to Casey Schermick, director of athletic media relations, there are hundreds, if not thousands of items around campus consisting of green and gold. “As time goes on, these items will be rebranded to match the new color scheme,” he said. “This will definitely be a rollout project that will be transformed over time.” He added that the new combination of colors is one of many ways to carry on the traditional spirit of each campus. “LIU will be recognizable with accenting colors from both Post and Brooklyn athletic departments,” he said. However, he cannot confirm a timetable as to when it will be completed. 
Pratt’s gym floor displays the Pioneer brand in big, bold lettering; it’s a definite change needed before the switch. “During summer break each year, the gym floor is stripped down to the base wood and refurbished. Once decided, the plan would be to make the color changes during this time,” Roy Fergus, executive director of facilities, said. 
Blue and gold will eventually be reflected in
all aspects of athletics, including signage and
website design, social media, and uniforms.

Currently, the university is exploring options for a “unified apparel company” to outfit all athletic teams beginning in the fall, according to Schermick. New uniforms will be ready to wear for preseason in late summer. A new mascot, which has yet to be determined, will also receive blue and gold gear with a new logo, wordmark and icons. 
The campus bookstore will also undergo various changes that will occur over the summer break. “Discussions are ongoing as to the extent of a makeover,” bookstore manager Jorge Lanas, said. New products and clothing displaying the school’s brand will likely become available this fall. “The bookstore will continue to be an important proponent of LIU’s brand awareness to all current and prospective students,” he said. “Students should be excited to be part of this new venture in LIU’s history.” 
Some students are disappointed in the change. Freshman Annalise Argento, a music education major, imagined herself in Pioneer colors since she committed to Post her senior year of high school. “I’m upset about it because I liked the green and the gold. Now we’re going to be in blue and gold, and it’s gonna be like the next version of Hofstra,” she said. “I read about it a while back in the newspaper. Other students said they didn’t like it either; even Brooklyn [students] said they didn’t like it.” 
According to Schermick, the athletic department is eager to honor both campuses through a unified LIU. “It was extremely important to the university, athletics, and administration to honor the traditions of both campuses when making the decision,” he said. “We as a department are very excited to see our stands filled with blue and gold as we compete at the highest level of competition.”

Three nursing majors, Jessica Alvarado, Melanie Lopez, and Arianna Cavallino were recently selected to be a part of the Nursing Students Association of New York State (NSANYS), which aids in the transition from undergraduate nursing students into the professional world. Its goal, according to the website, is “to help mold the future of nursing by developing accountable, responsible and motivated leaders.” 
The three campaigned for their positions and gave speeches at the NSANYS convention. Alvarado, sophomore nursing major, was elected as NSANYS president. Lopez was elected as the regional director of Genesee Valley, and Cavallino was elected as the regional director of Long Island. 
“Being the president of the NSANYS, I oversee a board of 16 students with the help of a presidential advisor and two faculty advisors,” Alvarado said. She also oversees committee projects and programs, plans the council of school leadership summons, and helps with planning the annual convention. 
Being a part of the NSANYS will help them learn many different skills and open up a lot of opportunities for each of them. “Being a regional director for the NSANYS will help me build my communication skills and help me make connections while leading other nursing students. It will also set me up for a very successful future as a nurse,” Cavallino said. 
All three students have big plans for their futures. Alvarado intends to go to graduate school for nursing, and then hopes to work in critical care in a hospital specifically with clinically unstable patients. “Getting to see patients come in and be unstable or maybe even not able to breathe on their own, but having them leave in good health, and eventually maybe even come back to visit,” is what Alvarado looks forward to most in her future career as a nurse. 
Lopez’s passion for nursing stems from her hands-on experience as an emergency medical technician (EMT) at Exchange Ambulance of the Islips, from which she is currently on school leave. She is eager to start working with patients as soon as possible. After hopefully attending graduate school for nursing, she is excited to “make a difference in patients’ lives, even if it is only for a day, because as nurses we are usually with the patients the most.” 
Cavallino plans to further her education after she gets her bachelor’s degree. She wants to become a pediatric nurse and eventually work at Sloan Kettering in Manhattan. 
Alvarado, Lopez, and Cavallino encourage
other nursing students to join NSANYS, and get
involved. More information on volunteering,
running for state office, and more can be found
online at nsanys.org.

Seniors are looking forward to graduating on May 10 of the spring 2019 semester. Those eligible for commencement include students in graduate, professional and dual-degree programs, and the deadline to register for graduation was Feb. 22. 
“I’m really excited for all of my family to be here to celebrate something that I’ve worked so hard for, they’ve been a huge part of this journey,” Elise Strange, senior psychology major said about the commencement ceremony. After graduating, she hopes to attend a graduate program in Virginia. 
The March 15 deadline to reserve your cap and gown online has passed, however reservations can still be made at the campus bookstore. In order to participate in commencement, as well as pick up a reserved cap and gown, students must be in good financial standing with the university. 
Senior journalism major Dondre Lemon is excited to prepare for graduation and to try on the cap and gown he recently ordered. “I’m looking forward to getting off the island, definitely, and going to grad school,” Lemon said. “It’s like ending one chapter and starting a new one.” Lemon will attend Iona College for sports communications and media. 
Graduates should make sure to verify the spelling of their name to printed on their diploma. This can be done by logging onto my.liu.edu. Once logged on, click the “Degree Progress/Graduation.” From there, choose “View Graduation status.” Two more links under “Student Information” will allow students to edit the way their name will be printed on their degree, as well as update the address to which it will be sent. If you will be moving off-campus, make sure to give an address where your diploma can be shipped. 
Senior musical theatre major Julia Vaughn anticipates attending her final company class as part of the Post Theatre Company. “I get to see what I’m leaving behind and know that it’s going to be okay because generations before and after us have been okay without their seniors,” Vaughn said. “It’s like graduating from the company as opposed to graduating from the university.” 
“I’m definitely going to miss the friendships I’ve made in college,” Elise Strange, senior psychology major, said. “Attending college out of state is such an amazing experience, but leaving these people behind is so hard.” 
A graduation fair will be held in Hillwood
Commons from 11 a.m. 7 p.m. on April 16 and
17. During this time, students can pick up their
cap and gown, order a class ring, and meet with
representatives from various departments.

Handicapped reservations for the commencement service, as well as various other information is available at www.liu.edu/Post/ Commencement. The ceremony will be one to remember for all students. “It’s major. Just
walking across the stage, being handed my
diploma; it shows I accomplished something,”
Lemon said.

In order to keep the student body aware of occurrences on campus, the Pioneer compiles and publishes crime reports. The reports are public and are available to view at Public Safety. All names have been redacted for privacy purposes. 
Sunday, Feb. 3

At 12:04 a.m., a busted sprinkler head outside a Winnick Dining Hall first floor refrigerator set off a fire alarm. The building was empty. The alarm was reset at 2:23 a.m. with the okay of the Chief of the Roslyn Fire Department. 
Tuesday, Feb. 5 
A robbery was reported at 2 p.m. that happened
on Monday, Feb. 4 in Brookville hall. The
incident was reported to the Nassau County
Police Department as the Old Brookville Police
Department does not have a detective to handle
robbery cases.

Tuesday, Feb. 5

At 4 p.m., a public safety officer responded to a report of a damaged vehicle. A commuter student stated that she parked her vehicle on the west side of the Tilles Center on January 29 at approximately 7:50 a.m. She returned to her vehicle around 5:00 p.m. and noticed a note on her windshield. The note said ‘sorry I hit your vehicle’ and had a phone number, but no name. The student said she no longer had a copy of the note. She stated she may call the Old
Brookville Police Department at a later time.
She said her driver’s side rear bumper and rear
corner panel were damaged.

Wednesday, Feb. 6

At 4:45 p.m. on February 6, a student reported damage to her vehicle while parked on campus. She stated that at 9:30 p.m. on Feb. 5, she had parked her car in the Brookville Hall parking lot, and her car was damage-free. She had returned to her car at 8:30 a.m. the follow- ing morning, drove to Hillwood commons and parked her car in the south lot. Around 4 p.m., she drove her car to the music rehearsal parking lot and upon exiting realized that there was damage to her passenger side front bumper.

The roads were also covered with snow and sleet. The student reported that he wasn’t injured and didn’t want any police action. The vehicle had driver’s side front bumper damage. 
Wednesday, Feb. 13

At approximately 10:45 a.m. a public safety officer on patrol between the Gold parking lot and the Green parking lot observed a car traveling at an excessive speed headed west on Pioneer Boulevard fail to stop at a stop sign. The officer put their lights on and the vehicle pulled over. 
The officer asked the driver of the vehicle for
their identification, and the subject identified
themselves as a dorm student. The subject was
issued a ticket.

Friday, Feb. 22

I witnessed the obstruction of free speech on March 18 when, three minutes after a student informed me of a new “Common Sense” pamphlet on campus, I watched two public safety officers gather the stacks and remove them from Humanities Hall. I was unable to get a copy. 
It was approximately 6 p.m. when the officers removed the pamphlets. Regardless of what the contents of the pamphlet were, students, faculty and administrators will never know. It was gone before it could even make an impact. 
That’s not to say that I support what is
written in these pamphlets; rather, I uphold
and defend students’ First Amendment right
to write what they believe and to read it. That
right is more important than ever on a college
campus.

While watching the stacks of student speech be confiscated, I was disappointed. Disappointed in the university for not being able to handle criticism by any other means than removing it before it could spread. 
I obtained a copy from a table in the Hillwood Commons Fish Bowl an hour later. There were no new claims made in the pamphlet, but there were student complaints about the following topics which were already covered by The Pioneer this semester: mold, the “recall of “Dr. Kushner the terrorist expert” after his recent appointment to the new position of Vice President of Faculty Affairs, Hutton House and the removal of Dr. Kay Sato, a call for transparency on President Cline’s salary, and the phasing out of the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP). 
The Pioneer reached out to Michael Fevola, director of public safety, for comment, but he did not respond to an email or phone call regarding who gave the instruction to remove free speech on campus and why, as well as how these pamphlets were discarded. The public safety officer on duty around 2:45 p.m. who answered the phone call identified the pamphlet as “propaganda,” but did not comment on other inquiries.

The men’s soccer team went to Huntington Montessori School to read books and lead soccer sessions for students between the ages 3 to 8 in the morning of Friday March 8. 
This was the second visit as part of a program
called “Read, Run and Fun.” “It’s a mentoring
program that is designed to get the players out in
the community and to get them to interact with its
youth,” head coach Michael Mordocco said.

Arriving at the school, the players split up in
two groups. One group visited the students in
their classrooms, where they read to them. The
other group brought students to the school gym
for a soccer session where the kids ran around and
played soccer-related games.

In the classrooms, the reading mostly consisted of Dr. Seuss books, as March is Dr. Seuss month, but the students also listened to stories about dinosaurs and Pete the Cat. Ajani, 6, was especially interested in the dinosaur books and their pictures. There was one particular thing he liked in one of the books the players read. “There was a big dinosaur head,” Ajani said. 
The program, Coach Mordocco said, is a great opportunity for his players to build character, mature and prepare for the future. “It’s healthy for them to communicate with people, whether it is children or adults, in different environments and different fields,” he said. “To be able to build relationships will benefit them and this program will help facilitate that.” 
Six of the seven players who visited Huntington Montessori School are international student athletes from Argentina, Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Trini- dad and Tobago. Even though some of them have distinct accents, the communication with the kids ran smoothly. “It’s a great interaction! The kids love them,” Jeff Rodriguez, head teacher for a mixed group with 3 to 6 year olds, said. 
Rodriguez sees the culture differences between the players and the children as a great experience for his students. Last month they talked about diversity in his class. “We were touching on how we are all different, but how we should celebrate that and be appreciative of each individual, that we can all learn something from one another,” he said. “I think, by the team coming in and having everyone being from someplace different, the kids can learn something from them. It’s nice for them to get a perspective from someone else.” 
Rodriguez also thinks is nice for the students to listen to other voices, especially male voices. “I think it’s nice for them to interact with other men. There aren’t that many male teachers, especially kindergarten teachers, so to have the guys come in gives them a chance to experience somebody else and not just me or their dads,” he said.
The students aren’t the only ones who gain perspective during the experience. By visiting the school, Paul Hein, freshman defender and broadcasting major from Germany, had the chance to learn about the American education system. “It’s very interesting to get to know the American school system and what it looks like,” he said. “It’s interesting to see how they use the Montessori method.” 
Junior physical education major Kyle Parish, a midfielder and defender, also thinks the experience has been valuable. “I’m trying to do physical education and coaching, so personally it’s a very good experience for me to see what I can use and improve on to further my education,” he said. He also likes the change of pace from the university. “To have a little bit of youth is very refreshing and joyful,” Parish said. 
Rodriguez would love to see the team come back, and he also thinks that more schools should invite university teams to interact with children. “I think this is a really nice experience not only for kids but for the team as well. I would really recommend this to other schools,” he said.
