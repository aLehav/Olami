On Thursday, Dec. 3, the fifth-seeded Pioneers got an incredible performance from sophomore outside-hitter Danielle Valenza, who totaled a match-high 19 kills, but it wasn’t enough to get passed fourth-seeded NYIT in the NCAA Division II Championship East Region quarterfinal. NYIT ultimately won the hard fought match 3-2.
The Pioneers claimed the first set rather easily thanks to a 12-2 run late, but lost their groove; dropping the next two sets. With their backs against the wall, the Pioneers responded and it was Valenza who provided the impetus. During an 8-1 run in the fourth set, she slammed down two kills and also had a block.
In the deciding fifth and final set, the Pioneers were, again, led by Valenza who had four kills, but NYIT weathered the storm and came out on top in the final set, 15-13. In addition to Valenza’s fantastic game, freshman outside-hitter Rachel Londot totaled 14 kills and 11 digs while junior outside-hitter Analise Austin chipped in with six kills and seven digs of her own.
Head Coach Shellane Ogoshi and her team finished the season with 23 wins compared to 11 losses. The team will look to build on its successful campaign next fall.

Akosa Maduegbunam, a senior broadcasting major form Hyde Park, Mass., is a shooting guard for the men’s basketball team. Maduegbunam is in his third year for the Pioneers and is averaging 7 points and 4 rebounds through the first six games of the season.
Q: What would you say first sparked your interest into playing basketball?
A: When I was a kid, I heard that Michael Jordan never missed a shot. Just hearing stories like that influenced me to strive to be perfect and perfect my craft, which is what I still try to do today.
Q: So, you transferred to LIU Post after playing for Penn State University for one year?
A: Yes, I went to Penn State my freshman year. I was actually recruited by Coach Pat Chambers at Boston University and he got the job at Penn State, so I was pretty much committed to the coach more than the school. Chambers was involved with my family in terms of reaching out to my mom, my siblings, and myself, which made me feel very comfortable. He was always the ideal coach I wanted to play for. When I got to college, I realized it was very complicated at that level in terms of plays and how intense the game was. I was a little overwhelmed at that time, so transferring to LIU Post was the better move for me because the game was slower and had a better pace that I could play at.
Q: Being a more experienced player who’s played in Coach Smiles’ system for two to three years, how do the younger players look up to you?
A: Playing in Coach Smiles’ system for two to three years has made me think less and play more. I’m not one of those guys who fills up the stat-sheet a whole lot, but I play hard and I make big plays that help us win games. Coach Smiles has brought the best out of me by making me prepared for that level of play if I was to get recruited all over again.
Q: What is the strongest asset of your game?
A: Shooting is definitely the strongest asset of my game and I pretty much fell in love with that. As a kid growing up, I always dreamed of making game-winning shots, so that’s something I took seriously early on. From there on, the rest of my game started falling into place.
Q: What influenced your decision to come to LIU Post?
A: I think Coach Smiles just won me over. He’s a great recruiter who’s huge into transfers and guys who are looking for second chances and getting a fresh start. Coach Smiles has an eye for talent on that and he recruited guys like myself, P.J. Torres, Jared Hall, Isaiah Stokley, and so on. I think he’s building a good foundation here and the type of guys he wants in his program.
Q: What goes through your mind when you’re on the floor late in a close game?
A: I just try to focus on my habits and making winning plays. I also try teaching plays that I’m learning in practice and all the things Coach Smiles is trying to instill in us. Guys get tired late in the game and Coach Smiles wants us to continue to close out with two hands up, play on our toes, and to communicate with our teammates. Those are the little things that I really try to focus on late in the game.
Q: Are there any areas you think the team needs to address or improve on moving forward?
A: Our biggest area of improvement is getting better every day. I think if we all get better individually and collectively, it will help us. We need to consistently bring effort, play tough, and do all the little things like crashing the defensive boards and getting back on transition defense.
Q: Do you think this team has the ability to win the East Coast Conference?
A: We have more than the ability to win the ECC because all of the pieces fit here and we really gel well together as a team. We also have experience, scoring, and other strengths. I’d like to see myself and the other guys work on playing tougher as the season goes on because toughness isn’t a skill that everyone has.
Q: What is your favorite part about playing basketball?
A: My favorite part is making a shot in someone’s face knowing that you put in all the hours and to see all the hard work pay off when you’re making shots. The game of basketball is beautiful to watch; it’s like poetry in motion, so I think seeing the look on my defender’s face after I make a shot is something I get a thrill out of.
Q: What is one thing that people may not know about you?
A: I’m really into fashion, so I think my personality is the same both on and off the court. I just try to play loud and make statements just like I do with my fashion.
Q: Do you have any plans after graduating?
A: Hopefully I can play professionally, but if not, I want to pursue my career in broadcasting. I’m excited for my future, whether it’s playing or coaching basketball or pursing my career. My biggest goal would be playing in front of the camera.
Q: Who do you most admire?
A: I most admire my mom. My father passed away when I was nine years old, so my mom has been raising me since I was nine. I just turned 23 on Sunday and I feel like my mom is a superwoman, which is no cliché. It was only a few years ago that my mom just went full-time in her job back home working for public transportation. I try to pick my toughness from my mom because she’s such a tough woman.

After falling behind by 17 points in the first half, men’s basketball (5-2) battled back to secure a 71-63 victory over the Mercy College Mavericks (1-3) in their East Coast Conference debut, Saturday, Dec. 5, at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y.
The Pioneers were coming off a loss against seventh-ranked Southern Connecticut State University Monday night where they surrendered 98 points. Saturday’s first half seemed to be a bit of a hangover as the Pioneers were down 40-23 late in the opening stanza. Part of the issue was finding an answer for Mavericks’ center William Robinson, who scored 13 first-half points. However, sophomore forward Hunter Powell finally slowed Robinson down late in the half as the Pioneers chipped away at the lead, going into the locker room down 42-32.
In the second half, the Green and Gold flipped the switch with a 12-2 run, which tied the game at
44 apiece at the 13:38 mark. All the momentum had shifted to the hosts as junior guard Jared Hall knocked down the jumper to tie up the score.
Mavericks guard Shaquille Stokes would bury a corner three out of the timeout to regain the lead for the visitors, but the Pioneers erupted with an 8-1 run as senior guard Dillon Burns scored five of the first seven points.
Burns also drained the eventual dagger, a three-pointer from the top of the key, putting the game to bed. The 5’7” guard was one of many players who had an impressive second half after only scoring two points in the first 20 minutes of play. Burns finished with 15 points, seven assists, and four steals. Junior forward Greg Dotson also struggled early on, but still tallied 10 points, five rebounds, and three steals. Leading the pack in scoring was Hall who scored a game-high 22 points, with six boards, and three steals.
Mercy fell apart in the second half as they only made four field goals, shooting just 16 percent from the field, and only making one three-pointer after making seven from downtown in the first period. Mercy scored just 21 second half points and turned the ball over 24 times in the contest, which helped the Pioneers get back into the game.
Defensively, LIU was able to limit Robinson and Stokes who were on fire in the first half. Robinson recorded 21 points and 10 rebounds and Stokes had 20 points, three assists, and two steals.
Head Coach Erik Smiles will lead his squad back on the floor on Wednesday, Dec. 9, as he prepares to square off against his alma mater, the University of Bridgeport, in an ECC duel at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

LIU Post had an unusual visitor in Hillwood Commons on Tuesday Dec. 1 during common hour. Blossom, a four-legged representative from Northshore Animal League of America, stopped traffic of the second floor of the commons as students fell to their knees to entertain the almost 2-year- old pup.
Two graduate students, Tim Howe and Alyssa Gobetz earning their Masters in public administration with a focus in nonprofit organization, set up a fundraiser for Northshore Animal League.
Inspired by an assignment given by Professor Cathy Black, also the advisor for the College of Management, teamed up to sponsor an organization that they both feel is worthy of the attention and time.
According to Howe, North Shore is the biggest no-kill animal shelter in the world. This shelter will take in dogs from kill shelters and puppy mills when they have available space. The animal loving duo said they did not want to pass up the opportunity to raise awareness and funds for this organization.
North Shore appreciated their efforts and accepted their offer. Blossom and her rescuer were then sent to the campus.
“They’ve [Northshore] been trying to get the support of students so we reached out and they loved it,” Howe said. “They have been trying to get a hold of that demographic [students] and we gave them a really good opportunity they couldn’t resist.”
The team set a goal to raise $250. With bountiful family members on speed-dial, the two do-gooders managed to raise just over $365 for the adoption center from students and staff within the two hours Blossom was on campus. Those who donated $25 or more recieved a metal bracelet commeding them for their contribution.
“We managed to bring a bit of puppy love to Post,” said Howe. To donate to the organization and possibly provide a puppy with its forever-home, log onto: www.animalleague.org

LIU Post has two upcoming study abroad opportunities, including a trip to Peru during the winter break, and a service project in Puerto Rico during spring break.
Yet, on Nov. 24, LIU Information sent out an e-mail notifying students that the State Department has recently issued a Worldwide Travel Alert to U.S. citizens. According to the alert, “Current information suggests that ISIL (aka Da’esh), al-Qa’ida, Boko Haram, and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks in multiple regions,” according to trave.state.gov. The report advises about possible targeted locations, such as large sporting events, theatres, open markets, and aviation services.
The only international course being offered during the winter semester is an Andean History, Culture, and Politics course in Peru. Professor William Hiatt said, “The course combines rigorous classroom study with cultural excursions in and around Cuzco.” The course is split 50/50 between class work and excursions through Cuzco. There are currently 12 enrolled in the course now. The number of courses available was not impacted by current threats, seeing as the classes have to be approved a year earlier, according to Director of the Study Abroad Program, Patricia Seaman.
The travel alert offered students some tips on how to keep safe in foreign countries. The main focus is for students to be alert at all times. One of the tips was to avoid large crowds and heavily crowded places, especially during holiday season. Another tip was to monitor the media, and local information sources.
The alert also suggested signing up for the State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. By regisering for STEP, U.S. citizens enroll their trip with the closest U.S. Embassy. The embassy will help to keep you informed and help your family keep in contact with you in an emergency. Students who register for a study abroad course are
all automatically enrolled in the STEP program, according to Seaman.
Seaman said, “We realize that situations are constantly evolving and can change quickly. If, based on the information received, we feel that any of our program locations are not safe; we will not hesitate to arrange to modify plans accordingly. Post is doing this by closely monitoring The Overseas Security and Advisory Council messages and other news sites.

Dr. Iftikhar Ahmad’s intentions were clear. ”These barbarians have nothing to do with Islam,” he said, referring to the radical terrorist group, the Islamic State. “Most of their victims are Muslim,” he added, blaming the media for its distortion.
The social scientist, and associate professor in the college of education, invited the community to a common hour lecture on Wednesday, Dec. 2, to discuss “Islam & World Peace.” Professor Shaireen Rasheed, who teaches philosophical foundations and multiculturalism in the school of education, and Zeshan Hamid, President of the Shan Group in Hicksville, joined Ahmad in the forum to reflect on the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, France.
“I feel like I have to start with Islam 101,” said Rasheed, providing each of the three-dozen students and faculty members gathered in the Humanities lecture hall with a basic cheat sheet. “Islam is not a religion based on people or geographical areas; it’s a fluid concept, which makes it hard to discuss.”
“Since 9/11, the theater of war has gone global,” Rasheed said, describing fundamentalism, in any form, as a perversion of the actual religion. The speakers, all American-Muslims, shared their pre- and post-9/11 stories to explain how the everyday lives of most Muslims have changed—now peaking at its worst in very long.
Rasheed referenced her to-be published book, “Sexuality, Islam and the War on Terror,” saying that “global freedom, as defined within the context of the ‘War on Terror,’ has been defined as the war against not just the fundamentalist factions but against the threat of upholding liberal values, a cornerstone of Western democracies.” She explained that the language often used in today’s terrorism discussion is uttered as a value debate relating to what she calls, ‘The Clash of Civilizations.’ “And Islam,” she added, “which is not a monolithic category, is bearing the brunt of this, as are Muslims.”
A student questioned how people—Donald Trump and Fox News, as examples—get away with their anti-Islamic commentary, which she deemed offensive. Rasheed referred to the idea of “Islamophobia industry,” which she explains as “using fear to make a lot of money.” Citing Nathan Lane, a professor at Georgetown’s Center for Muslim-Christian, she stated that there is an ongoing industry to promote Islamophobia, where donors pay off public figures to express anti-Muslim propaganda.
Rasheed describes Lane’s book on the subject as “a disturbing account of how certain networks are dedicated to convincing the larger public that Islam is inherently a violent and dangerous religion, that Muslims as a whole adhere to such violence, and that both Islam and Muslims should be marginalized in this country.”
Lane looked at Richard Hofstadter’s 1952 book, called “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” to explain the seemingly popular pattern of creating impressions by way of fear throughout the history of American public culture. “He refers to waves of the Enlightenment Illuminati in the Revolutionary War era, anti-Catholicism in the period of late 19th and early 20th century immigration (an issue resurfacing again), anti-communism in the McCarthy era and Anti-Semitism in America and Europe,” she said.
The cheat sheet that Rasheed distributed emphasized the Jihad clause, often questioned by non-Muslims. Rasheed explained the Arabic translation for the word Jihad as “struggle against your own desires,” which has indeed been interpreted differently by many. According to the book of Ayesha Jalal, a South Asian scholar, the Islamic Theological tradition includes strict codes for Islamic governments. How to implement Jihad into action is one of them, but some fundamentalist groups, such as IS, have misrepresented the codes.
“Isn’t it in the hands of people to interpret what it means? Who regulates what’s right?” asked Ian Jonson, a sophomore international studies major, after the event.
“This issue is complicated and requires a nuanced examination of social, economic and political factors as well,” Rasheed said. “Pakistan is a case in point in that the rise of fundamentalism there has been financed by certain countries and is gaining traction in poor sections of the country, usually by the local religious leaders.”
 
Hamid explained that the American presence in Pakistan, and other countries, fuels the already bad social standards, and becomes an effective tool of persuasion for radical Imaams with their own political agenda. “They point at the drones, ‘All these drones, it’s them,’ or they use your social struggles and say, ‘America is the reason for this problem,’” Hamid said.
He gave an example of a young man. “They show him a girl. If you do this and kill yourself, you’ll go to heaven and get all the girls you want in the world,” Hamid said. “They get brainwashed.”
”My father is Muslim [so] events like this can really hit home for me, since it is such a sensitive subject to talk about,” said Alanna Hynes Gür, a senior international business major, who was appreciative of the positive response among fellow students attending the lecture. “One of the audience members stood up and talked about how his opinion had changed after coming to this presentation; I just wish there were more people like this man who were open-minded to the idea of Islam.”
Jonson praised the speakers for bringing up such a serious, timely issue, but he was one of a handful of students who thought the presentations could have been more effective. “It did feel . . . at times, as if they weren’t fully prepared,” Jonson said.
Rasheed admitted that the topic was hastily proposed just before Thanksgiving, because of the many questions students had posed in class following the Paris attacks. “We had three days to organize the event, publicize it and get speakers,” she said, stating that she had envisioned more of an “everything you wanted to know about Islam but were afraid to ask” type of dialogue.
But Rasheed believes that opening up the discussion was significant enough at this stage, and plans to continue talks over the spring semester are ongoing.
“Given the San Bernardino shootings, the climate is even more urgent in which to ensure that backlash against American-Muslims is kept to a minimum, while at the same time trying to understand the political, social, [and] economic climate of the current agenda of terrorism,” she said.
To Hamid, speaking at the event was never really an option, as he said, “I cannot let your mind think that I’m a terrorist, that my religion promotes terrorism.”

With over 80 active clubs and activities, it is hard to believe that one very important club has been left out until recently. Post’s brand-new book club, which had their first meeting on Thursday, Oct. 22, has been extremely successful, welcoming 56 eager members.
“The idea for the book club was a joint effort among [the Herstory] interns from both Hofstra University and LIU Post,” said Nicole Bellinger, a senior English major at Post. Bellinger and Phillip Catapano, a junior criminal justice major, are both Herstory’s Youth Writing for Justice program interns. Herstory is a “writers workshop that provides opportunities through guided memoir writing that empower people from all walks of life,” according to the Herstory website.
“Phil and I decided to inquire about the creation of a book club on the Post campus,” said Bellinger. “And it was approved! With the support of the Honors Society on the LIU Post Campus, fellow peers, Professor Campbell, and the leaders of Herstory, Phil and I were able to have our first meeting.” The club is currently reading “All I Ever Wanted” –a collection of stories from children with incarcerated parents put together by Erika Duncan, the founder of Herstory.
“Phillip, Nicole, and Kristen [Linsalata] have been attending weekly intern meetings exploring the use of stories in justice reform, followed by writing workshops with high school students, during which they’ve each been drafting a 15-page justice-centered memoir,” said Professor Campbell, who is the faculty mentor for the program. “The interns are also doing an intensive study of Herstory pedagogy, creating a professional academic poster to be presented at Post’s annual Student Research Symposium this spring, and forming a book club centered around Herstory’s most recent publication, “All I Ever Wanted: Stories of Children of the Incarcerated.” The book was supplied to each intern on the first day of the internship.
“Professor Campbell, Phil, members of the book club, and myself actively read the book and discuss it via weekly meetings. Because the book is now for sale on campus, fellow peers are increasingly taking interest in reading the book and speaking about its moving content,” said Bellinger. So far, the book club has not faced any major obstacles, according to the leaders of the club.
“Students are actively showing up to the weekly meetings, our discussions address important topics, such as issues related to social injustice, and everybody is engaged in the readings of All I Ever Wanted,” said Bellinger and Catapano. However, both students stress that the book club is not only for reading.
“The book club is truly a rewarding experience for students,” said Bellinger. “Not only do we read from ‘All I Ever Wanted,’ which contains real-life memoirs, but we all express ourselves, therefore we are able to relate to one another. The book club also grants students the opportunity to share their writing. In fact, we have had members of our book club share poems that they have written.” The club prides itself on its welcoming and tolerant attitude.
“The book club is a great opportunity for students to voice their opinion on profound subjects- such as raising the age of youth incarceration,” said Bellinger and Catapano, “Thus, the book club welcomes students from all different majors because the subjects we discuss can be viewed from a variety of perspectives.” Professor Campbell is thrilled about the progress of the club and encourages all students, not just Herstory interns, to join.
“All I Ever Wanted” contains moving stories by ten of the 2.7 million children who have experienced a parent serving time in prison or jail as a result of this country’s mass incarceration epidemic,” said Campbell. “Herstory is encouraging not just interns, but also teachers, families, community members, and legislators to read and foster dialogue around this book, thereby amplifying the voices of youth demonstrating resilience as they deal with the stigma and intergenerational trauma caused by incarceration. We hope that this book club will continue into the spring semester, and Phillip, Kristen and Nicole continue to sell ‘All
I Ever Wanted’ at a reduced student rate to encourage its purchase and dissemination.”
LIU Post’s book club meets on Thursdays from 5-7 p.m.
Gianna Barberia is a high school senior on special assignment for the Pioneer. Kristen Linsalata, an intern with Herstory and a member of the book club, is the Co-Editor-in-Chief of the Pioneer.

Catching up on assignments, writing essays, practicing statistics equation after statistics equation, making sure I’m ready for finals, waking up at 9 a.m. to start a day filled with studying, and being productive throughout out the time off. No, this is certainly not what I did throughout the Thanksgiving break.
My story was more like waking up at noon, cuddling, drinking tea, eating poorly, watching films, thinking about doing work, but then coming to the reality of “no” to that. Now I am back at school, and the realization of the workload is smacking me in the face. I do regret, just a little, not doing an ounce of studying.
My justification for my lack of any attempt of bettering my academic self, is that I have had a long, tough soccer season, which, sadly has just come to an end. The practices five times per week, two games per week, and traveling up and down the east coast, and to West Virginia for the later part of the season, can really take its toll, especially when it’s on top of all the essays and quizzes that students have to complete on time.
However, many students who don’t have this obligation also have other things that draw away their attention, and are still able to stay on top of academic tasks throughout the Thanksgiving break, which I admire. As I now look at the bright lights of my laptop, I wish I also had the same attitude a week ago; it would have helped.
It is really important to take the breaks as they come; not only to enjoy the company of your family and indulge in the excitement for what Thanksgiving has to offer, but to just relieve stress and relax, so we can prepare ourselves for some tough schoolwork ahead. Finding the balance between chillin’ and getting those stat equations securely fixed into your mind is hard, but important. Something I may have to take into consideration next year.
Although I now have the dark and stormy cloud of catching up with some work over my rough and uncontrolled hair, I cannot let it overshadow the brilliant, beautiful and blooming time I had over the Thanksgiving break. I had such an amazing time; I experienced my first real Thanksgiving. Although the European one I celebrated with my best friends and housemates last year was wonderful, this year was just a REAL Thanksgiving.
A gorgeous and loving Palestinian woman, Abir Khouri, hosted my night along with her perfect family, who provided my first taste of that marshmallow and sweet potato mashed potatoes. The whole experience is one I will never forget, and something I’ll take home with me to tell my family. The company was tremendous, and when the guitar and piano began to harmonize, I felt like I was in paradise (of course, I requested Wonderwall by Oasis).
The most beautiful and defying thing about the night was the warmness and thankfulness of family and friends. The Khouri household really did remind me how important your loved ones are; their support, their love, their defaults, their perfect imperfections…putting all of these into perspective was wonderful and gave me this excitement to get home for Christmas and hug my own family.
I hope your Thanksgiving was as overwhelmingly brilliant as mine. I hope it was more productive on the academic side than mine was. Also, if you don’t think you fully appreciated what you experienced over the break, then have a thought, and make sure you truly and sincerely say thanks for all that you have and experienced.
Now, good luck in all your schoolwork. I need it.

Although their season came to an end last week, the men’s soccer team had five members earn All-East Region Honors by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. Three members were named to the first-team, including senior midfielder Per Forgaard, junior forward Jason Lampkin, and sophomore back David Arvidsson. Junior goal-keeper Jesper Malmstrom got a second-team nod, and senior midfielder Matias Ruiz earned third-team recognition. In addition to this honor, Forgaard and Arvidsson were named All-Americans by the same committee. On the women’s side, four student-athletes were also named to the All-East Region roster and they included: senior forward Susanne Vistnes, who landed on the first-team, junior back Kristin Brandman, who earned a second-team nod, and senior back Katie LaManna and junior midfielder Julia Backman, who both earned third-team praise. And no surprise here, but Vistnes landed on the All-America team for the fourth straight season.

The Pioneers stepped on their home court for the first time this season on Wednesday, Dec. 2, when they welcomed Mercy College to the Pratt Recreation Center. The Green and Gold came out strong and shot at a 50 percent clip for the first half, which set the tone for the game. Senior guard Quanisha Ratley scored 12 of her season-high 18 in the first half, as the Pioneers took a 36-19 lead into intermission.
In the second half, the Pioneers let their foot off the gas slightly, but kept the damage under control and ended up winning by a score of 63-55. Freshman guard Shannon Doyle finished with 12 points while senior forward Nyasia Davis and senior guard Jalyn Brown had 10 points each.
The Pioneers returned to the hardwood on Saturday, Dec. 5, when they traveled to face St. Thomas Aquinas College. In that battle, the Pioneers scored just six points in the opening ten minutes and that was a microcosm of the afternoon as points were hard to come by and the Pioneers fell 48-41.
Junior forward Janaysia James led LIU with 14 points on 12 shots in her 30 minutes of action while sophomore guard Khea Gibbs also played well scoring nine points with two assists and a couple steals. On the other side of the ball, sophomore guard Jenna Erickson led in the scoring department for St. Thomas with 14 points while they played stifling defense against the Pioneers, limiting them to just 23 percent shooting from the field.
The Green and Gold will get back at it on Wednesday, Dec. 9, when they host the University of Bridgeport. Opening tip is set for 5 p.m.
