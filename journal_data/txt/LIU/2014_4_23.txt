On April 2, James P. Bednarz, a professor of English, received the 2014 Abraham Krasnoff Memorial Award for Single Scholarly Achievement for his book entitled, “Shakespeare and the Truth of Love: The Mystery of The Phoenix and Turtle.” The Krasnoff award is one of the highest honors a Long Island University faculty member can receive.
“Professor Bednarz’s book, a ground-breaking interpretation of [William] Shakespeare’s most beautiful, difficult, and neglected masterpiece “The Phoenix and Turtle,” is a tour-de-force in interdisciplinary scholarship that uses a single literary artifact to reflect the political, social, and literary dynamics of Shakespeare’s life, work, and culture in a single year –1601—in early modern England,” John Lutz, professor of English and chair of the English department, wrote in his nomination letter to the Abraham Krasnoff Memorial Award Committee.
Bednarz, while humbled by receiving the Krasnoff honor, isn’t a stranger to receiving scholarly achievements and awards in his collegiate and professional career. He graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in English from Columbia College, and then received an M.A. with honors and a Ph.D. with a distinction from the Columbia graduate school of Arts and Sciences.
Bednarz also served as a member of the advisory committee for the Publications of the Modern Language Association (PMLA), the principal professional association in the United States for scholars of language and literature where he served as a specialist on Shakespearian literature. In addition to the Krasnoff award, Bednarz has also received the Trustees’ Award for Excellence in Scholarship in 2003, and the David Newton Award for Excellence in teaching from LIU in 1991.
“After receiving the award, you can’t help but feel grateful,” said Bednarz. “I don’t want to undermine that at all, but the most important thing is the work. If the work is satisfying on its own level, then you’re very lucky. When students go to school, it’s not about the degree, although that marks what they’ve achieved; it’s about what you’ve actually learned and what you bring away [from it that] changes you.”
Perhaps the milestone that “changed” Bednarz was the discovery of William Shakespeare, the author of the enigmatic play entitled, “The Phoenix and Turtle,” that inspired Bednarz to write his now award-winning book. Bednarz became enthralled with Shakespeare’s writing during college, and was mesmerized by the incredible language, deep characterization, and the various plights of the human condition Shakespeare incorporated into his work.
“Once in a while, you come across a writer that just kind of speaks to you in a direct way,” Bednarz said. “To quote John Dryden, ‘He was the man who of all modern and perhaps ancient poets had the largest and most comprehensive soul.’ His work was just so satisfying on every level, and the fact that there was just so much of it made it even better because it can’t be exhausted.”
It’s interesting to him now that at one point in his life he didn’t understand the potency of Shakespearian literature and other people’s obsession it. When his junior high school English teacher told him that she knew of someone that was obsessed with William Shakespeare, he thought it was odd that a single author could exercise an all-consuming effect on someone’s psyche. Now, a published author and specialist on Shakespearian writing, he couldn’t imagine his life without Shakespeare’s presence.
Before joining LIU in 1991, Bednarz was an adjunct associate professor of English at Columbia University and a lecturer at NYU School of Continuing Education. “Ever since being a junior in high school, I knew that I wanted to teach [in] college,” said Bednarz. “I didn’t even know why, but I knew that it would be kind of amazing to devote one’s self to figure out what life is about. When I came to LIU, I never looked for another job because I just loved it here. The people are just so great, and the students are just so wonderful, polite, and engaging,”
For the future, Bednarz plans to continue to live in New York City with his wife, a writer about art, and to keep teaching and writing. “I love teaching, and I think if I didn’t teach then I would miss writing,” said Bednarz. “They go together hand in glove. I think to be a good teacher you should be a good researcher; the more you know the better. I couldn’t ever imagine them being separate. It’s that give and take that makes it so amazing.”
“If anyone were to win this award, it should be Professor Bednarz,” said Danielle Sposato, a sophomore English Literature major “Honestly, I wish I had the privilege to hand him the award.”
“I’m really happy for him. I think he’s so passionate about his work. You can tell that he loves what he’s teaching, and he brings that vitality into his voice and his work,” said Amanda Dollé, a junior Vocal Performance major.
Bednarz advises students to follow their passion, as he did. “I think that if students find something that matters to them, [they should] stick with it, not be diverted, and build on those skills. Find out the skills that you have and find out how they’re matched to something you could really put your heart into. If you can succeed in that, your life will be the for the most part enjoyable,” said Bednarz.

A college education is desirable in order to advance within most career paths today, but those who seek to get a degree usually need to pay a hefty price. At LIU Post, however, a benefit for faculty members makes them eligible to send their children to school for free.
According to a 2010 survey by the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, 98 percent of respondents from 340 different public and private colleges in the United States provide tuition benefits for full-time employees. LIU Post is on the list, to the satisfaction of the Chair of the English department, Dr. John Lutz, who believes the incentive is part of the package when applying for a job at LIU Post. “A lot of universities offer it, so in terms of attracting faculty here specifically [because of the benefits], I don’t know that it would be a determining factor, but it certainly would be a factor,” Lutz said. 
Lutz takes advantage of this benefit by sending his son, a junior English major, to school at LIU Post. He admits that he saves a lot of money this way. “I have certainly found it beneficial,” he said. “Tuition for a four-year degree here is probably close to $130,000. So for me, that is a major perk. Otherwise, he [my son] would worry about student loans,” he added. 
Clearly, there is more to it than just saving money. “It’s a big thing for parents to send their child to college, and I guess I have more peace of mind knowing that he is at a place I understand,” Lutz said. He also noted how driving to school along with his son allows them to spend more time together on a personal level.
However, even benefits could have a downside – something that Lutz does not conceal, yet claims he has never had to face personally. “There could be situations where there are conflicts of interests. Obviously, he [my son] is not taking classes with me, but he does take classes with people with whom I work,” Lutz said. He referred to common sense as being the key to succeed in such a relationship. “You follow a kind of ethical standpoint and it is not really [becoming] an issue,” he added. 
Currently, 13 full-time faculty workers, and 20 part-time adjunct faculty employees take advantage of the free tuition privileges, according to Debra Annibell, associate Vice President for Human Resources Administration. “Tuition benefits do not appear in an individual employee’s paycheck,” said Jackie Nealon, Chief of Staff, and Vice President of Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. “The employees fill out a tuition remission form and once verified and approved, the appropriate funds from a designated account are used to cover the tuition costs according to the specifications of the benefit,” Nealon added. 
The union contract that was signed between the LIU faculty and the school in September 2011 gives the child of an employee eight semesters of undergraduate studies for any credit-based course, except doctoral ones. If the child has not completed its coursework within the given four years, the tuition costs would come back into effect. 
When calculating the tuition for the children of these 33 faculty members currently attending Post, the approximate value for one semester reaches over $1,100,000 – counting one child per worker. 
Nealon mentioned that the salary of an employee and the given tuition remission are not dependent on each other. “If this benefit was not offered, the salary for individual employees might not be higher but the likelihood that strong candidates would not choose to work at LIU would be very great,” she said. 
Like many other private schools, LIU Post gets nearly all of its total revenues from tuition and fees, according to Forbes.com (2013). Therefore, where best to spend this money is a thoroughly debated subject. For instance, the school is granting high academic scholarships for incoming freshmen, apart from giving free education to faculty, staff, and their children. Meanwhile, Post raised its tuition fee by 3.5 percent in 2013, which demonstrates the paradoxical relationship of attracting students and staff, while still maintaining its budget. 
As of now, only 33 out of the total 635 full-time and part-time faculty at Post have children currently enrolled with tuition benefits. However, this number does not include staff members and administrators who also send their children to LIU, or university employees who are currently using free tuition benefits to get their own advanced degrees. The estimated overall scale comes down one free student in 100 for the undergraduate programs, according to Nealon. “The number of students who are currently enrolled under the tuition remission program at Post represents less than one percent of the undergraduate student population,” she said. 
In all cases, the employees and their respective children must apply and be accepted like everybody else before receiving economic assistance. “All students must meet the admissions criteria for the university and for the program to which they are applying regardless of how their tuition will be covered,” Nealon said.

Canrock Ventures, the early- stage technology company that President Kimberly Cline brought to LIU Post around Thanksgiving 2013, is currently under investigation by the U.S. Treasury’s Inspector General for allegedly having misused federal dollars.
“I can confirm that Canrock Ventures is the subject of the review by the Inspector General,” a Treasury spokesperson told The Pioneer. “The audit concerns specific transactions of federal funds and the I.G. is trying to determine whether Canrock violated conflict-of-interest rules.”
In 2012, New York State, through a then newly-founded investment pool called the Innovate NY Fund, chose Canrock as one
of seven tech startups that would be allocated a total of $35 million dollars, of which Canrock was given $5.7 million. The companies were relatively free to choose how they would use their respective share of money; however, there were some rules to follow.
A March 22 Newsday article titled “LI Venture Firm to Be Reviewed By Feds,” reports that Canrock invested almost $2 million of taxpayer dollars into five computer software companies, where Canrock is either the largest shareholder or owns a significant stake. Additionally, four of these startups were co- founded by Mark Fasciano, the company’s managing director. Mr. Fasciano is also the chairman of the board of directors on three of them.
In an interview with Newsday, the 45-year-old Fasciano denied that there were conflicts of interest in how Canrock used Innovate NY money, and that New York officials knew about his dual roles as a board chairman of three of the companies and a Canrock partner.
According to the Newsday article, the review of Canrock Ventures began after Newsday asked the Treasury Department questions about one of the company’s investments that was funded using federal money. This occurred in early November 2013, around the same time that LIU president Dr. Cline was in the process of having Canrock Ventures move on campus in an open floor-plan office on the lower floor of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library.
“The university does not comment on investigations of other parties or the potential ramifications of the outcomes of the investigations,” Sarah DeCamp, associate director of Public Relations, wrote in an email on behalf of the president’s office.
DeCamp explained that the initiative began after President Cline met with Canrock’s leaders when out in the community to meet neighbors and learn more about regional businesses. They started a discussion about the great possibilities linking students to an active tech-incubator, and, together, made it happen. The Pioneer reported in its January 29 article “New Student Business Opportunity: Canrock,” that the school signed a 10-year lease with the company.
DeCamp also explained the many possibilities of housing a startup tech company on campus. “We are able to provide students with an array of opportunities to learn about start-ups including mentorship programs, guest speaker lectures, interactive workshops, and
seminars with innovators and entrepreneurs,” she wrote in the email. “Additionally, LIU has been working with Canrock to provide students with an entrepreneurial tech internship program.”
Five students currently intern with the tech incubator, with others joining in the summer, according to DeCamp. If they will be affected remains unknown until the Inspector General finalizes he audit. The Pioneer reached out to Mr. Fasciano, who declined to comment on the investigation, and also to Ryan Attard, human resource specialist at Canrock Ventures and director of the ThoughtBox lecture series, who declined to comment on the investigation or anything related to the company.
However, DeCamp, on behalf of president Cline, assured in the email that the investigation does not affect the university.
But some university students are concerned over possible implications. “For students who work there now, it has the potential to hurt their business and progress dramatically, in case they are found guilty of this,” said Jacob Maitland, a senior Business major.
Maitland personally met with Mark Fasciano last year, after being introduced by a business associate. “I could imagine working
for Canrock because I have a good impression of Mr. Fasciano and
they provide some essential resources and expertise which many new businesses need to survive, let alone prosper,” he said. “But at the same time, their future image and reputation is at risk.”
He also believes that President Cline could lose some credibility in case the Inspector General finds that Canrock misused federal money. “The president may be viewed as irresponsible…by creating a situation in which this could happen,” he said.
“But at the same time, I like how she’s shaken up the campus and tried to implement new ventures and opportunities for students. There is never reward without risk, and she has the best interests of the students at heart.”

This is the last issue that I will have the privilege of overseeing, and the moment is bittersweet. There are so many stories I wish The Pioneer had been able to cover.
The first was the administrative layoffs that occurred this semester. In response to inquiries about the layoffs, University President Kimberly Cline and Jackie Nealon, chief of staff and vice president of Enrollment, Campus Life and Communications, released the following statement:
Serving our students is LIU’s number one priority and one of the ways that we do that is to ensure that rising operational costs don’t find their way into increased tuition for students. LIU, with the support of the Board of Trustees, is working toward no more than a 2 percent annual increase until the year 2020.
In order to achieve that goal, the university must do several things over the next few months and years. Administrators and staff are being asked to look closely at their operations to ensure that they run at maximum efficiency… Students and faculty are LIU’s top priority and the budgetary measures that we have been putting into place are designed to improve and/or enhance academic areas, not hurt them.
Another story that I wish The Pioneer could have covered was about a Westbury taxi driver who filed a lawsuit this semester against several members of the LIU Post lacrosse team. The story, which was reported by Newsday in March, revealed that the cab driver claimed that the Post students used police connections to avoid being charged with skipping out on a $28 fare. The Newsday article also claimed that the cab driver was charged with nabbing the iPhone of one of the students and dragging a student alongside the cab, while in motion. Our writers use The Pioneer as a training ground, and they are often met with real-life scenarios, such as harsh criticism, limited information, no information and dead-ends, on and off campus.
Despite not being able to cover some stories that would have shaped important conversations on campus, I’m proud of many things. We were the first to report that MaryAnn Clark, the dean of the School of Health Professions and Nursing, resigned. We were also the first to break that two Norwegian students, Petter Holmsen and Maria Simone Emdal Otterlei, both from the School of Visual and Performing Arts, were chosen to be this year’s Valedictorian and Salutatorian.
We were also able to share some of Post students’ really memorable experiences with the entire community.
We reported on Marisa DeSilvestre, a third year student in the Radiological Technology, winning two Super Bowl XLVIII tickets—she took her dad to the game, by the way!
We were also able to follow Kirstin McDonough, a senior Health Science major and a four-year member of the LIU Post Dance Team, as she tried out for a second time, to be a member of the New York Jets’ Flight Crew. She was able to successfully complete the final round of the auditions, and will become a member of the Flight Crew, this season!
So, as the semester comes to an end, it’s important for us to look back at everything we have accomplished. The semester began on really icy terms — literally, as we battled endless snowstorms and multiple school closures. However, despite all of that, we are able to produce 12 issues, and seeing you all pick up the paper and read our stories online, made it all worth it. 
As I get ready to hand the position over next year to Alyssa Seidman, a sophomore Print and Electronic Journalism major and Public Relations minor, and Maxime Devillaz, a sophomore Print and Electronic Journalism major and a member of the LIU Post soccer team, I realize that The Pioneer is invaluable to a community often plagued with secrecy. On a campus where approximately 80 percent of our students are commuters, the paper is essential in keeping us connected.
And we have been connected for so long — we have kept you updated and informed and you have validated our contributions by picking up the paper each week, speaking with our reporters and posing for photos!
In a matter of weeks, the Great Lawn will hold a couple thousand people, as we say goodbye to the students who have shaped the LIU community. With that being said, congratulations to all and best of luck out there in the real world—cliché, I know, but I don’t mean it any less!
As for The Pioneer, our first issue back will be on stands on September 10.

On April 15, the LIU Communications and Marketing Office announced a new web feature called “Ask LIU.” The online service will provide students with quick answers to frequently asked questions, as well as new ones. When The Pioneer submitted a question to “Ask LIU,” it took 21 hours to receive an answer.
According to Dr. Jackie Nealon, Vice President for Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications at LIU, “Ask LIU” is supposed to be located on the LIU website. Right now, however, it can only be found directly at the web address: liu.edu/post/ask. A smartphone application or text message version of the service is not yet planned.
On Thursday, April 17, The Pioneer tried the new web feature by submitting the following question: “I would like to take the Computer Competency Exam this semester. Is it still possible to register?” The answer came 21 hours later: “Dear [name], the last competency exam for the spring term is taking place today, April 18th, and it is full and closed. The Fall exam schedule will be published on September 10.” A few days earlier, when The Pioneer tried to reach the Communications and Marketing Office with questions about “Ask LIU,” it took two days and four emails to receive any answer.
The “Ask LIU” team is prepared to answer broad questions about LIU, such as, “How to get things done, what policies and procedures are, what services we provide, [and] when activities are taking place,” Nealon said. The service will not support personal or individual questions, such as a student’s specific financial aid or schedule. “But we can definitely help students find out exactly who to contact, and even put the student in touch with the right folks,” Nealon added.
The “Ask LIU” web feature will be offered to students at the LIU Post and Brooklyn campuses. In an announcement email, LIU described the process: “Simply fill out the ‘Ask LIU’ online form, select a category that best suits your question, and type in your query. The ‘Ask LIU’ team will be happy to provide quick answers to all of your questions or concerns.”
The “Ask LIU” team is university staff that was not hired specifically for this purpose, but has been assigned the role additionally as the new web feature was created. The staff members come from all LIU campuses, and Nealon describes them as experts. 
According to Nealon, the initiative for “Ask LIU” was a collaborative effort between faculty, staff, and students to help make LIU stronger, and enhance communication.
Ask LIU” is now available at liu.edu/post/ask.

With the last day of classes quickly approaching on April 29, students, faculty, and staff at LIU Post prepare for the end of the semester. However, after finals, senior week, and commencement have wrapped up and most students leave for the summer, the campus will be utilized for other purposes during the summer months.

“We have many residence halls open this summer that will be utilized by our current students enrolled in courses, students attending orientation sessions, and students involved in our many camps and summer programs,” Van Vlerah continued. According to the LIU Post website, on-campus housing is available for all students registered
for summer classes. There are no meal plans offered for the summer session, but meals may be purchased on an a la carte basis in Hillwood Commons. The Winnick Student Center will be closed for all summer sessions.
From “May 16 through September, several of our residence halls will be used for summer conference rentals,” Hayes said. “In July and August, we will also host a series of Summer Honors Institute for High School Seniors,” she added. This program (now in its second year) allows graduating high school students the chance to gain educational experience in one of four fields of study (Creative Writing, Gaming Design and Development, Fashion Merchandising, and Entrepreneurship), and work closely with faculty mentors on hands-on projects and field trips. All accepted students receive free tuition and housing. Each program is a weeklong intensive. For more information, visit www.liu.edu/shi/summer-honors.html.
Many building renovations and facilities projects are planned for the summer months, as well. As reported in the March 26 issue of The Pioneer, the campus’ stadium is undergoing renovations, which are due for completion by the Fall 2014 semester.
“We will be replacing the front doors of the Winnick Center to a more dependable system that will cost less [money] to maintain, since the electric sliding doors are constantly breaking. This system is similar to the entrance doors in Hillwood,” said William Kirker, the director of Facilities Services. “We will also be renovating the Gold Coast Lounge [in Winnick] into a new convenient type [of] store called the POD express, like the one in Life Sciences. Aramark will be operating the store,” Kirker added.
He continued, “We will be continuing to replace fume hoods in the labs of Pell Hall. Two more are scheduled for this summer. In the speech building, we will have two classrooms renovated into one new space to accommodate the growing demands. Also, a storage area in
the lower level of Riggs Hall will become a practice room for the new wrestling team. The Pratt Center will get a new dehumidification system for the pool area, and the tennis courts will be completed this spring/ summer; we are just waiting for some warmer weather for the final coatings to be applied.”
The LIU Post campus has been host to summer youth camps for 19 seasons. “We do a regular summer day camp and a performing arts academy,” said Nickolette Kacharaba, the director of Youth Programs at LIU Post. “Both of these programs employ any Post students that would like to apply, and the performing arts academy also employs actual faculty members,” she added. About 30 percent of the staff is comprised of Post students, according to Kacharaba.
“Our summer day camp program is not just about having fun, it’s also an educational experience for our students that work and live on campus,” Kacharaba said. “If you are thinking about being a teacher, there is no better way than coming and checking out our camp. It is a great opportunity for those that are learning about teaching to come and be able to really get the hands-on education that they need.”
The library will continue to operate on standard hours (8
a.m. – 10 p.m.), but will be closed some Sundays. The Pratt building will be open as well from 7 a.m. – 7 p.m., but the aquatic center hours are variable. A schedule for new pool hours will be posted on the LIU website in early May.
The Student Body clothing boutique and Post Treat Shoppe in Hillwood Commons will be closed for the season. “As of
now, we will be closing the businesses for renovations and additions during the summer,” said Tamir Dayya, Special Projects Coordinator for Student Life. There is no word yet on whether Hillwood’s eateries (the End Zone, Starbucks, Subway, and the café) will have altered hours of operation. A representative from the Campus Concierge said there will be a schedule for all venues posted on the website soon.

On Wednesday, April 9, James Carroll, a junior Information Management Technology major, witnessed an incident involving a fellow student, a tree, and Public Safety.
That morning, Alfonso Mora, a sophomore Computer Science major, “woke up, took a shower, ate breakfast, went to class from 9:30 to 12:20, and then went straight to Hillwood.” It was there that he met up with friends and asked, “Do you want to go climb a tree?”
Around 1:30 p.m., Mora walked over to the tall tree in front of Kumble Hall and began to climb. “The tree actually wasn’t that bad of a climb. There were a couple of branches that got in my way, so it was slightly like a maze,” Mora said, illustrating his climb. “A term me and my friends use, we call them ‘ladders,’ it’s like a step, hand, hold, step; like you’re climbing up a ladder.”
Mora explained that he asked his friends to climb, because he himself enjoys it. “I just love climbing, so I always try to encourage people to do stuff that they don’t usually do,” he said.
However, none of his friends took him up on the offer, but instead, they participated in other ways. “I actually timed him. It took him three minutes to climb the tree,” Carroll said.
According to Mora, climbing trees helped him conquer his fear of heights. He explained that he now considers himself a rock climber, and that he started climbing trees at a park in Bayside, Queens. Mora does not discriminate against any tree. If he likes it, he climbs it.
Once Mora was up in the tree, bystanders started taking notice of him. “I was chilling in the tree, my friends were just making jokes at the bottom, and people were walking by wondering why my friends were looking up and making jokes,” he said.
According to Carroll, about 20 people gathered around the tree, curious about what was taking place. Carroll explained that this was something he had seen Mora do before on campus. Mora claimed he climbed the same tree two days before.
Soon after Mora was stationed in the tree, Public Safety received a call from someone who said there was a boy in a tree. Carroll thought, “Either he was going to get written up, or they were going to take him in to meet with the Dean or somebody.”
Once they arrived to the scene, Public Safety asked Mora to come down. A Public Safety Officer commented on Mora’s climbing skills, saying he was impressed that Mora managed to get as high as he did in the tree, according to Carroll. “Hey, you know we’re going to have to write you a ticket for this,” said one of the Public Safety Officers jokingly, according to Carroll.
James Contarino, a Public Safety Lieutenant, asked Mora to come down for his own safety. Mora told Public Safety that he just likes climbing trees, and that it is “good exercise.” Mora claims that he was not harassed in any way for his leisurely activity. He says he plans to climb more trees.

As a singly born person, I have always imagined what it would be like to have a twin. A twin-ship is like a partnership for life, with its roots at birth and ending with death do you both part. One of the mysteries associated with being a multiple is that they share a special connection beyond that of an ordinary sibling. While having a bond with your twin is a special part of the unique relationship already, it has been said that twins have “supernatural” qualities.
Nearly every set of twins has a story about this “supernatural” experience. Sometimes, one twin experiences a physical sensation of something that is happening to their twin, such as pain or sadness. Other times, they will find that they perform similar actions when they’re apart, such as buying the same item, ordering the same meal in a restaurant,
or picking up the phone to make a call at the same moment. They may appear to know the other’s thoughts, by speaking simultaneously or finishing each other’s sentences.
This can be defined as telepathy, which is the process of assessing thoughts or feelings without help from sensory input like sight, sound
or touch. In the paranormal world, extrasensory perception (known as ESP) is an ability to acquire information without relying on physical senses or previous experience.
Whether you’re an identical or fraternal twin, there’s no denying the superior relationship you have with your sibling. Twins seem to share a natural understanding of their co-twin’s emotional state.
Tia-Monã Greene, a junior Psychology major, has an identical twin, Bria-Letã Greene, a junior Business Administration major. Both sisters love being twins, so much so that they founded their own club, TWIce as Nice, two years ago.
TWIce as Nice is the first and only on campus “twin and multiples club that does not only focus on twin and multiples, but works on building community, as well,” said Tia-Monã Greene. The Greene twins not only dress alike, but are college roommates and best friends.
Tia-Monã Greene agreed that twins have some type of out of the ordinary connection. “When we were about nine, both of us got a black eye at the same time. It wasn’t funny then, but it’s very funny now. I got hit by a bike and she fell off the monkey bars; the only way you could tell who was who, was because it [the bruise] was on different eyes.”
While ESP is assumed to be more common in identical twins because they share a closer genetic connection, fraternal twins aren’t excluded.
Adina Oditt, a junior International Business major at Post, and her twin, Serena, a junior marketing major, also think having a twin is great. “We are very close,” Adina said. “We finish each other’s sentences and thoughts, and we have the same interests. When we lost our teeth, my sister’s would come out just one day later [than mine].” Both sisters agreed, “Being a twin is a special blessing that we would not change for the world.”
Brooke Rozea, a junior Psychology major, and her twin sister Ali, a junior Radiology major, may not look alike, but definitely share some of the same feelings. “When either of us is upset or hurt, we both get very upset and almost feel like we were hurt emotionally, too. It’s like if you hurt my sister, you hurt me kind of thing.”
Brooke explained that she values having a twin. “I’ve had my best friend with me throughout my whole life, and experienced all important moments with her right next to me.” Ali stated, “If anything were to happen to her, I know for a fact that I would never be the same.”
Hunter Stones, a junior Social Work major, and her twin brother Kyle, who is not a Post student, said, “Having a twin is like having a best friend who literally was born with you. They will always be by your side, and will stick with you for the rest of your life.” Stones went on to explain how twins “share a level of comfort that other best friends and even family members might not have.” This dynamic duo would never choose to be without the other twin, if given the choice.
In fact, Kyle has the metal core band, Asking Alexandria, lyrics “My terror twin and I, let’s take over the world,” tattooed across his back. Kyle said, “A lot of the time, I’ll reach out to Hunter because I feel that she is upset, and eight out of ten times I’m right.” The twins both share a strong bond, and think it is very possible to have some type of twin ESP.
So what is this phenomenon? Can twins really feel what their other twin is feeling? Despite the lack of scientific proof, these personal experiences can’t be denied. It is common that such incidents are signs of a deep emotional connection, which produces an intense sense of compassion, strong enough to generate physical sensations, such as feeling pain when a co-twin is hurting.
Twins also know each other so intimately that they can often predict how their twin will speak or behave. This can also be observed between two non-twin people in a close relationship, such as a husband and wife who have been married for many years. And many twins— whether due to nature or nurture— simply have the same instincts, tendencies, or preferences, explaining why they do eerily similar things simultaneously.
To find out more about twins on campus, check out TWIce as Nice’s meentings every Thursday at 5 p.m. in the Gold Coast Cinema.

What do the phrase “Mens Regnum Bona Possidet,” an ocelot, and the colors green and gold have in common?
The answer is that they are all LIU Post traditions. Since LIU Post was founded in 1954, the school has established many customs unique
to its institution. Students have heard of some of these traditions, but according to students interviewed by The Pioneer, many have not.
Anastasia Manesis, a freshman Pre-Pharmacy major, is a student who does not know much about Post’s traditions. While the campus mascot is an ocelot, a medium-sized American wildcat, she “thought it was a panther.”
Sophomore Philosophy major Sabrina Laurito knew that the campus mascot was an ocelot. “Before I came here I looked it up,” she said. “I don’t know any traditions this school has, except the ocelot.”
Natalie Post, a sophomore Math major, remembers something about the little known exam touchstone: a stone that supposedly brings good luck to students on test day. When Post was being shown around the school, she believes, “I think someone mentioned it.” Marianna Scalise, a sophomore Psychology major, also knew about the exam touchstone since she had learned about it on a campus tour. The exam touchstone is located outside of Pell Hall, the Life Science building, and is supposedly a good luck charm that will help you ace your exams if you touch it.
Even though most students don’t know that much about the school’s traditions, Post has a rich history, some of which can be found on the school’s website. The campus motto, which is “Mens Regnum Bona Possidet,” translates to “A keen mind possesses a kingdom.” The school colors, green and gold, symbolize the campus and its location. Green symbolizes the green lawns, hillsides, and trees all around campus. Gold symbolizes the school’s location on Long Island’s Gold Coast. The school mascot is called “Sir Lancelot the Ocelot.”
The name, the Pioneers, stems from the people who created these traditions. After World War II, establishing a new private college was something unheard of and founding traditions from the ground-up made these innovators feel like pioneers. The name was coined in 1955.
The street names on campus such as Post Lane, University Boulevard, Gold Coast Road, Pioneer Boulevard and Scholar Court were given to these roads after a vote by the campus community in 1997, in an effort to improve signage.
Many students are unaware of the myriad of traditions that LIU Post has. An important step to get students into these traditions would be to inform them. Laurito said, “I think it would be cool…to have something that really…unifies us as a school, like to do every year that everyone can participate in.”

20-year-old singer-songwriter Trish Torrales, a junior Broadcasting major at LIU Post, is an up-and-coming musician who can rock the stage, but is ready to rock your world. Torrales has been playing shows all across Long Island since 2010, and has used passion to turn her dreams into reality.
It all started with “family jams,” Torrales said. “Growing up, all of my guy cousins were always into music, so one day I picked up the guitar and I haven’t put it down since.”
At age 16, Torrales began to play shows at small dive bars with her cousins. When she came to Post, she met her current drummer, best friend, and band manager, Rafe Tangorra. Torrales said, “Rafe has helped me start my current band, Trish Torrales & The Premier, but he has also always helped me with my songs; without him, I wouldn’t be where I am today.”
Torrales has already had an exciting music career. She has performed alongside artists including Aaron Carter, Deleasa (“Married to Jonas”), Melanie Martinez (“The Voice”), and Nick Tangorra (“America’s Got Talent”) at venues such as The Bitter End in Greenwich Village and The Emporium in Patchogue. She came in second place at the first annual MSG Varsity Talent Show that aired on television in May 2011. The singer also came in first place in the song-writing category
for Rockville Centre’s Respect Life Contest with her song “Measure Of Love,” and became the winner of “Best Rising Star” at “Got Talent? Long Island” in March 2012.
But her achievements don’t stop there. Torrales was just chosen out of hundreds of contestants to appear on MTV’s newest singing competition show, “Copycat,” which will air early this summer. On “Copycat,” singers battle it out on stage, doing their best to sound like their favorite recording artists, with the studio audience voting on each performance to determine who will go home empty-handed, and who will advance to win the grand prize: the title of Ultimate Copycat.
Torrales explained, “The show was filmed in Hollywood this past January; I was chosen to be country star Miranda Lambert’s copycat. And weirdly enough, Jonathan Bennett, best known for playing Aaron Samuels in the movie “Mean Girls,” was the host!”
Besides taking 18 credits this semester and being an active member of the WCWP radio station, where she has her own show, “Ain’t That Country,” Torrales still finds time to go to the gym, have a part time job at Pathmark, play gigs, and write her own music. “It sure isn’t easy, but it’s really do-able. I really don’t have a life right now,” Torrales said, laughing. “But it’s all about time management and reaching my goals.”
One of the singer-songwriter’s favorite shows was last September at Revolution Bar and Music Hall, in Amityville. She opened up for, and met her childhood crush, Aaron Carter. Torrales explained,“[Playing
for Carter] was a lot of fun, the bar was really packed that night and I remember listening to his music as a kid, so it was a great experience.”
Another memorable performance of Torrales’ was at the Rock Out Autism show this month on April 5, at the Emporium in Patchogue. “It was a huge deal,” Torrales explained. “We performed for a crowd of more than 800 people, which was by far the biggest show I’ve ever played.” Trish Torrales & The Premier accompanied a few bigger acts, like Jill Jensen from “American Idol,” Reed Deming and Kelly King from “The X Factor,” as well as famous YouTube stars Lohanthony, and Sean O’Donnell.
Torrales considers some of her musical influences to be Grace Potter & The Nocturnals, ZZ Ward, Lana Del Rey, Alanis Morissette, Led Zeppelin, and Third Eye Blind.
While identifying herself as “a bluesy, southern feel in a classic rock sound,” Torrales never hesitates to look for inspirations to incorporate into her own style, and is frequently supporting other local musicians and attending live shows.
Torrales plans to release her new song, “Nitty Gritty” sometime this summer to accompany her single “Tonight,” which is currently available on iTunes. Torrales said, “I’ve already started recording it and it’s coming along great; I can’t wait for the release.” 
To find out more about Trish Torrales & The Premier, check out trishtorrales.com and tune into WCWP 88.1, for “Ain’t That Country” every Tuesday from 4-6 p.m.

Summer, when college students are free from homework and exams, is a perfect time to take advantage of all of the music festivals in the tri-state area. Over the past few years, summer festivals have grown in popularity, and now there is nearly one every month in the region, catering to all genres of music.
Some of Post students’ favorite festivals include Electric Daisy Carnival and Governor’s Ball. 
The Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) takes place bewteen May 24 and 25. This year, the festival will host multiple stages for electronic music and events at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Some artists performing include Calvin Harris, Afrojack, Steve Angello, and Tiesto. A regular admission ticket allows you access to multiple music stages and carnival activities. Bars are located throughout the event. The two-day regular admission pass is $240, while the single day pass is $142. VIP tickets are also available for both single day and two-day admission. VIP tickets include a separate entrance, bar and lounge areas, and viewing decks overlooking the different stages. Tickets can be purchased at electricdaisycarnival.com/NewYork. 
“The tickets are expensive, but every concert is the same price really, and at least here you get to see tons of different artists rather than just one – definitely worth it,” said Thomas Durso, a freshman Business Administration major. 
Governor’s Ball is scheduled for June 6, 7, and 8, on Randall’s Island Park along the East River in New York City. The show will feature artists such as Skrillex, Vampire Weekend, Axwell, and many more. Tickets are sold at governorsballmusicfestival.com. Single day tickets cost $100 while the three-day pass is $230. VIP tickets are also available for purchase and include a private bar and cabana area. 
I’m going to the Governor›s Ball with a ton of my friends. We go every year to get together and kick off the summer,» said Abby Brosnan, a sophomore Broadcasting major 
No matter how students are spending their summer, there is bound to be some great music and fun in the sun.

Woody Allen has written, directed and occasionally starred in one film a year since 1977. If you can’t do the math: he’s made well over 35 films in that time. The feat is fortified by his consistency of quality. Most recently, Cate Blanchett went home with a Best Actress Academy Award for 2013’s “Blue Jasmine”, and the film received a myriad of other nominations, including Best Original Screenplay. One can anticipate an Allen film every year, and it has become fairly easy to identify his signature style, especially in his latest offering.
“Magic in the Moonlight” is very much a Woody Allen film. The story takes place on the scenic southern French Riviera in the late 1920‘s (an era the director already visited in 2011‘s “Midnight in Paris”). It is smothered in his usual neurotic, cynical, philosophical characterization. Wei Ling Soo, the alias of snobbish Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth), is a prestigious stage magician whose act is lauded for being technically superb. For the act, he hides behind layers of makeup and prosthetics that make him look Chinese, setting up the overarching themes of the film immediately: illusion and identity. He is deeply observant and willing to speak his mind – the character is reminiscent of the director’s own classic 1970‘s and 80‘s acting, except with a neater, more precise British charm.
After being tipped off by a friend, the atheistic Stanley sets out to visit and disprove of an alleged spiritualist from America, named Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) whose “mental vibrations” have gotten her hired by the wealthy Catledge family to contact their recently diseased patriarch. Sophie is able to pick up impossible psychic impressions (such as personal family histories she could know) stumping Stanley and bringing his godless beliefs into question. They develop an odd friendship, wavering from quasi-flirtatious, to accusatory, as Stanley desperately tries to understand how different the world may actually be if Sophie is not a fake. He is a man of logic. She may defy logic.
Allen is arguably his strongest when tackling the romantic comedy genre ( “Annie Hall,” “Manhattan,” and a handful of others). “Magic in the Moonlight” showcases his ability to create quirky, flamboyant settings for his characters to meander into love. Firth and Stone fit well together, maintaining an energetic, back-and-forth relationship that echoes the filmmaker’s early work. Stone’s character, having risen from the lower-middle class, to being romantically courted by her male bourgeois clients, adds a classic fish-out-of-water aspect to the film. These are characters that captivate the audience with quick-moving conversations, and make us desperately want to keep up with them. Yet, it is often hard to do so.
The filmmaker is known for his loaded, often culturally relevant dialogue. This aspect, though, is not for adamant realists – every word, every joke seems highly calculated, making the film feel like a stage-play, sometimes even like a fantasy. “Magic in the Moonlight” feigns pulling any real dramatic punches in the long-run. It lapses into a neat formula towards the end, almost echoing Golden-Age Hollywood. Perhaps this classicality to the story was fully intentional, since there is a romanticism inherently built in to its roaring 1920’s setting. That isn’t to say the film is not enjoyable. Allen’s dialogue-centric, ping-ponging comedy, despite free-wheeling expressionism, is refreshing amidst the overwhelming glut of physical, cringe and toilet-humor in mainstream cinema. Allen once again proves that he’s still a compelling writer and director, never short of ideas – especially his iconic wit.
“Magic in the Moonlight” opens in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on July 25, followed by nationwide expansion. It will screen at Lincoln Plaza Cinema at Broadway and W. 63rd Street in New York City.
Verdict: B+

1969 was a packed year in American history. The Vietnam War, among other social and political problems, had rallied many people into protest. 500,000 or more joined together at the Woodstock Music Festival that August, a historic gathering of not only college students, but several generations of Americans. Yet, the American home front was safe. The fight between communism and democracy was largely overseas, far away from the American citizenship.
Halfway around the world, however, there were solid, often deadly consequences for Eastern European countries such as Czechoslovakia, which felt the brunt force of the pushing and tugging by Soviet Russia’s totalitarian regime.Polish director Agniezka Holland’s “Burning Bush” projects those struggles onto the screen like a visual textbook, one that does not omit the unpleasant parts of the time period.
The three-part film, clocking in at four hours total, was made for HBO by Holland (remember her Oscar nominated “In Darkness” back in 2011?), and began showing at Film Forum in New York (with two, fifteen minute breaks) on June 11. It is based on true events and real people, set three months after the Prague Spring, a brief respite of reform from Soviet control that was ended by the USSR.
The self-immolation of Jan Palach, a history-student-turned-protester from Prague, kick starts the story and illustrates the desperate nature of the Czech populace during this era in history. His literal burning, and the aftermath of that sacrificial action, parallels the biblical nature of the title: just like the burning bush refuses to give in to the fire, Czechoslovakia refused to give up hope of freedom.
“Burning Bush” isn’t about one person and hisstruggle, but a whole nation. At such a length, the story has the luxury of skipping from character to character; the family of the burnt college student, a young lawyer, a group of journalists fighting against censorship, government officials, and police. In this way, the viewer is let in to different experiences, forming one, cohesive, whole story. The tear-jerking onion layers are pulled off over the next four hours, as the film provides a multitude of viewpoints.
However, the most attention is given to Dagmar Buresova, the young female lawyer who defended Jan’s family despite the adversity of the communist government, a regime who sought to defame his protest legacy. Her story is full of political intrigue – exciting like a thriller, but paying important attention to the heaving, drawn-out efforts of the Czech citizenship fighting for freedom. A freedom which would not come to fruition for another twenty years, coinciding the fall of the Berlin wall, and collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. Choice cinematography, piggybacking on the tense situations of the film in neat execution, creates an atmosphere of surreal danger. Some scenes are filmed in black and white (like old stock footage) and with a documentary feel, to further framing the events in a historical context. This adds an extra layer of realism – a reminder that the story is non-fiction.
Holland dishes out Hitchcockian suspense, like when Jan’s mother takes a train to visit her son, his self-immolation unknown to her until she sees his face in a newspaper. Her speechless response sums up the bended reality of that time. One scene in the film does well to illustrate this severity, when Buresova notes that Soviet tanks and gunfire have become common in the city. The scary thing is that these sights and sounds are becoming a new, absurd normality.
“Burning Bush” is a reminder to the Czech people of their historical resilience. To the United States and the rest of the world, it is an eye-opening account of history brought to the screen with astounding clarity of experience.
Verdict: A

Greer Grammer just graduated from the University of California School of Dramatic Arts this spring. Yes, she’s a star from MTV’s “Awkward” (now shooting its fourth season) and the daughter of Kelsey Grammer (“Frasier”), but when the Pioneer interviewed her, via telephone, the 22-year-old was as humble as any college-aged student facing the daunting task of declaring independence.
The actress had a featured role in “Life Partners,” a film that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, and recently completed the feature film“Christmas in Balsam Falls”. Grammer discussed her college experience, her acting career, and trying to juggle work and play.
The Pioneer (TP): How do you feel since graduating USC? Is it a weight off your chest?
Greer Grammer (GG): Yeah, a little bit. It’s bittersweet; leaving school is weird. Not having any classes is nice. It’s all scarier because I don’t have a cushion. Being in college, it’s [was] like ‘yeah, I have my job, but I’m still in school so if I don’t it’s fine’; but now it’s like ‘oh, I need to do something’.
TP: Do you have any advice for someone entering or in theater school?
GG: Just to be involved. To be totally honest, I wasn’t [as] involved with my theater school as I would have liked to because I was working. And all of my friends that I have in the theater school who were involved had the best time. I was always kind of jealous of it, because they were doing plays and scenes together, all of these fun things. I’m very grateful for my job, working on [Awkward], but I definitely feel like I missed out a little bit of the actual theater college experience.
TP: “Awkward” focuses a lot on teenage identity, especially in high school, but that theme is still relevant to college students. Did you find it easier to define yourself in college?
GG: Yeah, absolutely. College is the first time you’re away from your family, living on your own and learning how to be independent. With that comes a different learning experience in dealing with the world. But I think there’s definitely a lot of self-discovery and learning [about] who you are. [That] can change so much in a different environment, depending on which college you go to and what you get involved in. I think you learn more about yourself in college than you do in high school.
TP: Tell us about your character Mia in “Life Partners”. Who is she and how can you relate to her?
GG: Mia is afun-loving, ready-to-take-on-the-world, 20-year-old lesbian who kind of falls for Leighton [Meester]‘s character Sasha, who is a couple of years older. The way that I relate to Mia is that she isn’t worried about what she is going to do with the rest of her life; she’s really worried about the now. A lot of 20-year-olds are invested in what is happening now, so it’s a fun contrastbecause Leighton’s character is like ‘no, I need to actually figure out what I’m going to do with my life, I can’t sit back on my music degree forever’: [mean]while, Mia says ‘no, let’s go on vacation and see this band play and do all of these cool things because we can’.
TP: Do you have any memorable moments from when you were working on that film?
GG: The whole thing was memorable. I got to work with people who I’ve grown up watching: Leighton [and] Adam Brody, [also] Abby Elliot and Kate McKinnon who’ve been on Saturday Night Live. It was a really cool experience to work and film with these people.
TP: Do you have any rituals or traditions you have, getting into a role, before a performance?
GG: I really dive into my script a couple days before. I go over the lines, usually working with an acting coach as well. I try to get into it as best [as] I can. I get myself prepared, and then the day-of on set, I kind of let everything go so that it’s more natural. That’s what I do.
TP: Any particular acting methods that work for you?
GG: I learned a lot of different things in college, different lessons in acting. The ones that I’ve always liked are sort of improv. One of my teachers had this improv [exercise] where we had to state our intentions and scream them at each other and have a whole conversation, and when she said ‘action’ we’d start the scene. I really like doing that, building it up, figuring out your intention, and then playing the scene from there. It was really cool.
TP: What inspires you? Do you have any role models?
GG: I have people I look up to as far as my career goes. I love Reese Witherspoon. As far as older actresses go, I love Grace Kelly. They’re my role models. I look up to my older [actor] sister Spencer as a role model.
TP: Do you have any upcoming projects?
GG: I have a movie I shot last year [coming out] called “Christmas in Balsam Falls,” and that was a really cool film for me to do. I think that should be coming out around November, because it’s a Christmas film. I know it just got picked up for distribution from someone. So I’m very excited about that movie.

‘Riding the Lightning’
Metallica’s second album, “Ride the Lightning,” turned 30 years old last month, and is still regarded by many as one of the best thrash metal records of all time. Many of its songs have been staples of Metallica’s live sets for decades. After “Ride the Lightning,” Metallica went on to sell out venues; they spearheaded the thrash metal explosion of the mid to late 80s with others bands such as Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth.
Yet when the members of Metallica entered the studio to record their sophomore record in February 1984, they were just happy to be able to record another album, and could not have predicted its success and enduring popularity. The album went on to become certified platinum six times. Needless to say, the band did not suffer from a “sophomore slump.”
The band members flew to Copenhagen, Denmark to record the album, and picked Sweet Silence Studios to lay down the recording because it was cheaper to record there. Denmark is also Ulrich’s native country.
“We were really broke,” drummer Lars Ulrich said in a July 28, 2014 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, describing their financial and living conditions when they recorded the album. “We had to live day to day,” Ulrich described. “A friend literally gave us his apartment to stay in while we were recording.” Ulrich said that he and James [Hetfield] shared the bedroom while Kirk [Hammett] and Cliff [Burton] shared a couch.
Prior to recording, Metallica had just finished touring for their first record, “Kill Em’ All.” All four band members were in their early 20s and were experiencing a bit of homesickness during the recording process in Copenhagen. “It was three American guys and a Danish guy. It was easy for the Danish guy to fit in, but it wasn’t so easy for the three American guys to fit in. We were experiencing culture shock a little bit,” guitarist Hammett told Rolling Stone.
To add to the culture shock, their equipment was stolen in Boston before the band left for Europe. Producer of “Ride the Lightning,” Flemming Rasmussen, recalled the process of finding Marshall amps, Hetfield’s preferred amplifier brand, that Hetfield could use to record in an interview with Rolling Stone.
“We had to get all the Marshall amps from some of the metal bands that were in Denmark at that time, so like nine Marshall amps, and spent the first day testing them. We actually recreated James’ guitar sound on Kill ‘Em All, but just beefed it up,” Rasmussen said. “He was really pleased with that.”
‘Fight Fire with Melody’
Metallica entered the studio with three new songs that contained a more melodic approach to thrash metal, a genre that Metallica cemented into the history of rock ‘n’ roll with “Kill em’ All.” Although some fans labeled them as sellouts upon hearing these songs due to their slower tempos and melodic sound, it’s silly to think about now because “Fade to Black, “Escape” and For Whom the Bell Tolls” defined what Metallica was and would become.
“Fade to Black,” is a power ballad, a song so melodic and catchy that its guitar solo by Hammett was placed at number 24 on the 100 Best Solos Ever Reader’s Choice in the September 1998 issue of Guitar World. The breakdown in the song is when the jam really kicks in; it’s a heavy yet emotional bridge that displays Metallica’s knack for melody. When Hetfield belts out, “Yesterday seems as though it never existed, Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye,” you can’t help but get chills.
“For Whom the Bell Tolls,” was inspired by Ernest Hemingway’s novel of the same name that dealt with modern warfare and the horrors that come along with it. The song is famous for its slow head banging tempo throughout but especially for its recognizable introduction that was written by Burton. Although Burton was tragically killed during a bus accident on September 27, 1986, his legacy lives through this killer intro.
“Escape,” is a poppy song, compared to the rest of Metallica’s catalogue at the time; nonetheless it is a good one. It contains all that ingredients of a thrash metal song, with heavy use of low-e palm muted strumming. The chorus, however, is a melodic one that resembles the direction of the two other songs. “Escape” has only been played live once. It was performed in Atlantic City, New Jersey on June 23, 2012. In the same Rolling Stone interview Hammett explained why, “It’s in the key of “A,” like “The Call of Ktulu” and “Metal Militia,” but the key of “A” doesn’t really work well for us for some reason or another. Playing that song was more of a novelty than anything else, but we loved playing all the other songs.”
Legacy
The album has aged well, AllMusic has given the album five out of five stars, while IGN Music placed “Ride the Lightning” at number five on their “Top 25 Metal Albums” list. “Ride the Lightning” is a huge achievement, a record that will continue to please new and old listeners for years to come. Six times platinum, people, six times.
The ‘Ride’ Isn’t Over
Metallica’s career isn’t over yet, they are getting ready to release a new record in 2015, vocalist-guitarist Hetfield just turned 51 on August 3, and the band just did a parody on ESPN’s spot ‘This is SportsCenter.’

Woody Allen met with members of the press, including the Pioneer, on July 17 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. The week before the release of his new film, “Magic in the Moonlight,” he, along with actors Colin Firth, and Jacki Weaver, frankly discussed how his religious beliefs have trickled into his writing, and the role of the artist in society.
It is widely known that Allen is an atheist. His films, with their existentially nauseated nerve-ball characters (think Alvy Singer from 1977’s “Annie Hall”), sprinkle metaphysical life questions into casual conversation. What happens when we die? Will we have any real legacy? Does Death have a sense of humor? How long is it until the sun explodes? In a Woody Allen film, all of these questions may be asked in an offhanded, fastidious succession — on a city street, or even the bedroom.
The writer/director has often laced macabre notions with comedy. His latest film, “Magic in the Moonlight,” (released on July 25) is a romantic-comedy that challenges religion up front, nestled within an array of humorous, fast-moving dialogue. In the film, the snobbish stage-magician Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth) seeks to disprove the clairvoyant abilities of a young American spiritualist named Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) on the 1920’s French Riviera. Stanley is a man who firmly lives by logic. Sophie just may defy logic.
“Colin’s character wants nothing more than to be wrong,” said Allen. “He wants to find out that there is more to life, and that [Sophie] is right that there are unknown, magical, and amazing things [in the world]. As soon as he sees that there may be more to life, he sees purpose, underlying meaning; it changes him completely. He smells the flowers and loves everything. His life has changed.”
Firth’s character lives rigidly in a technical, empirical manner — what he sees is what he gets. To him, any illusion, like his own stage act, is purely a spectacle that can be broken down, figured out and debunked. When Sophie provides “mental impressions” of personal family information she couldn’t possibly know, Stanley develops a new, albeit wary, hope for an afterlife.
Perhaps Allen truly wants to believe in something greater as well, but has not been thrown a wild card such as Sophie. He is a man of logic, just like Stanley. He must construct his own magic. “Magic in the Moonlight” is not his first film to involve the otherworldly– “Purple Rose of Cairo” (1985) saw a man walk out of a film into real life, and “Midnight in Paris” (2011) incorporated time-travel fantasy. At a young age, inspired by Harry Houdini, Allen studied and performed tricks.
“I’ve been escaping my whole life,” he explained. “Ever since I was a little child, I’ve been escaping to the movies on the other side, as an audience member. I’d sit in the movies all day long. When I got older, I escaped into the world of unreality by making movies. I prefer the magic to reality and have since I was five years old. Hopefully I can continue to make films and constantly escape into them.”
The 78-year-old filmmaker believes that life, in the end, is meaningless. To deal with that void, he turns to distraction. “I’m not alone in thinking this,” he said. “There have been many great minds, far, far superior to mine, that have come to that conclusion. And unless somebody can come up with some proof or some example where it’s not, I think it is. I think it’s a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing, and that’s just the way I feel about it.”
“Magic in the Moonlight” contains references to philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, famous for his atheism and embrace of the physical world over the idea of an afterlife. It is no surprise that Allen’s philosophical curiosities have trickled into his writing, as he is considered one of the premier auteur (distinct voice) filmmakers in cinema and has been doing so for decades.
But where does the artist fit into Allen’s world? At first, he expressed a somewhat depressive view , again citing logic and science — eventually the universe will come apart, and human achievement will be utterly gone. “All the great works of Shakespeare and Beethoven and Da Vinci, all that will be gone,” he explained. “There will be nothing, absolutely nothing: no time, no space, nothing at all. Just zero.”
The journalists chuckled here and there, as Allen shredded apart the meaning of life before lunchtime. Yet, there was an ultimate, positive message embedded in his words: that artists are here to help, at least in the present. They are here make life less drab, with their pretty pictures, musical notes and language.
“I think it’s the artist’s job to try and find some solution or reason to accept things,” said Allen, who found an anecdote to further explain, about two types of filmmakers existing. “One makes films that are deep, intellectual, profound and confrontational. The other makes purely vacuous escapist films. I’m not sure who makes the deeper contribution [to the world].”
“[Experiencing art] is like drinking a cold lemonade on a hot day,” he explained. “You’re refreshed. Then you walk out into the terrible heat, and you can take it for a few hours more. That is the only thing I can think of the artist doing. The artist cannot give you a satisfying answer to the dreadful reality of human existence. So, the best you can do is maybe entertain people, and refresh them for an hour and a half. Then they can go on and meet the onslaught, [until] somebody else picks them up again.”
Allen believes that the artist is here to distract, to provide that escapism he has been welcoming his whole life. They provide the magic, even if it is an illusion. And with a filmography that stretches over nearly fifty years, he is has proven a supreme distractor — even if only for a short while, as we gaze up at the big screen.

Michael Walker’s “The Maid’s Room” starts simply enough. Drina (Paula Garces) is a young, attractive Colombian woman who takes a job as a live-in maid to the Crawford family, who are? rich-and-powerful New Yorkers with a gated house in the Hampton’s on Long Island. “She’s better than the others,” says Mrs. Crawford (Annabella Sciorra). “At least she speaks English.” The Crawfords are away most of the time, working in the city, but Drina is left with their teenage son Brandon (Phillip Ettinger), who flirts with her by offering some Kit-Kats (her favorite candy) and making sure to break into the liqueur cabinet with his friends when throwing a small shindig.
One night as Drina sleeps in the maid’s room beneath her (appropriately strong female lead) “Erin Brockovich” poster, she notices Brandon noisily and drunkenly pull his car into the garage, stumble inside and proceed to use the sink for a while. The next morning, playing detective, she finds a bloody sponge and the front of the car ruined – he’d obviously been in an accident. Mr. Crawford (Bill Camp) comes down hard on his son, berating his lack of responsibility, and then fishing out information from the hapless Drina. “It was a deer,” says Brandon. No, no it wasn’t. The ripped out newspaper articles and ultra-stressed Crawford family prove other-wise. But they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Nothing will get in the way of Brandon going to Princeton next year, not even murder.
Drina falls into a (very) uncomfortable situation – turn in Brandon and get deported as an illegal immigrant, or take a great sum of money from Mr. Crawford, who thinks he’s got everything under control. Her morality gets the better of her, but that doesn’t stop the Crawford’s from forcefully detaining her, the maid’s room literally becoming a prison. Alas, Drina has friends who know where she is. They come knocking.
The score in “The Maid’s Room” dances from two, sometimes unfitting extremes – like an oddly hopeful fantasy (ala “Chronicles of Narnia”) or else a 1930’s or 40’s suspense film swelling with ominous pianos and melodrama. Speaking of which, “The Maid’s Room” takes blaring influence from Alfred Hitchcock, hobbled together like a modernized collage of his films (even directly referencing shots), predominantly “Blackmail,” “Rear Window,” “Psycho,” and the dark, upper-class schmaltz of “Rebecca”. For this very reason, the film seems unfocused and not sure of what it really wants, sampling from a buffet of story, but never settling into it’s own groove and identity.
Unlike other Hitchcock rehashes, like “Disturbia,” this film fails to lock itself down, first moving slowly (we see Drina’s job explained, in long-winded detail) and then too quickly, where several characters would benefit from a more personal exposure to the audience. Mrs. Crawford in particular seems to take a back-seat later in the film, superseded by the men in her house.
“The Maid’s Room” changes into a very different beast half-way through, shifting focus to the Crawford family guilt, suddenly incorporating flashbacks and a noted increase of an ‘Amityville Horror” feeling of surrealism and psychological horror – such as a symbolic infestation of ants. Perhaps that element stresses the ultimate theme of the film, convoluted by etch-e-sketch characterization and flaky, overdone dialogue (“You’re nothing. You’re not even a person. You’re dirt.”) that spoiled upper-class folks, who seem to have all of the power, can still be reduced to murderous, bumbling mistake-makers. If only this theme was orchestrated in a more seducing, clean way the film would be more than a couple hours worth of head-scratching and (unwanted, I’d assume) laughs.
“The Maid’s Room” opened in limited theatrical release on August 8.
Verdict: C+

Director Colin Healey’s “Homemakers” is a (literally) smashing debut – a comedy that ultimately is about finding a home and identity amidst the entropy of life. The film won this year’s Audience Award at the Independent Film Festival of Boston, and made its New York premier at the Northside Festival in Brooklyn on June 16.
Irene (Rachel McKeon) is a rowdy, indie-punk singer with an affinity for chaos, who, after fighting with her bisexual lapsing lover/accordion player Kicky (Molly Carlisle), takes time off from band life to visit an old house in Pittsburgh that she has inherited from her grandfather. She seeks to restore the trash-heap of a home by making it her own mess – painting with her body, breaking old furniture, and swigging bottles of liquor with the help of her long-lost cousin Cam (Jack Culbertson). Slowly Irene feels herself becoming a responsible and settled person, a conflict at odds with her once vagabond way of life.
Healey and McKeon spoke to The Pioneer on June 11 via telephone about filmmaking, music, and the fun of destroying inanimate objects.
 The Pioneer (TP): At what point did you decide, “I’m making this film”?
Colin Healey (CH): I moved to Pittsburgh and I thought it was the most beautiful place, but there is this sort of sad story that the city has been split in half and all these houses are left there. I thought that would be a good place to find drama and comedy. Also, I come from a distant, extended family prone to acts of extremism, so I figured it [this kind of story] felt close to me.
TP: Was the house in the film [loaned by] a friend, or did you have to scout for it?
CH: I used to hang out at a bar, the one you see at the end of the movie, with the production designer and prop master, who were my roommates. The guy who owned the bar, Steve, is a sweet guy and he happened to own [the property]. Steve cut a deal. He leased it [to us] for a dollar a month. The art department was able to do whatever they wanted, but we weren’t able to reshoot or do anything like that.
TP: Rachel, when did you start getting involved [with this project]? 
Rachel McKeon (RM): I got involved through a casting notice. I was living in Pittsburg doing theater, and I hadn’t really considered the film scene much because there isn’t very much there in terms of “homegrown” Pittsburg films. But then I saw this notice out on a website. I was really drawn to whoever was behind it because I could tell that the person was interesting, creative, and smart. It turned out that [Colin] and I had all of these mutual friends.
CH: I was sharing a really bombed-out studio with one of her roommates.
RM: Yeah, with one of my, like fifteen roommates. I live in a huge house. It was the perfect situation and was such an amazing role. I hadn’t [found much work] in theater, and I hadn’t been offered any films yet, so it was very good timing.
TP: Maybe you’re long-lost cousins? 
CH: We actually have the exact same ethnic background. We both come from Jewish families in the Bronx.
RM: But grew up in other places.
TP: Rachel, I’ve heard that you have a very different personality from the character of Irene. How was it transforming into that character? Did you do anything in particular? Join a fight-club?
RM: That would be so cool, but no. The difference between me and Irene is very physical. Her gait, her walk is such a huge thing we worked on. I really had the chance to delve into that before shooting. Colin would have me walk, giving me ideas of how she would walk, and we would tape it and do a couple more, then go back and review it. It was very nice to be able to have that objective eye before shooting. If I wasn’t allowed to see what I was doing, I think it wouldn’t have come out as well. It became clear to me which version of Irene was more captivating on-screen, and which version wouldn’t have been as interesting. It was all very helpful because I showed up on set on day one and already knew where we were going with her [character].
TP: Who and what influenced you artistically for the film? 
CH: On early SNL, Gilda Radner had a rock star character that is sort of like Patti Smith. Her name was Candy Slice. We watched all of the Candy Slice [skits]. She’s not really Irene, but she was a reference.
RM: [The character] is somebody who is so [filled with] pure energy. And her energy is up and down. It’s so good.
TP: Were there any particular challenges for the “Homemakers” production?
CH: Well, first off, we didn’t know what we were doing. I mean, we did know how to make good movies, but we didn’t know how people normally make movies. We had to figure out routines for ourselves. For example, one of our production designers had never seen a call sheet before. So we were kind of making up a production process that seemed right for us. That was challenging. Rachel had to do an incredible amount in the film.
RM: It was sort of realizing that we had this incredible, creative balance [going;] that is rare on most professional sets. We had so many visual artists on set, so many creative people aboard who were not traditional filmmakers who went to film school, or actors who had been on TV. We had to preserve that [creativity] while somehow getting through it in an organized way. I think that’s the balance that [Colin] is talking about.
We want to preserve it in the future, to always have our sets feel spontaneous and creative [like this one was]. We, as actors, felt very safe with Colin on set. We could fail. We could screw up. And we could also do something very bold and awesome that really worked. Everybody would just celebrate creativity in general. That was the spirit of the set, and it was very special.
TP: Were there any notable differences, compared to your theater and short film work, Rachel?
RM: It’s funny. I think the biggest difference isn’t feature versus short, although it is incredible to [portray] a character with such a big arc. When you’re shooting a short, it’s usually like a vignette. If it’s very well done, it can have an arc, but a lot of times they’re not that fleshed out. Really the difference is the creative energy. [The “Homemakers”] set reminded me of theater, actually; being in the rehearsal room, and how spontaneous and creative everyone, present, in the moment, alive. It reminded me of the creation of theater, which I think is very special.
TP: Some films have one or two scenes where things are broken or smashed. “Homemakers” has a lot of scenes of destruction. Can you tell us about the making of those scenes? I assume you didn’t have many takes? 
CH: It depends.Especially in the big destruction at the end, those shots mostly happened in one take. The shack falling down in the beginning – that was one take. That could have been reset, but it had to be once, time wise. We wanted things to just happen on camera, sort of like a documentary.
TP: Did you have fun smashing things, Rachel? 
RM: I did eventually, but I was really scared in the beginning. I knew this was such a big part of Irene’s personality that I needed to conquer – her bravery and her lack of concern for her own body, like her organs; the drinking as well. She drinks a lot and eats like crap. All of those things I could fake, but the smashing of things I really had to take on myself. I love watching it.
TP: Music obviously has a large role in the film. What kind of music do you listen to?
CH: I listen to fun music, but I mostly listen to music that is appropriate for whatever story I’m working on. So, when I was working on Homemakers as a writer, I was listening to a lot of Patti Smith, and like Le Tigre, fun music that Irene would like. Now I’m listening to like Tangerine Dream and [different] music for my next film.
RM: My musical tastes are quite eccentric. But also not at the same time. I’m a huge fan of classical music and I love jazz. I have the musical taste of a fifty year old at the end of the day. I was just raving about Scott Joplin and rag-tag downstairs, and people were just looking at me with glazed looking eyes. I love old Americana, which also drove me to Homemakers. Old folk and Lomax recordings. Gospel choirs. Those are the things that I really collect and treasure.
CH: The thing about Rachel being eclectic is that we have this character of Irene who likes to sing, but she has a thousand different styles. She sings in a punk style, but then we hear her sing “Suwannee River” which is a Stephen Foster song. And then she sings a Polka Song. That’s Rachel. She can do any of those styles because she listens to that music and she loves it.
TP: What are you working on next? I heard a rumor that you two will be collaborating on a new project?
RM: We are. It’s another movie.
CH: It’s going to be the same team of filmmakers, with a couple new people; some new visual artists who I can’t say who they are.
RM: It’s bigger in scope is what I can say. It’s taking that next step.
CH: It’s got the opposite [visual] color palette. It’s about nature and civilization.
RM: The setting is going to be less than grand, to put it one way.

Graphic novel adaptations have often dealt with serious, culturally relevant themes. In 2007’s “Persepolis,” we saw how Iranian society limits freedom of expression. “Watchmen” in 2009 posited questions regarding war, being a vigilante and utilitarianism. Originally adapted in Spain, Paco Roca’s award-winning “Wrinkles,” released in 2011, digs into problems of age, particularly memory loss and the sometimes- shaky  morality of homes for the elderly. The animated film has recently been remade in English, with Martin Sheen taking the lead role of Emilio, a man who is reluctant to admit that he can’t take care of himself anymore.
Emilio’s family brings him to an elderly home, where he soon meets his flamboyant roommate Miguel (Matthew Modine). They take a tour of the facility, where Emilio is soon exposed to the twisted underbelly of his situation – several babbling, hapless folks at the home are kept “upstairs,” where they reside in a constant state of confusion. Emilio discovers that Miguel has been swindling money out of their delirious peers, and they have a falling out. Eventually, though, they develop a pact to keep both of them from being sent upstairs, no matter what it takes.
Wrinkles” is very much an adult film – expect many old-person sex jokes, drab musings on mortality and cursing. It plays out in a psychological way like Milos Forman’s “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” but in a retirement home, with a constant sense that the characters are being manipulated, and herded around like soon-to-be-dead cattle. The halls of the elderly home feel like a labyrinth, Emilio discovering the dark realities of the place in the monotony of his stay. We see how every day he eats the same meals, sees the same people and falls into an oppressive routine. Emilio’s alienation becomes even more apparent when his family visits for Christmas, and seems oddly careful, at a distance as if he is a child. The sad moments outweigh the humor of the film, in a somewhat off-balanced way.
The fairly-simplistic  animation style allows for a loose, free-wheeling expression of memory loss and old age – the filmmaker is free to swiftly move between flashbacks and nearly hallucinatory moments. Emilio and Miguel have an interesting chemistry, see-sawing between distrust and camaraderie. Some of the sadder moments of the film are disarming, and suck the fun away just as quick as it arrives. While it has funny moments, “Wrinkles” can feel like a heaving, depressing sloth.
“Wrinkles,” was directed by Ignacio Ferrera, from a screenplay written by Ferrera with Roca. It opened on July 4 at New York City’s IFC Center on 323 Avenue of the Americas, and will be followed by a DVD and digital release on July 15.
Verdict: B-

Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” might be the most literal coming-of-age tale ever brought to film. The writer/director is known for his strikingly original stories that are philosophically and dialogue heavy (“Before Midnight” was nominated at the Oscars last year for its screenplay) – but his latest pushes boundaries in a unique way. “Boyhood” was shot over the course of twelve years, using the same actors, and chronicling the family and social life of Texas-born Mason (newcomer Ellar Coltrane) from ages 5 to 18. The viewer is able to watch this character evolve in the most organic, pure lens possible: time.
“Boyhood” kicks off by immediately establishing Mason’s familial troubles – his father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) is seen mostly in visits.His mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) is attracted to alcoholic men who are poor replacement role models for him and his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater, the director’s daughter) to look up to. It’s fun to see Samantha and Mason bicker with each other in their younger years, pointing fingers filled with boy vs girl angst.
The time transitions are seamless, and are as simple as cutting to a new scene. There is a loose, overarching plot, but a lot of breathing room to simply watch these kids grow up. Each year is basically a short film, with new issues faced as Mason matures. He learns about girls, rebuilds his relationship with his father and has defiant moments against bullies. We live through birthdays, camping trips, and first beers in a little under three hours of viewing time (it seems quicker than that, though). The film is a collage of relatable experiences and childhood benchmarks, ultimately culminating in Mason going to college and striking out on his own.
This is a historical film, not only due to its impressive, involved production, but because it morphs with the times. When Linklater started making it, he of course did not know who would win the 2004 Presidential election (or 2008 for that matter). He did not know how technology would change over the years, from Gameboys, to I-Phones and beyond. His project was free to evolve and partially write itself as the world moved alongside it. We see Mason’s liberal father show distain for George W. Bush in 2004. We see how those opinions and events impact Mason and his family, just as they did millions of other American families. The filmmaker never had to recall what the late 1990’s and early 2000’s were like, because he was in them during production.
The soundtrack is swelling with throwback tracks – from Coldplay, to Blink 182 to Arcade Fire. This certainly adds an extra layer of context to the world the film establishes, which will be familiar to many young adults. It’s like finding a bunch of old knick-knacks, posters, CD’s and clothes up in the attic and having a rush of memories. “Boyhood” is a culturally aware, saturated glimpse into growing up as a suburban kid, without the skewed, time-capsule romanticism of a period piece – it constantly examines a series of present days.
“Boyhood” opens on July 11 in New York at the IFC Center, before its nationwide release on July 18. On July 12, Linklater and Coltrane will appear for several Q and A’s at the IFC Center. The film is rated R.

Hiroyuki Okiura is a veteran in the animated film community. He and his team for his latest, “A Letter to Momo,” have a combined resume of work on hi-fidelity projects, from the ultra-violent “Akira,” to quirky “Cowboy Bebop: The Movie,” to Oscar-winning “Spirited Away,” by master-animator Hayao Miyazaki. Using traditional animation, where the cells are painstakingly, but beautifully, hand-drawn,Okiura’s “Letter to Momo” is a children’s film that adheres to traditional Japanese folk-lore in a vibrant spectacle.
After the death of her oceanographer father, pre-teen Momo Miyaura (Karen Miyama) moves with her mother Ikuko (Yuka) to the Island of Shio – a stark contrast to her urban Tokyo life. This change of pace is apparent as she shyly meets some townies, avoiding eye-contact, and appearing to retreat into herself. Her mother becomes distant too, physically and emotionally, as she searches for a job during the day, leaving Momo to (attempt to) make friends and take care of the house. The young girl is still in the grieving process, in a complex way. Her father left an unfinished letter (saying “Dear Momo”) written shortly after she last saw him, which also happened to be a fight. Echoes of their relationship are felt in the film, becoming more apparent as supernatural elements seep into the story.
Momo notices strange things in the house – items missing, food eaten, scurrying from the attic. She goes up to investigate, finding an Edo era illustration book depicting three yokai (goblins) who escape the prison of the page into the real world. Invisible to adults and outsiders beside her, Momo is startled to find them casually stealing food from the locals. These yokai fell from the sky as rain, hitting her on the way down and giving her the ability to see them.
The de-facto yokai leader is Iwa (Toshiyuki Nishida), a large, bearded ogre with sharp golden teeth. He forms their plans and communicates the most with Momo, even if that gets his group into further trouble. Mame (Chō), whose name roughly translates to “Bean,” is the smallest and newest member of the group, soft-spoken and innocently dim-minded. With his large tongue hanging out of his mouth and very sunken eyes, Mame is equal parts cute and creepy. Kawa (Kōichi Yamadera) is the gawky, frog-like goblin whose arrogance is rivaled only by his flatulence.
With her mother away most of the day, Momo is left to deal with these bumbling intruders. She becomes a babysitter to them, enforcing her rule after stealing their “travel pass” to the earthly realm. In their naivety, they seem to do more harm than help, as it is revealed that they were sent from the “Above” to keep an eye on Momo and her mother during their grieving period. That mission doesn’t stop their mischief, though, as one hilarious scene has them run away from a group of wild boars after they steal their babies. Half of the time the goblins are seeking food, the other half doing lackluster spy-work for the heavens.
“A Letter to Momo” benefits from the sky-is-the-limit aspect of animation, the finale incorporating what seems like thousands of creatures in every frame, while more subtle nuances of the location create a fluid “world” for the story. Shio Island is an idyllic Japanese landscape, set on the Seto Inland Sea, and showcasing terrace-farms, shrines and one very large bridge. The town is populated mostly by couldn’t-be-bothered old folk, but some goofy characters, like a friendly mailman, and local children, who add even more personality to the story.
Momo slowly emerges from her tightly-closed shell, the film merging coming-of-age themes the over-coming of death. She meets a young boy named Yota (Kota Fuji), who introduces her to the other children in the town, as well as their traditions. As her own grieving starts to subside, the struggles of Momo’s mother come to the forefront -when she falls violently ill during a tumultuous storm. The film balances its quirky milieu with darker themes of death, and sickness.This is a feat not easily accomplished, proving that well-made Japanese films can be produced outside of Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli.
“A Letter to Momo,” is distributed by GKIDS Films and opens July 23 at NYC’s IFC Center, before expanding further in the United States. The film is the grand prize winner of the New York International Children’s FIlm Festival.

Jen (Jo Mei) and Kyle (Andrew Pang) are two predictably combative siblings, forced to be together after the death of their mother (Jodi Long, seen in flashbacks). They must clean out their old childhood home in rural Pennsylvania, essentially throwing away physical memories. Cooped up together, the siblings grieve in contrasting ways – butting heads all the while.
Kyle is the supposed responsible adult, the older divorced brother who took care of his mother in her final months, whereas Jen is a couldn’t-be-bothered hipster, chock full of excuses. They are joined by her wannabe tech-geek boyfriend Doug (Lucas Dixon) (think Chris Pratt from “Parks & Recreation”), and best-friend Mika (Teyonah Parris), who supply emotional support, humor and some marijuana. Kyle deals with their presence, at first an annoyance, by chugging beers and bike riding around town, detaching himself. The dynamic is similar to typical cabin-in-the-woods horror films – a group of very naive people who can’t seem to get along, crammed into a single location – but without a sadistic killer or force in the story.
The siblings discover some, well, graphic photos on a hard drive, revealing that their mother may have had a lover in her final years. This notion hits them hard – Why didn’t she mention him? Who is this man? How will I ever get these scarring images out of my head? This complication, reluctantly brought into open discussion, brings the group of misfits together, creating a bickering, clumsy team of detectives.
A whodunit revels in the satisfaction of surprise. “A Picture of You” seems to give attention only to overcooked humor and forced awkward moments. When the big reveal happens, it is charged with purposely humorous shock-value, which cheapens the reality of it and the impact on the characters. Kyle and Jen have their obligatory making up moment; their relationship becomes closer after they realize that their mother harbored secrets just like them. Their character arcs are very apparent, played out in a stale and recognizable way.
“A Picture of You,” is yet another film that attempts to defy categorization, but ends up doing the opposite. Shaky handheld camerawork in the film is distracting and coercive – projecting conflict on a story full of shabby sentiment. Yet, the lush visuals of Pennsylvania and an airy lullaby-like score uplift the film where needed. The general minimalism overall of the rural setting and small cast is commendable, but is never filled out by gripping characters that go beyond seeming like fill-ins for an elongated sit-com episode.
J.P. Chan’s tongue-in-cheek debut feature is a droll family film that treads on all-too-familiar terrain. Not without entertaining moments, the film is, simply put: too simply put. Cookie-cutter movies might make a brief treat, but don’t forget that film is art, and good art isn’t a hit-and-run chuckle.
“A Picture of You” will open on June 20 at AMC Loews Village VII in New York, before expanding to additional cities.
Verdict: C +

If a hypothetical Noah Baumbach joined Woody Allen on a train to Berlin, Germany, then met up with Jim Jarmusch to form a small gang, sip espresso and smoke cigarettes at the nearest cafe, the intellectual brainchild of the gathering may resemble something similar to Jan Ole Gerster’s feature debut “A Coffee in Berlin.”
The dark and satirical dramedy stars Tom Schilling as Niko Fischer, a young college dropout who has been spending a lot of time thinking and is consequently scolded by his lawyer father, Walter (Ulrich Noethen), for not being proactive enough in figuring out his life. His allowance is cut off. His girlfriend dumps him. Anyone who has ever been in or just out of college, or maybe even just alive and human, will cringe as Fischer is asked what he does for a living, and he responds with nothing. But the tug-of-war with the shaky, unsure, existential mess which is in all of us does not stop there.
In Allen-esque comic fashion (did I mention it is in black and white?) Fischer meets Julika (Friederike Kempter), who used to be the resident fat girl at his high school, and turned out to be a blue-eyed bombshell whose hobby is avant-garde theatre. The two develop one of the most uneasy relationships in recent film history, among scenes of Fischer’s semi-aimless journey through the city with his burly friend Matze (Marc Hosemann). Along the way, a slew of characters richly posit questions regarding identity, belongingness and general life stuff. The heavy bits do not weigh down the film, which clocks in neatly under an hour and a half, with excellent pacing supplemented by a jazzy score.
Fischer is fairly normal in his own right, if only because he is overshadowed by memorably painted characters around him — imagine Lewis Carroll’s Alice, but instead you find a German man in his twenties navigating the streets of Berlin, constantly denied the coffee which he attempts to purchase throughout the film, and compensating with his nicotine addiction. While Schilling is wonderful at portraying a regular guy, his character could have used some extra agency and clearer objectives to be a real player in the story. Yet, this lacking does not render the film without meaning, as the observable world of the film is never a bore. Fischer’s contemplative blues are established right away with a job interview turned authoritative interrogation. Exposition is presented to us through meaningful dialogue laced with tension, something many films these days seem to bypass.
“Coffee in Berlin” isn’t outright surreal but certain moments, be it an actor friend dressed as a Nazi, the befriending of a kindly old woman, or Fischer seeing someone who hasn’t been in his life for a dozen years, construct an ethereal, fairytale-like adventure. Perhaps it is the attention to small detail — the mundane — and the ability to make those things exceedingly interesting that elevates the film to such top-notch form. Fischer is not just another hopeless hipster searching for artistic retribution, but a conduit for a myriad of filmgoers to reconsider how they view the world and others around them.
The film, an official selection of the AFI Film Festival 2013, is the winner of six (6) 2013 German Academy Awards including Outstanding Feature Film, Best Director for Gerster and Best Actor for Schilling. It will be released by Music Box Films, opening in New York City at the Landmark Sunshine on June 13.

Livia De Paolis co-wrote, directed, produced and acted in her feature film debut “Emoticon,” which first premiered at the Gen Art Film Festival in 2013, and currently has a limited theatrical release at Cinema Village in New York City. The film tells the story of an anthropology Ph.D. student named Elena (De Paolis) who attempts to complete her thesis on modern communication, soon becoming involved in the lives of her new boyfriend’s (Michael Christofer) adopted teenage children — her best subjects of study. Dealing with themes of age, identity and technology, “Emoticon” tackles modern social problems with a touch of indie humor.
A veritable jack-of-all-trades, De Paolis moved to New York in 2001, working within the theater community in collaboration with Richard Foreman and the Ontological Hysteric Theater, 3LD, SITI Company, Labyrinth Theater Company and others. Originally born and raised in Rome, Italy, the actor received her Masters degree in Philosophy from University La Sapienza. De Paolis is currently living in Los Angeles.
The Pioneer had the opportunity to speak with De Paolis about her challenges, process, and memorable moments while making “Emoticon” as well as future projects.
The Pioneer (TP): Can you tell us about the process of getting “Emoticon” made? At what point did you decide to dive in to the production?
Livia De Paolis (LD): Sara [Nerboso] and I started writing the script, and as we were writing it I got progressively more and more involved with it and passionate about it and [wanted] to actually make it. I took a class with Film Independent in Los Angeles, which was [about] how to make an independent film for no money. It’s a very step by step scenario where they explain how to raise money and go about it. However, in the meantime, I also gave the script to James Calleri who is [our] casting director. He really liked it, thank god, and he sent it out to to his contacts at agencies he works with. Thanks to that, Michael Christofer came on board.
I had a little bit of money at the time when I started it, but I didn’t have the full budget. With [Christofer] aboard, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Carol Kane and Sonia Braga joined in. With a more packaged situation I was able to raise more money. Then we cast the kids and shot the movie, but we still didn’t have enough money to finish it. So then I was fortunate enough to have the post-production house here in New York City, called The Station Media. It is [Executive Producer] Hugh Broder’s company. They do post-production for commercials and all sorts of stuff. He read the script, watched a very rough cut of the movie, and decided to come aboard as a producer, basically financing the entire post production. And that’s how the movie was made.
TP: Were there any particular challenges, taking on so many roles as a crew and cast member? What was that experience like?
LD: The part of it that I overestimated was how complex the production aspect is. I had produced theater before but theater involves ten to fifteen people, where a movie involves one to two hundred people. With ultra low-budget movies, while it’s possible to (recruit) very good creative people who are willing to work for little money, because they’re young or they’re working on their reel and their craft, it’s hard to find a producer who is experienced and is willing to do it. That was the most difficult part. For me, I really overestimated myself and my ability to actually do everything, because once we were in it, I thought if I’m shooting and acting I’m not going to be able to be on the phone with agents; I’m not going to be able to look for permits. It became clear to me that I cannot do everything, although I did a lot. One morning I ended up driving the truck with the camera to location.
TP: What about happy moments?
LD: So many. In general, my favorite part of the production was working with the actors because it’s something that I really enjoy. One of the most stressful moments was at the same time was one of the most fun memories. In New York you can shoot in the street for free with a permit. You can talk to your friends and shoot in their apartments, which I did. But the hardest location to get, was like an elevator. So we had to steal those shots. It was very, very late at night because we’d just done the party scene. It was the end of the night and they had a beautiful elevator, so we’d just do it fast. It was a very tall building, so the elevator ride was going to be long and I thought it would work out. Of course, there was a camera in the elevator. Of course the doorman saw us. Of course the doorman locked the door and called us down. So we couldn’t stop the elevator. We were just going down and once we hit the ground that was going to be it. We were really tired. It was me, Miles, the DP, Alex and our grip guy, we were just laughing hysterically, but in the end we got the take. With one take we got it! So it was stressful, but also very playful and fun.
TP: “Emoticon” deals with modern communication and identity. Do you think that it is harder to define personal identity now that technology constantly bombards us with information and choices?
LD: This is an interesting thing because I feel like we all have a double identify with social media — ourselves, and our public persona, which used to only be for celebrities, but now we all have it. We have to deal with this public image. We decide what to put out and what not to put out. Somebody asked me if we’re putting out too much and taking in too much. I personally think that it’s good to have an extra opportunity to interact even though it’s not, and it’s never going to be as good as when people talk in person. For example, the phone. The phone is great because we can talk — I can hear your voice, you can hear mine. There was a time when we had no phone, so people would probably have written better letters at that time, because the need for communication is still there, we’ve always had it.
So, personally I think that has two sides. I like to focus on the positive sides of technology and social media because I have a lot of people in my life who wouldn’t be, if not for Facebook. As I say in the movie, it’s still human connection, but in a different way. I think that comes out in the movie as well. However, I also see how there can be a risk of not really interacting with people in person and kind of imploding, which happens to Jackie in the movie. Not being sure of how much can be communicated, and when is does come out it’s clumsy.
 TP: Especially in some scenes where we have characters videotaping and not actually looking with their own eyes, which you made a point to focus on.
LD: I’ll bring in an example. I have a friend of mine who was tweeting, he said ‘I have to stop, because my entire day I keep on thinking what clever things I can come up with to put on Twitter, it’s influencing my thought process’. If we go for dinner, and instead smelling the food and eating it, we take a picture of it and post it, to share it, we have a modified way of taking it in and experiencing it. The movie is a reflection about those themes. I’m not saying one thing or the other, I’m saying one thing and the other. It’s there for us to use, and to experience, and to see what it does to us. It is a reality and I do believe that it’s a good reality. However, sometimes I wonder how our brains are actually evolving or changing now due to emoticons, due to the way we communicate now (which is) different from the way we communicated only seven years ago.
 TP: Age plays a significant role in the film, with younger and older characters having parallel relationships. Can you relate to the teenage characters in the film How was your upbringing different from theirs?
LD: This movie is autobiographical in different ways. I never got pregnant. You know there are aspects of [it] that are completely made up. There is adult Livia who had a relationship with an older man who had two adopted kids. I wanted to kind-of play with that story. And then there is teenage Livia, and my co-writer as well. I grew up in Rome, she grew up in New York. We both have divorced parents. I grew up with my dad and had the experience of being this daughter of a father who does have a girlfriend. And the girlfriend is around the house and I am not happy to have her around the house. But now as an adult I can see that this person actually brought a lot of good things into my life at the time. I was young and those relationships are so complex that it is very hard to see that. Ironically as an adult I found myself on the other side, so I thought it was an interesting thing for me to explore. It’s not autobiographical in the plot points, but it is in the emotional content.
TP: There’s that proverbial saying “write what you know,” but is doesn’t have to be an actual thing that you’ve experienced. It can be a thematic or emotional experience.
LD: I think that every writer, to a certain degree, writes autobiographically. It’s how much you choose to go away from the truth. How much of the story will be actual story? It’s up to any writer to figure out.
TP: Any advice for aspiring filmmakers or actors?
LD: Acting is so tough. It’s so hard that I would encourage anyone to start writing their own material and to start producing their own stuff because it’s so invigorating. It feels really good to be able to not be at the mercy of other people constantly (laughs). For filmmakers, I’d say that if you really want to make a movie, or anything, I think that it has to become the most important thing in your life. It has to become something that you will not be able to do anything unless you get it done. The amount of passion has to be that great in for a project to be brought to completion.
TP: What is next for you? Any projects planned?
LD: I have two projects that I am working on. One [film] I am writing. Another is a book, but it is still in negotiation so I can’t really say anything. The movie that I am writing is about an adult, still an ensemble piece, it involves thirty-somethings. It’s really about emotional and sexual confusion and relationships.

We’ve seen filmmakers from Quentin Tarantino to Sergio Leone build upon ideas from others. Asia is a gold mine for stories, like the classic Ronin or samurai flick, to be reshaped and stylized into something original. Wes Anderson, for example, has a constant love affair with the French New Wave. It seems hard to shake influences when they are so impressionable. So why not turn to the milieu, lingo, and style of a whole decade of filmmakers? How about the 1980’s? Could be fun, right?
“Ping Pong Summer” tackles that pseudo-techno era with light-hearted humor, featuring a familiar coming-of-age story that basks in the nuances of the time. The film takes place in 1985 (the same year that “Back to the Future” was released) and tells the story of Rad Miracle (Marcello Conte), a 13-year-old who is terrible at dancing, loves hip-hop, and, above all, table tennis. His family is a construct of archetypes: the hollering mother (Lea Thomson – yes, from “Back to the Future”) who finds it hard to relate to her son with growing pains; the state trooper father with a foreign accent (John Hannah, with his natural Scottish brogue); and the Goth sister Michelle (Helena May Seabrook), who frowns on most of the world. Throw in Susan Sarandon as the wise mentor with a crazy town lady reputation, and many a secret to hide.
Miracle is the definitive goofball underdog who falls in over his head when he develops a Ping-Pong rivalry with the cartoonish bullies he meets on vacation. They are the kings of an arcade mecca in Ocean City, Maryland, which looks a lot like that family trip you may have taken as a teen. Determined to beat the ringleader, Lyle (Joseph McCoughtry), in a ping-pong match, Miracle finds wisdom in Sarandon’s character. The final match is like a playground fistfight – practically every kid in town shows up to watch the big game, even Stacey Summers (Emmi Shockley), the girl Miracle has developed a crush on during the trip.
Never too serious, the film freely adopts 80’s hijinks and stereotypes. “Ping Pong Summer” builds upon ideas from the competition in “Karate Kid”, “National Lampoon’s” family farce, and a hearty dash of John Hughes angst (yes, there are freeze-frames). The big boom box; Slurpees; Run DMC; dance-offs; that one attractive girl who everyone fawns over, with her pack of followers, and whose soft-drinks may or may not have a little bit of cocaine mixed in. Not sure how relatable the last example is, but in the world of the film, it makes too much sense. The acting seems appropriately dated – with manicured dialogue and a number of one-liners and clichés acting as gags. Viewers must let the film wash over them, or else they’ll get caught up in the blatant and unrealistic aesthetic choices.
The movie works in a way, but the old ideas need to be reinforced by a memorable plot. “Ping Pong Summer” falls on its own predictability and 80’s hodge-podge, hoping to be relatable and nostalgic, too much to cement itself into a fully coherent piece of art. There is a missing ingredient, however: that same bit that made Tarantino’s “Reservoir Dogs” and Leone’s spaghetti westerns original. It is the ability to morph what has been done into something that has not: pretty on the outside like a filmic collage, full of a whole lot of nutrients and flavor within. Entertaining as it is, “Ping Pong Summer” has a Top Chef exterior and a McDonald’s core.
“Ping Pong Summer” was written and directed by Michael Tully. The film opens theatrically on June 6 at AMC Empire and IFC Center in New York City, as well as video on demand.
Verdict: B-

Livia De Paulis abides by the DIY ethic. She not only stars in her debut feature, “Emoticon,” but she directed it, co-wrote it and produced it, too. This approach can have several results — the film can feel thin, since the creative core has many things to worry about. It can also appear whole, since that same force has an unequaled dominance on it. “Emoticon” falls somewhere somewhere neatly in the middle of that spectrum.
The film has a divided focus, on the verge of feeling like an ensemble piece. The asserted center of the story is Elena (De Paulis), a 30-something aspiring anthropologist, who is sorting out her PhD thesis about modern communication. Her boyfriend Walter (playwright Michael Christofer), thirty years her senior, has two adopted children, both in the most uncomfortable of teen years — Mandy ( Diane Guerrero) and Luke (Miles Chandler) — and with a slew of issues in their own right.
It is interesting to see such a varied family construct, and the adoption dynamic serves a way to further the personal identity issues of Walter’s children. Mandy is Hispanic, but is disconnected from her roots living in an upper-class, mostly white neighborhood. Luke navigates his coming-of-age with many questions about manhood. Those questions are somewhat answered by Elena, whose role in their house grows from seemingly ostracized (dad is dating another young girl?!) to confidant, since Walter is fairly absent from their lives. The father-children disengagement is further solidified by their referring to him by his first name, as if he’s just a very hospital hotel owner.
The relationship between Luke and Elena is refreshing — how often do we see a platonic friendship between a 30-year-old woman and a teenager? She helps him out of a tight spot when he gets his new girlfriend pregnant, a somewhat convenient parallel to her own surprising pregnancy. Some scenes here seem a little unbelievable — Luke doesn’t beat around the bush at all when he tells Elena about his emerging sex-life, and this feels forced. At the same time, Mandy falls in with a group of people who share a similar heritage, and begins to question her pampered upbringing. She goes so far as meeting with her always-traveling mother, one of the more tense and revealing scenes of the film. All three characters have interweaving story-arcs, which is a strength.
“Emoticon” is openly thematic, which is moderately campy. What happens to identity in the digital age? How is communication effected? Do we really experience the world anymore?Elena is something of an observer to the teenage world exploding around her. She’s the Nick Carroway to Jay Gatsby — fairly dull on her own, but her world is excited by the lives of others. The character deserves to be more of an active player in the story, but that notion is not achieved.
Technology is shown full-frontal: laptops, iPhones, iPads, text messages and everything else your grandmother can’t figure out how to use. It might just be me, but it’s a bit cringe-worthy to see a teenager post a nasty message on a Facebook wall in a film. There’s something about the digital age that seems hard to portray without pointing out the obvious flaws and lack of focus to the real world it causes in people, to the point that it seems overdone. Maybe it’s because we’re so used to this technology that it has become mundane, and therefore a bore on screen. The attempt, though, is bold, if only for its honesty.
“Emoticon” attempts to stake a claim on an intellectual level, prying at social and racial issues, such as integration and personal identify, by making using of a varied cast.It is this honest attempt to actually say something, despite feeling packed like a sardine-box, that gives the film and De Paulis’ hard work a pass in my book. The film has a limited theatrical release on May 30 at Cinema Village in New York City.

Let’s face it: the time travel film genre has been exhausted. From indie flicks like the super-low budget “Primer” to good ole “Back to the Future” to the neo-noir “Looper” it seems like viewers have seen every variation imaginable. What could impress them? Every once in a while somebody comes along to give a jolt to the metaphorically weakening heart of niche cinema.
That person is Hugh Sullivan, an Aussie director and writer whose debut film “The Infinite Man” (yes, it’s about time travel, among other things) impressed many at the SXSW Festival in March and comes to New York City’s Rooftop Films on May 23rd. The impression is easy to understand, despite the innate complexities of time travel films.
Dean (Josh McConville) and Lana (Hannah Marshall) try to experience their perfect anniversary getaway for a second time, but end up experiencing it again and again and again. The former is a bookish but somewhat naive scientist, who invents a way incapsulate experiences into data to be re-used later on like some sort of memory whiskey. The two lovers seem to be having communication problems as they arrive at their seemingly abandoned beach-side vacation resort; Dean is caught up in trying to calculate and plan every moment of their anniversary, just so it’s as supposedly “good” as he remembered last time. Hell, he even has Lana wear the same clothes. This is where it gets sticky.
Lana’s obsessive ex-boyfriend Terry (Alex Dimitriades) shows up, brandishing his muscles, a javelin (he’s got an impressive arm) and the idea that he can win her back. Somehow he does, pulling out a taser and shocking a babbling Dean into submission. The hapless and broken man confronts them again, only to receive further rejection. Retreating into himself and his uncontrolled intellect, Dean converts his memory collector into a time machine and calls Lana a year later. She’s willing to give their relationship another go. He convinces her, somewhat easily, to use his new device to correct their past and have a start fresh. This is where it gets sticky, again.
Of course, there must be something that goes wrong with the time traveling discovery. For “The Infinite Man” that problem is that through his impulsive nature and accidental carelessness, Dean has trapped Lana in what seems like an infinite loop, doomed to repeat that anniversary day forever. It’s fun to watch him try to sort out the mess, which escalates into a complex-but-easy-to-follow web of time travel logic: he must compete with various versions of himself from different points of time, for the love of one woman.
Sullivan’s film evolves from a straight comedy into something with much more heart, as Dean begins to better understand his notion of love, and what it means to be loved. The story never falls on it’s tangled shoe-laces of a chronology, easing up room for fun on our part. It contains the fashionable satisfaction of a humorous short film, with a small cast that carries that engagement with ease despite being feature length. The stylish camera-work, making use of goofy pans and fast insert shots, never feels overindulgent.
While the idiosyncratic tone of “The Infinite Man” is understandable, the characters underwhelmed by the reality of time travel — as if their emotions cast aside logic and achievement. The focus is placed on the characters and their conflict of love, rather than the sci-fi intricacies. One can can only wonder what other amazing devices Dean has created, if Lana is fairly unimpressed and surprised at the invention of time travel.
We can also wonder what Mr. Sullivan may come up with in the future. We’ll just have to see.

Ellie Klug (Toni Collette) is a music critic who can’t seem to critique and correct her own life. Even though she’s in her forties, she indulges in bad-boy musicians, and seems to live off the instant gratification of her sexual encounters, all of which pale in comparison to her first boyfriend and childhood sweetheart — a legendary singer-songwriter named Matthew Smith, who dropped off the face of the earth and presumed dead years ago.
The critic is called into action since she is quickly becoming irrelevant — her recent articles have very few online comments, says her boss (Oliver Platt). So, there we go. It make a little more sense for her to act like a teenage girl with daddy issues, because it seems she is seeking the attention that has slowly been sapped from her life. She’s given a do-or-be-fired assignment to track down the whereabouts of Smith: the story that will save her career. Commence the search.
A mustachio’d Thomas Haden Church plays the supporting role of eccentric old money ex-boyfriend Charlie, who is someone for Ellie to scoff at since he’s an outsider to her alt-rock, leather jacketed world. Church certainly has proved his indie chops, and is a strong point of “Lucky Them”. He decides to help Ellie chase down a lead about Smith somewhere in yonder country, as long as he can make a documentary about it, since he’s been taking classes in what appears to be a reflection of his own mid-life crisis. Charlie provides a few nuggets of romantic wisdom, but musings like those shouldn’t act as a thematic crutch for a film.
The film turns into a meandering road trip, with odd leaps in time, insta-relationships and a whole lot of Ellie losing focus of what really matters. Any “indie” appeal to the film is squandered by an obviously structured script — very apparent beats, character growth and convenient situations strip any sense of realism, especially when every character seems to be flirting and making fun of each nearly all of the time. Not since “Juno” have I heard such wise-cracking dialogue in a film, that seems like a TV sitcom without a laugh track. The tone may work in straight comedies, but “Lucky Them” confuses itself in the struggle to seek that crucial balance that makes good dramedies work.
“Lucky Them” is a film about past, present and future. Ellie is on a journey to track down a vital part of her past, to save her future, while Charlie films the trek in the present. The dichotomy is weaved by generational gaps — Ellie develops a somewhat irrelevant younger boyfriend named Lucas (Ryan Eggold), while Charlie starts a relationship with the young Charlotte (Ahna O’Reilly). Lucas seems to be in the film just to add conflict — he’s a good guy, and a reminder to Ellie that she could try to settle down. In once scene, she meets a man at a party who psychoanalyzes her, noticing that she calls relationships “gigs”. This temporary attitude swamps the character throughout the film, leading to her eventual and expected growth. Characters need flaws, don’t they?
When we finally reach the big reveal — is Smith really alive? — it is underwhelming, given Ellie’s ADD personality. We are distracted by her distractions, and so become disengaged to the whole point of her mission, other than keeping her job: to grow up and move beyond her past . And when she does, why should we care anymore?
“Lucky Them” was directed by Megan Griffiths, with a script by Huck Botko and Emily Wachtel. It has been touring film festival circuit since fall of last year, from Toronto, to Tribeca, to Nashville, and distributed by IFC. The film opens for a public release in New York City on May 30th.

Alexander Berman’s short film “APP” premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on April 18th. The film, about a geeky man who creates a sentient phone application that helps the user pick up woman, was presented in the Handle with Care program, which emphasized delicate people and situations. Satirical and comedic, “APP” is a modern film that deals with how the idea of romance has changed in our exponentially growing globalized techno society.
Alexander Berman
 
A graduate of the prestigious American Film Institute fellows and Harvard University, Berman recently finished a Fulbright Fellowship in the Russian Far East, where he shot his feature documentary “The Volcano People”. The filmmaker won the Grand Jury Prize at the Provincetown International Film Festival for his short film “Songs from the Tundra”, about tank-riding reindeer herders. The Pioneer had the chance to speak to Berman about love, technology and the future of filmmaking.
The Pioneer (TP): You recently finished a fellowship in Russia to make your feature documentary, “The Volcano People”. At what point did you decide on doing something very different, like “APP”?
Alexander Berman (AB): I think that moving to Los Angeles really had an effect on me. The other day at a Q and A somebody asked me ‘what inspired this film’? And I said, that I lived in Siberia for almost two years, and moving to LA I realized that it was easier to meet someone in Siberia than it was [there]. All the different ways that people were trying to find connections in such a big city I found really interesting, and then as a personal experience I wrote this film as a satire of that atmosphere. I knew I wanted to do fiction filmmaking, so that’s why the opportunity to go to AFI on a scholarship was incredible, but really being in LA inspired a new set of interests in me, and that’s where the film came out of.
TP: Did you have any particular influences for “APP”? You said it was a satire. Were there any references?
AB: Definitely. In terms of references, from the real world, was my brother who did the animations [in “App] Benjamin Berman. He works at Apps Now and we’re huge geeks. You know, using Tinder for the first time, which is a big app, but when I was writing the film it was small, and now is a multi-million dollar thing. That was definitely an inspiration.
And then, in terms of films: “Her” [by Spike Jonze] didn’t exist back then. There’s definitely a dialogue between our film and “Her”. [That film] imagines ‘what is the relationship going to be between love and our technology fifty years from now?’ and I was more interested in what it is going to be like tomorrow, or in year. [Other influences include] Charlie Kaufman’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”. Anything where technology allows us to explore our relationship in this new age are some of my favorite films, and definitely an artistic inspiration.
TP: If you could make a prediction of where the film industry might go in the future, especially now that we have new technologies and digital filmmaking that is more accessible, where do you think we may go in ten or fifteen years?
AB: Our film, which we had to do for a skinny budget, had one guy doing all of the visual effects, of which there were 230 shots that needed visual effect treatment done. If one person can do now what a post [production] house could do five years ago, then you’re going to see that, just how digital filmmaking has put cameras in everyones hands, we’re going to see some really cool fantasy as the costs of visual effects go down. People will make, I wouldn’t say more creative stories, but [ones] that certainly go beyond our reality.
And then in terms of the business, like someone starting out. I just finished AFI, and I have a film at Tribeca and looking at the opportunities for me to build a career out of it, you know the web is a very interesting place, because after headline TV shows like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” coming out on Netflix, Amazon Studios and even for X-box now, the quality of online original content has gone up. There are many entrances in the field and a few projects I am developing are actually for a web outlet.
TP: Could you tell us about those projects? What are your plans now that you’ve had “APP” on the festival circuit?
AB: I have a feature that I am writing about a guy who can’t get it up in Los Angeles. He’s just gone through a bad relationship. He and his friends realize that it’s also happening to them, and also happening all over LA, so it’s like a zombie apocalypse of impotence is traveling through the city, and they’re trying to find out how to solve it. So it’s, you know, another dark romantic comedy. In terms of TV projects, for the Web, I’ve been developing a few series, definitely in the tech sphere.
TP: “APP” is a modern film, exploring technology and what it means to quote unquote be compatible with someone. Can you tell us about the idea of the film, and what it means to you personally?
AB: In terms of my personal connection to it, I was getting out of college, and out of very intense relationship. As many of these films are, they’re inspired by breakups. I remember this was right on the cusp of our whole datafication of our lives, you know like everything today is on Facebook, it’s like an entire library of your life online that’s out there. I was in this relationship, it ended in and amicable way, but I remember being so tempted to look at her email. Like a lot of people, we shared passwords and whatever. And I was just shocked. If I wanted to, I could go back to look at her conversations with her sister six months ago if I wanted to. I [stopped myself] and felt really guilty and told her, and she laughed and said she did the same thing to me.
So, I realized then that the datafication of our lives, it’s so much about spies going through out stuff, or corporations doing it, but we have this intense fear of rejection as people, and technology can enable us to take uncertainty out of our lives. But that’s fundamentally changed a lot because love is about the mystery of ‘I don’t know what my life will be like with this person, but I love them so much that I want that mystery’.
TP: Do you feel that technology can disconnect people?
AB: Yes. I think the way it disconnects is that it’s impossible to have a private conversation anymore. What I mean by that, for example, is let’s say you and I are friends, and we’re talking, and you turn off your self phone, right, because you’re really a stickler about not having any distractions during private conversation. But your alternative self, the one that is online, on your Facebook account, is still carrying on a conversation with so many other people, but I don’t know about you but when I turn off my phone I feel a certain anxiety that people are talking to me, and I haven’t responded back to them, I haven’t checked my email, I haven’t looked at whose liked my stuff on Facebook. I think We are being rewired such that it’s not just technology disconnecting us because we’re checking our emails during a conversation, just that we can’t disconnect from it now, it’s too much of who we are.
TP: The Pioneer is a student newspaper, for a college campus that includes film majors. Do you have any tips for young filmmakers who are trying to get their own work made?
AB: Having just finished being a Fellow at AFI, the advice [I heard] the most is that talent isn’t enough, and that it’s all about hard work. I think that’s true, but one think that we lose in the mix, particularly when you go to New York, or Los Angeles, or a big place where ‘everyone is writing that screenplay’ it’s easy to feel like it’s such a crapshoot. I think really the people who make, are people who are at least my role models, like Darren Aronofsky, and Spike Jonze, who I really admire, it’s really about being a person who can stand rejection the most. Before I had a film at tribeca, we had a lot of festival rejections. It’s crazy odds. It’s thirty films out of three thousand three hundred. I think the thing that I would advise anyone starting as a filmmaker is that if you have the passion, you can do it, but it’s just about hearing no, and having that inner strength to keep going. In my own life I’ve heard no a lot

At the beginning of the new school year last fall, LIU Post initiated a new program known as LIU Promise, which is a team of advisors who guide incoming freshmen through their four years at Post. LIU Promise assigns each student a success coach. Their mission is to help the student, starting from their first day at Post and continuing to their last day. Incoming freshmen students will be able to direct their questions and concerns to their success coaches. Although there are other advisors at Post, the LIU Promise team was formed to ease the transition from high school senior to college freshman.
The success coaches were all advisors who were previously stationed in Kumble Hall. There are still several services provided at Kumble Hall, such as academic planning, Bursar, and the Registrar’s office. However, the coaches have been moved into the Winnick House (the mansion on the hill).
“The LIU Promise Success Coaches are taking this program to the next level. Not only are they connecting with students in our inviting office space, but they are connecting with their students all over campus, as well,” said Ali DiBona, associate director of LIU Promise. The LIU Promise program is different from the usual advising setup at Post because it keeps a consistent link between the same group of students and their respective coaches. DiBona mentioned that the coaches support their students by taking part in their on-campus activities as well, whether it’s attending performances or sports games.
“Coaches are very eager to get away from the typical student- faculty level, that way it is more comfortable to talk about things like work and our futures, things besides scheduling,” said Deirdre Kelly, a freshman Arts Management major.
In addition to DiBona, the LIU Promise team consists of Daniel Carlos, Daniel Lauterman, Saadia Rafiq, Alissa Karcz, and Kaitlin Jensen. All of the coaches have received training through workshops in order to tackle the different majors they are faced with. They are being cross- trained in all majors, as well as in financial aid.
“I feel that the success coaches are a great thing for incoming freshman as it is a promise for the four years while they are at Post. However, in the process, upperclassmen were juggled between advisors due to restructuring; I was a bit uneasy about it at first,” said Danielle Siebner, a senior Elementary Education major with a Spanish concentration.
Success coaches can help students find jobs, internships, work- study, and even plan to study abroad. “As I continue to mold into this position I am constantly discovering new unique opportunities to enhance my students’ experience on campus,” said Daniel Carlos, a former advisor who is now a success coach. Carlos said that the success coaches could also create new events on campus, such as “Tunes @ Noon,” which is held during common hour in Hillwood.. Coaches can also work with various departments by reaching out to them in order to learn more about their students.
Success Coaches continue to receive training to equip themselves with the tools necessary to handle situations with their students. LIU Promise is continuously adding new initiatives and is the new beginning for advising on our campus.

As the spring semester comes to an end, LIU Post students prepare to take finals and look forward
to the promise of summer vacation now lingering off
in the distance, getting a little bit closer each day. For graduating seniors, the end of the semester is a time of celebration, as students come together in their last few days as undergraduates, finishing final assignments and spending all the time they have left with their friends before commencement.
Seniors are given the opportunity to celebrate all their hard work and dedication they have put into the last four years, with the coming of Senior Week from April 29 to May 3. Senior week is seven days of fun-filled activities concluding what is left of the spring semester, and providing graduating seniors with the opportunity to spend time with friends off campus.
This year’s Senior Week includes the Commencement Ball held on Tuesday, April 29, a Yankees game at Yankee Stadium, held on Wednesday, April 30, an NYC dinner cruise held on Friday, May 2, and a trip to Six Flags on Saturday, May 3.
“I actually did not know anything about Senior Week until another student told me about the activities,” said Andria Lynn Osler, a senior Public Relations major. “It really sucks because I would have loved to participate in the events, but the detailing about where to pick up tickets and how much each event costs was very vague.”
Tickets were available for purchase at the concierge desk in Hillwood Commons until Friday, April 18. The cost of each event varied, and students were able to pick and choose which events they wanted
to go to, or if students wanted to attend all events, they were able to purchase all tickets for a special package discount of $150.
The ticket prices for commencement ball cost $65, the Yankee game taking place on cost $35, the NYC dinner cruise cost $65 and the Six Flags trip cost $25. Transportation from campus for each event is provided to seniors participating in the activities of Senior Week.
“I really like the idea of Senior Week. It makes me excited to know I am graduating,” said Sang Geun Yoon, a senior Journalism major. “I am happy that this is the way I will be able to spend time with my friends before the semester is over. Lots of fun, no stress.”
For students who may have missed the deadline to purchase tickets for Senior Week, do not fret, as this is a time to celebrate yourself and your accomplishments throughout your years at Post. Enjoy the time left with friends, no matter what activities you participate in, the week before graduation. This year’s commencement ceremony will be held on May 9, 2014 under the big tent on the Great Lawn at 11:30 a.m. Congratulations, class of 2014!

“Fading Gigolo,” released on April 18th, is John Turturro’s (“Barton Fink”) fifth effort as a writer/director. In a Woody Allen-ish way, Turturro tells the story of Fioravante (played by Turturro) who decides to become a professional Don Juan as a way of making money to help his friend Murray (Woody Allen, “To Rome with Love”) who is in desperate need of cash. With Murray acting as his pimp, the duo quickly finds themselves caught up the interweaving lines of money and love.

The film isn’t a great comedy, but it is filled with plenty of laughs, most of which are supplied by Allen, who plays a typical variation of himself — the neurotic Jewish man. Turturro has a stroke of writing brilliance when deciding to turn that character into a pimp, and there is a strong creative partnership apparent between the two filmmakers. Their on screen chemistry works well, to compliment Vanessa Padis’ incredibly powerful performance as a lonely, strict Jewish woman whose husband died two years prior.
The off-beat humor of “Fading Gigolo” certainly targets a specific audience. A majority of the comedy derives from Jewish culture. While this sort of writing may be partially lost on a non-Jewish audience member, there is enough plot to guide the audience along nonetheless. There is a noted lack of sexism in the film, but at first it seems to be the contrary. The story is on the surface about love, sex ad prostitution — with an instant anti-feminist feeling, as if women are pieces of meat. However, Turturro writes strong female characters that develop with the love story, and combat this sexist mentality.
Another great aspect of the film is that, while it may seem like a Woody Allen copy-film, it’s not a blatant rip-off. “Fading Gigolo” joins the ranks of films like Josh Radnor’s “Liberal Arts” in successfully taking the Allen style and making it their own.
“Fading Gigolo” is a sexy, witty, entertaining and very Jewish film. Turturro did a splendid job with a light-hearted comedy. It’s definitely not a spectacular comedy, but with plenty of good laughs, it’s a good selection for the early-mid film year.

Dear Dorianna,
I began as an employee at LIU Post last September and work in University Advancement (i.e. fundraising) for the College of Management. I just read your last letter in The Pioneer and wanted to thank you for your service, creativity, professionalism, and plain old good journalism.
For me, presenting great young students and young alumni to our prospect pool of established alumni is critical. Prospects and donors see charitable giving as an investment –whether they give for scholarship, bricks and mortar, faculty development, athletics, or whatever. If the investment proves to have a solid ROI, the donor is happy and likely to invest again. Thank you for being an example of a great student and soon-to-be great alumni.
All my best to you, in your words, “in the real world.”
Sincerely,
Sean Collins

On the weekends, despite the number of students living on- campus, LIU Post seems totally different from what we see every Monday through Thursday. The Hillwood Commons Café, The Bookmarks, Humanities Café, and Subway are all closed on the weekends.
Winnick Dining Hall, where dormer students usually have meals, opens at 10 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Starbucks opens at 9 a.m for breakfast, and closes earlier than usual, at 3 p.m. Though the off-campus shuttle bus runs on weekends, it does not run often and the time schedule differs from the weekdays.
Max Nacho Bovin, a freshman Film major who lives on-campus, usually spends his weekends having fun with his friends off-campus. “I usually hang out with friends at their houses because there is nothing to do on campus most weekends,” Bovin said. “I get excited for the weekend because the work and stresses of college can be overwhelming.”
“I usually go to the city on weekends because there are many more art galleries [there] than on Long Island, and something is always on going,” said Meng Xing Hu, a Fine Arts graduate student who has lived on campus for two years.
Hu said, “Since I am an international Art major, I have never thought of living off campus because carrying all my art supplements every [day] is just too much.” When Hu has too many assignments, she stays in her room and watches TV and movies online in her free time.
“Currently, I am enjoying tastes from around the world,” said Melis Selen, a freshman Psychology major. “I have tried Cuban, Mexican, Italian, and Thai recently. I found those restaurants on Long Island. Since I got my own car, I love driving [for] my leisure.” Melis added, “I will definitely rent an apartment and live off campus for the following semester, but I’ve met so many nice residents, especially my roommates, so I am pleased.”
Miho Osugi, a sophomore English Literature major, is another city-goer. “It’s time to shop for a lot of clothes for spring!” Osugi usually goes to SoHo for shopping. “I sometimes have to get my work done over [the] weekends. In that case, I would go to the Broadway Mall in Hicksville, watch a TV series, or hang out with friends in the common room in my dorm. I love those opportunities to meet new friends.”
It seems like dormers make the most of their time in their homes- away-from-home. Where to live and who to live with are big decisions for students. Think carefully and choose wisely.

Premiering on April 19th at the TriBeca Film Festival, “Zombeavers” has been unsurprisingly receiving a lot of attention. The buzz for the film, directed by Jordan Rubin (“Crank Yankers”) has reached the elite film festival audience, a feat rare for a horror film … with zombie beavers.
The Zombie genre has been completely over-saturated and overdone in the last 15 years. So why does this film deserve our attention? Films like “Cabin In The Woods” (2012) and “Juan of The Dead” (2011) are examples of how to make zombies funny and memorable, mixing in genre twists and satire. Apart from being entertaining, these films amongst others, comment on important and relevant social themes. Government control and religion are a few major topics touched upon in these films, which elevates them above the slough of garbage zombie entertainment that comes out regularly these days.
“Zombeavers” had potential to do this, and seeing as it made it into TriBeca one would assume it offers something more than gore, dumb teens, and a cabin in the woods. Unfortunately, this film does little more than display naked women and make bad jokes. The zombie beavers are accidentally created after a toxic barrel sprays on them and their dam near a riverside cabin. From here an unsuspecting trio of sorority girls predictably find themselves cornered with their frat bro counterparts in the cabin. There are a some funny moments and even some references to a few other horror/thriller films; the most direct being the famous “Get out of the water!” from Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws”. Other than the innocent beavers, who couldn’t help being mutated into monsters, it’s hard to really feel for any of the characters, which makes it hard to see the point of it all.
One of the key marketing points of “Zombeavers” was advertising its bad reviews. This would be funny if the reviews weren’t completely accurate. If you’re looking for something intelligently framed within the Horror genre, ‘Zombeavers’ has nothing to offer. Even entertainment wise this film seemed to be lacking. Maybe fifteen year olds will get a chuckle from the potty humor but it is hard to see what the people behind TriBeca saw in this vapid and unimportant film other than a large draw and some money.

Is getting a college degree worth the amount that it costs? With the current conditions of the economy, and jobs requiring denser skill sets, is the price of a college tuition affordable or is there an underlying problem with it?
In an article, “Debt by Degrees” by James Surowiecki, published on The New Yorker’s website, he states, “The piles of student loans are due largely to the fact that the cost of a college degree has been going up much faster than people’s incomes.”
LIU Post students sounded off concerning the topic of tuition prices, and gave ideas as to where the money should be spent in order to help better the school.
Freshman Broadcasting major Brittany Mitchell said, ”I think that the tuition is a bit too high because sometimes it is hard to see where the money is actually going.” In her opinion, an ideal tuition should be somewhere around ”$22,000,” an amount Mitchell referred to as ”plausible.”
”There are definitely some areas that need improvement,” Mitchell added. ”As a resident, I would say the dorms need a lot of renovations.”
Freshman Broadcasting major Samantha Negron agrees with Mitchell’s notion that the tuition of LIU Post is not an ideal number.
”The tuition is too high because myself, as well as others, struggle to pay tuition. For me, an ideal tuition for LIU Post would probably be between $20,000 to $25,000, because it would be more affordable,” she said.
Negron was asked if she believed she was getting her money’s worth out of college, specifically at LIU Post. ”In the long run, yes. Essentially, you are fulfilling your degree requirements that set you apart from other qualified degree recipients,” Negron said.
In terms of where she would like to see her money spent, Negron stated, ”Better facilities because the interior needs work.”
Senior Public Relations major Devan Farrell desires a change in the price of tuition as well. ”I think the tuition is way too expensive when we don’t even have smart boards in each class room. I think tuition for Post should be around $10,000 a semester,” Farrell said.
For possible suggestions to the university, Farrell stated, ”I think the actual classrooms could be better. Also 24-hour dining like they have at other universities.”
Tuition is rising, and for some universities like LIU Post, students would like to see changes in the future to help benefit their overall college experience. Changes may not happen overnight, but it is important to remember that making suggestions may help along the way.

Juan Aybardiaz graduated in 2013 as an undergraduate Film major. Since then, he has revisited the campus frequently, sharing his knowledge with current film students, and included them in his projects. Right now, he is in the making of a new short film, “The Answer,” which is based on his own experiences as a psychiatric technician during the Iraq War. On April 18, The Pioneer got the chance to meet with Aybardiaz to discuss the new film and his experiences of war-related mental health issues.

Juan Aybardiaz shoots original film on campus
“Usually, I end up thinking more about other people and their well-being than I am thinking about myself. By helping people, you always take the risk of being taken advantage of, but I prefer to take that risk than losing the opportunity of helping somebody,” Aybardiaz said, while setting up one of the four cameras he brought to film our inter view. Occasionally, he messed up the camera settings, only to ask me to remake them. If Aybardiaz can teach someone something and share his knowledge, he makes sure to do it.
Since graduating from LIU Post last year, he has spent a great amount of his time to help current students with their projects, and to get them involved with other projects and opportunities. “The Answer” is only the latest example of projects that has included an LIU Post crew. However, Aybardiaz assures that it is not a one-way-street of knowledge. “My friends and I here at Post are learning from each other all the time. School is definitely a good way to learn, but most of my knowledge comes from actually working with other people.”
Aybardiaz is originally from the Dominican Republic, but grew up in Puerto Rico. After studying to be a psychiatric technician in Portsmouth, Virginia, he realized that he wanted to do “something meaningful.” He therefore decided to join the U.S. navy, where he eventually stayed on active duty for six years, serving as a psychiatric technician, with two combat tours in Iraq.
During his time in the navy, he worked with hundreds of members of the armed forces that were affected by mental health issues
as a result of warfare. “It was very interesting, but at the same time it was difficult. I helped people who were struggling with everything from depression to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia,” Aybardiaz said. He explains that patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were especially distressful to observe. “I had to watch how all these great guys, who had done and sacrificed so much, lost their ability to function and be part of a normal society.”
Aybardiaz’s work in the navy was demanding in many ways, but he describes it as a great experience. “If I had the opportunity to live a parallel life, I would still be in the military. The people that I met and the experiences I had there were very beneficial to me,” he said.
When Aybardiaz left combat after several years, he realized that he was experiencing many of the symptoms that his patients had. He felt like it was time to leave his military career behind, and jump onto his life-long dream of working with film. This brought him to New York, and LIU Post, where he earned a bachelor degree in Film last year.
The idea of “The Answer” started to develop just before Aybardiaz left the navy. “I started to gain a deeper understanding of how the victims of PTSD felt. I had the opportunity to see, very close, how this condition actually destroys a person’s life, their relationships with other people, and their relationships with their families. I wanted to do something that shows their point of view.”
Most parts of “The Answer” have been filmed – some on the LIU Post campus – and the film is now in the editing process. “I am very happy with the opportunity to work with great people. I actually shot the movie with all my friends from LIU Post, and I also had the opportunity to work with the most talented actors: George Katt and Lance Marshall. I will be eternally grateful to both of [them] because the work they did was just incredible,” Aybardiaz said.
Since graduating from LIU Post, he has already achieved great experience in the film production field. His latest work includes being the script supervisor and a production assistant for the Investigation Discovery TV series “Redrum.” He has also been the production assistant for the 2013 short films “Tammy” and “The Other Half,” and in 2012 he wrote, directed, and produced his very first short film, “Joe,” which acted as his senior thesis.
Aybardiaz is expecting to release “The Answer” to the public by the end of May or the beginning of June. He is hoping for it to be picked up by different film festivals, and thereafter be released on the Internet.
In the future, Aybardiaz wants to make movies that make people think, and he is hoping to be able to affect society and make positive changes through his movies. In addition, he wants to contribute to improve education, particularly in Third World countries.

Film festivals are a veritable proving ground for young bloods and up-and-comers to show their creative skill, especially when it comes to crafting short films. These shorts show industry buffs who has the chops to be economic, creative and original. They’re like visual business cards. The Tribeca Film Festival, held this year from April 16 through 27, screened dozens of shorts in slyly named categories with common themes.
For example, the Totally Twisted category delved into the realm of dark comedy, while Handle with Care provided stories of an uneasy, anxiety filled quality, with characters who seemed to be in odd states of suspension and impending emotional or physical danger. These categories provided a fun way of framing films that were somewhere on the spectrum of being intellectual, flat out idiotic, and everything in between.
The Totally Twisted program screened films that were odd, funny and a little off the deep end, sometimes in an unflattering way. “The 30 Year Old Bris” directed and written by Michael D. Ratner has a fun concept: a devout Jewish woman asks her non-Jew fiancé to get a ceremonial circumcision before they tie the knot. A lot of potential here for irony and some controlled Jewish humor, perhaps ala Woody Allen or Coen Brothers witty schtick. But the film mires itself in dick jokes and cringe worthy antics, which were semi-expected given the plot, but seemed very contrived.
“The Body” directed by former HorrorHound journalist Paul Davis played out in a similar fashion, deriving most of it’s appeal by it’s shocking the audience. The short, which stars Alfie Allen of Game of Thrones fame, tells the story of a professional killer who carries his kill through crowded streets and parties with no worry — it’s Halloween, and everybody thinks he’s just a master costumer dressed like the main character from the film “American Psycho”.
Allen does well as a cold and psychotic assassin, sort of the antithesis of James Bond, but keeping the controlled-sexy appeal. Davis’ work ends up in a gory stand-off, with the anti-hero walking off with a one-dimensional blond bombshell who’d been eying him the whole night. The faint message seems to be sociological: could a killer get away with murder much easier on Halloween, just because our norms are so unusual for that one day? Hmm. But still, “The Body” seems to be grasping for substance — it’s definitely entertaining, but at festivals like Tribeca, the highest quality is found in those films that strike a neat balance. Stories that totally absorb our attention and also have us pondering big STUFF after the fact. They are truly cinematic and rare.
Director Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer’s “Contrapelo” is one of those rare films, and a key highlight from the shorts at the festival. The filmmaker, who cowrote the film with Liska Ostojic, manages to blend style with substance and a powerful story — a Mexican barber is forced to shave a dangerous cartel boss, a man who he has the power to kill with a flick of his blade and who he despises morally, but who ultimately becomes relatable and human. Beautifully shot by Carolina Costa, “Contrapelo” feels very worldly, despite only having two locations. Those locations are barber shop, and a drug cartel hideout, both of which feel very inhabited. Shot on a digital camera, but with older anamorphic lenses that give an antiquity to the atmosphere, the world of the film feels real and powerful. Kudos to everyone involved, between the set design, acting, directing, filming and the sound design — every bit of stubble being shaved is heard, adding to the hand made feel of the production.

Other shorts at the festival focused on an awareness of technology, such as director and writer Alexander Berman’s “APP”. That film, about a geeky man who creates a phone application to help pick up women, was one of several centered on modern society. The Digital Dilemma program, including films such as “A Film is a Film is a Film” delved into the future of physical film. Now that digital cameras, filmmaking and theater projecting is more cost effective, people such as Eva von Schweinitz, the director of that documentary and a projectionist, are experiencing drastic changes in their professional lives. Digital Dilemma featured several experimental films that played around with the core of the physical medium, a highlight being “Acetate Diary” by Russell Sheaffer, which depicts hundreds of images of a meticulously painted film reel — like a series of abstract paintings.
As for festival winners, “The Phone Call” directed by Mat Kirkby was a clear standout as Best Narrative Short. Starring Golden Globe winner Sally Hawkins (“Blue Jasmine”) the film is about a rather shy woman who works for a helpline call center — a place where suicidal folks vent their concerns in desperate times. Part of the the Handle with Care Program, it’s definitely a delicate film, as Hawkin’s character speaks with a man (Jim Broadbent) who has taken just the right amount of pills to kill you, won’t reveal his location and just wants someone to speak to in his final moments. There is a raw intensity here, mostly in one location for more than 21 minutes, that is sad and seductive all at once.
Attending the Tribeca Film Festival is rewarding for several reasons. Firstly, one feels like they are on the front lines of filmmaking. Fresh ideas, especially compacted into short films shed new light to an industry that is over saturated with multimillion dollar productions. Secondly, Chelsea Bow Tie Cinemas has some pretty damn comfortable seats.

On Wednesday, April 16, during common hour, the Student Art League featured a free Turkish Water Marble demonstration by Merve Karaca in front of the Student Art Gallery in Hillwood Commons.
Karaca is an ESL student at Suffolk Community College. She received a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry in Turkey, and desires to pursue a master’s degree in Chemistry after she improves her English. She started water marbling in Turkey, but began practicing the art more intensely when she moved to America about two years ago.
“Marbling is the art of creating colorful patterns by sprinkling and brushing color pigments on a pan of oily water and then transforming this pattern to paper,” said a poster displayed behind Karaca at the event. Karaca explained how all the tools, including the paints used, are organic and made of “all-natural” materials.
“The paint is taken from the soil… the earth,” Karaca said, and added that the brushes are made from “natural horsehair and rosewood” and the water is “prepared from purified water.” The painting process is natural to the environment, and the environment also affects how the paintings form on the surface of the water. Karaca explained that if people feel “negative” towards the painting, the painting would not be beautiful. “If the environment is good, the art will be nice. The art is sensitive to people and the environment,” she said.
Karaca demonstrated water marbling in front of a small audience of students and other observers. She transferred the final painting onto paper by simply laying the paper over the still water and removing it, dazzling her viewers, before continuing on to another painting.
Burcu Altintas, a Psychology major and member of the Turkish-American Student Association, attended the event. “This is my culture,” Altintas said. “It’s such an overlooked form of art. Many people don’t know about this stuff,” Altintas added. The event also aimed to help attract students to join the organization, since there aren’t many Turkish students on campus.
After the event, Karaca handed out small goody bags to the viewers, which contained Turkish Delight candies, an informative flyer about Turkey, as well as a bookmark.

On Saturday, April 26 at 8 p.m., Aleksey Igudesman and Richard Hyung-ki Joo, a musicians duo, aims to make classical music accessible to a wider and younger audience. The duo will bring their comedy, “A Little Nightmare Music,” to the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. The show will feature classical music and pop culture.
The Pioneer had the chance to speak with Igudesman and Joo to find out exactly what the LIU Post community will be in for when the YouTube favorites, with over 30 million views, take the stage. Their show, with Igudesman on violin and Joo on piano, has been described as a “Bach meets the Simpsons/Mozart hijacked by Monty Python” experience.
Discounted student tickets are available for $15 at the Tilles Center box office.
The Pioneer (TP): What kind of show can the LIU Post community expect? 
Igudesman & Joo (I&J): If we had to describe it in one sentence, we would say “Monty Python meets Mozart, or South Park meets Bach.”
It’s something between a concert and a show, with a mix of comedy, theatre, and many types of music. You can be six years old or as young as 90 years old, a lover of classical music or someone who has never even heard of Mozart.
TP: On March 11, you uploaded a video entitled “Whoop Dee Doo with Igudesman & Joo,” announcing the performance at Tilles. Since then, it has garnished over 8,620 views. How did the concept come about? 
I&J: We owe much of our success and popularity to the Internet and
in particular, YouTube. Before YouTube, we were not on the general public’s radar, but since our first clips went viral, we’ve been able to enjoy touring all over the world. The Tilles Center is a big date for us, and since having played the New Year’s Eve concert with the New York Philharmonic, we were dying to return to perform for one of our favorite audiences: the New York audience.
TP: Long Island’s own Billy Joel is one of your fans, has performed with you, and requested you record his CD of classical compositions titled “Fantasies & Delusions.” Tell The Pioneer about the dynamic you three have together. 
I&J: Working with Billy Joel was an absolute joy. He is a great ambassador for classical music and he is one of the funniest guys we know. Hyung-ki Joo worked with Joel and recorded his classical album of piano pieces, and Aleksey Igudesman performed the violin solo on Joel’s song “Downeaster Alexa,” when Joel was on tour in Europe, and since, we have all got to know each other very well.
TP: Besides performing at Tilles, how has your Long Island experience been? 
I&J: We have spent quite a lot of time on Long Island, as we have a
few friends out here. Joo studied at the Manhattan School of Music for many years so Long Island was a Jitney trip away. Long Island is very picturesque being next to the ocean and waters. We’ve also eaten some of the best clams and oysters here.
TP: What advice do you have for college students, specifically Music, Film, and Broadcast majors who want to get ahead or break into the business? 
I&J: We believe in creativity, and the most important thing we’d like to leave behind is inspiring people to be creative, whether it’s in their music, their work, or their life. We believe that creativity moves the world forward and enhances the environment around us. It’s one of the reasons we came up with our educational program, “8to88.” The program is for children of all ages, and it explores often-ignored and less-practiced aspects of music making, such as theatricality, stage presence and presentation, movement and choreography, and different types of rhythm. We will present our “8to88” at the Tilles Center a few hours earlier on the same day of our show.
TP: You are building a younger audience for classical music while millions of college students and children know nothing about the genre. What inspired this direction?
I&J: When we were studying at the Yehudi Menuhin School in England, we both felt that the world of classical music was taking itself way too seriously. Going to a concert often resembled a funeral rather than being a celebration of life, and while a lot of music is serious and tragic, the whole ceremony surrounding classical music need not be so serious and elitist. This is one of the main reasons why so many people, and especially so many young people, are afraid of going to classical concerts and we dreamt of changing this.
TP: As a send off, tell us about one of your YOLO moments.
I&J: For us, it would be a YOLT (You Only Live Twice) moment, when former James Bond, Sir Roger Moore, joined us to set the world record for the most Dancing Violinists on stage at one time. The record was in aid of UNICEF, and we had 100 violinists volunteer from all over the world to help make this come true.

The Art and Art History club held an interactive event called Haxus on Wednesday, April 16 during common hour. Situating themselves on the Great Lawn in front of Hillwood Commons, participants were able to join together in creating an art piece as a group, while enjoying free pizza. 
The idea for Haxus was first proposed by President and sophomore Art History major, Sam Bonilla. “She thought it would be cool if we did an event that incorporated making art through student participation,” said Vice President Stacie Zucker, a sophomore Digital Arts and Design major. Assorted paints were available, and instruction cards were distributed to attendees with ways to contribute to the piece, such as to paint a squiggle, or to do their own free interpretation. During the event, the wind threw several slices of pizza to the ground, which was promptly added to this artwork, in addition to parts of the pizza box, and even the instruction cards themselves. In the end, the piece had to be thrown out, but in the spirit of this spontaneous form of art, that was okay with the club. 
Some members of the club, including Zucker, studied with their adviser Aileen Wang in her Contemporary Art Class, learning about performance arts like Fluxus Concerts and Happenings. The class decided to learn by doing, and the event was co-coordinated by Professor Wang and the club. “We decided to combine Happenings and Fluxus and made a hybrid, Haxus,” Zucker explained. 
“[Haxus] is a performance art event that combines two types of performance art that were very popular in the 1960s,” said Wang. The events known as Happenings were formulated by Allan Kaprow in 1957, and involved participants doing certain actions according to index cards similar to those used at the Post event. The first gallery showing of one of these performances was at the Reuban Gallery in New York in 1959. Fluxus concerts were popularized by people such as Yoko Ono and George Brecht in the mid 1960s. These were not traditional concerts or performances; Brecht’s solo for Violin performance involved him wiping down his violin with cleaning liquid, while Ono’s invited participants cut off pieces of her clothing.
The Art and Art History club, which is open to all students, meets on Wednesdays in Humanities 108 during common hour. They reside
as a community to foster creativity and art appreciation. “Even if you’re not a talented artist, it doesn’t matter. You don’t have to be the best, just as long as you have an interest in art,” said Zucker. “This was proven
by our Haxus [event] because we had tons of non-artists at this school participating and having a blast.” 
“We haven’t had any events like Haxus before, but I’m hoping that interactive events like this catch on for the future of the club,” said Jill Coklan, a senior Art History major. Coklan first became involved with the club as a cofounder, and is now a secretary. “The [Art and Art History] club provides a network for like-minded people and those interested in art to discuss, share, and learn about topics involving art history and the current art world,” she added. 
The club will be holding an end of the year social event on Thursday, April 24, in Humanities Room 108 during common hour. All are welcome. Refreshments will be served and students are encouraged to bring a piece of artwork for viewing.

The Pioneers baseball team defeated the Dowling Golden Lions 3-2 in the second game of a double header on Saturday, April 19. The win snapped a two game losing streak that saw the Pioneers drop the first game to Dowling 9-1 and an 11-2 loss to the Golden Lions on Thursday.
Junior pitcher Mike Eckerle threw six innings for the win on Saturday and allowed eight hits, two runs, and struck out four batters.
It was also Eckerle’s sixth win of the season. Freshman pitcher Dan Jagiello came into the game in the seventh inning for relief, and recorded his first save of the year.
The Pioneers quickly jumped onto the scoreboard in the bottom of the first. With a runner on first and third designated hitter, junior Anthony Brunetti, grounded into a double play that allowed senior third baseman Tom Tolan to score.
The Golden Lions tied the game in the top of the third off an RBI single and took a 2-1 lead in the top of the fifth.
LIU post rallied in the bottom of the inning with two runners on second and third. Freshman centerfielder Kenny Daley slammed one out to left field, and allowed freshman first baseman Thomas Asbaty to score from third base.
A fielding error by the Golden Lions second baseman allowed junior shortstop Rick Alessi to reach base, and allowed junior second baseman Angel Vidal to score the go ahead run.
In the first game on Saturday the Pioneers gave up four runs in the first five innings, and their only run came in the bottom of the fourth. Dowling scored two more runs in the sixth, and then added another three in the ninth.
Sophomore pitcher Chris Anderson recorded his third loss of the year, giving up 12 hits, six runs, and walking three batters. He did strikeout four in his 6.1 innings pitched.
On Thursday, April 17, an 11-2 loss, the Pioneers gave up eight runs in the first five innings before they could score a run in the bottom of the sixth. The Golden Lions scored three more runs before the game ended, and LIU Post added one final run in the ninth.
The Pioneers have five games coming up on their schedule, which includes three games against ECC rival the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

On Saturday, April 19, the LIU Post Men’s Lacrosse team took the field against the Bears of NYIT in the Battle of Boulevard from President’s Field on the campus of NYIT. Three overtimes were needed to decide a winner as sophomore attackman Shawn Murphy netted the game-winning goal to improve his club to 10-3 for the season, while the Pioneers dropped to 6-5.
The Bears had the advantage early on in the matchup, outscoring the Pioneers 5-2 in the first half. Murphy scored the first of his four goals of the day, and added an assist in the first half as well. NYIT Junior attack man Luke Miller scored two goals of his own to give him an even 30 for the season.
Down by three coming out of the break, the Pioneers looked to respond and did so, with two unanswered goals cutting the lead to one at 5-4. The Bears, however, regained their composure and answered the two goals scored by the Green and Gold with two goals of their own, pushing the lead back to three. A late goal in the third period by the Pioneers brought the score to 7-5.
The Bears led 8-6 with just over eight minutes left in the fourth period, and the combination of LIU Post graduate student midfielder Joe Costello and attackman Chris Caiazza came up big. The duo each scored with under 2:30 left in the game, and scored 43 seconds apart from each other. The two goals tied the game up and sent the match into overtime.
Not one, not two, but three overtime periods were needed
to decide a winner. The Pioneers outshot the Bears in the first two overtimes, but failed to convert. With 2:26 remaining in the third overtime, Murphy capped off his impressive day with the game-winning goal, lifting the Bears to the victory at a clip of 9-8.
For the Pioneers, sophomore attackman Matty Beccaris led the team by scooping up five ground balls while senior defenseman T.J. McAndrew scooped up four ground balls and added an assist to his stat line. Coach Jez and his squad return to action on Saturday, April 26, when they wrap up their regular season as they take on the Dowling College Golden Lions from Brookville N.Y.

The top-ranked Pioneers found themselves trailing 7-5 early on in the second half, but used a 6-1 run to sneak away with an 11-9 win in a back-and-forth battle against Stonehill (rank no.15) on Saturday, April 12th, at Hickox Field in Brookeville, N.Y.

Stonehill’s Kelsey Shannahan tied up the game at the 18:07 mark of the second half, but the Pioneers would go on another three-goal surge, capped off with the deciding marker courtesy of senior midfielder, Katie Rotan, which secured the Green sand Gold’s victory. Junior midfielder Jenna Pierro and freshman midfielder/defender Cara Douglas gave the Pioneers some insurance with a goal apiece.
Senior attacker Jackie Sileo finished the game with seven points (1 G, 6 A). Senior attacker Samantha Losco added two goals and one assist, and Rotan had a dominant showing on top of her game-winning goal by scoring three markers and causing two turnovers.
Freshman attacker Stefani Vagelatos continued to impress as she scored two goals along with Douglas, who scooped up three ground balls and caused two turnovers along with her one goal. Sophomore defender Honey Roche collected two ground balls and caused a pair of turnovers. Pierro also won four draw controls, two ground balls, and caused one turnover.
In the pen, senior goalie Katie Hannan accumulated six saves for the Green and Gold, who held a 20-19 edge in shots and won the ground ball battle (15-11). The Skyhawks’ goalkeeper, Ashley Armstrong, made five saves in the cage.
After the game, Rotan said that the team was focused the whole game and had the momentum needed to win. Rotan mentioned that she is looking forward to the East Coast Conference Tournament because it’s a very strong conference. She also believes that the NCAA Tournament will be a true testing of how strong the team really is.
As a senior, Rotan said that being with six other seniors brings back memories, and that this senior class was very close. Rotan quoted, “It’s not what you wish for, it’s what you worked for.”
Saturday’s home finale against the University of the District of Columbia Saturday, April 19th, was cancelled; no make-up date has been announced. The Pioneers will return to action Thursday, April 24, when they collide with New Haven in a non-conference showdown in West Haven, Connecticut. The opening draw is set for 4 p.m.

After spending four years as a part of the men’s soccer team, and serving as sports editor for this newspaper, I have seen a lot of outstanding athletic performances from the Green and gold athletes. As my last contribution to The Pioneer, here is my very own Top 11 Sport Memories.
The first was when Joyce Kwok winning back-to-back National Championships. The undisputable number one on my list; to win 200- yard Butterfly at the NCAA National Championships is nothing less than impressive; to repeat it: Exceptional. With the 400 Yard Medley Team also winning a set of rings in 2012. Kwok and the rest of the swimmers have together with the Women’s Lacrosse team set the bar for all the other sport programs at LIU Post.
The second was seeing Women’s Lacrosse win back-to-back National Champions. When talking about National Champions, Post’s Women’s Lacrosse is the definition of one. Two straight titles, and a current streak of 35 straight wins is unmatched at any NCAA level. Class, pure class.
The Men’s Soccer’s results from the last three years is my third favorite memory. It is hard to say that I’m objective in this matter,
but the statistics speak for themselves. For the last three seasons, the Men’s Soccer Team has produced three East Coast Conference (ECC) Regular Season Championships, and crowned it with two straight ECC Championship Titles. They’ve been nationally ranked among the top 25 teams for the entire season in both 2012 and 2013, and kept the highest spot on the NCAA Ranking for more than 10 weeks in total. One loss
in three years at home, and a cumulative record of 53-7-3 since 2011 is extraordinary.
Field Hockey’s run in 2013 is number four. Led by Carlee Dragon, the field hockey team was 21-0 heading into the National Championship Game against Shippensburg University in Virginia. They were seconds away from the perfect season, but after a controversial call by the referee, the Pioneers dream ended in a 2-1 loss in overtime. Their 7-10 record from 2012 makes it all the more impressive.
When Jackie Sileo was named NCAA‘s Leading Point-getter. We are blessed with a lot of great athletes here at LIU Post, but the Women’s Lacrosse Team has the best lacrosse player in the nation. Jackie Sileo became an NCAA All-Time leading point-getter across all divisions when she surpassed the previous record-holder, Ashley Hansbury, in the 14-9 win over Dowling. She currently has 527 points and three games left in the regular season.
Number six is Alexis Peters’ buzzer beating performance. With 1.1 seconds left, the LIU Post Women’s Basketball team was down 59-58 against Assumption in the East Regional Quarterfinals. Assumption had possession of the ball under their basket. As Assumption’s Jamie Insel tried to inbound the ball, Peters intercepted the pass, and took a shot just before the buzzer sounded and scored, sending the Pioneers to the Semi-finals. I have never seen anything like it. You can see the play on LIU Post’s Athletic website.
Post’s position in the Commissioners Cup comes in at number seven. On February 17th I tweeted: “2013-14 season for the @ liupostpioneers must go down in history as one of the best!? Standout performances from ALL teams so far. #PostPride” A couple of months later, LIU Post has moved up to 13th spot in the Learfield Sports Directors’ Cup Standings. This standing is based on all the schools’ sports results combined. The Pioneers have been ranked as high as six over the course of the season, which is in fact the highest in history.
My eighth favorite memory was when Jonathon Watkin was named an All-American. After scoring the game winner in the ECC Semifinal with 2.8 seconds left in 2013, winning the teammate of the year award for three straight years, and working harder than anyone else for the last four, Watkin was finally awarded the highest honor a student athlete can receive his senior year: NCAA First Team All America selection. Together with Eivind Austbo’s significant harvest of personal awards in 2013, Watkin really helped to put the Men’s Soccer program on the national map.
The ninth was when Maka Namahoe (Volleyball) won the East Region. The Hawaii native had been the heart and soul of the Volleyball team for the last four years, and played 133 games without winning a single trophy with the Pioneers. In 2013, he finally got the chance to lift the East Regional Trophy. Well deserved.
Susanne Vistnes’s goal against Molloy is number ten. There is no doubt that Susanne will go down in history as one of the best players to ever play here at LIU Post. With 33 goals and 15 assists during her first two seasons, she has distinguished herself nationally, being named All- American two years in a row. Her goal against Molloy in 2012 is hands down the best goal I’ve ever seen at any level of women’s soccer. From 25 yards she blasted the ball into the far top corner, and if the net didn’t stop the ball, it would orbit the earth till this day.
My final favorite memory was when Karsten Viste joined the football team. Viste played for the Men’s Soccer program from 2010 and retired after the 2012 season. Just weeks before the fall season started, he was brought in to tryout for the football team, and was soon hired as their kicker. He made 41 out of 42 PAT’s and six out of eight field goal attempts in his first seasons. With no experience playing football that is impressive. Viste will return for his final season in 2014.

The no. 18 LIU Post softball team earned yet another sweep on Saturday, April 19, downing East Coast Conference (ECC) opponent St. Thomas Aquinas (STAC) 2-0 and 8-0 in a doubleheader in Sparkill, N.Y. As a result, the Pioneers improved their overall record to 33-5, with a conference record of 19-1.
That was all the scoring the visitors needed, as senior starter, Liz Weber, earned her 16th win of the season. She allowed five hits and one walk with two strikeouts over five innings of work. Sophomore pitcher Quincy Lewis tossed the final two innings to collect her seventh save of the year. She set the Spartans down in both the sixth and seventh frames to secure the win. Havens and Gonzalez each finished the opener 2-for-3 with a run scored, while Gonzalez added a walk and two RBIs.
The Pioneers did not wait as long to cross the plate in game two. Havens singled to lead off the game, and Gonzalez doubled her home only two batters later. A subsequent groundout then moved Gonzalez to third, and junior catcher
Aly Dzierzynski reached on an error by the third baseman, allowing Gonzalez to score the second run of the inning. The Green and Gold added another two runs in the next frame on an RBI double by sophomore third baseman Maria Palmeri, and an RBI groundout by senior second baseman Angela Carmine.
After pushing across a fifth run in the third, the Pioneers extended their lead to 8-0, with a three-run fifth inning as Palmeri, Havens, and Carmine all knocked in runs.
Freshman hurler Ashley Martin was dominant in the circle, improving to 13-0 for the season. The rookie allowed just one hit over five innings while walking none and fanning six. Havens led the way at the plate as she put forth a 3-for-4 showing with an RBI and a run scored.
The team wraps up their regular season on Sunday April 30, against Dowling College, and then begin the ECC Championship Tournament and NCAA sub and super regional tournaments.

Several international student clubs joined together to host the second International Fashion Show on April 3, in the Long Island Room of the Winnick Dining Hall. The show was one of the biggest events during International Cultural Week, bringing in over 70 students from 13 different countries. There were 43 models representing countries such as Jamaica, Nigeria, India, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, China, Mongolia, Russia, Norway, Sweden, and the United States.

Saki Matsumoto, a junior Public Relation major from Japan, danced a traditional dance called ‘Nihon-Buyo’ with other Japanese students. They showcased “Yukata,” a traditional Japanese cloth. “It was so tight I couldn’t breathe,” Matsumoto said of the outfit. “But I had fun being on stage and dancing. I was proud representing Japanese culture.”
Leslie Bai, director of Asian Student Affairs in the Office of International Student Services, said that she was proud of the students. “It was really run by student clubs, and it was those groups that took on the project. We basically just advise [them] and listen to their concerns.” Bai said that the participating students did a great job with the show despite time constraints. “I [hope] to watch this show again [for the] next International Cultural Week, maybe [in a] bigger room and with more models.”
Jerome Warden, a graduate Theatre student, enjoyed the showcase. Warden is from Texas, and did not have interactions with many internationals before he came to Post. “It was a great show, well organized,” Warden said. “I think it is very important to see different cultures here at LIU Post. I hope [the event continues to grow].”
Stephanie Trieu, a sophomore Health Science major, is the president of the International Student Union. “I was a little nervous since many people would be comparing the first show to this one,” said Trieu. “The first International Fashion Show was in the Pioneer Room last spring, which was successfully done. There were a lot of high expectations, but for ISU and its affiliates, we also had a great deal of fun.”
Trieu will be graduating this May, and reflected on her time as president of ISU: “Running [the club] as an American student was both difficult yet rewarding. There were many cultural and language barriers that we all had to overcome, even between the international students who came from so many different countries. However, in the end we were able to unite altogether as one community, and I will never forget the profound moments I shared with my ISU family.”
The success of the second International Fashion Show proves that LIU Post is becoming a more multicultural campus. The next ISU event at Post will be held in the fall semester during International Educational Week. For students who wish to join ISU, contact post-isu@my.liu.edu, or attend a club meeting Thursdays at 1 p.m. in Hillwood, room 114.
