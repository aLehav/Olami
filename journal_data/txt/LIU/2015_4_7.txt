In a dimly lit, but aesthetically curated gallery, Alexandra Pospelova, a senior Art major, explained her vision of art. “To me, this is what art should be. It should be knowledge, skills, and beauty,” she said. Her exhibition, Focus, is created in this vision, inspired by classical sculptures from the old Renaissance masters.
Her artworks consist of paintings, pencil drawings, and she has even incorporated sewing into some of her works. “I did a lot of macramé when I was a kid,” she said. Macramé is a French form of textile work, consisting of knots and sewing; Pospelova incorporates this technique into her canvases. “I wanted to show things that people don’t usually see or think about,” she said. All of her work in the exhibition is illustrations of the human body.
Pospelova was inspired by her father’s love of photography, and one day, he asked her why she didn’t combine it with her own interests. She has incorporated her Russian background with her new American impulses after studying here, and also took a semester abroad in Florence, where she picked up influences from the classical works, such as the likes of Michelangelo. In her show, which is displayed in the S.A.L Gallery, she brought all the different cultures and influences together.
She uses photography in a research phase of the expo, taking or finding photos in black and white, and then studying where the light hits them, and how the shadows cast on the body and form. The shadows are what her work is made of, and her works combine both her traditional Russian background and American contemporary art. “I’ve struggled with contemporary art,” she said. “It doesn’t always fit my view of art. There’s no good or bad; it’s just all good. I need some rules.” But her artwork is unmistakably modern, both in media and imagery.
After graduation, Pospelova aims to stay in the U.S., for both artistic and social reasons, as she develops her artistic identity. Pospelova said the work in the exhibit isn’t her final form as an artist, but a means to discover her true identity. The exhibition ran in the S.A.L Gallery from March 30 to April 5.

Coming off five straight victories, the seventh-ranked men’s lacrosse team marched towards another win on Saturday, Apr. 4. But leading by six with 20 minutes to go, the Warriors from Merrimack sharpened their blades and the homeside couldn’t hold off sporadic, of- fensive attacks. The Bethpage castle fell to the ground, and Merrimack could bring home a close 10-9 ruling.
The squad will look to get revenge in its next battle on April, 11. The Pioneers will face neighboring New York Institute of Technology at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. The game is set for noon.

After serving as an assistant coach last year, Mike Gaffney has taken over the head coaching duties for the LIU Post baseball team. In his first year at the helm, Gaffney is looking to continue the winning tradition and put his squad on the map as a championship-caliber team.
Q: What went through your mind when you first found out you were taking over as head coach?
A: I was excited to be able to work with this team on a full-time basis. Last year, I was called in to help out on a part-time basis. It’s great to see my players take the next step developmentally as baseball players and student-athletes. I’m also able to watch these guys take steps on the field and help us win baseball games.
Q: What made you want to become a coach?
A: I got out of professional baseball about six years ago. I had some coaching and scouting offers at the professional level, but after being away from home so long, I wanted to come back and get a full-time job. I didn’t realize how much I missed baseball until I started helping out last year. Halfway through last season, I figured out that this is the path I want to take. The players and coaches have hit the ground running ever since I’ve been here.
Q: How would you rate your team’s chemistry on the field?
A: It’s been a pleasant surprise. We’re all brothers in this and by us preaching that, the guys really embrace it. We take pride in how tight we are and our chemistry will help us produce more success on the field. If we keep the train on the tracks, we’re going to be in a good place at the end of the year.
Q: What are some of your team’s strengths and things that need improvement?
A: Right now one of our strengths is starting pitching. We also put the bat on the ball and we make hard contact. We need to get better with situational hitting by finding a way to score with runners in scoring position. We’ve had too many strikeouts in those situations. Half of the battle is just putting the ball in play. Since injuries have given us tough luck, I always stress that next man-up mentality.
Q: How do you look to build on your momentum being tied first in conference play?
A: We have a huge series coming up against St. Thomas Aquinas who we’re tied with for first place. They were a top-25 team and one of the College World Series participants last year. As a baseball coach, these are the best times when you’re putting all the money out there. This series is a really good test for us and we’re going in expecting to win.
Q: What’s your favorite position to coach?
A: I was a shortstop/middle infielder during my career, so I enjoy working with the middle infielders the most because that’s where my expertise lie. I also have a passion for working with the hitters too. I was an average hitter in the MLB, but I enjoy teaching these guys the mental aspect of hitting. This year, we have a better approach and game plan when it comes to hitting.
Q: Do you have any prior coaching experience to Post?
A: No, but I spent one summer with the Long Island Collegians when I first left the pros. I helped out my friend, Chris Rojas, the head coach there. I’ve always been involved with baseball camps, but last year was my first year coaching at the college level. Baseball is really a simple game if you don’t let it get the best of you. While in the pros, I was around players like George Bret, Bo Jackson, and Hal McCray, and seeing the game from their view helped me as a coach.
Q: How did it feel to be drafted twice to the pros while playing during college at New York Institute of Technology?
A: It was a dream come true. I think every college baseball player has that dream of putting on a professional uniform and representing a MLB organization, which I was lucky enough to do for five plus years. Baseball also helped me in life itself with the cut-throat competition. I know of the bumps in the road when you play Northeast baseball and I always had that coaching mentality even when I played on the professional level.
Q: What is your goal for the baseball program here at Post?
A: My number one goal is to make us a regional contender every year. We’re doing a great job recruiting and we also have really good energy in our local baseball community about what we’re building here.
Q: What is one thing people would be surprised to know about you?
A: Everything about me is pretty much known. I’m a local guy and my roots are here on Long Island and New York City. I do have national relationships, which we’ll see with some of the players we’re bringing in here. My relationships locally are what will bring us to the next level. We’re going to be successful locally and then extend nationally after that.

On Thursday, Apr. 2, the baseball team started out their crucial four-game set with the 9-3 rout of the Spartans from St. Thomas Aquinas Col- lege from the LIU Post Baseball Field in Brookville, N.Y.
Sophomore pitcher Jake DeCarli tossed seven innings, striking out six Spartans and allow- ing just one run on five hits. While DeCarli kept the opposition at bay, the Pioneer offense went to work early and often, scoring all nine of their runs in the first four innings. Sophomore outfielder Kenny Daley, graduate outfielder Vinny Iacono, junior infielder Matt Bowers, and junior shortstop Rick Alessi all collected multi-hit games.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Apr. 4, in a doubleheader against a familiar foe in the Spartans. St. Thomas took both games by a score of 9-6 and 6-0 respectively. In the first game, the Pioneers jumped out to an early lead, but sophomore pitcher James Long ran into some trouble in the third inning. The Spartans evened up the score and then scored three more runs in the next two innings.
Trailing 4-1, the Pioneers put runs on the board in a rather unique way. After an RBI groundout plated junior first baseman David Goreneveld, the Pioneers tallied runs on a bases loaded hit by pitch and walk to even up the score at four. The Spartans answered the three run rally with a few runs of their own, pushing their lead 7-4. The Spartans eventually took the game by a score of 9-6.
In the night cap, the Pioneers struggled at the dish and in the field, posting just four hits and committing eight errors. The Spartans were led by pitcher Nick May who stuck out six Pioneers in a seven inning effort to earn his third win of the season.
The Pioneers are back in action on Friday, Apr. 10, when they return home to face Dowling College in a four-game weekend series. First pitch is scheduled for 3 p.m.
