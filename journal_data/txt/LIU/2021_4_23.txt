Women’s Gymnastics’ inaugural season may have wrapped up, but several gymnasts earned honors for their success at the conference championship meet on March 20. A total of four gymnasts on the Women’s Gymnastics team earned All-EAGL recognition. Gymnasts Mara Titarsolei, Amanda Loo, and Katy Koopman earned First-Team All-EAGL recognition, while Allison Lapp received Second-Team honors. Titarsolej earned a 9.825 on bars, while Lapp posted a 9.800 for her bar performance, while Loo posted a 9.850 on floor, and Koopman earned a 38.575 in the all-around routine. 
 The honors meant a lot to sophomore Amanda Loo, as the awards allowed the four to make history in the LIU Women’s Gymnastics program.
“Earning an All-EAGL recognition means a lot to me considering my four teammates, and I get to be the first LIU gymnasts to ever receive a conference recognition. Earning it on floor is special to me and was a personal goal because floor is my favorite event,” Loo said. 
 Head Coach Randy Lane was pleased that his team could accomplish this honor in its inaugural season.
“I am immensely proud of this team and these four women in particular for setting the standard for LIU gymnastics.  It means a great deal to be recognized by the EAGL conference for the hard work by these women and this team,” he said.  “This was not a normal year, and to achieve success within our conference in the inaugural year sets us up for great success in the future with this talented group of student-athletes.” 
 Despite the inaugural season wrapping up, gymnast Mara Titarsolei has already set goals for next season. 
“My goals for next season are coming back strong and ready to contribute to what this team can do. We showed this year that we can push through anything, and next year I want us to show what we are capable of,” she said. “Personally, I would like to add some harder skills here and there. I am really excited for next year.”

NCAA March Madness is here again, and it has been exciting with a few upsets from Oral Roberts, Northern Texas  Loyola, Chicago, Oregon State and Syracuse.
 Closing in on the Final Four, Junior Damien Caffery felt strongly about Gonzaga’s chances.
“Gonzaga will be on top at the end of the tournament,” he said.
The Gonzaga Bulldogs are coming off a huge overtime buzzer-beater win over the UCLA Bruins, rolling into the championship game to play #1 the Baylor Bears.
Caffrey believes it was a shock that UCLA made it that far.
 “The biggest bracket buster Is UCLA,” he said. “They were an 11 seed that made it to the Final Four, and they beat Michigan.” 
Anthony Gambino spoke about how he had Michigan to Win.
 “UCLA pulling that through was huge. I couldn’t see Michigan losing,” he said. “UCLA was the biggest bracket buster, and I doubt anyone had them unless you are a fan.” 
On Monday, April 5, many waited for after the cancellation of the March Madness tournament last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was finally the championship game. The teams lucky enough to make it were the undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs and the underdogs, the Baylor Bears, who faced off in a seemingly lopsided battle. 
In this case, the Baylor Bears were the bigger threat on the floor. Gonzaga’s performance was disappointing to fans after coming off of an impressive win against UCLA in the Final Four with frontman guard Jalen Suggs’ buzzer-beater for the win. It was unfortunate for Gonzaga fans, but it was great for people who always root for the underdog. 
Senior sports management major Eddie McQuade got the opportunity to work at the Final Four down in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
McQuade said his favorite moment from the event was watching UCLA’s game-winning shot in person. 
“I got to witness Jalen Suggs hit a buzzer-beating three from 33 feet away to save Gonzaga’s perfect season and send them to the national championship. That game alone was easily the best of the three games, and that shot is gonna be talked about forever,” he said. “Jalen Suggs just had ice water running through his veins because to hit that shot as a true freshman and to be that cool under pressure. I don’t think any other freshman in that situation would be able to pull that shot off.”
McQuade thought the area was perfectly fitting to hold the event after all the unforeseen circumstances that lead to its cancellation last year. 
“One thing I’ll always remember is how beautiful Indianapolis is. The city is so clean the people always take care of it,” he said. “Lucas Oil Stadium is also a nice stadium, and the way the stadium is built, you’ll realize how much the stadium represents the blue-collar culture of the city.”
McQuade loved the thrill that the fans brought to the event.
“The atmosphere was like the super bowl to an extent. Seeing so many people from all over the nation was a sight I loved seeing since we’re not used to large crowds,” he said. “The fans were all very polite, and the celebrities in Indy are all people who will take time to talk to you if you choose to talk to them. Even outside the stadiums at bars and restaurants, the locals loved bringing in the tourists, and I think this is exactly what every major city in America needs right about now to get back on their feet.”
McQuade thought the intensity of the crowd was unlike anything ever seen. 
“The crowd’s energy was fantastic. During the national anthem, it was impossible not to get goosebumps while listening to it, and you can feel how into the game everyone was during the UCLA Gonzaga game. You can feel the heartbreak for the Bruins and the pure joy for the bulldogs when Suggs called the game,” he said. “During the championship, you can feel both teams being hungry for their first National Championship. As soon as Baylor started pulling away with the game, I had the privilege of getting the first look at the Bears championship gear as I had to deliver it to the merchandise stands. Seeing thousands of Baylor fans rush to the lines to get their merch was a pure adrenaline rush, and I hope to relive that same energy at sporting events in the near future.”
McQuade got the position to work concessions and sales through a friend he met while working at the Super Bowl with the organization ‘Living Sport’. He claimed that no one was taking cash and that the fans could pay for anything with a card. McQuade also believes this could be something we see going forward. 
With Baylor Coming out on top, beating Gonzaga 86-70 for the National Championship, March Madness and the College Basketball season came to a close.

Nets player Kevin Durant recently has gotten into a controversy on social media with actor and comedian Micheal Rapaport. 
Rapaport took to social media to share screenshots of a private conversation had between the two via direct messages. The conversation revolved around a tweet Rappaport made in December of 2020 making fun of Durant after a post game interview he was a part of.
Rapaport had tweeted, “KD seemed deeply in his feelings with the @NBAonTNT crew after the game DAMNIT he’s super sensitive about everything.” 
Durant later responded with a series of messages that contained offensive language, along with comments that social media users have called homophobic and misogynistic.
Rapaport said the situation was not as bad as initially reported. 
“Those are threats that were made over and over and over. It’s been going on for months. On Tuesday of this week, he caught me on a bad day. That being said, in my opinion, the whole situation got blown out of proportion,” he said.
The NBA later fined Durant fifty thousand dollars, and Durant later came out and apologized. 
“I’m sorry that people saw that language I used,” he said. “That’s not really what I want people to see and hear from me, but hopefully, I can move past it and get back out on the floor.”
This isn’t the first social media controversy Rapaport has been involved in. Rapaport has engaged in several arguments with Bar Stools founder Dave Portnoy, and was criticized for making fun of Ariana Grande’s appearance in 2018.
Junior business major Tosin Oyekanmi had some thoughts about the situation.
 “In this day and age, everyone’s a troll, and everyone has something to say. I think Micheal Rapaport and Kevin Durant were just trolling or joking around,” he said. “Rapaport is known for his friendly banter with many famous celebrities and also his rants and trolls on former President Donald Trump, so this isn’t out of the ordinary for him.”
Sophomore pre-med and pre-law major Noah Anderson thinks both Durant and Rapaport could have handled the situation differently, and that neither of them are in the right.
 “The NBA did what they had to for the way KD handled that, but I don’t think Micheal Rapaport needs to release the direct messages if he really felt attacked or threatened, he should’ve sought authorities and not viewers,” he said.
Kevin Durant recently got back on the court for the Nets and hopes to continue dominating the Eastern Conference and have an excellent closing to the end of the season.

Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Philip passed away at age 99 on April 9.
 Prince Philip was the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. He was born on June 10, 1921 in Corfu, Greece. Prince Philip was known for his long naval career, his passion for sailing and his support for the Queen. He retired in August 2017, at the age of 96. He had four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. 
 “It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,” Buckingham Palace’s statement said. “His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. Further announcements will be made in due course. The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.”
“The funeral arrangements have been revised in view of the prevailing circumstances arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and it is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral,” the College of Arms said in a statement The funeral took place on April 17 at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. Only 30 people were allowed to attend the funeral. 
The Duke of Edinburgh spent a month in two hospitals in London. He was treated for an infection and had heart surgery. He was discharged from the hospital in March. The cause of his death has not been publicly announced.
In honor of Prince Philip, the bell of London’s Westminster Abbey rang once every 60 seconds on Friday evening. The bell rang 99 times for his 99 years alive. This is where he and Queen Elizabeth were married on Nov. 20, 1947. The Queen referred to him as her “strength and stay.” The two were married for over 70 years.
“I’m really sad to hear this,” freshman criminal justice major Meghan Corrigan said. “He seemed like a great man that cared for his family and his country. I liked that they rang the bell 99 times to honor his number of years alive. That was a really nice way to pay respect to him. My prayers go out to the Royal Family.” 
The government told the public to not gather or leave tributes or flowers at royal residences because of COVID-19. Instead, the Royal Family would like people to make a donation to charity. There is also a book of condolences online on the official Royal website for people to write a message for the family. 
There have been tributes all around the world to honor the life of Prince Philip. “Prince Philip was a man of great purpose and conviction, who was motivated by a sense of duty to others,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement. “He will be fondly remembered as a constant in the life of our Queen, a lifelong companion who was always at her side offering unfailing support as she carried out her duties.”
“That is really unfortunate that there can only be 30 people at his funeral,” junior political science major Marianne Bell said. “I know they have to be safe because of covid, but that must be so hard for the family and friends that cannot be at the funeral. I hope the Royal Family finds peace during this difficult time for them.”
Some of the 30 guests that attended the funeral included Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Eugenie.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has forced many clubs and organizations to adhere to an online format. The on-campus comedy improv troupe, “No Control” is no different. 
The group has been having rehearsals on Zoom all year and has been creative in finding new ways to hold shows.
Improv shows rely on the audience’s reaction. They are fueled by the laughter and emotions from the people in front of them. But most of all, it’s all about the suggestions. 
Improv is made up on the spot, and unscripted. The troupe members get a suggestion from the audience and perform a scene based off of it. 
When the world moved to an online format, No Control had to find a way to incorporate that exciting audience interaction aspect. Luckily for them, Zoom has a chat feature that has been used in the same way. 
“It’s working, there’s some adjustments that have to be made, and there’s been a lot of uphill battles, but I think we’re at the top of the hill,” senior musical theatre major Izzy Ochocki said.
Ochocki has been part of No Control since her sophomore year. She auditioned the first chance she got, and never looked back.
“It’s changed a lot,” Ockocki said.
She recalls the in-person performances she got to be a part of. Since this is her last performance, she won’t be able to be in anymore. 
This past Thursday, No Control had their “Spring Break Show,” where everyone came dressed as their favorite holiday. The troupe all dressed up as spring break in memory of the one the students did not get this year.
“It will be my last show, but I’m really excited to have that and knock it out of the park and see everyone else kill it,” Ochocki said.
After the show, the leaders of the troupe, Steele Whitney and Jordan Horne gave a senior farewell to Ochocki. 
While this was Ochocki’s final season with No Control, it was other member’s very first. Sophomore musical theatre major Kevin DiCarlo is a new member this year and is excited to perform in his first real show with No Control.
“It’s been fun being a new member because Steele and Jordan; our leaders have made a really great environment for us coming in, and have really taken the time to train us in improv technique,” DiCarlo said.
The troupe meets every Sunday for rehearsal, and DiCarlo has had a great time learning how to navigate improv on zoom.
“Zoom has been a really great platform, only because the things we do have been so well adapted from being in-person,” DiCarlo said.
Although students can’t physically come out to the shows anymore, they are tuning in to Zoom to watch and laugh.
