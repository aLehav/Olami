 The Field Hockey team is putting the last pieces together as they prepare for conference play.
The team had mixed performances at the start of their fall 2019 season. With a record of 3-5, The Sharks are anticipating their first conference game on Friday, Oct. 11, against Wagner College. The team is up for the challenge and ready to give their opponents trouble in the NEC, according to Head Coach Raenee Savin.
Coach Savin does not believe their .375 winning percentage record is representative of what is to come in conference play. “I think that the teams we played out of conference before starting our conference schedule were definitely challenging, but it got us ready for everything were going to need to do,” she said.
In their third game of the season, The Sharks faced nationally ranked No. 25 William and Mary College. The Sharks stood up well against the power house from Virginia, but ultimately lost in a 2-0 defeat. 
The other teams that defeated the Sharks had very close finals scores. The Sharks lost to La Salle University in a shootout 3-2 and lost to Saint Francis University 2-1 in overtime. 
However, the Sharks non-conference games were not plagued with close loses. The Sharks defeated Towson University with the score of 3-2 and, defeated Lock Haven University 1-0 in a huge win on September 29.
With the start of conference play upon them, the Sharks seem to be an unexpected threat within the NEC. 
“I know that [in] being a new team to Division I, teams are not expecting us to be as strong as we really are. So I hope to be the underdog that shocks everyone and comes out on top,” Savin said.
Friday is not only the team’s senior day as well as their first NEC game. Coach Savin believes that it will be an exciting day, kicking off both conference play and celebrating the seniors and all they have accomplished throughout their four years.  
After coaching LIU Post Pioneer Field Hockey for 16 years, this is Coach Savin’s first time coaching at the Division I level and in the NEC. However, she does not see it affecting her coaching style or their game play.
“As long as our team just follows a plan and they stick to the plan than were gonna be just fine,” she said. “Our team is up for the challenge and we just need to continue to raise the bar each and every day.”

 The women’s soccer team fell to the Robert Morris University Colonials on Sunday, Oct. 6 in a 4-2 loss in their Senior Day game. Prior to kick off, seniors Julia Duffy, Gabrielle Clark, Veronica Saager and Shakila Seva-nan were honored on the field surrounded by family and friends. The announcers highlighted each of the senior’s accomplishments throughout their collegiate athletic careers. 
The Sharks were off to a rough start in the first half, with the Colonials securing two goals in the first five minutes of game time. They were able to cut the deficit in half as Duffy landed the first goal to put the Sharks on the board. Unfortunately, the Sharks were unable to gain more ground as the Colonials secured two more shots, going 4-1 into the intermission.
In the second half, the Sharks came back strong on the offense. Duffy scored her second goal of the match, once again splitting the deficit at 4-2. The scoreboard remained stagnant throughout the second half as possession bounced back and forth between the two teams. The goalies were toe-to-toe on saves, as neither team was able to secure a goal. 
A third goal for the Sharks by sophomore forward Kendra Oldroyd would have made the match a close call. But it was disallowed by a hand ball call from the referee. The game came to an end with a 4-2 win for the Colonials.
Duffy would have a Senior Day for the books, earning a season high of two goals during the match against RMU. In an interview before the match, Duffy and her fellow senior teammates reflected on their last few years on the field and the switch from Division II to Division I in their final season. 
From Pioneers to Sharks, the players said that the changes weren’t drastic. “We played at such a high level in Division II, so coming to this level in Division I wasn’t that big of a difference,” said Gabrielle Clark, a political science major and midfielder. 
Starting off the season, Clark wished her team could have gotten a few more wins. “A lot of [the games] we could have won or been a little more successful because we come from a very successful team,” she said. Clark said the team is working on a few things, and she hopes they will be able to accomplish more for the remainder of the season. After graduating early in December, Clark will take a semester off before applying to grad school and possibly law school. 
Veronica Saager, an education major, psychology minor and forward, was excited for the switch to DI. “I felt ready for it and was excited to see the next level and how we would play,” she said. Unfortunately, Saager’s season was cut short due to a torn meniscus, which required knee surgery. She hopes to bounce back from her second surgery and continue playing later in the season. After graduation, Saager plans to attend grad school to earn her masters in special needs education. She also plans to continue her soccer career as she has a redshirt year, and possibly continue playing overseas. 
Shakila Sevanan, a health science major, business mi-nor and defender, believes the team will step up to their ultimate goal – which is to win more games and reach the playoffs. “We started off slow,” she said. The team is still adapting to the coaching style of their new head coach, Eleri Earnshaw. “It’s different but we’re learning to work with it. She’s new, and it’s new for us, so I think we are just learning day by day to get to know her more,” Seva-nan said. “She’s building up a relationship with us, we are learning to trust her.”
Duffy, a business administration major, said the season so far has been fun, though emotional. This new season has been a huge transition for her and her team-mates. As a senior, she hopes the younger players on the team learn to work hard for each other. “That was a really big thing last year, working with each other,” she said. 
Her other advice for younger players is for them to give it their all for their four years. “It goes by a lot faster than everyone says. Just have fun, because before you know it you’ll be a senior graduating,” she said. Duffy has plans to work in sports marketing after graduation.
The seniors looked back on their favorite moments of their time on the team. A fond memory this season was the team’s trip to California for their first D1 game. “Road trips were my favorite, because that’s when everyone bonded the most,” Sevanan said. They enjoyed playing music on the bus, dancing, and singing along to karaoke.  
For Saager, the most memorable moment was during her sophomore year when the team was battling for an Elite 8 position and they beat their rival Adelphi University. “We played our hearts out and when we won we were in the locker room singing along to ‘All I Want for Christmas’ by Mariah Carey and all the coaches joined in our dance circle. I felt on top of the world,” she said. 
The Sharks look forward to more memories to come. Their next home game is against Merrimack College on Sunday, Oct. 13 at 1 p.m. at the LIU Soccer Field.

 Nine of 20 players are new to this year’s Women’s Rugby roster, the team has a new coach and is in a new division. The team has a clear goal for this season: team synergy and constant improvement. “Our goal is to get a little bit better every single day,” Head Coach Colleen Doherty said.   
Women’s rugby was added to the LIU Post Division II athletic program in 2017. For the 2-19 season, due to the merger between Brooklyn and Post athletics, the team had their first season as a Division I program. “We are in the development process of building this program,” Doherty said. 
Doherty started her job as the head coach for the rugby team in January 2019. Before LIU, she served as an assistant coach at Quinnipiac University where the team won three National Intercollegiate Rugby Association (NIRA) national titles. Aside from coaching, Doherty played college rugby at Quinnipiac University where she was captain for four years. 
The team began their season with a lower roster, which means several players are doubling up on positions and taking on more physical stress. Most rugby teams have a roster of 25 or more, according to Doherty, but she said this is normal for new teams starting out. “It’s just a part of the development process. After [one or two years] we expect it to continuously grow exponentially.”
The team had to learn to adapt to these conditions. “This season has been a great learning experience for both players and coaches alike. We have brought in a lot of new girls so it is a different dynamic than what the team is used to,” Doherty said. “With that came a period of learning how to work of each other and figuring out the line-up of who works best where and who works best with other players.” 
The Sharks are halfway through their season and their current record is 0-4. Doherty said the challenge is getting great individuals to work well together. “We have a bunch of great individual athletes and rugby players and now it’s just kind of building the pieces and putting it all together,” she said. Freshman Lynsey Danko, a health and physical education major, also thinks the team needs to continue working on working together. “Definitely a main goal is to grow even more together as a team,” Danko said. 
To pull the best out of everyone at the same time is one of the teams next steps towards a better result on the scoreboard. “We see moments of greatness continuously but it’s learning how to string those moments of greatness together and to make them more frequent so that it is across the board a strong game and a strong output both in practice and games alike,” Doherty said. She thinks their irregularity could be because of their young roster, but is convinced that pieces will fall into place quickly. “I feel like pretty much every single game, we are getting better and better,” she said. “We know how great they can be and it’s just a matter of time before we see that on the output.”
Senior psychology major Janine Gelles also believes that good results are in the near future. Their biggest strength, according to Gelles, is their adaptability. “We’ve had to change a lot in terms of positions on the field, adjusting to new players, new styles and drills and a bunch of different aspects through the season,” she said. Gelles mentioned that in their last game the team had to change their entire playing style, which they managed to do well.  “No matter what, everybody is willing to figure out what’s going to be best for the team. We have definitely been showing off what we can do and now it’s just to implement it in the games, which we have seen happen piece by piece so it’s just a matter of time,” she said.
Sophomore biology major Brianna Thomas agreed. “You see the change from the first game versus the last one,” she said. “The communication was better and it was more like we are working together as a team.”
Like in any DI level sport, the rugby team has had their fair share of injuries. Together with wrestling, rugby is one out of two full contact sports in the NCAA Division I for women, and with that comes physical stress. But Doherty said the team doesn’t have any more injuries than any other contact sport or any other teams. “We don’t talk about injuries. We talk about being physically resilient and being strong for each other’s team-mates,” Doherty said. They instead decide to focus on the “controllables.” The teammates work with their full-time strength and conditioning coach and full-time athletic trainer to ensure athletes are well prepared. 
The team plays their next game at home on Saturday, Oct. 12 against American International College. Going forward, Doherty sees her team continuing to develop and use the same fighting mentality they’ve shown all season. “Every time the team steps on to the game field they give everything they have which is very awesome to see as a coach and it makes us very proud,” she said. “I expect us to keep moving forward and to finish our season stronger than how we started it.”

 Venus, the planet of love, beauty, values and finances, moves into Scorpio, a fixed water sign associated with passion, possessiveness, mys-tery and seduction, which means changes and developments in your love life could be under-way. Venus will reside in Scorpio until October 31, so start looking into your love life now. 
People are more than just their sun signs – the sign associated with their date of birth. Everyone has a unique and complex birth or natal chart made up of many signs, planets and aspects. To find out your full natal chart, use any astrology website you can find – we recommend using cafeastrology.com, but there are many to choose from. Once you do this, check the list to see what zodiac sign occupies the planet Venus and check below for your love horoscope for this month.
Aries Venus
Those with Venus in Aries in their charts are very straight-forward, bold, no-bs signs when it comes to love. A fiery confidence is very apparent in this cardinal fire placement. This month, you may find yourself falling in love – and fast! If you see someone you like, you likely won’t hesitate to go after them. But try not to get hurt in the process. Venus’s position in Scorpio this month has you craving for intimacy, but beware of people who can’t sustain your interests. 
Taurus Venus
People with their Venus in Taurus feel right at home in this position, as Venus is Taurus’s ruling planet. Often seen as the most luxuri-ous of the zodiac signs, Taurus in Venus place-ments have a desire for comfort and fashion. Taurus is a fixed earth sign, and paired with Venus, those with this placement tend to have a possessive streak in their affairs. Try to relin-quish some control as Venus moves into your opposing sign this month – a sweet surprise is on the way.
Gemini Venus
Venus in Gemini people use witty conversa-tion to win over the hearts of those they love. Being able to speak at length about an array of interesting topics is part of your appeal. These lighthearted and changeable lovers are very playful, but don’t like to be tied down. You may find that you have more than one love inter-est at a time – and that’s okay. But this month you should focus on yourself. Try a face mask. You’ll run into a few of your crushes along the way. 
Cancer Venus
One of the most nurturing placements of Venus is in Cancer. This sign tends to root their relationships in emotion. A cardinal water sign, those with this placement tend to flirt by wear-ing their heart on their sleeve and investing in the emotions of others. Cancer Venus people are overly caring and love to comfort others, but they are also shy to make any first moves. If there is a special someone on your mind this month, try baking them a treat or plan some fun activities with them to give them a little nudge. 
Leo Venus
With Leo being one of the most showy signs of the zodiac, it’s only natural for them to be equally showy lovers. Venus in Leo lovers will shower you with affection and attention – as long as you can match it. Venus in water sign Scorpio this month, however, cools down this fire sign and put you in a cozy mood. Instead of going out, try a home movie night with your lover. It could be refreshing.
Virgo Venus
Virgo in Venus people are picky lovers who are always searching for perfection in their relationships. However, these signs are also one of the most insecure. A Venus in Virgo person may focus too much on the details, which can get you into trouble. This month, take a moment to stop overthinking and go with the flow. Communication with your partner is key during this time. 
Libra Venus
Another venesian sign of the zodiac, Libra shares its ruling planet of Venus with Taurus and is another sign with an eye towards the finer things in life. People with this airy place-ment tend to exude venusian charm and are quite popular. They can attract anyone they want and they know it. Libra in Venus people reach for lovers with good taste – both in com-munication and in style. This month, expect a surprise in finances and go pamper yourself. You might attract something great.
Scorpio Venus
You may never meet a lover with more pas-sion and intensity than a Scorpio Venus. These people make their partners the center of their world by knowing every intimate detail about them. Though this water sign may love deeply, they are guarded with their own feelings at first. Once they let their guard down, they are devoted lovers. Scorpio Venus people will feel an extra boost this month. A new and exciting love is on the way. 
Sagittarius Venus
By far the most flirtatious and care-free of the zodiac, a Sagittarius Venus has an uncon-ventional approach to love. A fire sign ruled by Jupiter, Sagittarius is an adventurous lover, and may have many lovers in their lifetime. Never one for the ordinary, these signs go for partners that offer them something new, differ-ent and exciting. If you aren’t in a relationship now, you might fall into one soon. Someone is pining for you from afar and they are dying to tell you this month. 
Capricorn Venus
You can’t play coy with someone who has a Capricorn Venus, they take matters of the heart seriously. Capricorn Venus people enjoy stability in their affairs, and are attracted to mature, ambitious partners. A person with this placement may flirt by sharing their accomplish-ments. This month, expect to open up your social circle. Who knows, maybe something lovely will come of it.
Aquarius Venus
Having Venus in Aquarius can mean your initial approach to love is quite detached. You don’t fall to your emotions easily, and an ideal lover is someone that you consider a best friend. Those with Venus in this fixed air sign flirt by talking about themselves and their own progressive ideas. This month, expect positive change in your career and image and use this to your advantage. Someone is admiring you.  
Pisces Venus
People with Venus in Pisces are dreamy lovers. The position of Venus in this intui-tive water sign makes for a number of magical moments. Pisces Venus people take comfort in depth to their relationships. They love on a spiritual level, but sometimes this can lead to imagining scenarios that eventually disappoint. Try a different strategy this month, you could attract something new and exciting.

 Hello fellow commuter students at LIU. With the fall semester in full swing, I am hopeful that everyone is on the right path to success, not only in school, but also on your literal path in life as well. This week, I wanted to give you tips on how to make friends and put less stress on your mileage. 
One thing I knew I had to tackle as a transfer student in at new university was making friends and becoming sociable among my peers. I’ve come to realize that making friends as a resident student is easier than a commuter student. It all comes down to how much time is spent on campus. But, there is a solution.
Lauren Levine, a first year economics major and transfer student, is one such commuter, like me, who is still trying to find her place on campus. After speaking with Levine, she found a silver lining to simultaneously make friends and reduce the stress of commuting overall. “Reach out to friends and family, as well as your peers in the area,” Levine recommended. “Commuting is long and tiring but can be a more positive experience with a friendly face.”
Even though commuting can be seen as a major hassle, with just a few quick changes or additions, commuting can become easier and more enjoyable. The best way to find carpool buddies is to reach out to classmates in your first or last class of the day.
As the school year rolls by, take a second to think about the aspect of commuting and efficient ways to save time, money and stress. Talk to your classmates, professors and friends about different ways to commute. They just might  have the answer you’re looking for.

 On Saturday, Oct. 5, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Circle K co-hosted the event .1K for a Cause. This event, a parody of a traditional 1K run, had participants run a few feet to raise money for the American Cancer Society. The cost to participate was $5 for students and $10 for non-students.  
The course started from the entrance of Pell Hall and ended at the entrance of Kumble Hall. The races were organised into four categories: women’s, men’s, female students and male students. 
After the race, a raffle took place. Prizes included Jordan backpacks, restaurant gift cards, student essentials baskets, spa baskets and more. Other activities throughout the day included spike ball and volleyball.
The event was organized by Lucas Salerno, a sophmore dual international business and finance major and a member of SAE. The goal of the event is to raise awareness for cancer research, while also creating a sense of community.“
The event is a fun way to get families and everyone from the community involved in campus life, while raising money to fight a good cause,” Salerno said. The fraternity chose to host the walk during October, breast cancer awareness month, because this is when the cause would receive the most attention, according to Salerno.  
People from all over campus from different clubs, organizations and groups volunteered and participated in the event. “[It’s] really awesome to see the community and the campus come together for such a great cause,” Beth Hillman, president of Circle K said.

 The archives and special collections department houses a large variety of rare and historical collections. Students can visit the second floor of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library to use these resources to help with assignments or pursue knowledge in fields of their interest. 
Jarron L. Jewell, the acting director for archives and special collections, can tell students about everything the department has to offer. “Archive in the special collections is what I think of as a high research area. It’s a place where students, academics, and researchers come to look for original research material and particular materials we have in the collections here,” she said.
One of the many collections available is the Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection. According to the archives and special collections department’s web page, this collection contains more than “3,000 books, pamphlets, documents, and archives concerning the life, times, and interests of our 26th President.” This collection was donated to LIU in 1974 by the Theodore Roosevelt Association. Many of this collection’s content comes straight from President Roosevelt’s Manhattan home.
The American Juvenile Collection is another collection that may be of interest to students. “We have 12,000 first edition children’s books in fiction, folklore, fairy tail, and poetry, and they were all published in the United States,” Jewell said. “This is a great research collection for what went on between 1910 and 1999 in the United States in the minds of the children.”
The American Juvenile Collection has also been used for community outreach. “We’ve had children from Norwood Elementary School come and enjoy the collection,” Jewell said. 
An extremely rare item that may be of interest to many students is the exact color copy edition of The Book of Kells. The Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript mainly containing the four gospels, as well as other historical documents. According to the Archives and Special Collections Department’s web page, only 1,480 copies of this edition exist. This edition was recreated to be as close to the original as possible, allowing for readers to appreciate the fine details in the writing and artwork. 
Books and documents are just part of all the special collections department houses. They also have a collection of over 6,000 original movie posters. These posters advertise different films from 1940 to 1962. This collection is a perfect way for students to study the changing landscape of American culture during World War II and the Cold War. Several posters are also displayed outside the special collections department room for visitors to enjoy, and new posters are displayed monthly.
The archives and special collections department differs from other departments in the library since items can not be taken out by guests. All research must be done within the “Rare Book Room.” Guests are also encouraged to check the archives and special collections section of the campus library website. The website features lists of many of the works available in the collections, and also features digital versions of certain items that can be viewed from home.
Anyone interested in using the archives and special collections departments services can call 516-299-2880 or email Jarron.Jewell@liu.edu to set up an appointment.

 One of Nassau Hall’s resident advisors, sophomore Leah Arroyl, created a monthly event this semester called Self-Care Sundays for campus residents to help address the stress associated with attending college.
The first event took place on Sunday, Sept. 29 on the third floor of Nassau Hall. The hour was filled with bonding activities like nail painting and movies. Hannah Winston, a freshman musical theatre major who attended the first self-care session, said, “I was just having a good time relaxing and doing face masks.” There was even an area for students to take Instagram pictures, according to Arroyl, who organized the event.
As an RA, one of the many requirements is to generate one event per month for their residents. Arroyl, who is double majoring in theatre and communications, designed Self-Care Sundays because she realized that amidst the many assignments, essays, and exams, students sometimes forget to take care of themselves, both mentally and physically.
The event provides students with a judgement-free zone where they can “take away the stress of school and leave the homework and drama at the door,” according to Arroyl. “I thought it was a lot of fun,” said Jessica O’Neil, a freshman musical theatre major. “It was a good bonding experience.” It allows students to dedicate an hour of their time towards self-care with friends and fellow classmates. “Before you take care of anything else like your schoolwork, relationships, and things like that, you have to take care of yourself,” Arroyl said.
The concept of Self-Care Sundays was initially developed between Arroyl and her mother. While growing up, they dedicated every Friday to bonding activities, but when she moved from Tennessee to Long Island for school, she said they were unable to continue the tradition. 
Freshman year was difficult for Arroyl and she believes it’s partly due to the move and her lack of time dedicated towards self-care. “I was just very stressed out and there wasn’t a space for me to really relax,” she said. This setback is largely what inspired her to create Self-Care Sundays for incoming freshmen. “[It’s a place] for people to just chill. Everyone shows up in their pajamas; no judgment. Everyone leaves everything at the door,” she said.
Taking time to wind down during college is essential to maintaining good mental health, especially during high-stress periods throughout the semester. In particular, the weeks of midterms and finals. 
Self-Care Sundays will continue to take place on the last Sunday of every month on the third floor of Nassau Hall at 8 p.m. Arroyl said students can expect something different each Sunday and she’s hoping to set up some relaxation activities such as yoga sessions and guided meditation. But Arroyl wants students to know “there will always be face masks involved because I love face masks,” she said.

Weeks after Dr. Joan Digby was dismissed as director of the Honors College, faculty members are still fighting against the decision and the manner in which the dismissal was carried out. Dr. Digby was removed by Ed Weis, vice president of academic affairs, from her position without explanation or prior warning of any changes to the direction of the Honors College on August 19. She was replaced by Dr. Daniel Hanley and Professor Heather Butts, two faculty members with no prior involvement in the Honors, who were told of their new positions prior to the start of the semester, in the same abrupt manner as Dr. Digby’s removal. 
In response to Dr. Digby’s removal, several members of the Honors Advisory Board have since stepped down and the Faculty Council created a petition and statement to the administration and the National Collegiate Honors Council. The petition received 92 signatures from faculty. The statement strongly objects the administration’s decision, reading, “Someone who has served Long Island University with distinction for a half-century–and who has received national recognition for the program she built from the ground up and directed for the past forty years–deserves far better treatment than she has received at the hands of this administration.”
Dr. Mark Pires, a chemistry professor, was one of four faculty members to leave the board. “I have always believed that Dr. Digby has been the heart and soul of Honors, here at LIU Post. I wasn’t pleased with the way that she was dismissed, and that’s my primary reason for stepping down. It has nothing to do with how I feel about Dr. Hanley or Professor Butts at all. It’s more with the way that the decision to dismiss her was made,” he said. “I couldn’t continue in good conscience to serve the Honors Advisory Board after that.”
Dr. Digby’s dismissal came after she met with the VPAA about the Honors stipend for the upcoming school year in August. Weis informed her she would no longer be the director, and that the college was going in a new direction. The decision came from the administration, not a faculty vote. 
“There was no consultation of any sort when it came to Dr. Digby’s dismissal; not with the Honors Advisory Board, and not with any other faculty as far as I am aware of,” Dr. Pires said.
It’s not customary for the Honors Advisory Board to decide on matters of personnel within the Honors College, according to Dr. Pires. Their primary function as a group of – then 18, now 14 – faculty members is to advise the director on course selection, programs and events. However, many members of the board believe there should have been some sort of communication to better prepare for the change. 
There was no formal announcement made to the advisory board of Dr. Digby’s removal prior to the start of the semester. Dr. Eric Lichten, professor of sociology, also stepped down from the advisory board after finding out from another professor about Dr. Digby’s removal. He believes that leaving faculty out of the decision-making process for something as academically significant as a management model is dysfunctional and unwise. 
“I wonder if the administration understands the dilemma this raises about shared governance and academic decision-making on this campus. It questions how decisions are made, and it questions the legitimacy of the authority of the decisionmakers,” Dr. Lichten said. 
 “So, you have an academic unit that’s really important, and academicians are left out of the discussions. That’s not a recipe for success for the university, or for meeting student needs,” he said.
Some faculty members find the decision and the manner in which it was carried out demoralizing. Dr. Jay Diehl, director of history graduate programs, also stepped down from the advisory board, as he felt like his position on the board could no longer help the students under the circumstances the administration created. “It feels like the most basic ways we have to support the students and to do what’s best for the students are just continuously being undermined at this point,” he said. “I cannot escape the feeling that this work is just continuously getting harder and being undermined at every turn at this point. I think, like a lot of faculty, I find myself, after an event like this, wondering, ‘What’s the next thing? What’s coming next.’”
Dr. Barbara Fowles, a tenured professor of communications, chose to remain on the advisory board, but is conflicted. “I’m torn. I think that, to be loyal to Dr. Digby, it would be nice to step down. I would like to do that,” she said. “On the other hand, if we all step down, there are still a bunch of students in the Honors Program, and nobody who knows anything.
”The new co-directors, Dr. Hanley and Professor Butts, have never taught in the Honors College before and come from academic backgrounds of biology and health professions, respectively. Honors studies are normally geared towards the Humanities. Faculty on the board believe the new co-directors were “thrown into” their roles at the last minute. “They really knew nothing about the Honors program,” Dr. Fowles said. “They didn’t even know there was an honors board. They don’t seem to be talking very much with Joan or Tracey [honors secretary] to learn.” 
The Honors Advisory Board met September 19 to meet with the new co-directors. Attendance was sparse, and most of the discussion focused on people’s feelings on the situation. “It was a very awkward meeting because the two new directors found themselves in a position that I don’t even think they saw coming,” Dr. Pires said. “The best way I could describe it is ‘uncertain’ what direction Honors is supposed to go or will be going into the future, and I guess we’ll have to wait and see what we hear. There’s been no communication with regard to that.”
The Pioneer reached out to the new directors via email several times in regards to their initiatives for the honors program and when they plan to meet with the advisory board again, but could reach neither for comment. When trying to schedule an appointment through the honors secretary, Tracey Christy, Christy informed the Pioneer that she does not have access to the directors’ calendars. Christy no longer has knowledge of their availability and is unable to make appointments for them.
The Pioneer reached out to University President Dr. Kimberly Cline and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Dr. Randy Burd via email in regards to the selection process of the new co-directors and what direction they would take the program. They did not respond to inquiries about the hiring process. Dr. Burd responded that they were excited about the “scientific research, community engagement and public policy opportunities” Dr. Hanley and Professor Butts can facilitate for honors students.
In a September 11 email to the honors faculty, the co-directors explained that they were appointed before the start of classes, and assured the faculty that they have “no plans to proceed with changes without the opportunity for shared-governance through the Honors Advisory Board.”
A best university practice when selecting a new director of honors is to host a regional or national search for qualified candidates with a history in working in honors; some colleges even utilize the NCHC. An example of this occurred this summer, where a search committee at Adelphi University named former LIU Post history professor, Dr. Susan Dinan, as the dean of their honors college. According to the June 28, 2019 AU article on their website, Dr. Dinan began her academic career at Post in 1996 before becoming the founding director of the University Honors College at William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey for 10 years; she later created an autonomous business honors program at Pace University before going to AU.
The faculty council made a list of demands in their statement to the administration. The first was for the administration to give Dr. Digby a written apology for the manner in which her leadership of honors was terminated, and should also include “warm acknowledgment” of her many contributions to the college and campus over 40 years.
The second request was for the administration to respect the need to “proceed through proper channels” with transparency and respect for academic norms when making major decisions regarding program and departmental leadership and faculty hiring. 
The third demand requests that the faculty are informed at least two months in advance of stipendiary and directorial changes that “lie outside of the collective bargaining agreement.” This notice would give the faculty time to plan for both altered course schedules and any financial consequences from the changes in their non-contractual positions.
In response to the Faculty Council statement, Dr. Weis shared an email correspondence between himself and the council chairperson, Dr. Jeremy Buckman. He wrote, “The circumstances surrounding how Joan learned of the change in her responsibilities were accidental and unfortunate. It is clearly an outlier from the university’s standard practices. Dr. Cline met with Joan and shared our regret over the way she heard. On behalf of the board, I add our apology to hers.” 
The next steps for the Honors College are unclear. Honors Advisory Board members are unsure of their next meeting, and no other communication was made.
