Coming off a tough overtime loss to first place St. Thomas Aquinas College by a score of 2-1, the Pioneers came out focused and determined for their next games at Molloy College (3-11) and Mercy College (6-6-2).
C.W. Post won in a 4-1 rout against the last-place Molloy Lions. Later on in the week, the Pioneers faced off against Mercy College (6-6-2), but lost in an exciting double overtime match-up.
“We played well both games,” said forward Rumen Kerekov. “We scored five goals in total in those games and we created many chances. Against Molloy we won convincingly, but we lost in a very unfortunate way to Mercy.”
Right from the start of the game against Molloy, the Pioneers came out energized and ready to play. The Pioneers scored two goals in the first half; one scored by freshman back Joakim Ohlson, and the other by junior midfielder David Carlsson. After these quick two goals, neither team would put up a point on the scoreboard until Molloy’s Dan Brown beat C.W. Post goalie Marco Jorgensen to make the score 2-1 in favor of Post.
Just five minutes after Molloy finally found their offense and came within one goal of tying the game, Carlsson scored his second goal of the game, and his fourth goal of the season. Post continued to pour it on when senior forward Emanuel Messina found the back of the net off a pass from Carlsson to put the game out of reach at a score of 4-1.
On Saturday, the Pioneers traveled to face Mercy College in an East Coast Conference showdown. Post took the early lead on a goal from sophomore forward Betim Bajrami, with the assist coming from Carlsson. Midway through the second half, Mercy would even up the score off a goal from Alex Cruz.
Both teams could not end the game in regulation, so overtime was needed. Neither team could find a way to win at the conclusion of the first overtime, so yet another extra period was needed. In the 104th minute, Cruz managed to give Mercy the lead on his second goal of the game, as this proved to be the final score of a thrilling battle with the Pioneers on the losing end.
“It was a tough loss, but we can still qualify for the playoffs if we beat Queens next Saturday,’ said Kerekov. “So we will definitely be pumped up for that game.”
The Pioneers next game will be at home against Nyack College (5-5) on Thursday at 2 p.m. Saturday, will be their last regular season game, which will be at home against Queens College at 2:30 p.m.

The Pioneers volleyball team walked away from their “Dig-Pink” match on Saturday with a split.  The games were played as part of the CW Post-held tri-match that took place in the Pratt Center and featured a very pink setting as coaches from all three teams wore pink and the stands were heavily decorated in the color in order to honor the “Dig-Pink” cause.  In addition to CW Post, the match included teams from Dowling and American International Colleges.
First, the Pioneers faced the highly-ranked Dowling team.  After a hard-fought three sets, Post settled for the loss by way of a sweep to their East Coast Conference rivals, who, after Saturday, boast a 20-1 record.
Later that day in their second match, Post was finally able to tally a win, defeating the Yellow Jackets of American International in five sets.  The Pioneers, now 17-9 overall and 4-4 in conference play, were led by senior outside hitter Marilena Guadaganini who notched a team-high 15 kills in addition to 16 digs.  Fellow senior Amanda Ostapow also stood out against AIC with 45 assists in the match.
The match was held as part of the East Coast Conference’s “Pink Week” to benefit breast cancer awareness.  All volleyball and men’s and women’s soccer teams in the ECC were expected to participate in the initiative.  Donations to the cause were collected, along with sales of pink-themed T-shirts, volleyballs, and more.

The C.W. Post Pioneer Women’s soccer team continued their winning streak by defeating Caldwell College and Mercy College this past week.  Prior to the two matches the Pioneers had beaten Wilmington University, Dowling College and Saint Thomas Aquinas College in impressive fashion.
On Monday, the Pioneers easily took care of Caldwell College in a non-conference match up. Midfielder Tove Eriksson opened up the scoring for Post at 21:47. Five minutes later freshman Alexa Niciforo would score her first of two goals she tallied in the game. Niciforo beat two defenders and put the shot in the lower left Corner of the goal. Her second goal came four minutes later giving the lady Pioneers a commanding 3-0 lead. Midfielder Sam Tavantzis put the nail in the coffin scoring in the sixtieth minute to make the final score 4-0. The defense was solid as they held the Cougars to six shots.
The next game the Pioneers battled the Mercy College Mavericks on Saturday October 23. Post opened up the scoring at 12:09 as forward Alexa Niciforo continued her offensive surge by scoring an unassisted goal. That would remain the lone goal in the game until Anna Svensson scored off a rebound minutes before halftime, giving the Pioneers a 2-0 lead. The Pioneers would add one more goal at the 67th minute courtesy of freshman Lauren Bischoff. Mercy College would get on the board in 71st minute on a penalty kick goal by Andrea Nash but it was too late as Post won 3-1.
With the win C.W Post moved to 10-1-3 on the season and 5-0-1 in East Coast Conference play.  The Pioneers will close out the season by taking on Kutztown University of Pennsylvania on Tuesday October 26th and Queens College on Saturday October 30th.

The best way to judge a team is not by the number of wins or losses it has, but by the way it plays each specific game. So while a 5-3 record for CW Post is not the most glamorous mark, it tells a deep, promising story.  Case in point: the Pioneers’ 50-48 loss against Kutztown.
In the game, the Pioneers took a halftime lead with great amount. The half ended with two dominant drives led by Eric Anderwkavich. CW Post’s senior quarterback did not back down at any moment and one-upped the Golden Bears.
Coming into the game, Kutztown had the country’s 21st ranked passing offense. Their quarterback Kevin Morton entered the game with 22 touchdowns and just under 2000 passing yards.  The guy is good.  But Anderwkavich was able to channel himself from 2009, when he won ECAC player of the year, and set a conference record with 651 total yards – 556 of those coming through the air.
Anderwkavich’s play helped the Pioneers get back into the game after they lost the halftime lead. Down by 20, CW Post was able fully command the field on offense.  But a few bad breaks were the difference in the game. A Keith Hadnagy extra point was blocked. Darnel Williams dropped a possible touchdown ball late. And Andrew Kell came inches short of a 2-point conversion.
I highlight all of that to state this; the CW Post Pioneers can play like a playoff team. The squad not only hung with but also nearly overcame a 20-point deficit to a nationally ranked, undefeated team. Eric Anderwkavich has surmounted his early season struggles and went head-to-head with one of the nation’s top passing defenses. The season is not over after this loss, no matter how draining and disappointing the final outcome was.
So yes, the record could be better, mistakes could have been avoided and calls could have gone the other way. But as the great Cleon Salmon once said, “If ifs and buts were candies and nuts, we’d all have a merry Christmas.” The Pioneers have not had a disappointing season by any stretch, but the team does need to step up. With the playoffs in reach and three games left – two against top ten teams in the ECAC – every decision becomes so much more important.  The Pioneers control their own fate and need to win.
“I don’t think it’s much about putting any losses on anybody else,” said Head Coach Bryan Collins. “It’s about us. It’s about us getting another shot to play for first place.” And while the Pioneers didn’t win, they still have an opportunity at first place and a playoff spot in Division II.

A four-year starter who has never sat out a single game in her college career, Kristina Gustafson has virtually been the backbone of the Pioneers’ field hockey team. After spending her first two collegiate seasons at midfield, Gustafson was voted Second-Team All-PSAC her sophomore year before she switched to defense her junior and senior seasons. On defense Gustafson subtly maintains control of the game while always keeping a positive attitude. Not only does Gustafson excel on the field, however, but the senior from New Braintree, Massachusetts also maintains one of the highest GPAs on the team, garnering a spot on the NFHCA National Academic Squad each of her three years completed at C.W. Post.
Name: Kristina Gustafson
Major: Arts Management
Sport: Field Hockey
Year played at Post: 4
What did you first think about Post: “I was excited to experience a new place and wanted to live on my own.”
How do you feel about Post now: “I have learned a lot living here, but now I feel ready to move on to the next stage of my life.”
Lessons you will take from Post: “I never want to share a bathroom with a ton of girls again!  I also learned that sometimes it is really hard to be yourself, but it’s worth it to stand up for what you believe in.”
Best memory with the team/of Post: “Sophomore year a bunch of my teammates and I went into the city to see the Christmas tree. I had a ton of fun.”
What do you want to do after Post: “I would love to find a job in the nonprofit art world.”
What will you miss from Post: “I will miss the friends I have made and the teachers that have pushed and inspired me.”
How do you balance both school and athletics: “Balancing school and field hockey was difficult at times, but I always tried to prioritize and plan ahead. That made it easier to get things done on busier days.”

It was a dog fight from the start, the offenses from the Pioneers and the Kutztown Golden Bears driving down the field possession after possession. The Pioneers were right in the middle of the shoot out but couldn’t lock it up at the end even with Erik Anderwkavich setting records.
Kutztown scored early but the Pioneers fought back but the score remained at 10-7, Post got its touchdown when Anderwkavich connected with Darnell Williams for a 5-yard catch.
Kutztown would push the lead to 19-7 when Kevin Morton found Chris McCormick for a 35-yard touchdown. Post responded with running back Thomas Beverly, who has been banged up the past few weeks, but against Kutztown you would have never realized it. Beverly scored twice in the second quarter to give the Pioneers a 21-19 lead heading into the half.
The nationally ranked Golden Bears showed why they were undefeated coming out in the third quarter, putting up three touchdowns within ten minutes. The Pioneers defense struggled to this point with the Golden Bears offense and the Pioneers offense was sputtering.
The Pioneers found themselves down 47-27 in the fourth quarter, but instead of giving up, they began to make a comeback.
Erik Anderwkavich lead the team down the field on a quick drive and connected with second year wide out Grayson Larine for a touchdown to make the score 47-34. The Golden Bears still had one last score in them kicking a 38-yard field goal to push the lead to 50-34.
But once again the Pioneers pushed down the field, and Anderwkavich would once again find Darnell Williams in the end zone for a 6-yard pass. Instead of kicking the field goal coach Brian Collins called for a two point conversion. The conversion was successful with Anderwkavich connecting with his old pal Williams to make the score 50-42.
The Pioneers defense deserves a lot of credit, although they may have given up 50 points, they held down the high powered Kutztown offense when it mattered. While the Pioneers were rallying to stay in the game, the defense made plays and gave the offense a chance to get back in the game.
Once the Pioneers got the ball back again, Anderwkavich found wide receiver Joe Botti for a 71-yard hail-mary pass, suddenly the Pioneers just needed to convert the two point conversion and score would be tied. But Post was unable to convert, falling inches short of the end zone.
The score would stand at 50-48, the Pioneers defense came up with a huge stop and it was up to Anderwkavich and the offense to win the game.
The Pioneers would drive 74 yards down the field, and bring the ball to the Kutztown six for a first and goal with 15 seconds in the game. On the next play Anderwkavich was sacked for a loss of seven. With four seconds on the clock, the Pioneers elected to kick a field goal and looked to freshman kicker Keith Hagnagy. Hagnady’s lined up to kick the 30 yard field goal and was iced twice, when the Kutztown coach called for back to back time outs. Finally Hagnagy lined up and missed wide left as the clock struck zero. The Kutztown Golden Bears had defeated the Pioneers and found a way to remain undefeated.
Erik Anderwkavich set a PSAC and school record with 651 total yards (85 rushing, 566 passing); Anderwkavich also had five touchdown passes on the day. Thomas Beverly scored a pair of touchdowns, while rushing for 51 yards. Darnell Williams and Joe Botti had huge games, each catching two touchdowns; Williams collected 131 yards while Botti caught 10 for 227 yards.
The Pioneers may have ended a four game win streak with the loss to Kutztown, but can look to rebound next week against Bloomsburg University. It will be the final home game at Hickox field this season, as always coverage will be on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com starting at 12:30PM with kick off slated at 1pm.

To the Association for Campus Programming Executive Board and the Offices of Student Life and Services- in regards to Homecoming 2010 Photo Collage:
Although it is not our responsibility to represent C.W. Post any certain way – positive or negative – it was NOT our intention to denote the lack of coverage or diversity ACP and the Office of Student Life and Leadership worked so hard to produce.  We recognize your efforts and agree that there could have been more exemplifying Post unity, which you so carefully described to us.  That being said, as much as we appreciate your comments and concerns, we have the right to publicize Homecoming in any way we desire. We are deeply sorry that you are disappointed but instead of demanding your letter be published, take into consideration that listing your concerns about Homecoming is very different than “All that we ask is everyone is thanked appropriately for their hard work and dedication.”  Again, not our responsibility.  If the “Post Pride” you speak so highly about was in fact existent, then the mere acknowledgement of Homecoming being the success it was should have been rewarding enough.  To avoid any more conflict we would like to work together to gain the coverage we lacked.  The events you spoke of would have been great to cover for the Pioneer.  Let’s keep in touch; you already know our email.

Less than a week until New York State elections, the race for the state governor’s seat has become very heated. The normal issues of taxation and the states budget have come under debate but issues such as gay rights have dominated much of the candidates smear campaigns.  The midterm elections across the nation have become very important for the Democrats, as they struggle to stay in power at all levels of government.
With all this going on in New York’s political scene, what are Post students saying? The answer is not much.  After speaking to dozens upon dozens of students on campus, from freshmen to well-seasoned seniors, only a handful of individuals even knew the candidates names.  This could be our moment in U.S. politics, with college-aged voters having an expected turnout of less than 20%, no one expects us to make an impact.
What happened to the political fervor that was present on campus during the 2008 Presidential Election? The excitement to partake in the democratic process permeated every aspect of campus life, sparking debates in classes between professors and students alike.
It is important to remember the midterm elections are just as important as any presidential election can be.  If you want change, you must vote. Let’s prove them wrong and make an impact.  Stay tuned for next week’s polls on our very own student body.  What’s your opinion? Let us know at cwpstpnr@gmail.com

“I always knew I’d study journalism. I worked on all types of publications throughout my childhood,” said Sandra Mardenfeld, Head of the Journalism Department.  She continued with her passion for writing earning a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism at Buffalo State College and eventually her Master’s in Magazine Journalism from New York University.
Mardenfeld first started her journalistic career at CMP Publications, which mainly produces computer magazines. “I worked on Network Computing and Windows…I learned the importance of networking there,”
said Mardenfeld.
Of the dozens of publications she has worked for Mardenfeld said she learned the most writing an article about Halloween Do-It-Yourself Magic for Time Out magazine, an international publication focusing on easy do-it-yourself projects, and fun things to do in cities around the world. “The publication had a particular tone I found difficult to produce…the editor worked with me to master the voice and she provided excellent instruction on writing and the importance of listening to your reader.  She showed me the importance of word choice.”
When asked whose journalistic work she admired, Mardenfeld said there were many.  “I think Talking Points Memo and ProPublica do excellent investigative journalism.”  “The New York Times and the Washington Post still produce important articles…I enjoy the Daily Show for its original takes on media-watching.”
Mardenfeld, who was previously an adjunct professor at Post, decided to be here full-time as soon as there was a job opening. “I worked at a small college for eight years,” said Mardenfeld, “Post offered me many opportunities that weren’t possible at that institution.”
“I hope to train fine journalists who find jobs,” said Mardenfeld, and “to do that, the department needs to stay current with an industry that changes dramatically on a regular basis.” Additionally Mardenfeld hopes to expand the opportunity students have to network with current industry professionals.  As part of that, “We have a mobile journalist from Newsday coming to speak during the common hour on November 18th…the first in a new speakers series the Media Arts Department is starting.”
One bit of advice Mardenfeld would like to give everyone is, “Journalism grads need to realize they must do it all to succeed in the field… research and interview their story, shoot and edit video, write the piece, and blog or tweet about it.”   Sandra Mardenfeld is currently working on her PhD, by finishing her dissertation, at Rutger’s University.

Now that it is midterm week, one of the scariest/stressful times of the semester, we are constantly looking for ways to stay awake and energized through our long hours in the library and sleepless nights studying. Before hitting the books, we usually think to pick up a few snacks to keep us going, right? Most of us even go for snacks we usually would avoid (Snickers, Hagen Daz, Twizzlers), convincing ourselves it is the calories that give us brainpower –“I don’t even care, I need it to study!” Unfortunately, junk food will only supply a quick fix of energy then cause an immediate crash –forcing us only to crave more. What most of us don’t know is that there are particular snacks that are recognized as “brain food” –for the ingredients that make up such foods are known to have an enormously positive effect on the brain. Certain foods contain such nutrients that sharpen the memory and ignite the brain to work in its full potential. Rather than undergoing a sugar crash midway through your studying session, learn what foods will help you get right through the end.
What is “Brain Food?” Brain food is such foods that are rich in vitamins, protein, whole grain carbohydrates and good fats –together supplying the nutrients needed for full performance of the brain. The vitamin-rich foods allow the brain to be active and alert, while the fats properly regulate the blood circulation, memory and immune system. The carbohydrates suppress anxiety and increase relaxation, while the proteins break down into amino acids that help directly feed the brain. Here are ten examples of dynamite combinations that truly kick-start your body and mind, all offered here at the Winnick and Hillwood Cafe:
Note to keep yourself hydrated. Although we think caffeine is necessary to stay focused, it should be taken in moderate amounts because too much can make you shaky and jittery. The best way to stay hydrated is through water. Lack of hydration leads to neuronal damage sustained from elevated stress hormones, limiting the brain to work to its full potential.
Of course it takes more than food to get through midterm week, but snacking the right way will definitely help you feel stabilized and relaxed, rather than fatigued and overwhelmed. Although you may think that chocolate bar is going to get you through the night, think twice and choose something that will better fuel your brain, not your sweet tooth.
Until next time, I wish you all a happy, healthy and stress-free midterm week. Good luck!
-Katie
PS: Please remember  to comment below or e-mail me personally at Katiehealth@gmail.com with any questions, concerns, or ideas for next week’s issue. I would be more than happy to research, answer and feature it in next week’s column.

In the movie Mona Lisa Smile, a story about college women, the character Joan Bandwyn, played by Julia Stiles, is facing a dilemma. She’s graduating and she must choose between Yale law school and marriage. She chooses marriage. This movie is set in the 1950’s when the average age for marriage was 20 for a woman and 22 for a man.
Fast-forward to today and the marriage age has jumped 5 years with it being approximately 26 for a woman and 27 for a man. College 20-somethings stuck in their bubble of pre-adulthood are now hesitant to get married. Something that was once a small step in the acceptable direction is now like a giant leap. There are some who have chosen to take the next step in their relationship earlier than most, but there are still some deeply devoted couples who don’t feel marriage is something they should be concerned with right now.
“No one is perfect and relationships take a lot of time and effort,” said Megan Williams (W.), 22, a senior Criminal Justice major. Megan W. and her boyfriend of four years, Nicholas Petty, are known for having a strong relationship amongst their friends, with bets being made as to when they will make it legally official.
Right now they are content with their current relationship, with the plan of getting married after they have the chance to establish themselves individually and save up. According to The Wedding Report, an average U.S. wedding costs around $22,000, not including the engagement ring or honeymoon. A majority of college graduates come out making around $40,000, but with student loans hovering over their heads. “I believe that with the economy being the way it is, many college students don’t want to struggle and feel as if they’re being forced to marry,” said Megan W.
While she admitted that an engagement can mean gaining a closer relationship with your partner and starting a family earlier, by not being engaged they feel like they’ve maintained their individuality.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, there’s another young couple, a gay couple, engaged at 21. Sharing the same name, but making a different decision, former Post student Megan Koilparampil (K.) says she met her now fiancé, Lesley Scheiber, while at Post before she transferred to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Megan K. has since been with Lesley for two and a half years before putting the ring on her finger eight months ago.
“I think people my age don’t like to feel tied down. College is supposed to be a time of freedom and making your own decisions,” said Megan K., an International Studies major. “Getting engaged isn’t for everyone and it can be very hazardous to relationships when one person doesn’t feel like they’ve explored all of their options,” she continued.  For Megan K. and Lesley though, it was love at first sign, and so an engagement quickly followed. “It’s nice to know that she’ll always be there. And it’s nice to have a ring to prove it,” said Megan K.
It is suggested that couples live together before getting engaged, and 64% of them do according to a survey on iVillage.com. Take for example one of C.W. Post’s newly engaged couples: Jacklyn (Jackie) Breitfeller, 28, and Harun Eggleton, 27, who lived together before popping the question. Jackie, a Resident Assistant in Queens Hall, who is pursuing her second Masters in Art Education, fondly recalls meeting her future fiancé who she has known ever since their sociology class in high school. She had a crush on him.
They were re-united on the same campus when Harun pursued a degree in Digital Art and Design. “From the moment I saw him, I had the same butterflies in my stomach that I did in high school.”
Harun proposed July 9th at the Old Westbury Gardens just in time for them to approach their final years at Post.
“Carrying her over the threshold and into the dorm room just doesn’t sound nice,” said Harun, also a Resident Assistant on campus in Suffolk Hall. Now they are waiting until October of 2011 to finally hear wedding bells.
For now all they’re trying to do is save. Megan K. and Lesley will begin solid marriage plans after possibly traveling around Europe, and Nick might pop the question to Megan W. on the day of graduation. No matter what route they take, these couples are moving at the rate that they feel is the best for them.

Long Island University’s radio station WCWP, may have something to celebrate come December. Announced late Tuesday, their once affiliated station, WLIU-88.3 may be no more, due to an $850,000 purchase of the license and broadcasting equipment.
Long Island University has owned the license to, and operated, a radio station out in South Hampton for 20 years. This station, 88.3 WLIU, the only NPR based radio station in New York (all others are based in Connecticut) was put up for sale by LIU in 2009.
 
After many delays and negotiations, a local based East End company called Peconic Public Broadcasting (PPB), has finally come up with the means to buy the broadcast license of WLIU-FM, and is becoming the newest radio station on Long Island. PPB, which was formed by employees of the radio station and a small group of supporters, won the right to purchase the licenses and equipment with a closed bid of more than $800,000 last October. Many of these employees worked without pay for a few weeks in January in order to help Peconic come up with this money.
The deal was initially supposed to be completed by the end of June.  However, with the help of U.S. Representative Tim Bishop, PPB secured an additional month to come up with the money. With the deadline that was supposed to be met by WLIU station manager and PPB founder Wally Smith approaching, Mr. Smith was forced to tell LIU he did not have the sufficient funds to purchase the station. That is when West Hampton resident Len Conway, who put together a fundraising effort to save the Westhampton Performing Arts Center years ago, came into play. With Mr. Conway’s help, the rest of the funds were available, and PPB made payments of $213,00 to LIU.
The final step was to have The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approve the transfer of the broadcast license for WLIU-88.3 FM from Long Island University to PPB, clearing the way for a closed deal.
On October 16th, the FCC approved the purchase, pushing the deal into the final stages. “This is an exciting moment and very satisfying achievement,” said Mr. Smith in a statement late Tuesday, to 27East.com, a website related to South Hampton press.  “We are so grateful to everyone who worked on this, contributing and supporting our efforts.” Mr. Smith however, never returned any calls from the Pioneer to personally comment on the matter.
The final step in the process of the license purchase would include something called “public notice period and comment.” This means that the public can comment on the purchase being made of their local radio station, and whether they find it to be a negative or positive change. If any resident feels PPB is going to have a negative impact, the commissioner will reconsider the deal, and WLIU will stay operated by LIU.
As of right now, there is $637,000 in an escro account. This money came from donations: mainly from Bridgehampton National Bank, private sources, and one unknown source.  “It’s like buying a house” said Dan Cox, the station manager of WCWP.  “When the FCC sends the final notice of closing the school will get that money.”
Long Island University students and staff at WCWP, have their own thoughts on what they know of the buying and selling of WLIU.  “We just want some of the money” said senior Max Caster, the Sports Director of WCWP.  If WLIU is sold, that money in the escro account will go to Long Island University as a whole, and distribution amongst the affiliated branches and departments will be known. “I just hope from the sale, WCWP will benefi,t” said Media Arts adjunct professor, Maura Bernard.
Some students however are hoping that at least half of that escro will go to WCWP, which, although is getting an upgrade as far as the building goes, hasn’t seen upgrades in equipment in 20 years. Christina Kay, the Program Director, feels very strongly about the whole situation. “We need that escro money to fix up WCWP. We are supposed to help people get into the radio field and we have old equipment. We need at least half of the money to do the upgrading.” Kay continued to say, “I don’t think they can say this because they are staff, but I think they want it sold because it was becoming stressful to go all the way out to South Hampton all the time.” 
Elena Dimarco, the News Director of WCWP took a more emotional approach to what she thinks about PPB buying WLIU.  “I didn’t like seeing my professors stressed out, so I assumed it was a good idea.” This change of hands, which is due to be final sometime in December, wont effect Dimarco a senior who is in her last semester. However, she did have this to say, “I love this place, I would love to see it get more money and resources for the students who are continuing their education here.”
Currently, Long Island Universities Board of Trustees still own the licenses to both WLIU and WCWP.  “Public Peconic Broadcasting will own WLIU,” said Cox.  As for now, the public notice and comment period is over, so it is unsure to say whether the deal and the money is a definite.

Many students are quick to blame them not being able to find a parking spot on the administration’s lack of providing parking availability. However, if we look at this situation realistically we will realize that the school, and public safety in general, don;t have much to do with it. Public Safety administrator Mrs. Nelson tells us, “Parking on C.W. Post campus is a privilege.”  Technically speaking, it is free. Unlike various other schools, the ability to park at C.W. Post is one that will not cost us anything. As we all know, what is free will not be great. Junior Andrea Deignan tells us that before coming to Post she attended George Mason University in Virginia and that there the purchase of a parking permit was mandatory. “Even though the parking lots fill up quickly here, it’s still better than paying a yearly rate.”
“I did notice the parking for 9:30 classes is more competitive than it has been in the previous years. Normally I’d be able to get a pretty decent parking spot even if I arrived on campus closer to 9:30 than 9:00/9:15,” says senior Lisa Treanor, “But because of common hour (or increase of students) forcing more students into taking earlier classes, it’s become much more cutthroat to get a good spot.”  Lisa is a commuter and deals with the competition of getting a parking spot daily. We are left to wonder, as Lisa pointed out, is there an increase in students or is the development of common hour pressuring students to take earlier classes than they otherwise would have?
According to Mrs. Nelson the public safety officials are not going out of their way to give out tickets, they are just doing their job handing them out to those illegally parked. Reassuring or not, she does also want us to know, “Faculty is receiving the same consequences as the students for parking illegally, it is the Post community as a whole that needs to park legally to keep our campus safe, not just the students.”  When asked about the parking situation Professor Dodrill takes a different, more positive approach, “I fully understand the problem, as I’ve been here a long time, parked illegally, been ticketed, and once was towed to the pound in Security. It’s good that there’s a parking problem, because it means healthy enrollment for us all.” There are plenty of spots available for students, however a lot of them are in places many of us wouldn’t even think about parking, because of their distance.
Mrs. Nelson from Public Safety informed us that C.W. Post allows for 4,479 legally parked vehicles. Aside from driving to school there are also other options that commuters can take advantage of such as easily accessible public transportation, as well as the option of car pooling.

With the sudden increase in the use of laptops and Ipads among students in colleges and universities, school newspapers are faced with a choice: should we continue printing a paper edition or would it be more beneficial to switch to the web? The Pioneer is a publication that has the benefit of being accessible on both, paper edition and Internet. However, which C.W. Post students actually read both, and which ones have their preference?
College campuses all around the country have been hit with the Ipad craze and according to Stanford University’s website many are distributing them to students free of charge. On Long Island University campuses, all freshman and transfer students are presented with an Ipad. All students who are registered to return in the spring, and have a good academic record, are offered one at half price. This ensures that a majority of the student body has a portable device with Internet access.The Pioneer knowing this, has made moves to make a more appealing website for the publication. According to freshman Angela Formica, a Pioneer app would be the way to go. “I’m a freshman and I have an Ipad so I think that if there was an app for it then it would be easily accessible and more students would look at it.”  Academic Advisor Tracy Cleary was excited to know that there was such a consideration toward getting the Pioneer’s name out there. “I don’t know how you would get everyone’s attention about there being an online edition but personally I would look at it and think it’s a great idea, especially now with the whole Ipad thing going on.”
Students who don’t often pick up the Pioneer were also interested in knowing that it is available online, “We think that if there were more advertisements, for the online or paper editions, more students would remember to pick them up,” says seniors Anna Djup and Ashley Ingleton.  Much of the campus community seemed to be thinking along the same lines as far as there not being enough advertisement.
Although online editions seem to be an idea that many students are willing to accept and enjoy, others are not as excited. When asked whether she would prefer an online edition as opposed to paper, junior Natalia Zimnoch states, “I like to be able to pick it up in print, but that’s just because I’m old fashioned. I think it’s very convenient to have the print copy for people who prefer reading “the paper” rather than online news.”  “The Pioneer should use the online portal as a utility to give consumers value-added product,” says Professor Sandra Mardenfeld. “That way people will use both product tools.”
If print is still what you find more convenient, then look for the paper in all of the buildings on campus. However, if you find yourself leaning towards wanting the online edition of the Post Pioneer, then log onto www.postpioneer.wordpress.com

Its true, the drinking water at C.W. Post is guaranteed to be the best water. The Jericho Water district supplies the water for C.W. Post Campus as well as for the whole distribution system, which include major portions of Jericho, Old Brookville, Muttontown, and Syosset. As stated by Peter Logan, the superintendent of the Jericho Water District, “the water we provide is the best water, even better than bottled water.”
Logan assures safe and high quality drinking water. Sampling points of bacteria are done every other week, exactly the first and third week of each month for bacteria testing at C.W. Post Campus. He includes that testing for first organic chemicals and second organic chemicals are done not only for the campus, but for the whole distribution system in general. Logan mentions, “ there are over 240 categories of chemicals that exist.” The district’s assurance for safe and high quality is required by them, the New York State Health Department, as well as by the Nassau County Department of Health. “We do random sampling everyday to make sure we are pouring out the proper amount of chlorine,” Logan says.
The test samplings done by the Jericho Water District check for the amount of chlorine, and bacteria that is poured into the water. Approximately, 60 samples are completed per month. Four samplings are done coming out of the faucet overall and two samplings at the end of the year. The district does this for about 30 sites and in two steps, alternating weeks.
Logan does not comment on how the Jericho Water District water level stand compared to other water districts in Long Island but says, “we meet the standards of the Nassau County Department of Health and also meet the required samplings.” However, he does agree upon the theory of C.W. Post drinking water provided by them is the best water. “We get all the water from ground water but I cannot tell you where the water comes from.”
If that’s the case, why do C.W. Post resident students buy bottled water if it is now guaranteed that the drinking water provided is better than what is in their refrigerator? Dana Block, a sophomore resident, said, “No I wouldn’t stop buying bottled water because I believe it would taste better and that it is cleaner. I would not replace it with drinking water.” Another resident student, Kim Kessel, a junior, said the opposite, “absolutely, I would try the water,” and also mentions, “I would prefer bottled water but would drink the tap water if this is true.”
The resident students view this fact differently, but why not take advantage if C.W. Post provides water that is better than bottled? Wouldn’t that save us money from buying bottled water? It really depends on the persons’ preference and taste. However, it would not hurt to try it out and give it a chance.
The Jericho Water District is the largest and commissioned water district in New York. The water district is 37 square miles in size. The Jericho Water District started in 1923 and currently completed 85 years of business. Besides the fact that they have been in business for a while and have the experience, they also guarantee to provide the best water around.

“We have a movie theater?” This was the common response when students where asked if they noticed the movies shown in Hillwood were disappearing. The answer is yes; Hillwood Commons does have a Cinema where movies are shown. Some movies that are shown have not yet been released on DVD. The Association for Campus Programming (ACP) sponsors these movies.
ACP used to show movies every Saturday night but has since scaled back due to lack of attendance. The movies have not completely disappeared; recently they have just been changed to new settings. ACP has decided to try out different locations and events to boost attendance to the free film screenings.
Since the semester began 3 events have taken place, an outdoor showing of “Toy Story 3” during the first week of the semester, a screening of the Oscar winning “The Blind Side” and, a drive-in movie at the Pratt Center where “Grown Ups” was shown. Due to the weather, however, the first two screening were moved indoors. “ I enjoyed the movies when they were shown. I was free and it was something fun to do on campus,” says senior Jackie Levine.
A Monday Night Football event was held last week for the Jets game, food was provided and Jets tickets were raffled off. ACP president Ashley Deal says the movies will keep coming along with new events like Monday Night Football. For Junior Cori Rende these changes will not convince her to attend, “I probably still would not go, I have a busy schedule with work. It is easier to go to the movie theater. Even though it costs more I can fit in my schedule.”
ACP will judge the frequency based on attendance to these events. “Showing the movies is very expensive, we want to make sure we are spending that money on something the students will enjoy,” says Deal.
In the mean time if you are looking to fill that free movie void in your life, PTV has added more movies to their lineup. PTV plays movies at 2pm and 7pm, with the premiere film shown at 10pm. You can find the PTV lineup each week in the Pioneer.

Since this past summer, WCWP, the C.W. Post campus radio station, has been under serious construction. The station was in need of an overhaul and the building is finally getting a facelift.  New carpeting, new ceilings and new paint have been installed.  However, the renovations have taken longer than expected. Workers are currently welding together the new heating system, which has left the station without hot water or heat. In addition, WCWP is still awaiting the resources to buy new equipment for the studios.
The construction has left many students upset with the situation, including junior Raul Chavez. “It’s a joke how they start the construction and have left everything half-assed. They need new and improved equipment along with fixing the current mess they’ve created.”  Ryan Pettys, a senior at Post and WCWP staff member, said, “It’s unfair to seniors who have to deal with this. I have work that needs to be done and it’s difficult to get a studio to use.”
 
“The technical renovations that I want to accomplish haven’t been funded yet,” said Station Manager Dan Cox. “But that hopefully will come through and we’ll be able to put new digital equipment in all the studios.”  WCWP is looking to install new audio boards, microphones and computers.
The station had not been renovated since it was built in the 1960’s.  “The funding for it finally came through this year and the university agreed. Every year you put in a capital plan, large projects that you want to do. And for the past three years, I’ve been putting in that plan.”
Freshman Jason Gieser has been vocal to administration about the repairs at WCWP. Two weeks ago, Gieser went to Barbara Fowles, the head of the media arts department, and Benjamin Moore, the dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, to complain about the amount of time the renovations are taking. “The renovations have prevented me from doing multiple shows which has hindered the learning process on using the equipment,” Gieser said.
WCWP’s renovations were expected to be done this semester. With the progress behind schedule, Benjamin Moore promised the station to be done in December. Junior and WCWP Production Director Matt Soldano doesn’t buy Moore’s guarantee. “It’s just to push the situation aside for the time being,” he said.
The WCWP staff has fought through the inconveniences and is returning to a full schedule on all three of its radio services.  Business is carrying on as normal as it can. Soldano said, “It is a very encouraging sign to see familiar faces strolling through the radio station once again. The radio station only enhances our college experience and it great to see everyone in good spirits.”
Currently, the radio station has two studios ready for use by students and staff. Two other studios are being used as storage for old equipment and CD’s while another is being built.  Nonetheless, studio time comes at a premium. The studios are reserved throughout the day for classes and meetings. WCWP live programming takes up the studios later in the day.
