Dylan Silva, a senior business management major, has been the mascot of LIU Post for four years. The mascot, which is a Pioneer, cheers on the football and basketball teams at school games along with the cheerleaders.
“It’s an honor being the Pioneer,” Silva said. “I came in my freshman year and coaches approached me and asked if I would like to be the mascot. I immediately said yes, so I went to mascot camp in Boston and came back with a blue ribbon and a trophy for the university.” Silva is a volunteer at this camp and is trained on how to be a mascot.
“Every year my favorite event is going down to Cheer Nationals and participating on the cheer mat where I essentially help tell the storyline of the cheer routine,” Silva said.
Right now Silva is preparing to compete in cheerleading nationals along with the cheer teams in Daytona, Florida in April.
Silva values his time at LIU Post. “I’ve learned a lot of critical skills here. I’m lucky to be at the College of Management so I get to take what I’m learning and implement it through real-world [situations] through student-run businesses,” Silva said. “LIU has prepared me with such great leadership skills, and being the mascot has prepared me in becoming a strong leader, because a lot of kids and alumni look up to the mascot.”
Silva gave some friendly advice. “Once you start something, stick to it, don’t ever give up,” he said. “You have to have a lot of agility to be successful throughout the course of college, and always be willing and open to learning new things to really push yourself to become a better person.”
In addition, Silva considered his best advice to be self-confident. “I believe self-confidence is the key to success. Self-confidence is the reason why someone can be successful. You have to be able to believe in yourself, and if you don’t believe in yourself, then how can you have a career?” Silva said.
Silva speaks from experience. “One point [where I didn’t believe in myself] was when I was really struggling academically and I was involved in a lot on campus.” His mentor worked with him to create a plan for success. For Silva, this was beneficial. “At first I thought I would have to give something up, like an activity I’m involved in on campus. However, once I sat down with my mentor and wrote out my daily schedule I learned very quickly that I still had time for myself and I still had time to do homework. So my best word of advice is don’t give up, don’t be afraid to reach out and ask people for help as well,” Silva said.
Silva credited his coach Matthew Blanar for his success, in addition to Dr. Robert Valli dean of the college of business management, and assistant deans Raymond Pullaro, and Graziela Fusaro.
When he graduates, Silva desires to go into consulting. “I want to be able to flip companies and help companies with strategy and developing, and driving a startup company to be successful,” Silva said.
He cited his work on student-run businesses and the deans’ scholars program. “Last fall I had an idea to do the Stuff-the-Bag sale which resulted in $8000 dollars in sales,” said Silva.

There is no denying it at this point; procrastination gets to everyone at some point or another. For some reason, calling off our assignments until the last day sounds like an amazing idea until that last day comes and you end up stressed out, and pull an all nighter to get it done. So why do we always end up waiting till the last second even though we know what torture we will put ourselves through?

“I certainly do [procrastinate] sometimes, especially when it comes to studying or homework. I would go to do it, but then I would decide to push the work back a little,” Gianna Leone, a freshman health science major said.
Leone also has an idea as to why so many of us leave ourselves with very little time to finish our work, “I definitely think we procrastinate so much is because of social media. We are always using our phones,” she said.
There are a few ways to avoid procrastination, but it might take some dedication and strong will power to do it. Try organizing your work throughout the week. Do a little bit each day leading up to the day your assignment or test so when it comes to the end you won’t need to scramble to get it all done in one day.
Leone has a suggestion on how to help too, “I think the best thing to do when your doing homework or studying is to put your cell phone on silent and out of sight so your not tempted to use it,” Leone said. Separating yourself from all of your distractions can be extremely helpful in order to get your work done in a reasonable amount of time.

It’s no surprise that technology has transformed our lives. “Black Mirror,” a show formerly available only in Britain, transferred production rights to Netflix in 2016. The show presents a satirical twist on what life has become as people grow more dependent on technology. Creator and producer Charlie Brooker uses a compilation of standalone episodes to show how technology controls our lives. The latest installment aired on Netflix on Dec. 29. The wait was greatly anticipated. 
“‘Black Mirror’ is a confusing show,” Caitlin Johnstone, junior health science major, said, “But that’s why I was so excited to watch it; you do not know where the season is going to take you next.” With midterms coming up, a show like “Black Mirror” can be watched in segments and allow students time to study.
When it first hit television screens in 2011, the dark comedy achieved instant success. In 2017, the show won a British Academy Television Craft Award for best makeup and hair design, and in 2012 it won an International Emmy Award for best TV movie/mini-series. Each episode has a different cast, setting and reality. They examine the consequences of unexamined technologies: those that could exist in our own reality in the future.
The show’s title alludes to the screens people monotonously stare at throughout their daily lives. From the little black screen that fits in the palm of one’s hand to the 50-inch screens that plaster the walls of houses, escaping this ‘black mirror’ is impossible. Brooker and co-producer Annabel Jones portray these to be the most controlling aspect of our society, and it is one that we subject ourselves to every day.
Some may find the first episode of season one difficult to comprehend. Brooker and the cast, including Rory Kinnear and Lindsay Duncan, lead viewers into a world that is quite similar to our own, and provide onlookers with a fourth-wall perspective on various situations. For example, in one episode, the Prime Minister was asked to do questionable things as ransom to ensure the safety of the country’s beloved princess. All the viewer can do is sit back and watch deception unfold. The latest season hints at the irony of the audience watching the show on a black screen and that they are out of control like the characters in the anthology.
Those watching season four have become accustomed to its stand-alone episodes, meaning the viewer can choose to skip those that disinterest them and won’t miss any crucial information or shocking twists.
The episodes evoke viewers’ laughter, yet the issues they laugh at are realistic in the western world. In episode three of the second season, a cartoon character named Waldo gains popularity for his vulgar language and ends up running for a government official in a fictional English town. Aspects of the episode such as the propaganda and money used to endorse the campaign are very similar to the current standings in the United States and the election of a TV personality to the oval office.
Along with storylines that shock, grip and scare the viewer, the outstanding production of these short dramas is what carries the show. With some having a darker undertone than others, the variety makes any episode relevant to us all.

The Music Department’s Hillwood Recital series continues Wednesday, Feb. 28 at 12:30 p.m. in the Tilles Atrium with performances by three music majors. Graduate student KaraAnn Leone will perform two pieces on flute, and graduate student Laura Fallon will perform two pieces on the euphonium. Joseph Savold, a senior, will be featured as well.
Leone and Fallon are both in their final year of the master of arts program. They both attended Post for their undergraduate studies as well and have had invaluable experiences in the music program. “I wouldn’t be the musician I am today if I didn’t come to this program,” Leone said.
“Since it’s very much like a family in the department, there isn’t really competition,” Fallon said. “Everyone’s encouraging each other to improve.”
Leone has performed in front of large audiences three to four times a semester. Though her studies focused on music education, she believes there is much to be gained from performing as well. “All the performance opportunities I had as an undergrad was one of the reasons I came back to grad school here,” she said.
“It’s nerve-wracking, but it’s also really exciting because it gives you an opportunity to showcase everything that you’ve prepared,” Leone said. “This is what I’ve worked for my entire career that I’ve been here,” she said, anticipating her upcoming performance. She finds the experience of performing to be rewarding above all else and has grown as an artist because of it. “When I was a freshman, it was nearly impossible to get me onstage to perform anything solo, and now I love it,” she said. Given her introverted personality, Leone hopes to show her fellow musicians that solo performances are not as scary as they seem.
“When I get into the zone of playing, I kind of forget about my nerves,” Fallon said. Having her instrument between her and the audience makes the experience less stressful for her. Fallon, who has always enjoyed music, started playing the euphonium in elementary school. By the time she attended high school, she decided she wanted to pursue a career in music.
Fallon will perform Niccolo Paganini’s “Cantabile” and Philip Sparks’ “Fantasy,” on euphonium. She compared the brass instrument to a small tuba, and said it plays in the same range as a trombone. “You learn something new about a piece every time you play it because it’s different each time,” she said. She will also perform with the wind symphony at the Band Festival April 13. Her graduate recital is scheduled for April 26 at 8 p.m. in the Great Hall.
In addition to a movement from the “Hamburger Sonata” by C.P.E. Bach and “The Concertino for Flute and Piano” by Cecile Chaminade, Leone will be presenting a preview of the solo repertoire she will perform at her graduate recital on March 8 at 8:15 p.m. in the Great Hall. Having learned the concertino, she is excited to perform it during her last semester. Leone will also conduct a small chamber orchestra at her graduate recital. “I want [my audience] to enjoy the night so that I can enjoy it, too,” she said.
Leone aspires to teach music as a profession, and both she and Fallon believe people who denounce music as a career should view the matter in a broader perspective. “It’s not just about becoming famous, becoming an artist, I think there’s more to music than [that],” Leone said.

The latest film from Marvel Studios, “Black Panther,” did not disappoint. Chadwick Boseman plays the lead role of T’Challa, the next king of Wakanda, a ctional country. Since he is the protagonist and soon-to-be-ruler, he is supposed to be the protector of its citizens as well. The antagonist, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) went face-to-face with the T’Challa for the throne. 
T’Challa ends up losing the fight, but is granted the powers of a black panther in order to defeat the unfit king. It’s safe to say that the director did a good job simply because the movie has made millions of dollars. On the day of the films release, the films box o ce revenue was 25 million dollars.
“The film was entertaining and has a strong plot with a strong cast, but [it’s] definitely not the best Marvel movie of all time,” Jonathan Gaviria, a student at Adelphi University said.
“The film set the platform for what lies ahead in the nearby future: Avengers Infinity War,” Gaviria said. The new film will depict classic Marvel superheroes including Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, The Winter Soldier, Hulk, Spider Man, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy and more. These characters will come together and fight for the greater good of the human race.
“I think the Black Panther movie will provide more hype for the Marvel franchise,” Erick Cifuentes, a student at Farmingdale State College, said. “The fans will look forward to seeing ‘the king’ in action in Infinity War against Thanos.” It is safe to say that the Black Panther film has made its mark in the Marvel World and will ease its way into the new film Avengers Infinity War.
The buzz behind “Black Panther” within the African-American community has been very positive. Instead of racism and injustice to people of color, the movie centered around the Black Panther superhero and the Wakanda nation. Though some may perceive the movie as racist, it’s the same thing as going to see a Spiderman, Superman or Batman film, but this time, the lead character is African. Fans even wore tribal outfits to see the film.
Overall, the movie showed African-Americans loud and clear why representation matters, and that no matter what, they should be proud of their background. Wakanda forever.

Aary Bibens, senior business administration major, played his last two games as a Pioneer last weekend for the men’s basketball team. 
Bibens played a total of 101 games for the Pioneers. When asked how he felt about his one hundredth game, he said, “I felt good, I wasn’t even aware that it was game 100 for me honestly but it went by so fast. It’s bitter-sweet.” Throughout his career as a Pioneer, he accumulated over 500 points.
Biben’s time on the basketball team meant more to him than just racking up points. “I loved my time here as a Pioneer. I grew academically, athletically and as a person. I accomplished a lot and Post helped create many opportunities for the future and myself. I had a lot of fun while doing it all.” Bibens said.
While Bibens had a prosperous career on the men’s basketball team, he said this is it for him and basketball. “This is the end of the road for me basketball wise. Being a global MBA student here has set me up for many opportunities after basketball in the business world,” Bibens said.
Assistant coach, Peter Lipka, commented on Bibens’ career as a Pioneer. “Aary is a hard working kid on and off  the court. He shows a great deal of focus and determination being our only graduate student on the team. I loved working with someone as mature as Aary with a selfless priority, team first,” he said.

In its home opener on Saturday, Feb. 24, the men’s lacrosse team defeated Adelphi University, 9-8. The victory was a historic one as the Pioneers came out on top against the Panthers for the first time since 2008 at home.
Dylan Harned and Eric Donahoe, both senior mid fielders, Steven Frank, junior mid fielder, and William Snelders freshman attacker, scored two points a piece, which helped fuel the win. Bryan Ochs, junior goalie, made 14 saves on 22 shots on goal and was a key reason for the Pioneers’ hard fought victory.
The first half was a back-and-forth battle the entire way – when one team scored, the other answered. The Pioneers led 8-7 at intermission, and three minutes into the second half, Adelphi tied the score at eight points. The second of Harned’s two goals, with 7:40 in the third, was the game-winning goal as the Pioneers cracked down on defense and held Adelphi scoreless in the final 26:46 of the game.
“We left nothing in the tank,” Connor Farrell, junior face-off, who won seven face-offs, said. “Not beating Adelphi in the regular season in 10 years added extra fuel to the fire so we all trusted each other and gave it our all.”
The men’s lacrosse team began their spring season with a new head coach. Eric Wolf replaces John Jez as head coach of the men’s lacrosse team, and is finding the transition to be smooth. “It’s been great, for me I just run the culture how I do it, the program how I do it, and try to be my authentic self, and I think the boys have been pretty responsive to it and we try to make the environment an enjoyable one and the boys are ready up to come out and practice and compete on game day, so far so good.”
Heading into the new season, Wolf is confident in the team’s dynamics. “We try to be balanced on all facets of the game. We got a lot of talented guys, offensively and defensively. Collectively as a unit, if we are all doing our jobs we should be pretty successful,” he said.
“Coach Wolf’s really good, really positive and really helpful with the transition. He’s gearing us towards the right look on the season,” Donahoe said.
Wolf isn’t concerned with the upcoming competition. “I’m really not comparing ourselves to anyone else in the country. We hold to our own standards,” he said. “We’re trying to better than we were they day before. If we do that on a day-in and day-out basis, we’re going to be making progress, we’re going to be growing, and then we’ll be on the path towards being the best team we can be.”
William Snelders, freshman attacker, had his first 10 points in his collegiate debut against American International College on Feb. 17 in the season opener. “He plays well off the other guys, he’s a product of our offense working together as a unit,” Wolf said. While Wolf said he doesn’t want to call out any players, Snelders is making a name for himself early on.
“We’re all here to win. New coaches bring in some new offensive stuff and techniques. We are looking forward to carry this new year forward,” Harned said. Last year, Harned lead the team in points. “As a leader, I always got to be positive. Always leading by example, someone is always looking up to you,” he said.
With a new coach overseeing the team, some changes are being made. “Biggest change, if we’re talking on the field, a complete overhaul of what we’ve been doing, especially offensively. We cleaned the slate, got a whole new offense going in,” Harned said.
The Pioneers will look to win their third consecutive game when they begin a three-game road trip against Pace University on Saturday, March 3 in Pleasantville, NY.

The men’s basketball team landed a slim victory against the Roberts Wesleyan Redhawks in the East Coast Championship (ECC) final tournament game on Sunday, Feb. 25, securing the number four seed. The home game was a close call, with the Pioneers leading by just six points, 86-80, at the end.
It wasn’t an easy start for the Pioneers, with the Redhawks leading 5-0 at the start of the first. Kyle Doucette, sophomore forward, placed the Pioneers on the board with two points at 16:41 in the first half.
The Redhawks put up an aggressive offense as they dominated the court in the first half. The Pioneers had trouble keeping the ball in their hands, yet managed a lead of 18-11 by their first time-out. They took a 44- 30 lead at the end of the first half.
Sophomore guard Jared Rivers scored 30 point to bring the Pioneers to their win. Senior guard Kyle Taylor-McLeggan, Doucette, and freshman guard Darien Jenkins scored 12 points each. Doucette added 12 rebounds to snatch a double-double.
The Pioneers had their largest lead at 52-32 in the second half, but the Redhawks used an 18-6 run to make it a five-point game, 66-61, with 7:57 remaining. The Redhawks managed to cut the deficit down to four points, but the Pioneers held on for the six-point victory and home playoff game. This win follows a loss of 61-58 on Friday, Feb. 23, when the Pioneers celebrated Senior Day at home against Daemen College. The three seniors on the team were honored, economics major Kyle Taylor-McLeggan, criminal justice major Hunter Powell and business administration major Aary Bibens.
The seniors played well; Bibens collected nine points, McLeggan and Powell grabbed the rebounds. However, Rivers picked up 24 points with two assists.
The first half was even with a score of 29-29, 13 points coming from Rivers as he played a total of 19 of 20 minutes in the half. Just over halfway through the final half, the Pioneers were down with a score of 44-39 and Daemen College started to take off, by adding on 10 points and limiting the Pioneers to four points with just under four and a half minutes left in the game.
The Pioneers started to show some life later on. After being fouled on a three-point shot, Rivers went to the free throw line, scoring for all three shots, and cut the lead down to 60-55 in favor of Daemen College. With 19 seconds left in the game, Rivers drops a three pointer, making the score 60-58. Unfortunately, after a missed three pointer by the Pioneers, Daemen went on to win, 61-58.
The Pioneers will host Molloy College in the play-in round on Wednesday, Feb. 28 at the Pratt Recreation Center.

The women’s lacrosse team had a successful start to the spring season after defeating Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), 16- 7, at their home game on Saturday, Feb. 24. Sophomore mid fielders, Paige Sherlock and Brianna Feldman scored four goals apiece to bring the Pioneers home.
Jill LoManto, sophomore attacker, led all players with seven points, all by assists. Olivia Kirk, senior goalkeeper, made 16 saves on 23 shots on goal. Trish Brisotti, junior mid fielder, added three goals of her own, along with two goals from Alyssa Mallery, sophomore mid fielder.
“We motivated and pushed each other throughout the whole game,” Brianna Feldman, sophomore mid fielder, said. “The overall chemistry of the offense and defense came together to help us play as a unit.”
The Pioneers scored four straight goals in the opening 10:00 leading 4-0. A goal from SNHU made it 4-1, before another four goal surge from the Pioneers. The halftime score was 9-3, and in the second half, the Pioneers closed the game on a 7-4 run for the win.
The women’s lacrosse team is facing some changes this season. “We’ve been doing a lot of prep work, working a lot on fundamentals and concepts, change our mentality approaching the game,” Meghan McNamara, head coach, said.
Two rule changes began for the 2018 season: free movement, which allows the players to move on the field freely like a majority of sports, and the addition of the possession clock for Divisions II and III, which Division I had for the 2017 season.
“It creates a very upbeat, uptempo game. It’s back and forth, the way the game should be played. Adding the free movement on top of that – it’s never-ending and it’s great,” McNamara said. “It puts a lot of honess on the players to understand what the situations are, how to control the tempo. It’s changed a lot but it brought back the love of the game and the speed of the game that we enjoy to play,” she said.
McNamara laid out some short-term goals for the team to improve on this season. “We know we are going to be faced with a lot of adversity, different situations, getting comfortable with the rule changes and finding ourselves. We obviously want to compete, we want to do well and we want to put ourselves in a position to compete in the ECC championship.”
The Pioneers return to action on Wednesday, Feb. 28 when they host Bentley University at 3:00 p.m.
