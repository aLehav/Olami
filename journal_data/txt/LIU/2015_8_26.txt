Tia-Mona Greene, the Pioneer’s Photography Editor from 2013-2015, plans to pursue her masters degree in higher education with a focus on student affairs, with the goal of working in a university Student Life department. She enjoyed working on the Pioneer for two years. It gave her a chance to do what she loves, which is photography, as well as to give other photographers more opportunities. She said that being able to provide her staff of photographers with the chance to continuously be published in an official newspaper “was the best feeling anyone could experience.”
