On Saturday, Jan 21, two Freshman from LIU Post other students in a joining a march of over 400,000 individuals in New York City. Anna Gwaltney and Samantha Resnick, both freshman musical theatre majors participated in the march, waved signs and chanted for what they both called “a very important cause”.
“I went to the march because there’s a lot happening right now in the political spectrum that we can’t control, so we protested,” Gwaltney said. “The protest was to educate people and help lawmakers understand that their actions affect women and girls throughout many generations.”
The New York City women’s march was one of several women’s marches that took place around the country on January 21. An estimated 700,000 participated in the march in Los Angeles, the LA march was the largest of all women’s marches this past weekend. According to Womensmarch.com, a major organizer of the marches, 444 women’s marches have taken place since the inauguration of President Trump.
“It was more intersectional than people think. Even though it was a women’s march it was a protest for the rights of all,” Resnick said. “It was a huge statement on many things that people are trying to ignore, for example they say contraception should not be covered by insurance but that would box many out of having contraceptives,” she added. Resnick said the goal of the march “was asking for respect”.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio applauded the marches leadership and the New York Police Department “A big thank you to the organizers and the men and women of the NYPD for keeping 400,000 New Yorkers safe during today’s #WomensMarchNYC.” Chirlane McCray, wife of de Blasio, spoke at the NYC march emphasizing that “New York is the birthplace of the women’s movement. The home of the women’s rights movement. And that will never change.”
Gwaltney and Resnick had spirited responses about what the march accomplished. “I think a big part of the march was to show that we are united and are going to fight for each other,” Resnick said. Gwaltney added “it was successful in showing the US lawmakers that we are watching”.

After a two-year absence, the Cosenza Prize returns to Post this semester to celebrate the non-fiction work of undergraduate writers. The prize originated in 2003 after the sudden death of teacher Joseph Cosenza. Sponsored by the Writing Center and the Dean’s office of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, students are allowed to submit writing that is five to 10 pages long and is either argumentative, analytical, a research paper, creative, or an essay.

Mary Pigliacelli, the director of the Writing Center and an adjunct professor of English, is excited that the Cosenza Prize is returning. “Everyone at the Writing Center is in the trenches with the students when it comes to writing. It’s nice that this contest celebrates and recognizes writing and is able to build a community awareness for it.”
Pigliacelli stated that the Writing Center does not usually see the revisions students make to their work, so this contest allows them to see how the students have improved from their first draft to their final draft. “Fiction and poetry often get celebrated at the Poetry Center but non-fiction is usually not recognized. We try to create a culture of writing on campus at the Writing Center and it’s great to be a part of it and to raise awareness of writing across campus,” Pigliacelli said.
The contest is currently running through Friday, April 14, and will award $100 to the winner. Entries have to be dropped at the Writing Center in Humanities 202 and the winner’s name will be posted outside the room on May 5. The submission must include two copies and can be either hand written or located online. Students also have to include a cover sheet with their contact information, title of the work, and where it can be accessed if it is located online. For more information, contact the Writing Center at 516-299- 2732 or email Post-wc@liu.edu.

Destiny Diggs, the founder and CEO of Young Black Successful, at the age of 21 has come a long way with her new online business. In 2014, during her freshman year at LIU Post, she came up with the idea of opening a business that would help college graduates find jobs. After hearing friends at WCWP saying they were afraid that they would not find jobs, Diggs felt inspired to do something. “People should have a way out of their current situation post graduation,” Diggs said.
Diggs did not think the idea of opening a business would ever happen, but she felt the need to help. Diggs wanted to open a business solely to help members of the African American community find jobs right out of college. One day, that all changed because of a “Forbes” magazine. Diggs read an article about Wall Street and how being in the black meant having money. On that day, she decided to name her business Young Black Successful, a title with dual meaning that could be for all races. Her customers can either be young, African American, and successful or young, have a lot of money, and successful, whichever way you feel the meaning fit you.
Throughout 2015, Diggs went into a deep thought process and felt she needed to experience different things in order to figure out Young Black Successful’s mission statement. She began to go on a hunt for mentors who could help these graduates find jobs. Diggs did a lot of radio interviews in the Delaware Valley area, which is where she is based out of, and went to many career events to network and gain support.
In late 2015, Diggs felt that her business was on its way. She applied for an LLC, which is a limited liability company. She then purchased a domain name for her website, www.youngblacksuccessful.org and began building her team. After searching for hardworking professionals, she hired Steven Hargrove as web designer, Chris Schley to do the businesses PR, Aliyah Dukes as event coordinator, Gary Diggs, who is also Diggs father as CFO (office of finance), and Malachi Matcho as photographer. Schley began to book radio interviews for Diggs at many radio stations in her area such as WTMR in Camden, NJ and FMHDMS Radio in Philadelphia, Pennsylviana. Diggs also made up a professional flyer], took promotional pictures, made social media accounts on all networks, and designed business merchandise.
On Aug. 1, 2016, Diggs launched the Young Black Successful website and held a launching party at a jazz club called Warmdaddy’s in Philadelphia. Over 300 people came to show their support for Diggs and her new business. Diggs father, Gary Diggs, who is the CFO of the company, has been so proud of his daughter and her business. “Destiny Diggs and Young Black Successful is not just another jump start business, but a foundation coined on positioning people to tap into their own inspired talents and display greatness for generations to come,” he said.
Since Diggs launched Young Black Successful, she has gotten a lot of criticism and hate from friends and people on social media, but has kept her head held high. She has lost many friends who don’t agree with her company and been called racist numerous times. Some people from the African American community were disappointed with her because they felt the business was no longer for only their people as it originally was supposed to be, but now for everyone. Diggs had to also give up opportunities for her business, such as a chance to teach dance to children in Korea over the summer.
The mentors at Young Black Successful have been working their hardest to not only help new college graduates find jobs, but also help high school students find internships. There are currently 52 mentors with the number still growing. These mentors have different professions that allow customers of Young Black Successful get the help they need. Benjamin Gerdes, a broadcasting professor, is one of these mentors for Young Black Successful and help customers who want to be in the broadcasting field. Simone Malone, an internet radio host from Philadelphia who is another mentor, recently helped high school senior, Troi Henson get an internship at the Internet radio station, FMHDMS Radio in Philadelphia. Since the launch of Young Black Successful, many things have happened. The businesses clothing line that is available online, which consists of a t-shirt, sweatshirt, two crew necks, hat and flip flops, has been receiving orders from all over the U.S. The business has also been doing professional photo shoots with models wearing the merchandise. One of the models for Young Black Successful, Amber Castle, was inspired by this business and knew she had to be apart of it. She said, “I didn’t want the money for modeling, I just wanted to be a part of a brand I like.”
As for the future of Young Black Successful, Diggs is working on a pop up fashion show that should happen sometime in the first week of March in New Jersey. New merchandise is being added next month, and adjustments are being made to the website to help people network more efficiently.
Diggs said, “I thank God that I was chosen for this because I feel it was part of my purpose and destiny. I didn’t choose this, it chose me.” Young Black Successful has helped over 30 people with the help of their mentors. After Diggs graduates, she is hoping to find an office for Young Black Successful instead of basing her business solely online.

The student band Fox Hollow was among the performers at the Music Industry Club’s first Saturday Sounds At Tilles Center on Saturday, Jan. 21 in the Tilles Center Atrium. Michaella Bowne, the Vice President of the Music Industry Club, said this concert “was part of a new series at Tilles meant to appeal to students with student and local performers.” The night also included performances by indie rock bands Figure Eight, RoswellDebacle, and Grayling, emo bands based near New York. Grayling is from Philadelphia, RoswellDebacle is based in New Jersey, and Figure Eight is based in Syosset.
After performances by Figure Eight and RoswellDebacle, Philadelphia native Lexi Campion stepped on stage as the only member of Grayling at the show. As the organizers of the event, Fox Hollow invited each band to perform at the concert. Mike Themistocleous, a senior film major and lead singer of Fox Hollow, invited Campion after seeing her open for Julien Baker and her band Forrister last Sept. at the Music Hall of Williamsburg. Campion was alone for this performance, although she is usually joined by the other members of her band. Despite being alone on stage, Campion was not deterred, as she put on a powerful performance for the audience between singing and playing all of the verses on the guitar. Campion was very calm, despite stepping on stage only minutes after arriving late to the concert. During her performance, multiple audience members stepped up to the stage and stood in silence, completely focused on her singing. All of the songs Campion played were new and are not on her latest album, “Everything That Burns,” which was released on April 15, 2016. After Campion’s five songs, Fox Hollow took the stage.
Fox Hollow a band of four college students, includes two Post students, Themistocleous and Daniel Delucia, a senior music major. Joseph Oliveto, a junior business major at SUNY Old Westbury and Christ Swift, a junior at Queens College, are the other members. Themistocleous was energetic from the start and urged the audience to step right up to the stage like at a rock concert. He ran out into the crowd of 60 several times to give hugs and take pictures. His enthusiasm spread to the other members of the band, as they seemed to improve with each song. After the show, Themistocleous said that the band performs a ritual before each show to ensure that they remain at a high energy level. “We all get together and say ‘energy’ to each other over and over again and then we rapidly fire back and forth the set list for the night to each other.”
Fox Hollow received a standing ovation from the crowd and was called back on stage to perform one last song. This curtain call gave Fox Hollow a new life, resulting in their best song of the night. Themistocleous brought the audience on stage, leaving few people in the crowd at the end of the set. Before playing at this concert, Fox Hollow had performed a two-week tour, in Tennessee, Virginia, Boston, and Washington D.C. Themistocleous said the tour was the “greatest experience,” even though they had a previous, small tour in Sept. to Binghamton, New York.
Last May, Fox Hollow performed at a St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital benefit show at a Bethpage bar called Mr. Beerys. Themistocleous would like to see the band continue to take part in fundraisers for different causes.
The Music Industry Club promotes local musicians both on and off campus and runs several events throughout the year, including a singing competition called Phenomenon and a music festival called MIC Fest. The Jan. 21 concert raised $200, all of which was donated to Planned Parenthood. The next concert will take place on Thursday, Feb. 23.

On Friday, Jan. 20, students in the digital game design and development major gathered in the Winnick Student Center to prepare for this year’s annual Global Game Jam, a 48-hour game development event that takes place at jam sites across the world over the same two-day period. The event is open to any participant over the age of 18, students and non-students alike.
This was the campus’ second year acting as a jam site for the event, at which participants are given a theme and have to develop a game around it in any genre or platform. Usually, the games created in the 48-hour time span are computer games for the PC or Mac. While games for other platforms can be created, they rarely are due to their long development cycles.
The participants are encouraged to come into Global Game Jam with an open mind so they are able to form a practical idea when their theme is revealed. This year, students learned the theme on Jan. 20 at 5 p.m. and had until Jan. 22 at 5 p.m. to finish their games.
Andrew Wallace, an assistant professor of digital game design and development, oversaw the event on campus. Forty participants took part in the jam this year, a fair increase from the 30 who did last year.
Wallace recounted, “This is a great experience for our students because having a game under your belt is very important for the students in the digital game design and development program; many students in the program haven’t made a complete game before, so this event gives them that experience. Just about all of the folks in attendance were LIU students. There were one or two non-Post students at the jam who were friends with somebody who was there.”
After gathering in the Long Island Room in the Winnick Student Center, the participants in Winnick and across the world learned that this year’s theme was “waves.” While the Long Island Room was available to the participants for the entire 48 hours, they were not required to stay the entire time and could leave to sleep and eat. Eric Guadara, a graduate student in the digital game design program and his team created a game called “Pelt ‘Em” about “a restaurant franchise mascot who gets stuck in a ball pit and is swarmed with screaming children.” Guadara said that “the player has to pelt the children with balls or die trying. Since the theme is waves, our group came up with the idea after thinking about waves of enemies in games like Call of Duty zombies. Someone else made a joke about a ball pit so we decided to put that in the game as well.”
Sophomore digital game design major John Mendez also took part in the event. His team created a game called “Combats.” He described it, “In this game you play as a bat and use your sonar to navigate a maze. This is a competitive multiplayer game where you fight to get points in a maze and compete against other players.”
At the end of the 48 hours, teams around the world upload their games and put together a short presentation on what they had created. While prizes have been given out in the past, Wallace explained, “We decided not to this year as we wanted to encourage experimentation and creativity as opposed to competition.”

The men’s lacrosse team’s spring season is quickly approaching, with the first two preseason games scheduled for Feb. 3 and 6 in St. Leo and Lackland, Fla.
Coach John Jez is entering his eleventh season as head coach of the Pioneers. His team is ranked seventh in the U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association’s preseason poll for division II lacrosse teams. This year’s defense consists of many returning starters, including four All Conference defensemen; but the offense is very young with about 14 new faces, which Jez describes as “new territory.”
“There are a lot of young guys and new faces compared to last year, but that’s not a bad thing,” senior middle Nick Zebouni explained. “They bring a great energy every day and are fitting into our system nicely.”
Coach Jez hopes that the veterans on the team will take the hard work and success from last season and teach the new players “what’s needed to play for a conference championship.”
Junior middle, Kris Alvarado, is one of those returning who has been helping integrate the newcomers into the team. “We try to keep the morale high with the younger guys and keep their confidence up so they can play to their full potential,” he said. Alvarado said that many of the younger players are “beginning to find their grove” and gain more confidence as the first games of the season approach. The players cut their holiday break a little short, and returned to campus on Jan. 10 to start training.
The first week of regular season competition is shaping up to be a challenging one as the Pioneers open on Feb. 18 by hosting third ranked Merrimack, the team that was responsible for two of their four losses last year. That game will be immediately followed by a tough match against eighth ranked Adelphi on Feb. 25. With six nationally ranked teams in the East Coast Conference, the Pioneers will have a very challenging schedule.
“It’s not an easy schedule but that’s what you need to make the conference tournament,” Coach Jez said. The Pioneers have won the last three East Coast Conference Championships and hope to keep that streak alive this year.
Their upcoming trip to Florida could be just what they need to kick off a successful season. The Pioneers will face Saint Leo University and Florida Southern College, two teams that are both ranked each year and play in very strong conferences as well.
“It’ll be nice to get out of the cold and play two games without dealing with the elements and just focusing on our play on the field,” Jez explained.
“Our little goals [throughout the season] are just to get better every day and set a foundation for the future with this group and continue the success of this program,” Jez said.
The Pioneers will return to Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium on Feb. 18 with a home opener against the Merrimack Warriors at 12 p.m.

The women’s swim team squared off against Kutztown University at the Pratt Recreational Center Saturday, Jan. 28. The team won their last home match of the 2016-2017 season with ease, beating Kutztown 126-115. The Pioneers won 13 of 14 races on the evening, advancing their record to 3-4.
Sophomore Karis Fuller stole the show, beating her own personal record and Pioneer record in the 1,650-yard freestyle. Fuller swam the 66 laps in just 17:20.04 besting her previous record of 17:22.63. “It feels great and pretty sweet to have broken it,” Fuller said after the race.
When asked how Fuller prepares for such a long and tiring race, she answered, “It’s the coaching staff making me hit my times in practice and making me push myself.” Her regiment is different from some sprinters; she doesn’t do as many explosive workouts, but more long-term exercises such as power cleans.
Junior Laura Bendfeldt and sophomore Catilin Johnstone finished first in both their races. Bendfeldt won the 100-yard freestyle and the 100-yard backstroke, coming in at 52.16 and 1:07.92. Johnstone finished first in both the 50-yard freestyle coming in at 24.92 and the 200-yard breaststroke at 2:26.59.
Sophomore Eline Swenson finished first in the 500-yard freestyle coming in at 5:23.18. Swenson also finished the 1,650-yard freestyle in second place coming in at 18:21.08. Sophomore Elin Kvanemar came in first in the 100-yard backstroke at 59.69 and finished second in the 200-yard backstroke at 2:08.41.
Freshman Tove Sparman swam the 200-yard freestyle in 1:54.72 to place first, and finished second in the 100-free coming in at 52.93. In the 200- yard individual medley junior Jacqueline Tonn took first place with a 2:16.27 time. Tonn placed second in the 200-yard backstroke and 100-yard coming in at 2:28.94 and 1:08.71.
Freshman Cassie St. Angelo won the 100-yard butter fly at 1:02.27 and placed third in the 200-yard backstroke at 2:18.52. Freshmen Jessica Argelander came in second in the 50-yard free at 26.56.
In the relay events, the team of Bendfeldt, Johnstone, Sparrman and sophomore Brianna LiCausi who came in third in the 100-yard freestyle at 53.54, and first in the 200-yard medley relay at 1:46.92.
In the 200-yard freestyle relay, the team of Sparrman, St. Angelo, Argelander and freshmen Elizabeth Law finished first with a time of 1:41.81
“Very excellent job, very proud for our last home match of the year,” said head coach Michaell Travers about his team’s performance Saturday.
The Pioneers look to defend their four year championship run at the metropolitan conference at Rutgers University on Feb 17 through Feb 19. Travers said he is “very confident in defending our title based on the whole year we had, very confident.”
First, Travers will take his team into Manhattan to swim in the New York University Invitational at the Palladium Athletic Facility on Feb. 3 and 4.

The Pioneer kickline squad has been around since 2010, but until recently, it was just considered a club. Last year, they became an official spirit team along with the dance team and cheerleading squad, but the newcomers are facing some challenges as they try to expand their team.
Currently, the team does not have an official coach. Katelin Townsend, who is also the head cheerleading coach and a success coach, is voluntarily serving as a temporary advisor to the team, and is looking for volunteers to fill the coaching position. The team’s two captains, Fallon Boyle and Erica Bergen, are in charge of running the team.
“We choreograph our own dances and organize everything we do,” Boyle, a senior public relations major, said.
“Our biggest challenge is definitely not having a coach as it is hard to run every aspect of the team while being a full time student,” Bergen, a junior arts management major, said.
Kickline, cheer and dance are three separate spirit teams, which became an official part of Post athletics in 2014. According to Boyle, kickline is different because they incorporate three different aspects in their performances: dance, pom, which is similar to some cheerleading routines, and kickline.
“Kickline is definitely unique,” Boyle said. “We always have one long kickline that is visually pleasing to watch. Think of the Rockettes. That’s exactly what we do.”
The team performs during football halftime shows and basketball games as well as some school events like Midnight Madness and Relay for Life.
Kickline held official tryouts on Jan. 22 and is still looking to expand. They currently have six active members, but are looking to build a team of 12 members. Along with practicing new routines, the girls have been working to build campus awareness of the team and have created accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @liupostkickline.
Boyle said that being a part of the team has been a great experience because not only has she met new friends, but it is great to be a part of a spirit team and cheer-on other Pioneer athletes.
“I’ve been dancing since I was little so to be able to continue in college is an amazing experience,” Boyle said.
According to Bergen, they plan on holding another tryout session at the end of the semester or over the summer to build their fall team.

Head Coach Meghan McNamara and the women’s lacrosse team hopes to combine new talent with the experience of veteran players to attain the ultimate goal of another national title.
The Pioneers have captured the national title four times since the year 2001, including two consecutive years in 2012 and 2013. Last year, the Pioneers ended their season as East Coast Conference Champions with an overall record of 17-4, but a loss to the second ranked Le Moyne Dolphins eliminated them from the National Championship. Coach McNamara said the end of last season “left us hungry for more and determined.”
Junior goalkeeper Olivia Kirk, who received many accolades last year including ECC Goalkeeper of the Year and IWLCA All-American First Team, is looking forward to what this season has in store for her team. “We have a very talented group of girls,” Kirk explained. “The team goal for the year is to put 100 percent into everything we do in hopes of it leading up to a national championship.”
This year’s team welcomed 14 newcomers, which makes up 50 percent of the team. Coach McNamara described her team as having “great energy and drive” and being very close knit.
“Our upperclassmen are very supportive of the younger players that keep coming in because they were them once,” McNamara explained.
Senior defensive player, Brianna Gibbons, is one of those upperclassmen who is helping out with the new players, and she is confident in her team’s ability to win this year. “We definitely have a young team, but I think it’s worked out in our favor,” Gibbons explained. “It has been a seamless transition with the freshmen.”
The Pioneers are taking advantage of this uncharacteristically warm January weather as they start their preseason training, which includes practicing six days a week for about six weeks. This first week is used to “get back into the swing of things” as players return from the holiday break, and many players look to return to the field after recovering from previous injuries.
According to McNamara, gaining confidence and taking it day by day will be key in reaching success this year. She said that communication and encouragement are crucial in developing the confidence her team needs to reach their full potential.
“It’s about them understanding the game and enjoying it,” McNamara explained.
The Pioneers will return to the field for a scrimmage match on Feb. 11 against Division 1 program Sacred Heart, but they will play their first regular season game at home against Pace University on Feb. 25. Kaitlin Gaghan, a three-year member of the Pioneer lacrosse team, will return to Bethpage Credit Union Stadium for the first time since graduating in 2016 as an assistant coach for Pace University. McNamara is excited for Gaghan to return to what used to be her home turf adding, “it’s amazing to have our alumni coaching collegiately.”
McNamara said the first game is an important one because “it’s the rst opportunity to see who we really are, how we compete, and where we stand.” Additional goals for the season include developing the team, keeping focused on what they can control and taking it day-by-day and one step at a time.
