The new LIU Enrollment Services department, which was created this semester, aims to address the issues associated with academic, registration and financial concerns. The offices are located in Kumble Hall.
Much like the new LIU Promise program, the university will cross-train the LIU Enrollment Services staff in registration, bursar, financial aid, and academic advising areas. However, the Enrollment Services department will work with continuing undergraduate, graduate, and transfer students, while LIU Promise works solely with freshmen. This will allow students to have a single place to go to for all their concerns, instead of going to different offices and advisors.
“This new department serves as a ‘one-stop shop’ where students can have [a] majority of their needs met in a single location by an integrated and cross-trained staff,” said Jackie Nealon, chief of staff and vice president of Enrollment, Campus Life and Communications. “Each staff member will have a specific caseload of students with whom they will come to know very well and be able to serve in a 360 degree way. This aligns LIU with the best practices and traditions across the country, recognizing that students are best serviced with an all-in-one solution.” This new model was introduced across LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn this year.
“Students will be assigned to an Enrollment Services Counselor. Whenever possible, we will try to keep a student with their original advisor, but that may not always be feasible,” Nealon said. “Our primary goal is to ensure that seamless service and advising is provided to all of our students,” she added.
“The changes sound like a great idea,” said John Pantaleone, a senior Computer Science major. “This should eliminate the awkwardness of running around Kumble Hall and will make talking to all of your advisors a lot easier. I wish they had this when I first started going to Post,” he said.
“I think this change is good in a way,” said Johnny DiMartino, a junior Computer Science major. “It provides one person you can go to for all your needs in regards to enrollment.” DiMartino also showed concerns for the employees that may lose, or have already lost, their jobs due to this change. “On the other hand, it takes away jobs from multiple people in order to consolidate everything in one place,” DiMartino added.
“I think this is a much needed change at the school. Year after year, I call and get directed to four different people and by the time I reach the last person, my problem still is not resolved. This definitely gives me hope that LIU Post is improving in areas where they were lacking,” said Kristin Napolitano, a senior Criminal Justice and Psychology major.
The new Enrollment Services office is currently up and running in Kumble Hall. However, reorganization and cross training is ongoing.
“The old bursar, advising and financial aid offices are not being replaced. They are being enhanced and improved to make students services stronger. The functions that those important offices perform will continue to be a priority,” said Nealon.
She also mentioned that there’s going to be a welcome desk when you first enter Kumble Hall, to help guide students where they need to go to address their concerns. “Of course during the early days, we will really appreciate [students’] patience as the team continues to cross-train and use their new skills.”

From May 20 through June 9, Willie Hiatt, assistant professor of Latin American History at LIU Post, will take a group of students on an educational journey through Cuzco, Peru. The course, HIS 189, is a three-credit, study-abroad course taught by Hiatt, and is designed to engage students in a historical and thematic understanding of Andean history.
According to the course syllabus: The study abroad course introduces you to important themes and concepts in Andean history, with a particular emphasis on the pre-Colombian world (1470- 1530), European contact and indigenous resistance (1530-70), and contemporary Cuzco (the rediscovery of Machu Picchu in 1911 to today).
For Hiatt, teaching this course is a new experience. “This is the first time I have offered the course,” Hiatt stated. When it comes to students and where they would study and eat, Hiatt provided examples of what’s in store during the expedition. “The group lodges, dines, and studies at La Casa Campesina, a quaint and rustic conference center in the heart of Cuzco. Using that as our base, we will make excursions to museums, pre-Colombian archaeological sites, and Spanish colonial churches in and around the area,” he said.
Hiatt stated that there are benefits to his summer course in Peru. “First is price: Thanks to the LIU tuition discount and forgivable travel loan, the price is around $2,600, which is less than taking a summer course here on campus; and second is context: Besides a rigorous classroom component in the beautiful Andean city of Cuzco, the course includes multiple trips to archeological sites, including a two-day trip to Machu Picchu,” Hiatt said. “We all know and love Humanities Hall, but the ‘lost’ city of the Incas is tough competition.”
“The third benefit is credit flexibility. The course works as a history elective or core requirement, an Honors elective, and, with prior approval, a Political Science elective or core requirement. Fourth is thematic flexibility: Although the course is listed as HIS 189, ‘Andean
History, Culture, and Politics,’ I have designed the class broadly to appeal to students with diverse interests in archaeology, geography, art history, political science, tourism, literature, and film. The class has something to offer most everyone,” he said.
About 15 students are listed as tentatively going,and another 12 students have expressed interest, according to Hiatt. Students who are interested in joining Hiatt this summer can reach him at willie.hiatt@liu. edu.
“Recruitment has been an adventure in itself. I probably have sent 500 emails the last few months, and I’ve completely exhausted my file of stock llama photos for campus flyers. I held informational meetings at Post and Brooklyn for about 30 students. After LIU Global posted the course on its Facebook page, students at the China, India, Costa Rica, and New Zealand centers inquired about the trip [as well].”
Hiatt explained his interest in taking Post students to study abroad. “An essential goal of a liberal education is to enhance global perspectives. I did not travel or study abroad as an undergrad, but when I went to France for five months at the age 25, it completely changed my life and launched my academic career. I want to share that experience with LIU students who have always wanted to travel but couldn’t or have never entertained the idea of going abroad. I’ve seen students
who returned to Post after a summer or semester abroad, and their confidence and excitement is remarkable. They return with a glow,” he said.
Evelin Rodriguez, a junior History major, is excited to study abroad in Peru. She holds Hiatt in good regards. “I am very excited about the study abroad program in Peru. I’m glad Professor Hiatt decided to teach the class this year. I know Peru has a large indigenous population, so I would like to learn about their rich history,” she said. “I know the class will go on several outings. This will be a great opportunity to see the landscape and to speak with the locals about their culture.”

The Student Body, Hillwood’s fashion boutique, held its first sale on March 3, during common hour. The aim of the sale was to raise awareness on campus about the new boutique, and to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for students and others. Clothing, shoes, and accessories were on sale in order to make room for the spring inventory.
Tamir Dayya, manager of The Student Body, and his student associates planned the event. “The event was about creating an atmosphere for people to relax and get reintroduced to The Student Body. We also took feedback and recommendations from students and restored our inventory with items that students requested. It’s about moving out our old inventory, and bringing in a new one,” Dayya said.
The store was packed with about 50 people, as purchases were being made. Music filled the air as DJ Lomo of the campus radio station, WCWP, helped create an ambiance for shoppers.
Employees were excited about the changes being made. “A main reason we held the event is because we’re trying to bring in new, exciting stuff, so we need more room,” said Antonette Daure, a sophomore Forensic Science major who is a sales associate at the boutique.
Lucie Chrastecka, a sophomore Pre-Medical Biology major who also works as a sales associate, gave hints on the new inventory. “We have some new items such as big handbags and different, colorful clothing, maybe even some sunglasses,” she said.
Nicole Urbonas, a senior International Business major who works as the merchandising director, said that the store is full of new clothes for the spring. “We recently went to the Javitz Center in New York City for a trade show and selected a vast amount of new, spring- oriented merchandise,” she said.
“The sale was promoted through flyers on campus and social media,” Daure said. “[I] Can’t say for sure how many students came out, but it was busy that day,” she added. Students are not the only ones shopping in the boutique. “We have a wide range of persons come in, from students to professors, to Aramark employees, so it’s pretty much even in regards to who shops the most,” Daure said.
“In terms of planning, this event has been ongoing for a few weeks, seeing as we want to get the new clothes out and introduce new products as soon as possible.”
No other upcoming events are planned at The Student Body this semester.
“We’re not entirely sure about any upcoming events just yet, but we’ll definitely let everyone know before hand if we do plan to have something similar,” Chrastecka stated.
The Student Body is open from 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday to Friday, for the remainder of the spring semester.

The Nassau Federal Credit Union (NEFCU) had an office on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, until Dec. 2013. This NEFCU branch allowed students to cash paychecks free of charge, and provided on-campus banking services for staff and faculty. As of March 14, NEFCU’s new location is 90 Northern Boulevard, Greenvale, N.Y.
Many students were unaware that the bank was once on campus. I didn’t know much about NEFCU. “I didn’t bank there. I just knew it was upstairs in Hillwood. I think the international students used it,” said Nicole Zaccone, a sophomore Psychology major.
Not all students used the bank, but there was still a good amount of students who used the bank when it was located on campus. “A lot of my peers cashed their checks at that bank even though they did not have an account there. I still bank with NEFCU, and heard they were moving. The teller told me that I should start getting direct deposits because they were moving and I wouldn’t be able to cash my checks on campus any longer,” said Tatiana Plunkett, a freshman Psychology major.
“I know NEFCU closed, but I believe the new location is close enough to campus for students to be able to bank there with ease,” said Rita Iosefson, a senior Child Education major.
“With our new branch, we will be able to offer extended services to the community. NEFCU will continue to offer surcharge-free ATM withdrawals to both students and faculty of LIU Post,” said Valerie Gargugilo, vice president of Marketing for NEFCU. “Branch features will include video tellers that will allow bankers to access tellers through a camera service similar to Skype. The move will not be cost effective, but we want to serve everyone in the community.”
The NEFCU ATM machine located in Hillwood Commons will remain in service. Alerie Tirsch, director of Student Life and Leadership Development, provided additional information on how students can travel from campus to the new NEFCU location in the Wheatley Plaza shopping center. “There is currently a shuttle [bus] that goes from the campus to the Pathmark shopping center where NEFCU is now located,” Tirsch said. Shuttle bus schedules are available at the Hillwood Commons Information Desk.

WCWP, LIU Post’s resident radio station, held a “Kickoff to Spring Break” event on March 6, outside of Hillwood Commons during common hour. Members of WCWP’s Public Relations and Promotions departments ran the event under the direction of Dan Cox, the station’s general manager.
Despite the frigid weather, a DJ table and a game table were set up outside the Commons, inviting students to get excited about the break with music, dance contests, and fun giveaways. Chris Maffei and Zachary Parker, WCWP radio disc jockeys, spoke to passersby’s via microphone and distributed WCWP t-shirts and colorful plastic necklaces to those who joined in on the celebration. Students played with blow-up beach volleyballs.
The station has been trying to boost its presence on campus this semester in particular. “We have a YouTube channel, Mywcwp, where students can watch footage from the events that we sponsor and see what we’re doing,” said Samantha Augustine, a sophomore Business Management major, and a member of the station’s PR team. “We always have our Midday Madness radio shows during common hour. Listen in on 89.7 FM [or online at mywcwp.org].” The YouTube channel also features footage of the station’s events as they’re happening live.
“Social media is definitely a big part [of it],” said Christina Kay, an alumni of the Class of 2011 in Electronic Media, who works as the Assistant General Manager and Program Director of WCWP. “We’re on the air 24/7,” Kay said. “Events like this get our name out there. We try to do an event every month. It’s been kind of hard with so many snow days and cancellations. This is the first one of the year. It’s just a little event for us, but we’ll do concerts, and we’ll bring comedians this semester and next.”
The spring-themed event came at a time when a recent surge of snowstorms and campus closings diminished student morale. “I don’t even want to come to school because it’s so cold,” said Errol Nicholson, a sophomore Film major, as he walked away with a free WCWP t-shirt. “I wish I was lying, but I’m not. As a commuter, I never look forward to driving in the cold.” Students who participated in the event were passersby walking between Hillwood Commons and Humanities Hall. Approximately 100 students showed up to join in the fun.
WCWP’s live broadcasts can be heard on their site at mywcwp. org, FM station 89.7 on- and off-campus (a 20 mile radius), and channel 95 in the dorms. The station will hold future on-campus events later in the semester, including a sports panel broadcast in The End Zone on March 27. More information about upcoming events and broadcasts can be found on their Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, all under the moniker mywcwp.
