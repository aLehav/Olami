Dear Readers,
As a public service, the Pioneer publishes a Crime Blotter so that students, faculty and staff are made aware of any incidents that have occurred on campus. At the beginning of the fall semester, a Pioneer reporter went to the office of public safety to obtain any recent information. The last incident logged in the book was from April.
The Pioneer’s assistant news editor returned to the office of public safety last week, and was told that there were two incidents since, it was unclear if the crime blotter had been updated. A federal law called the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act requires all federally funded colleges and universities to make publicly available a log of crimes that have occurred on campus. Stay tuned for further updates. Following is what the office of public safety provided to the Pioneer:
On September 7, public safety responded to a report in Hillwood Commons regarding a lost car key. The car was a rental from Enterprise. The key has not been found.
On September 8, a fire alarm went off in Lodge A, room 201. The Roslyn Fire Department arrived at the scene. The alarm was due to a smell in the room, but the cause was unknown. The Fire Department reset the alarm.
The Pioneer’s mission is to inform the LIU Post community about news occurring on campus. The staff works very hard to put out a weekly newspaper 12 times during the fall and spring semesters. As the editor of the news section, it has come to my attention multiple times this semester that members of the administration simply will not respond when asked for comments or quotes. Other times, my staff has been ignored completely.
This semester we have faced a number of challenges with administration and other sources. One of our editors was told that he could not take a picture of the new Tilles Center Director unless the story was approved in advance by the dean of students. Members of the Tilles Center stated that they could not speak to the Pioneer, and referred questions to the dean of students. Students working in the office of campus life have stated that they have been told by administration they are not allowed to speak with us. The RA’s, Facilities, Public Safety, among others, have also stated that they are not allowed to comment on even      non-controversial stories being reported by my writers.
Part of a journalist’s job is to report information fairly and accurately. Without truthful and accurate information from members of our administration, who often are the only ones with such information, our job as journalists becomes that much more difficult. Having a journalism program means we need to learn how to go out and report. Many internships and jobs often ask for samples or clips of work we have done while in school.
We simply cannot have a journalism department without a newspaper, and we can’t have a fully functioning newspaper without sources. The intention of the paper is not to harm the school, but to report fairly, accurately and ethically about things that happen on campus. Being able to practice our writing skills is how we prepare for our futures.

The search for a permanent dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences continues this year. Former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English Department.
Chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer was the acting dean from June 2015 to August 2016, while a search for a permanent replacement was conducted. However, Ramer stepped down from the position after the search failed.
This semester, LIU Global Dean Jeffrey Belnap has been named acting dean as the search for a permanent dean goes on.
The position of dean is usually chosen by a faculty committee that reviews candidates, and then recommends a suitable person to the administration; yet Belnap was chosen by the administration and named to the position last spring.
Belnap is a literary scholar and holds a doctorate in comparative literature. Belnap spent 10 years in Hawaii as the dean of the Global College campus, and 11 years in the UAE of Dubai and Abu Dhabi under the same position.
But Belnap is not a stranger to Post. After 20 years of being off the continental U.S., Belnap returned to the LIU Brooklyn campus three years ago and has worked on projects with Post, while managing the LIU Global offices on the Brooklyn campus.
The acting dean must make all the same major decisions as the regular dean. Previous dean, Katherine     Hill-Miller shared with The Pioneer in March 2015 that “there are many responsibilities that come with being a dean [which] range from student difficulties to budgets to curriculum concerns.” The acting dean must work side by side with faculty members to maintain the proper functions of the departments within the College.
“I am delighted to work with a great faculty,” Belnap said. He deals with Post issues all day, every day, and is on campus three times a week, sometimes more.
He is used to managing complicated multi-campus organizations with the global academy, and is comfortable with the commute between Post and Brooklyn. “[I am] happy to stand in to help the college manage themselves,” he added.
The reason why Ramer stepped down from the acting dean position is unclear. Ramer has returned to the faculty in the chemistry department and is enjoying his time there. “Being back in the classroom and working with my students are the only plans I have for now and the future,” Ramer said.
The search for a permanent replacement for Hill-Miller, who served as dean for 13 years, continues. For now, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is in capable hands.
