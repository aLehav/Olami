Katie Muller (’15) is in the last year of the graduate Game Design and Development program at
LIU Post. She works as a graduate assistant for the program, “mostly because I care about the department a lot and I want to do what I can to help it grow, since i’ve been there since it’s creation. That can range from TA’ing the undergraduate classes alongside the professors, suggesting new classes, to teaching the Summer Honors Institute.” Katie had one of hergames shown at PAX East and IndieCade East in the LIU Booth, called “Ōra.” She also interned at Arkadium in New York City during the spring of 2016, where she worked on designing the new game mode, “Daily Flight” for their mobile puzzle game “Imago”. It was featured on the Google Play store and App Store. She joined the Pioneer staff in spring 2014 as a staff writer and became the assistant copy editor, editing and revising articles.
