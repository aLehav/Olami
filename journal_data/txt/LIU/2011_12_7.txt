Now that the semester nears completion, graduate students, like others, have a variety of things to catch up on or engage in.  After a grueling semester of writing papers, studying for exams, interning or working, many graduate students are in need of a break.
Tiantian Zhang, an international graduate student from China, will be graduating in December with a Master’s degree in Biology. Tiantian stated that she is ‘happy the semester is over” but is “feeling a little under pressure about graduating.” She went on to add that she “will be looking for a job as well as applying for a Ph.D in Biology.”
Whether your plans are to earn extra money to offset your education expenses or to continue your studies in your chosen program, there are lots to accomplish during the winter session. Just remember that the knowledge you’re acquiring is an advantage. Horace Mann once said, “A human being is not attaining his full heights until he is educated.”
As a matter of fact, nine graduate classes are available during the winter session, should you wish to further your plan of study more quickly. Although the classes that are offered during that time are often limited to specific disciplines, this semester a total of 27 students have already enrolled in classes, ranging from teaching methodologies from the School of Library and Information Science, to applied behavior analysis from the School of Liberal Arts and two courses taught by Dr. Kushner from the Criminal Justice Department on terrorism and critical issues in law and society.
Nonetheless, some graduate students have different plans besides taking courses over the winter break. For example, Jamline Alcineous, a Health Care Administration major who is enrolled in the Advance Certificate in Gerontology Administration, said that she “plans to travel to Paris and visit Africa – especially countries like Mozambique, Senegal, Rwanda, New Guinea and Sierra Leone.” Other students, like James Benoit, a Management Engineering major, have different plans. These plans are simple, effortless and require little effort energy. After going through the first half of the academic year, Benoit stated that he does not have much planned, except for possibly looking for a job, but he has nothing extensive planned beyond that. What are your plans this winter break?

During the fall semester alone, C.W. Post has offered, and will continue to offer, many events showcasing the various backgrounds and ethnicities of its students. There are exactly eight clubs and organizations on campus that deal with promoting cultural diversity. These clubs include the C.S.S.A. (Chinese Student and Scholars Association) and the I.S.U.(International Student Union), which is a multi-cultural organization that fosters growth and inclusion of the entire international student population.
“We have 60 clubs on campus, and they are required to host programs,” says Fernando Mendoza, the Associate Director of Student Life and Leadership Development.  “Many clubs choose to touch upon subjects of religion, sexual orientation, and different countries. At times, several programs will work together like I.S.O. and the N.A.A.C.P.”
Throughout the years, college campuses have become more accepting of different races, cultures and sexual orientations.
“I believe that the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) community is well represented on this campus, and the Rainbow Alliance tries very hard to make both prospective and current LGBT students feel accepted,” said co-president of the organization, Andrew Albrechtsen. “Several years ago, however, there was an incident where a group of students burned a Rainbow Alliance flyer in one of the dormitory buildings… Since then, however, I feel that the student body, in general, has gotten more accepting of the LGBT community, quite possibly because of the visibility of Rainbow Alliance on the campus.”
However, even with the growing acceptance of diversity on campus, the discussion of religion may still be difficult.
“We have one or two representatives and religious leaders from each major tradition, from Catholicism… to Islam,” said Father Ted Brown, Chaplain. He went on to explain the importance of representing different belief systems to get rid some of the stereotypes some students made have. “[It’s good] when you see a priest laughing with a rabbi or a pastor… Students can talk about sex and everything, but religion seems to be private.”
Even with all the resources available, some students are skeptical about diversity on campus. “I don’t think there is enough diversity on campus,” said Mekelia Channer, a senior Journalism major, “And, with the little we have, races seems to stick together on campus.”
And, that’s the point of prompting diversity of races, cultures, sexual orientations and religions: to dispel stereotypes and misconceptions. The more exposure we have to what the world can offer as students,the more likely that acceptance for all can come about.
So, have a Merry Christmas. Happy Chanukah. As-salaam alaikum. Namaste or a Happy Kwanza.  However you choose to say your greetings, have a happy holiday!

Got any gum? Not on the C.W. Post campus, you don’t. You can try the Hillwood Cafe, the vending machine in Life Sciences, the Bookmark in the library, and the mini shop in Humanities, and you will not have any luck.
“I am here 30 years, and I haven’t seen one piece of gum purchased,” said Joan Lavin, the cashier in Humanities Hall. “They [students] have to purchase it on the outside. There was a store where you could buy anything: gum, candy, cards, whatever you wanted. They did have it, but then, they stopped it.”
According to NBC, a study from the Baylor College of Medicine found that chewing gum may have a positive effect on academic performance in teenagers. Other studies have suggested that chewing gum may help reduce stress, may ease anxiety and may enhance alertness.
“Its gum,” said senior Criminal Justice major Jennifer Ducles. “We are all adults here. I think they should bring it back; we could handle it. It’s a different time. They have to have gum.”
In June 2001, Aramark, a leader in providing award-winning food services, facilities management, uniform and career apparel to health care institutions, universities, school districts, stadiums, arenas, and businesses around the world, took over food service for the C.W. Post campus.
“Dining Services has not sold gum on campus for several years as a university policy,” said Shawn Carvajal, the General Manager of C.W. Post’s dining services. “I have not had any real concerns or questions regarding not selling gum on campus. In the past five years, there have been minimal questions regarding not selling gum on campus. Energy drinks are another item that we do not sell on campus.”
Lavin, who works for Aramark, explained the policy. “Students don’t know what to do with it when they are done,” said Lavin. “It goes under the desk, on the floor, under the set, and they all got tired of cleaning it up. I feel bad for the guys that have to clean it. That’s a hard job to do. That’s why it is a gum -free campus.”
However, Rev7, a new gum developed by Revolymer, is water-soluble. At the same price as Wrigley’s 5, Rev7 is “readily removed” from sidewalks, carpets and clothes. It will disintegrate to a fine powder within six months by the use of “mild agitation in water,” which would make cleaning up the gum a much simpler task.
Gum can also be dangerous. Its added ingredient, sugar, has been linked to an increased risk of cavities, and sugarless chewing gum often contains the artificial sweetener aspartame, which has been linked to headaches, insomnia and heart palpitations.
“People are still going to bring gum on campus,” said first year graduate student Chris Kwozbo, a Secondary English Education major. “Buying it on campus would be a lot easier. I don’t know what the harm is to really having it on this campus. For something like 30 years, I think it’s kind of sad. It’s a weird thing to have on the books.”

It is no secret that a digital classroom can have an extremely beneficial effect on student learning.  SMARTboards, iPads, and laptops are just a few of the many tools that are being increasingly incorporated into classrooms at C.W. Post.  Technology-equipped classrooms allow both students and teachers to have access to a wide variety of resources to foster learning and to promote professional development. While many professors are making the transition from a traditional classroom to a progressive one, others continue to teach from the assigned course textbook.
Because technology is changing at such a rapid rate, it can discourage teachers, especially those who have been teaching for many years, from wanting to learn about what is new in the technological world.  However, the campus offers a vast amount of learning opportunities for professors to promote the learning of technology and to help make the transition from chalkboards to SMARTboards.
C.W. Post Director of Information Technology Nancy Marksbury discussed the services that are provided to campus faculty to provide technology support.  “Professors are provided with laptops to bring to class…An annual survey is given that allows faculty to request a replacement laptop, but [they] are typically replaced after three years unless there is damage beyond repair.  Through IT [Information Technology], we have a faculty and staff lab, and it’s through the folks in that lab, who provide workshops for faculty to learn and try out software and they can use specialized software that is more expensive. There is also the IT Faculty Center, where faculty can go to get one-on-one assistance if they are trying to achieve something in blackboard.  Additionally, there’s the Academic Multimedia Support Services (AMSS). The AMSS are not only providing when a faculty member requests a projector, they also have started working with faculty who want to record narrated Power Points.“
Marksbury affirmed that: “There are a number of locations where faculty can get support.”  The C.W Post AMSS website states, “The office is comprised of a team of full and part-time staff and student workers that not only provides “traditional” audiovisual services and support (including the maintenance and repair of audiovisual classroom equipment and “smart” classrooms), but also works with the faculty to design interactive multimedia content that meets their educational objectives and supports blended and online instructional technologies and course content.  Currently the department maintains over 60 “Enhanced Classrooms” across the campus.”
C.W. Post has been making strides in the technology field.  Last year, C.W. Post became one of the first universities to distribute free iPads to all incoming freshman and transfer students.  Also, on November 11th, the campus hosted Long Island’s first ever PadCamp.  PadCamp is a free “unconference,” which means that the participants are the speakers, and they focus their conversations on incorporating tablets and other handheld devices in the classroom. The conference was a huge success and had about 150 participants, including teachers, administrators, and students.
Childhood Education major Janet Dillon voiced her opinion on professors using technology in the class.  She said, “I think some teachers are using it, but not all.  Some teachers feel uncomfortable using technology because they are set in their ways.  Many still teach out of the book and use overhead projectors.  They have to begin to adapt to technology.  They depend too much on Power Point to teach rather than making it an interactive, student to teacher relationship.”
Whether the reason for professors resisting to use technology is because of fear for not being able to use it properly or is simply because they are at the end of their careers and do not feel a need to advance, we cannot crucify them for not making the transition.  However, it is evident that the role of technology in our classrooms will only grow and continue to foster learning.

Towards the end of each semester at C.W. Post and other colleges around the country, students are given course evaluation forms to complete in each class. At C.W. Post, the course evaluation forms are used to assess the course material and the instructors.
Course evaluations are completed anonymously; the students complete the forms once the professor exits the classroom. When the students complete the forms, one student from the class returns the completed forms to the Registrar’s Office.
The forms are then forwarded to the University of Washington’s Seattle Office of Educational Assessment for processing. After six to eight weeks, C.W. Post receives the results. The reports are then submitted to the deans, department chairs and individual instructors for review. The course evaluations are a matter of public information, and the results are available for review to students in the library.
Students can access the results by clicking on the Online Database (alphabetical list) link followed by clicking on the letter “C” for course evaluations and then by clicking on the course evaluation link on the homepage on any computer at the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library.
While completing course evaluations have become a habitual practice for C.W. Post students, many are unaware that the results of these forms can affect curriculums and professors.
According to Dr. Lori Knapp, the Deputy Vice President of Academic Affairs for Long Island University, professors can measure their success while finding areas to improve, and departments use the results to make certain changes to courses and program curriculum.
Dr. Knapp said, “Outcome from student course evaluations is significant because it allows us to monitor the effectiveness of our degree programs and course offerings as we strive to deliver excellence in instruction to our students.”
Aside from completing the standardized course evaluations, students enrolled in Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) courses complete an additional written course evaluation. According to Wendy Ryden, the Coordinator of the WAC program, the WAC evaluations have been in effect longer than the general course evaluations that L.I.U. purchases from the University of Washington.
The purpose of the WAC course evaluations is to help give instructors who teach and administer the WAC program a sense of student insight on the writing class in relation to the two main components of a WAC course, which are informal writing and revised formal writing.
“What we discover is that students overwhelmingly (upward of 80 percent in any given academic year) experience their WAC courses in the way that we hope, and that is they come to understand writing as a means of learning more deeply and as a process that involves revision.” Ryden added, “After the total responses are tallied, the surveys are returned to the instructors, as the feedback is useful in helping them think about how to structure their courses.”
According to Kay Sato, the Assistant Provost in the School of Continuing Education, the curriculum can be entirely rewritten because of the results of the course evaluations in the School of Continuing Education. Sato said, “Courses and/or instructors are not retained in our offerings if they consistently receive low ratings.” She added, “We very strictly control for quality in order to be the best we can be for students.”
Dr. Mary Infantino, the Director of the Graduate program and an advanced practice and associate professor of Nursing said, “I have no problem administering course evaluations, but it does get arduous sometimes.” Dr. Infantino stated that the Nursing Department reviews the evaluations very carefully and will sometimes make curricular changes based on them.
However, a professor from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, who wished that his name not be published, stated, “The results are considered as a part of the promotion and tenure process, but then, it’s not clear to what extent they’re used or how significant their affect might be.”
Professor of Electronic Media and Chair of the Media Arts Department Barbara Fowles stated she doesn’t mind administering the evaluations; however, she does feel rushed at the end of the semester. She said, “I think they are very flawed as a way of telling whether a teacher is effective or not.” She added, “However, they are the only way we have to really give students a chance to express their views. It’s better than “Rate Your Professors,” which can get pretty ugly.”
As Pioneer reporter Genna Apfel reported in an article on October 26, 2011, ratemyprofessors.com is a website where students can find and post professor ratings and read comments from both current and former students about their professors.
Like the C.W. Post evaluations, Ratemyprofessors.com is anonymous.  However, the website allows students to leave comments, meaning students can easily express their feelings for a particular class or professor, unlike the L.I.U. administered course evaluations, which come in a multiple-choice, standardized evaluation.
Of the necessity and effectiveness of the course evaluations, junior Journalism major Adrianna Alvarez said, “If done in a different way and there were a guarantee that the students were being heard, then they would be necessary.” She added, “The course evaluations are so impersonal; they are done at the end of class when everyone just wants to leave. We never hear about them again after that day.”
The results can be reviewed for a specific department or professor, and the median is used to determine what two scores the professor ranged between. So, while the L.I.U. course evaluations may not be as open as ratemyprofessors.com, the results are used to measure a program and an instructor, and students should answer honestly and fairly.

So, you’re dating someone new and it’s time for this person to be introduced to your friends. You set it all up; your closest friends are going to be there. It can be a completely nerve-wracking experience. You want your friends to like your new boyfriend/girlfriend but at the same time, it’s not really up to them who you date.
For argument’s sake, let’s say after the initial meeting, you think it went great. The new person in your life said all the right things, was cracking really funny jokes, and your friends seemed to be engaged. The next day rolls around and you’re talking to your friends about the night before. To your surprise, the general consensus was that your new boyfriend/girlfriend basically sucks, for lack of a better word. They cannot stand him/her and they found the jokes to be crude and insensitive; the entire time, they all wanted to get up and leave.
You are dumb-founded; you thought everything had gone so well. So now what do you do? How do you tell your boyfriend/girlfriend that your friends hate him/her? Or, do you just beg your friends to meet him/her again, citing the fact that he/she was just nervous? It’s going to be very hard to date someone that you can’t have around your friends.
You can try and lead two separate lives, the one you share with your significant other and the one you share with your friends. But, that’s not going to be much fun for you. Friends will eventually get irritated with you for ditching them, and your boyfriend/girlfriend will get mad because he/she doesn’t understand what is wrong, you like him/her, why can’t your friends?
This is not a decision that anyone can make for you, nor can my advice be the only thing you take into consideration. You have to decide whether this relationship is going to be worth potentially losing some of your friends over, or not. Maybe your friends are simply being unreasonable and need to be told so suck it up. Then again maybe this new person in your life is not worth all the trouble. To play devil’s advocate here, maybe your friends are right and this person needs to get the boot.

When you think “Political Scandal,” most people’s minds drift to an office affair by some political representative with someone random; it could be an intern, a secretary, a famous movie star, or anyone really. But what does it do for the politician who is doing this?
Let’s take a look back at some of the country’s most famous cheaters, starting with a personal favorite, John F. Kennedy. President Kennedy was famous for a few things. He was the first and only Roman Catholic president, he was a World War II navy lieutenant, created the Peace Corps, brought about the domino theory of the spread of communism, held the Bay of Pigs invasion, and was accused of having an affair with the famous Marilyn Monroe. That is quite a bundle for any President who takes office, however that last one is often the most talked about. How many times have you heard someone say, “That President Kennedy, I hate him just because he slept with that movie star?” Odds are, none; I have never heard anyone criticize Kennedy for this accusation. Most people who remember JFK talk about all the good he did, or his untimely death, not his supposed affairs with the rich and famous. So is it sleeping with a famous person that got him off the hook, the fact that he was President, or the fact that he did well for the country?
If I had to take a guess, I’d say it was a combination of them all. To prove it, let’s take a look at another one of the most famous affairs, or supposed affairs, to hit the White House, President Bill Clinton’s affair with intern Monica Lewinski. I’m sure everyone can remember this in one way or another and of course we have all heard those famous words from our former President, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.” This whole scandal and those famous words caused President Clinton to be impeached by the House of Representatives, although he was acquitted by the Senate. But to the American people, this was interesting only because of the drama. Clinton is still one of the most popular Presidents we have ever had in office. The scandal was dwarfed by the fact that he dropped our national debt to one of the lowest points in decades.
So does this mean that politicians have yet another power, the power to get away with cheating in office? Not quite, and this is proven by Presidential candidate hopeful Herman Cain. Cain is a Republican pizza mogul who had high hopes, and a good shot, at winning the Republican primary and the chance to run for President of the United States in the 2012 election. However, these hopes have been dampened lately by several accusations of sexual misconduct that have now caused Cain to suspend his campaign. Five different women have come forward and accused Cain of being sexually inappropriate, and, in some cases, engaging in sexual assault. This would ruin anyone’s campaign and that person’s life.  But Cain simply steps down from his candidacy for a bit and that’s it. Here is where the issue in all of this lies.
What makes these politicians special? What makes them able to get away with sexual exploits without a rough divorce, having their name thrashed, and in some cases being thrown into jail for crimes like the rest of us? Clinton was accused of perjury and Cain accused of assault. What I am gathering is that becoming President or even considering, makes you immune to the consequences of committing crimes. This is a major flaw in our system and something that should be looked at. I’m not here to preach about fixing the system or to insult it or whatever else it may be. I just want to call attention to this and put the word out there. Maybe someone should take a look at this. What makes these people any more special than the rest of us?
If you ask former New York Governor Elliot Spitzer he may tell you nothing. Considering that his scandal caused such an uproar, he was forced to step down from his position. I’m sure we all remember Governor Spitzer when he was caught in the midst of a prostitution scandal that literally ruined his political career. What some people may forget is that the major part of his campaign while he was running for office was to find ways to get rid of prostitution. Granted he kind of went the other way on that one, but what made his scandal so much worse than what Clinton, Kennedy, or Cain did? Perhaps it was because he prided himself on the fact that he hated prostitution at the beginning of his career or possibly the fact that instead of one or just a couple of women, it was quite a few. It could have been a combination of them both but again what really happened to him? He lost his job and yes, that is a big deal but the legal consequence of being caught in prostitution includes jail time, so why wasn’t he put in front of a judge for it?
I’m not quite sure why politicians are so special and seem to get away with cheating, lying, and can escape large-scale scandals relatively un-harmed, but I do know that it’s not right. What makes these people better than the rest of us? Is it their money, their power, or the fact that they know how to talk and weasel their way out of it? I guess we will never know for sure, but at least we can all sit around enjoy the show each politician puts on when they try to get themselves out of trouble.

Here’s a scenario for you. You forgot to do your homework, or maybe you forgot about that ten-page paper that the professor talked about excessively for the last month-and-a-half. So what to do? Well, a lot of students give the teachers excuses. Most are pretty common, such as having a job that messes up their schedules, or having too much work to complete for another class. This is a compilation of some of the best (and sometimes hilarious) excuses received by some professors on campus.
Sandra Lynn Mardenfeld, Assistant Professor of Journalism, said the “most honest answers amuse me the most,” like when a student told her “I just had better things to do.” Well at least it’s better than the old “the dog ate my homework” excuse. Honesty is the best policy.
Gerald Lachter, the head of the Psychology Department, has been offered two very bizarre excuses. He said,  “A student informed me that she had missed my exam because she was in jail.” Maybe she was caught speeding to get to the exam? The second one was, “A student told me he was very ill for my exam so he sent his friend to take it for him.” Next time just take a box of tissues and some cold medicine; it’s much better to sneeze on your test paper than have an “F” on it.
This last one I think may be the most interesting and bizarre out of all of them. It comes from English professor, Edmund Miller. It’s not really an excuse, but a bizarre story that was too strange to leave out of this article. He was teaching a graduate course on Milton, in which he had a student who was doing well and attended all the classes regularly during the first part of the semester. One day, the student asked if she could leave in the middle of class for an appointment. He agreed and also agreed to let her leave a tape recorder in the class so she wouldn’t miss any information from the lecture. Professor Miller took the tape recorder at the end of class to give it back next time. However, she didn’t show up for the next class. From that point on, she never returned to class for the rest of the semester. Miller sent her an email but it bounced back. So then he tried calling the telephone number she left on the class list, but it was a disconnected number. He even sent a letter to the address he had on the class list and tried to find if the student had an alternative phone number, but she had disappeared. He said that “The only theory that occurs to me is that she was swept up in the Witness Protection Program with the tape recorder still going.”
It’s the mystery of the vanishing student, and maybe we’ll have an article next semester on students who disappear. Forget about making rabbits appear; let’s make a student who failed for the semester appear before your eyes. I would seriously go to that magic show if that were the headliner.

We’ve got spirit, yes we do, we’ve got spirit, how about you? But, do C.W. Post students really show off their school pride? Colleges and universities encourage school spirit, which can be anything from dressing in school colors, to attending sporting events. However, it seems students would rather not take part in some events on campus. While school programming groups such as the Commuter Student Association and Student Government Association work to provide students with a great college experience and a chance to get involved on the campus, it seems students couldn’t care less.
Some students feel C.W. Post is more of a commuter school. Marissa Santomosa, a senior Public Relations major said, “ I feel too many students go home on the weekends and that’s why there isn’t much to do here then. You can compare our school to another school, maybe like Penn State or Syracuse University and it seems students only want to stay on the campus and show off their school pride.”
Chelsea Serra, a sophomore Environmental Science major said, “Even though I live really close to home, I choose to stay on campus, but I don’t attend anything like football games or go to school events. I can say I am getting a good college experience, but I feel a lot of the reasons students go home or don’t get too involved is because there isn’t much school spirit and a lot of students commute.”
Electronic Media Professor Christopher Dodrill added, “Unfortunately, students care more about getting their degrees and don’t focus enough attention to the learning process. The Long Island University Campus community only wants to get their degrees and leave. Therefore, they don’t participate in enough events on the campus. I try to get students to get out and go do things, like going into the city for example.”
Deborah Khalou, the SGA Treasurer said, “I don’t feel that Post necessarily lacks school spirit. Instead, I feel that it’s a matter of students – both commuters and residents – not being aware of the different activities taking place on campus. Students who want to learn more of the wide range of activities occurring on campus should attend the SGA General meetings!”
In my opinion, a good curriculum and faculty is essential when choosing the right college. But let’s face the facts; we’re young college kids and we’re all interested in one thing, a good social life. College needs to be more than just getting good grades and networking with your professors. It’s also about making the most incredible memories with your friends, going to that party that you have talked about for weeks, or just having fun on the campus. Students involved in SGA and CSA are extremely dedicated to setting up events and keeping the community up-to-date, but a lack of school spirit can cause students to turn to other colleges for fun.

According to www.purseblog.com, one in ten women is willing to spend $150 or more on a handbag. In addition, the average woman currently owns around six handbags. It does not take a mathematician to see how much money we are truly spending on fabulous designer handbags.
I spent my high school years wearing a uniform, so the only way I could show off my style was to experiment with accessories. This directly led to my love for handbags of all kinds. As much as I would love to spend my life savings on a designer handbag, that is not in the cards. However, a solution exists that is certain to ensure the wellbeing of your savings. Many people do not realize that you can find a similar bag at half the price. You just have to be willing to look. I have formulated a list of classic designer bags, and the more affordable equivalent.
My first designer bag is the infamous quilted classic flap shoulder bag. This iconic purse is consistently on the must-have handbag list no matter what season, or year. You see this bag on virtually every celebrity these days because of its classic, elegant design and its chain strap. An authentic version of this bag could run you over $1,000, but you can find a similar bag by DKNY for under $200. Additionally, www.gojane.com has a similar bag on sale for only about $50.
Another designer bag is the Louis Vuitton Monogram Speedy, which I rarely go a day without seeing on campus. This purse is available in a variety of sizes and colors, so the price tends to fluctuate. However, the most popular version hovers around $800. This bag is one of the most popular and fashionable designer handbags on the market today, so virtually every company has its own version. This is probably the easiest bag to find. My personal favorite translation is a black Steve Madden bag with gold studs that I found for $80 at Century 21. For only $25, you can own a sequined version from Target’s brand Xhilaration!
My final classic designer bag is Balenciaga’s Motorcycle Bag. I have been pining for this bag since I was first able to Google and see every celebrity I loved holding  it. It retails for about $1,500, but the price varies based on the size. I have scoured the Internet and stores to obtain an inexpensive adaptation of this famous and luxurious bag. I found one for about $50 that has lasted me for awhile. You can also find satchel bags such as this one from Target and Forever 21.
“When I am looking for a handbag, I usually look at the style of the bag and how comfortable the straps are. My favorite places to shop for handbags are Burberry, Juicy Couture, and Coach,” says Jenna Moglia, Junior Psychology major.
“I look for portability and size in a handbag. My favorite places to shop are Nordstrom and Macy’s. My favorite handbags are by Vera Bradley,” says Stephanie Mendez, Junior International Business major.
Although many of us wish we could afford designer handbags like our favorite celebrities, sometimes we have to work with the hand we were dealt. Yet, at the end of the day, the price and the label are not the important things. As long as you like your handbag and you feel confident wearing it, nothing else matters.
When on the hunt for a designer handbag equivalent, it is important not to be blinded by the price. Make sure you are purchasing something that you really want and that you know is of good quality. Keep in mind that designers such as Coach and Michael Kors make more affordable designer handbags, which are great alternatives. Also, note that shopping at discount stores like TJ Maxx, Marshall’s, and Century 21 will also help.

This summer I went on two road trips to places I had never been before, Philadelphia and Hershey Park. Driving to Hershey, Pennsylvania, was okay because I had an accomplice with me telling me directions, but when going to Philadelphia, I was all by myself. I’m not saying I’m incapable of doing things alone, but driving to an unfamiliar place scared the living daylights out of me. So I used the GPS and this is what I got out of it: it’s a driving nuisance and this is why.
First and foremost, this GPS that I had did not let me know what my next turn or exit would be, so I had to take my eyes off the road to look at the GPS to see my next move. So that confused me at first. Then the arrows on those things are impossible to read – sometimes it looks like it’s going left, other times it looks like it’s going right, and most of the time I went the wrong way and then had to turn around again. And everything on the GPS is measured in feet. I know what a foot is, but I can’t calculate what 100 feet is when I’m driving; I’m sorry but I can’t. And is it just me, but when the GPS talks, doesn’t it sound like a bunch of gibberish?
But recently I was driving my friend’s new Altima, which has a built-in GPS and for some reason it’s much more accurate and easier to follow than mine because the sound goes through- out the whole car, and the distance wasn’t measured in feet. There also weren’t any arrows. Of course, the factory-installed GPS had its qualms, like it didn’t give any route options, it just gave directions, and a few times it took a longer way than we should have taken.
If when driving, you hap- pen to come across a problem with your GPS, like it decides it doesn’t want to work because of a bad satellite signal, and you’re just about to throw the thing out the window, pull over and let it re-calculate, or use your phone for directions. A few times this happened, I pulled over, calmed down and then continued driving on for a bit until the GPS decided to work again. But I had noted in my head what the next stop would be just in case the satellite went down again, and then continued on my journey.
According to rei.com, they suggest practicing using the GPS before taking a long trip, or when getting a new car, they suggest just fiddling around with the GPS until you get comfortable with it. They also advise you to update your GPS every year or the satellite signal will get lost, and then your GPS is worthless.
I feel that life was more simple before the introduction of the GPS. People were okay with getting lost, since the world wasn’t in such a rush. And reading a map is ridiculous! Have you seen those things? If you could learn to read a map, I would consider you to be a genius and sexy, because come on, who takes the time to learn how to read a map? That’s somebody you want to have around. So thanks GPS, for making road trips a bit easier, but totally confusing at the same time.

David Otero
For 150 days, the National Basketball Association and its players were in a lockout that at times got ugly. When reports surfaced that Commissioner David Stern was planning to offer a less favorable proposal to the play- ers that would almost certainly be rejected, the chances of a season were in jeopardy. However, both sides managed to set aside their differences and worked to finish a deal that would ensure at least six years of labor peace. Following the dissolution of the play- ers’ union, the filing of a federal antitrust lawsuit, and a 15-hour settlement negotiation, the two sides in the NBA labor dispute came to a tentative agreement to settle the players’ lawsuit at roughly 3:30 a.m. on November 26th.
“There has mainly been a sense of relief (from the players),” said Alan Hahn, News- day’s beat reporter for the NBA and New York Knicks.. “When the owners offered that last ultimatum proposal on November 11th, the players were annoyed that the owners didn’t budge on their requests in the deal and the belief was that, with the process moved into the forum of antitrust litigation, the season may be lost. Others were frustrated that they never had the chance to vote on that proposal. All of the players knew they were going to lose financially in this deal, and they did. But it could have been much worse if they lost the season, too.”
The ecstatic feel of the players could be felt by looking at Twitter during Thanksgiving weekend. When Miami Heat superstar LeBron James found out a deal was reached, he tweeted, “I feel like my kids on X-Mas Day! So juiced!!”
Former New Jersey Nets forward and current free agent Kris Humphries tweeted, “Woke up to great news…Can’t wait to get back on the court! Thanks to all our fans for your patience.”
Los Angeles Clippers star power forward Blake Griffin showed his appreciation of the NBA returning with the following message on Twitter, “This must be how the guys in Space Jam felt when MJ gave them their powers back through that old basketball.”
As a result of this tentative agreement, a 2011-2012 season has been salvaged, although the fans will not being seeing the normal 82- game season as in a regular year. This year, there will be a shortened 66-game schedule, beginning on Christmas Day, with a handful of headlining games to start off the campaign.
“Returning on Christmas Day was a critical achievement because this day has become a traditional starting day for the NBA’s na- tional television schedule,” mentioned Hahn. “If the lockout had continued into the New Year, and possibly led to the loss of the en- tire season, I’m sure the NBA would have a greater concern with apathy and overall fan disgust. I believe they salvaged this thing at the last possible moment.”
On the Christmas Day slate, the New York Knicks are hosting the Boston Celtics at noon, the defending-champion Dallas Mavericks will be squaring off against the Miami Heat at 2:30 in a rematch of last year’s NBA Finals, and the Los Angeles Lakers welcome the Chicago Bulls at 5 p.m. ET.
“A classic old-school matchup against a historical rival,” said Hahn about the Knicks- Celtics matchup. “And having the Celtics there, fresh off the bitter sweep last spring, provides an immediate opportunity for re- demption.”
Although basketball has returned, when- ever a sport goes into a lockout it runs the risk of losing fans. There is even more of a danger of losing a fan base when there is an extended lockout like Major League Baseball in the 1990’s, or when the same league has had to miss games during multiple seasons like the NBA had previously done in the 1998-1999 season.
“I’m sure some casual fans have deserted,” said Seth Rosenthal of PostingandToast- ing.com, a Knicks blog. “My sense is that a great deal of people still love the game and that the lockout didn’t run long enough that real diehards abandoned ship. I assume that the League’s momentum will pick up where it left off.”
The regular season usually starts in late October, but this year’s start is nearly two months later. This gives older, veteran teams time to recuperate from injuries at the end of last year as well as rest. But for teams such as the Knicks, the extended lockout has the potential to cause some problems.
“One of the most conspicuous issues with last year’s team (post-trade) was a lack of chemistry and coherence,” noted Rosenthal. “A full training camp and exhibition schedule would have served to foster chemistry heading into this season.”
The Knicks can look at the positive side of the 150-day lockout and see that their top three players with injuries: Carmelo Anthony (knee and elbow), Amare Stoudemire (back), and Chauncey Billups (knee), all are now completely healthy. They will come into this season with less wear and tear on their bodies than in previous seasons.
Matt Soldano, a senior Broadcasting major at C.W. Post and an avid basketball fan, was extremely excited when he found out the NBA had ended its lockout. “The end of the NBA lockout also represents the end of a very dark moment in my life,” said Soldano. “I re- ally missed the game. Now that we will finally have basketball, I could care less about which side got the best of the negotiations and who is getting what money. All I want to see is actual basketball.”
In response to the Pioneer’s inquiries to Jean Casner, the NBA’s Vice President of Compensation, regarding the NBA’s posi- tion about the end of the lockout, she replied, “We are not able to provide responses at this time as our efforts are focused on getting the tentative agreement finalized and signed and preparing for the season to begin on Christ- mas Day.”
Did the players accept a deal that wasn’t in their best interest? Did the players sign a deal with their hearts instead of their heads? Probably so, says Hahn: “The players knew they were going to lose on this deal – the troubling economic climate has impacted every industry, so professional sports is no different – but they were trying to avoid being completely obliterated. In the end, they (the players) made almost $300 million in salary concessions and lost security with shortened guaranteed contracts. This wasn’t going to be a good deal for the players, but it wasn’t the worst deal they could have taken.”
The owners won in the negotiating room against the players, but the biggest winners with the conclusion of the lockout may very well be the fans and local businesses around NBA arenas. With the NBA season back, more money stands to be made as the season tips off. This year will bring a very Merry Christmas to NBA fans around the country.

The semester is rushing towards the end. The last day of regular classes is December 12th, and from December 15th through December 21st, it’s finals time.
Quiet hours are coming into effect in the residence halls starting on December 12th, with a mission to provide the on-campus students with a study-friendly environment. The library offers extended hours between December 5th through December 20th, to let the students come in earlier and stay late. For an overview of the longer opening hours, check out http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/libhourx.htm.
With late nights, early mornings, pages to read and papers to write, students are preparing for finals in different ways. Some feel in control, having worked steadily throughout the semester, while others are beginning to feel the pressure, as procrastination has been a habit during the semester. Here are five study tips to make your preparations for final exams easier, well managed, and hopefully lead to a great result.
1. Plan ahead: Free your schedule as much as possible. Ask for fewer hours at work, and eliminate other responsibilities. Time-management is important. Make a schedule including final dates and material to cover. Make appointments at the Student Writing Center if you need to, but don´t forget to take breaks in between your work.
Plenty of students have the habit of studying for hours and hours during the last days before a final. Divide the work you need to do for each different final into blocks of a couple hours a day, as soon as you get the final review. You´ll get into great habits, and you won´t get tired of studying the same subject all day before the exam.  Also, you will have time to ask your professor for help if there are any problems or confusions.
2. Make study appointments: Create a motivational atmosphere where you get together with friends and classmates to review chapters, and solve problems together. Help each other, and find motivation through seeing other people studying. Gather in a place where the distractions are few, and find out where you have the best chance of keeping your concentration. Make appointments for study times, and make agreements for rewards and breaks throughout the studying. If you study better alone, you can still have agreements with friends about breaks, and study times. It´s easier to study when you know others are doing it as well.
3. Avoid Facebook when studying: A couple of minutes on Facebook can soon turn into a couple of hours, especially when you´re getting tired of homework and books. For Macintosh-users there´s a free application called SelfControl, designed to block access to websites for a predetermined period of time. It allows you to limit your access to selected pages, while still being able to access the rest of the Internet. Read more about it, and download the application at http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/31289/selfcontrol. Or else, make an agreement with yourself to stay away from selected pages until you have finished studying for the day.
4. Vary your study location: Do not always study in the same place. Vary your location in the library, study in different environments, and rooms, and your brain will better remember the material you are trying to learn. It could also help improve your motivation, so you don’t get tired of staying in the same environment all the time.  Read the whole article here: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=homepage&src=me
5. Take care of yourself: Don´t forget to sleep! Allow yourself to take breaks, remember to eat and drink enough to keep your head in focus. Reward yourself with a break when you have reached a goal, and let yourself have a couple of hours during which you avoid thinking about school work and finals. Watch your favorite TV show, spend an hour at the gym, do something fun with your friends; find something to look forward to in between your hours of studying. Allow your mind to relax for a while.
Sophomore transfer Finance major from Norway, Vibeke Aarstad, is getting ready for her first final exams in America.  “My plan is to review class notes, looking over tests we´ve had during the semester and spend extra time on parts I had problems with,” she said. She has been studying throughout the semester, and feels that she is ready to take on the last weeks of preparations before the final exams.
Junior Marketing major Emma Reinli prepares for finals by rewriting her notes, reviewing textbooks, and creating flashcards. “For me, the most effective way of studying is writing things down again and again,” she said.
Her biggest problem is finding time for sleep and food in the last weeks before finals. “I don´t sleep,” she said. “I just study as much as I can possibly do, spend as much time as I feel I need on each subject, and try not to think about everything else I have to study for,” she explained. Usually located in the study lounge at Hillwood Commons or at the Chapel, she is most comfortable studying by herself. “I study somewhere that´s not too quiet, but not noisy, and somewhere where the lights are bright.”
There are only a couple of weeks left until the winter break begins. Hopefully these study tips will give you some advice and motivation to perform your best on your final exams. Good luck!

“Hooray for Hollywood, that screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood. Where any barmaid can be a star…”
The word Hollywood is often used as a synonym of American cinema. The city of Hollywood, the “Entertainment Capital of the World,” is the leader in the creation of motion pictures, television production, video games, and recorded music. These products from the industry can be deceptive to their audiences, engraving a false perception in viewers’ minds.
“For the longest time, I thought [James Cameron’s movie] “Titanic” was a true story,” said junior Nicole Pitone. “There was no such thing as Jack or Rose. I watched a lot of documentaries that told the real story including “Curiosity” on the Discovery Channel. Things were loosely based on real events.”
Movies such as “Gladiator” (2000), “The Patriot” (1998), “Marie Antoinette” (2006), “300” (2007), and “Apocalypto” (2006) all feature historical inaccuracies.
““Saving Private Ryan” counts as well,” said freshman Bruce Costa. “I am sure in a way war is hellish but I don’t know how graphic it is or how it scars the character. It seems like it was more for the sake of art. “Pearl Harbor” was just a glorification of the battle. The explosions were just for the sake of the eye.”
Artists have a certain creative control or “creative license” in deciding how the final product in a production will look.
“Biopics often alter real events in order to be more entertaining and match the demands of film structure and length,” said Assistant Professor of Film, Lisa Robinson. “They often condense time, change events, and consolidate secondary characters. One has to judge these films on a case by case basis as to whether the filmmakers have gone too far in their “shaping” of historical fact to create an entertaining film or to potentially fulfill a political agenda.”
HBO Films is currently working on a biopic starring Al Pacino as Phil Spector, a record producer who worked John Lennon and The Beatles, while on trial for the murder of Lana Clarkson, an actress who appeared on “Night Court,” “Three’s Company,” and “Knight Rider.” Helen Mirren also stars as Linda Kenney Baden, Spector’s attorney.
“Personally, I would like to find out how I could get this film canceled,” said Gary P. Spector, son of the music legend in an exclusive interview. “I would love to see a movie made of the trial and of my father’s life, but not by a director that just refuses to accept reality. If they had done it with the right research, I would have loved to have seen it.”
Director David Mamet spoke to the Financial Times on June 10th about his upcoming project. He does not think Spector is guilty and that there is definitely reasonable doubt, “whether he did it or not, we’ll never know but if he’d just been a regular citizen, they never would have indicted him.”
“I don’t care if people like or dislike my father,” said Spector. “What I don’t like is mistruth or blatant lies about my father. I am always going to be the one to stand up and defend him. He [Mamet] never responded to my emails when I offered to assist him with some information. Nobody ever did. From my understanding, no one ever contacted the Clarkson family. Without any contact from either side, I don’t know how there can be any facts in this movie. I got no response from HBO either. They acknowledged receiving the email but that’s all they sent. I know they got it.”
The Friends of Lana Clarkson, a group led by Hollywood publicist Edward Lozzi, whose clients include Debbie Reynolds, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Larry Hagman, first accused Mamet of being pro-Spector to the LA Times over a year ago. They are concerned that Phil Spector will be portrayed with some kind of sympathy.
“We understand the film is about a strange relationship between Spector and Linda Baden Kenny and that it is not a biopic,” said Lozzi in an exclusive interview. “But no one knows for sure. Gary Spector contacted me once by phone call and was displeased that Mamet had not contacted him for background for the script. We also are displeased that Mamet did not contact us about Lana, which we feel is another red warning light about the accuracy of this project.”
In a letter addressed to Mamet dated June 16th, The Friends of Lana Clarkson, comprising of Clarkson’s girlfriends, boyfriends, hairdressers, agents, managers, casting directors, producers, make-up artists, and a select group of media reporters, asked him to refrain from rewriting history for “creative license”. It took the group years before the trial to educate the media about their opinion of what a wonderful, loving, nurturing, and good natured positive woman Lana was.
“David Mamet, Al Pacino, and the HBO people have never responded to our courteous and official requests about the script and how Lana Clarkson will be portrayed,” said Lozzi. “The only response came from actress Helen Mirren who had the courtesy and understanding to address our concerns about our friend Lana Clarkson. She has stated to us and publicly that the film does not “trash” Lana and that we can be confident in that.”
On August 1st and 2nd, scenes for the film were shot on the south side of the State Supreme Court building in Mineola, New York. Mamet used his “creative license” and added protesters outside the courthouse holding up “Justice for the victim” and “Justice for Lana” signs.
“The scenes of poster holding screaming demonstrators out front of the court house are indeed puzzling,” said Lozzi. “There was not a demonstration like that. I was in the courtroom almost every day for the trials. An occasional kook would mouth off but mostly media and photographers yelling at Spector to look at their cameras. The Friends of Lana Clarkson were inside the court room, not outside like that.”
The Pioneer made an attempt to reach David Mamet though his official website which was updated with a link to “read an excerpt from my new book” published in June. The phone number and email address were not in service. According to HBO, the film is “David Mamet’s exploration of the client-attorney relationship between legendary music producer Phil Spector and defense attorney Linda Kenny Baden, who represented Spector during his first trial for murder.”
“The truth that I think needs to be told is basically what really happened,” said Spector. “It should not in any way imply suicide on the side of Lana Clarkson. This is what this movie seems to want focus on that as well as the pointless issue about the relationship between my father and Ms. Baden. He never had a relationship with her as far as I know. She was never the primary speaking attorney during either trial. She just sat next to my Father, speaking to him occasionally.”
When contacted by the Pioneer, HBO would only re-release the statement given months ago. “HBO has a long tradition of capturing real life events on film. We think our track record of dealing with the complex adaptation of history speaks for itself and we hope people will reserve judgment until they have seen the film.”
“Our members who have worked on HBO projects including myself, have contacts there on the inside,” said Lozzi. “Even with that, HBO has shut down the media machine on this film. No reporter has been able to get information on the script or what is in the script. HBO PR will not even talk about the project which is still unnamed. No one knows if the Spector family or spouse is in the picture.”

Social networking websites have become one of the most popular tools for communication. Facebook is by far the most popular with over millions of members and its features such as creating events, groups, apps like Farmville, and so much more. This however led way to competition for other sites to “cash in” on the concept. Twitter is a prime example of a successful social networking site and is a heavy competitor with Facebook . Now there is a new contestant to gain the networking crown, it’s called Google Plus; this is Google’s latest project to join in the networking craze.
Google Plus was first introduced in June this year as a “test-run” at first but was later changed to an invite only system, where you had to be invited to join Google Plus and the chain would continue from there for people to just keep inviting others to join.  The site became available without an invitation once it went public. The site introduced a system called “circles” where the user would categorize friends in certain circles. The idea is that the user can control, who sees their posts and other information. So if the user only wanted their “best friend’s circle” to see a certain post, they can do that easily. Another unique feature is the “hangout” option on the site, which allows the user to have a video chat with up to 10 other users at the same time. Other than just posting information, like on a Facebook wall, there are features such as “Sparks”, where the user can post up interesting topics and share information that is linked to the Google search engine. So the social networking site, has some interesting ideas in how to make a better and more user-friendly social network.
From the student’s perspective, it’s a lot like Facebook. “It’s a Google Facebook, I made an account but hardly use it”, said Carissa Kupper and many others do agree. Amanda Vogt, a sophomore Speech major, said “Nobody uses it so it’s boring.” This is pretty evident since a great majority of people I’ve asked about it, do have accounts but don’t use it or have never even heard of the site. Surprisingly, the site is still really unknown or ignored by a lot of people. From any ones viewpoint, the site has an uncanny resemblance to Facebook, but it does look a little more “polished” and “vibrate” then Facebook. It truly does have potential to be very popular and maybe be the next big thing. Still it’s a problem that it’s not anything really new so people may not be so tempted to change to another site that’s pretty much the same. Also if other people don’t even use it, then there is no point in making an account.
In the past, Google made other attempts in social networking, such as Google Wave and Buzz which failed. So now with social networking becoming the ultimate way to do business and publicity, Google’s next attempt has to be big. The timing for Google Plus is pretty good, due to the negative reaction to Facebook’s changes to its layout and privacy features.
It’s really anyone’s guess on who will rise up and who will fall in this battle for popularity. As of now Facebook is on top obviously, but with the mounting negative feedback could Facebook be finally toppled?

If you are looking for a show to offer you some laughs, then take a look at CBS’ new comedy 2 Broke Girls. It’s about Max (Kat Dennings), a brooklyn waitress that decides to take in Caroline (Beth Behrs), a former rich girl who is penniless and homeless after her father is sent to jail. Eventually, they become friends, and, together, the two not only end up living together but also come up with the idea to open up a cupcake shop. At the end of every episode, it even shows how much money the girls earn and inform us that they are putting it toward the goal of $250,000, which they need to open their cupcake shop.
The show is turning out to be one of the best that has aired this fall. It is not only an interesting storyline, but it is also really hilarious, too. The lead actresses, Kat and Beth, are great together. Even though the characters they play are complete opposites to one another – Max being the tough and serious jokester, and Caroline being optimistic, friendly and organized – they have good chemistry. The other supporting cast members also add laughs to the show. Han (Matthew Moy), Max and Caroline’s boss who attempts to be cool, Earl (Garrett Morris), the cashier at the restaurant, Oleg (Jonathan Kite) the cook that hits on Max and Caroline often, Peach Landis (Brooke Lyons), a spoiled socialite who Max also works for as a nanny for her babies, and Johnny (Nick Zano), a bartender and graffiti artist who has a romantic interest in Max. So, if you enjoy a show with a good plot, humor, some memorable lines, and enjoyable characters, this show is perfect for you.
The show airs on CBS on Mondays at 8:30 p.m., and I highly suggest giving it a chance.

“I Hate My Teenage Daughter”
FOX
By Paul Kalis
The new comedy follows two mothers, Annie Watson (Jaime Pressly), who grew up in a conservative household, and Nikki Miller (Katie Finneran), who grew up unpopular and overweight, as they realize that their daughters, Sophie Watson (Kristi Lauren) and Mackenzie Miller (Aisha Dee), are becoming more like the girls that picked on them when they were in high school. Annie’s ex, the clueless Matt (Eric Sheffer Stevens), needs his brother Jack (Kevin Rahm) to help sort out his mixed up family. Nikki’s ex, Gary (Chad Coleman), further complicates the parenting process.
It’s great to see another traditional, multi-camera sitcom hit the airwaves. Although some of the lines delivered by the leading ladies are corny, they add to the comedy and charm that this show has to offer. What did not make sense was that both couples are divorced, and they still hang around in each other’s homes. I like how their situation was explained several times throughout the pilot, so the viewer could get an understanding of these characters and where they come from. This type of relationship opens up new several new windows of comedy. In a couple of instances, I had to rewind my DVR because it was just too funny. It never got old. To quote Gary, “Good Lord, woman; you’re covered in pie!”
I Hate My Teenage Daughter airs on FOX on Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m.

Rihanna’s sixth album, “Talk That Talk,” came out on November 18th. I must say, it is definitely one of my favorite albums from her. I got it last week, and I haven’t been able to stop listening to it. The album doesn’t only have one specific genre; it includes a variety of them. From pop to reggae, she covered it all in this album, which keeps it interesting and makes you want to listen to it.
I would say it’s very different from her past albums, but in a good way. We can see how talented Rihanna is as an artist. She collaborated on only one song with Jay-Z in this album. Personally, that would be the only thing I would change; maybe, she could have added a few more songs with different artists. It was still a great album, however, and I enjoyed it. Even if you just preview some songs off the album, they are very easy to relate to.
I definitely recommend this album to everyone; you do not have to be a huge fan of Rihanna to buy it. Trust me, whatever mood you are in, there is a song on this album that you will be able to relate to. There are a lot of songs that are fun and upbeat to listen to because I am definitely not a big fan of those songs that are very sad and make you feel like you just broke up with your boyfriend. Although Rihanna does have songs on the album that deal with that, everyone really can listen to this album and relate to it. Also, with the holidays approaching, it can make a great gift. But, even if you don’t buy it, I recommend that you listen to it.

On Friday, December 2nd, the Ballroom Dance club hosted a Zumba dance class in the Pratt Recreation Center at 7 p.m.   The class promoted the Livestrong Foundation and supported cancer awareness. The event was free for all Post students and was sponsored by the Nutrition Club as well as by the C.H.A.T.S Club.
The Zumba class was an hour long and was filled with fun dance music.  Students danced to songs such as Shake Senora, by Pitbull, Waka Waka, by Shakira, and Bumpy Ride, by Mohombi.  Laura Gallof, an academic advisor at C.W. Post, was helpful in posting flyers in her office and trying to get students to attend the dance class.  Zumba was a lot of fun, and it was a great way to get students informed on the Livestrong Foundation.
Lance Armstrong created the Livestrong Foundation in 1997.  It is known for providing extensive information for cancer patients.  It also gives people with cancer the opportunity to receive one-on-one support in order to help deal with their situations. The foundation’s website, www.livestrong.org, offers a ton of resources and information for people to learn about and even donate money towards the foundation. Also, the website, www.livestrong.com, is sponsored by the Lance Armstrong Foundation. It has helpful tips on staying fit and healthy as well as a list of certain nutritious foods that everybody should eat.  The website offers a variety of different ways people can stay active and exercise.
Alize Margulis, a sophomore majoring in International Studies, is the president of the Ballroom Dance club, a brand new club that just started this semester.  The goal of the club is to have fun with dance and to explore various types of dance.  So far, the students danced to salsa music, cha-cha, and meringue.
The Ballroom Dance club hopes to attract a variety of groups of students on campus.  Alize has plans to eventually bring her choreographed dances to towns near C.W. Post and perform for people.  No dance experience is necessary to join, and the most important message that the club has to offer is to have fun with dance.
Other upcoming events that the club will host include Post Clean-Up Day and Holidays at Hillwood.  For Post Clean-Up Day, the members of the club will participate in cleaning up the University on Tuesday, December 6th. They will be helping C.W. Post stay clean by picking up trash around campus.  The club will also have a table set up during common hour on Wednesday for Holidays at Hillwood.  The members at the table will provide information about the club and try to get people to join. There will also be free holiday crafts for students to have fun with. The club usually meets on Tuesdays during common hour, but next semester, this may change. Students interested in joining the club or who have any questions can email the club’s website at dance_ballroom@ymail.com.

Photographer Thomas Holton is presenting his series The Lams of Ludlow Street at Hillwood Art Museum from September 12th to November 5th, 2011. The series is an essay of photos that follow an immigrant Chinese family living in a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan’s Chinatown.  Following an electrical fire to the family’s building on Ludlow Street, the Lam’s moved into Red Cross housing, and temporarily reside there for only six months while the landlords and inspectors assess the building to see if it needs to be completely rebuilt, which may take years. Mr. Holton took photographs of the family from 2002-2005 as they struggled to live their lives in a limited space.
Thomas’ photographs are lined up neatly in a row on the wall. It’s hard to tell which photo is which due to the lack of ID tags directly under a particular photo, and may or may not be in chronological order, but nonetheless, they tell a story. Holton’s photographs are full of sensitivity, which he felt for the Lam’s throughout the 3 years he spent documenting their lives. Holton wanted to help the Lams by selling the photos he took of them for $175. In his “Untitled No. 5,” photographed in 2005, Holton captures Mrs. Lam in a supermarket. Everything is blurred out in the photo except for her face, giving movement to the photo. Mrs. Lam’s facial expression illustrates a line between concern and horror, allowing on-lookers a chance to interpret just what Mrs. Lam may be upset about.
Holton’s “Untitled No. 8,” depicts the bathtub in the Lam’s kitchen with a bouquet of roses inside. This particular photo grasps the attention of onlookers due to the contrast of the tub, which was once white and now dirtied, against the red roses. Although roses typically would not be placed where her children bathe, Mrs. Lam has found a way for her small, cluttered space to be special and decorative, and that is what The Lams of Ludlow Street is about—to make the most of every situation no matter how unfortunate.
In nearly every photo of Holton’s series, the color red is present. This type of hue provides a range of emotion from anger or sadness to love and passion. “Untitled No. 1” is a portrait of the Lam family with smiles on their faces and arms around each other gathered behind their kitchen table. Red can be seen in the clothing hanging from above their heads, within the chairs, and the bag probably used for trash.  This hue reflects that love still exists regardless of an unsatisfying situation.
“Untitled No. 9,” a powerful picture of a red door up-close, is Thomas Holton’s brilliant depiction of mystery behind the Lam family. The texture of the door is rough and cracks are apparent, most likely signifying the internal state of the family that lives behind it. The only object not painted red in the photo is the peephole, which is white. Inside the hole is black with a tiny bit of light coming through, adding to the mystery of what may be going on behind the door.
Although the Lams are all smiles in “Untitled No. 1,” the father doesn’t seem to be smiling, or giving a forced smile. Again, in “Takeout” and “Untitled No. 10,” the father isn’t smiling and hiding behind a wall or a piece of clothing. There is a mystery, and Thomas Holton may or may not know what that is. Nonetheless, Holton invites us into the Lams’ world, revealing the severity of economic hardships. The times are hard, and families all over America are living the same way the Lams are living.

The C.W. Post women’s swim team walked away from last weekend’s College of New Jersey’s 2011 Lions Invitational on Sunday, December 4th, with a second place finish. Out of the seven teams that took part in the event, the team’s 666 points were enough to put the team just one spot out of the lead, which was held by a dominant College of New Jersey.
The Pioneers kicked off the meet with a couple of wins on Friday, December 2nd. Freshman Courtney Delehanty, sophomore Tamara Garriock, junior Mairi Morrison, and senior Cornelia Hanes teamed up to win the 200 free relay with a time of 1:36.08, and Garriock also completed the 200 individual medley in a time of 2:06.88 to garner another first place finish for the day.
On Saturday, December 3rd, each of the teams competed in a number of preliminaries for placement in the final day of competition, which took place on Sunday.
Freshman Malin Hedberg made a strong showing for the Pioneers in distance on Sunday, earning herself a second place finish in the 1650 free race with a time of 17:50.44. Next, Hanes took another second place spot for Post when she finished the 100 free in 52.45, and Garriock collected the team’s third second place finish on the day in the 200 breaststroke with a finishing time of 2:23.23.
The swim team is 3-0 after November 18th’s win over Army and will be back in the pool on January 11th to take on East Stroudsburg University in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

The C.W. Post women’s basketball team’s five-game winning streak came to an end on Wednesday, November 30th, when it lost 70-69 in overtime to the undefeated Dowling Golden Lions.
Senior guard Felicia Joyner led the Pioneers with 17 points while adding three assists. Junior guard Ashley Caggiano contributed 13 points of her own and had four assists in the loss.
The Pioneers opened up the game, going on a 7-0 run through the first five minutes. The Golden Lions responded by going on a 10-3 run to tie the game at 10.
The Pioneers regained and maintained the lead until there was 5:34 left in the first half. Golden Lions senior guard Kelly Puwalski hit a three-point shot to tie the game at 25. The Golden Lions took the lead and ended the first half ahead 36-32.
The Golden Lions maintained the lead for the first 10 minutes of the second half, but the Pioneers slowly inched closer to tying the game. With just under ten minutes in the game, Joyner nailed a three-pointer to tie the game at 46. The Pioneers and Golden Lions traded the lead for the final eight minutes of the game, with neither team having the ability to pull ahead of the other. The largest lead during the eight-minute span was a 55-50 lead held by the Pioneers, but the Golden Lions found a way to force overtime with the score tied at 62 at the end of the second half.
The two teams continued their neck-and-neck battle in overtime, trading baskets during the five-minute frame. With 3:08 left, Golden Lions freshman guard Christine Varrelle hit a three-point shot to give Dowling a 67-64 lead. However, Caggiano answered right back for the Pioneers, sinking a three-pointer of her own.
With 1:38 left in the game, the Pioneers were able to take the lead once more after a pair of free throws made by freshman guard Chelsea Williams. The completed shots gave the Pioneers a 69-67 lead.
The ensuing Golden Lions’ possession proved to be the game winner. With only 1:22 left in overtime, sophomore forward Julia Koppl hit what turned out to be the game-winning three-point shot to make it 70-69 game in favor of the Golden Lions.
The Pioneers could not answer back in the final minute, although junior forward Nicolette Marciniak nearly gave the Pioneers the lead with 12 seconds left in the game. Her attempted jump shot bounced in and out of the basket.
The Pioneers shot 36% (22-60) from the floor, 41% (10-24) from three-point range, and made 15-18 attempts from the foul line. The loss moves the Pioneers’ record to 5-2 for the season and 0-1 in East Coast Conference play.

The C.W. Post men’s basketball team has won four consecutive games and now has a record of 6-1 after knocking out the Queens College Knights on Saturday, December 3rd, by a score of 79-63.
In the contest, junior guard Tobin Carberry led the Pioneers in scoring with 20 points, despite only shooting 5-14 from the floor. Although the shots weren’t falling consistently for Carberry in this game, he managed to maintain his aggressiveness and attacked the basket, drawing fouls and getting to the free-throw line. At the charity stripe, he went 9-11, and he also secured seven rebounds in the game.
Immediately after the tipoff, the Pioneers jumped out to a 15-2 lead. However, following a timeout, the Knights fought back and went on a run of their own, tying the game at 15. In a game that included many streaks of scoring, the Pioneers closed the first half of play with a 37-21 advantage.
Without sophomore forward Vaughn Allen playing, the Pioneers’ forwards had to step up; and, they did just that. Starting freshmen Charles McCann and Tyuan Williams both had major impacts inside, crashing the boards and making their presence felt down low. McCann, making his first start of his collegiate career, notched his first double-double, scoring 14 points and hauling in 10 rebounds. Williams also played well, scoring eight points on an efficient 4-5 shooting while grabbing nine rebounds. In addition, off the bench, sophomore forward Amir Tarif scored seven points and snatched eight rebounds.
The Pioneers dominated the majority of this game, leading by as many as 19 points at one point in the second half. The Knights slowly chipped away at the lead, cutting the deficit to as few as four points. Knights senior forward Khalil McDonald led all scorers in the game with a career-high 30 points, but the Pioneers played solid defense all afternoon, forcing him to shoot 11-27 from the floor. The Knights’ offense ran through McDonald, and without him having the ball, their offense looked lost.
In the win, Pioneers’ senior guard Stefan Bonneau scored 14 points, brought down four rebounds, and dished out five assists. Showing a slight limp and grimacing throughout the game, Bonneau displayed his toughness, staying in the game and hitting key shots when it mattered most.
For the game, the Pioneers dominated the glass, out-rebounding the Knights 47-32. The Pioneers, as a team, also made it a point to get to the free-throw line, successfully making 25-32 shots from the line. They also limited the amount of tries Queens had at the charity stripe, as the Knights only attempted nine free-throws during the contest.
With the 79-63 win, the Pioneers advanced to 6-1, and the Knights dropped to 2-3. The Pioneers’ next game is against the New York Institute of Technology (2-5) on Wednesday, December 7th, at 6:30 p.m., in a matchup that serves as both teams’ East Coast Conference opener.
