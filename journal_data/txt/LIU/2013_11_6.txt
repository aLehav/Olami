Students who dorm at LIU Post have the option of sharing a room or paying a little extra to live alone in a double-room. However, students that end up without a roommate involuntarily could be forced to move or to pay the single-room rate.
Students who pay between $3, 917 and $4,113 for a double- room, could potentially end up paying an additional $400-$500 for a single room.
This is LIU Post’s Consolidation Policy. It has recently been added to the end of the 73-page PDF file that comprises the school’s Student Handbook. The policy states: “When vacancies are created and no waiting list for housing exists, residents who live alone in a double room will be offered the option of maintaining their location at the single room rate. If the resident declines the single room rate option, they may identify a new roommate to fill the vacant space in the room. If the resident is unable to identify a preferred roommate, they will be consolidated to another double occupancy space within their building within ten business days.”
This means that on-campus residents, who involuntarily end up without a roommate, have no other choice but to move in with someone in order to avoid paying extra money.
“Residents get the option of maintaining their room as a single at the single room rate or their Residence Hall Assistant will work to find them a roommate,” explained Jennifer Fuoco, the director of Residence Life.
When it comes to actual costs for living alone in a double- room, information is hard to find. Rates for single-rooms are not listed in LIU Post’s Housing Application, and cannot be found in the Student Handbook.
“The [Resident Assistants] RAs were supposed to inform us about the cost if we were to end up without a roommate, but they did not know the price,” said Theresa Frank, senior Political Science major. “They just said that the charge for people living in a double room with no roommate has to be enforced. I also heard rumors after that there would be a $400 increase, so I feel it’s unclear what is accurate,” she added.
Frank is one of the students who could be affected by Post’s Consolidation Policy. She heard about the dorm charges during a floor meeting in Queens Hall, and worries what will happen next semester when her current roommate has graduated and moved out.
“Truthfully, I’m not looking forward to finding another roommate. Most of my friends have graduated or already have a roommate, and moving in with a complete stranger is a rough way to begin my final semester, but I guess that I have to, since I do not want to pay extra,” Frank said.
Frank also finds the policy unfair. “Why should we pay extra when we aren’t the one leaving? Living on campus is already very expensive. It will become unaffordable and people will start moving out,” she said.
However, can students end up residing in a double-room without paying the single-room rate? “I know students who live alone in a dorm and ignore paying extra coverage for it,” said Kent Johansson, a junior Theatre major. “It is annoying that these students take up space when there are many students that would like to become roommates, but cannot find a room,” he added. “I talked to staff at Residence Life and asked why they are not doing their job and received the response that they cannot force someone to move out of their room because then they might threaten to move off campus, thus causing the school to lose income,” he said.
Johansson believes that the university’s policy backfires when it sometimes appears to be enforced, and other times not. “Post shoots itself in the foot when saying one thing, then doing the other. We already pay so much to live here compared to the standard we receive, and honestly people are getting tired of it. The only ones that will be
left living on campus will be international students who come here not knowing better, and athletes who get sponsored to live here,” Johansson said.
Natasha Khajooei, junior Public Relations major, understands that setting prices for specific situations can be tricky for
Residence Life, but still finds the Consolidation Policy strange. “It is logical to charge a little more for students who wish to live alone in a double-room because they will take up more space. However, if your roommate dumps you, you should be able to remain in your room at the price that you were expected to pay because it’s not your fault,” Khajooei said.
Khajooei is also surprised that she had not previously heard about the Consolidation Policy. However, according to Fuoco, students were repeatedly informed about the policy. “We told returning residents during the room selection process last spring. New residents got the information via their housing application. They were also reminded about the Consolidation Policy during their first floor meetings and during check-in. In addition, the information is available online in the student Handbook.”
Khajooei insisted, “I have not received information about this, and I asked my two roommates and a couple of friends, and they had also not heard about it. I cannot recall having read any specifics about prices in the housing agreement,” she said, adding, “This is always the case with Residence Life. They should focus on improving the standards for us instead of trying to find loopholes where they can make money. People are going to start moving off campus otherwise because the prices are ridiculous anyway.”

Scandinavian students have experienced some confusion over the past few weeks regarding their scholarships based on their Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements, and the relationship between LIU Post and their backer organizations. Backer organizations help international students through the process of finding and applying to an American college or university.
Swedish students, who came to Post with the backer organization Blueberry Worldwide, have discovered that their organization and LIU Post had ceased their affiliation. Some Norwegian students who came to Post with the Norwegian backer organization Study Outside Norway (SONOR) are getting anxious about the relationship between LIU Post and SONOR. The students are worried about the implications this may have for them in terms of scholarships and discounts.
Sofie Hoff, junior Fine Arts major, is from Sweden and attends Post through the backer organization Blueberry Worldwide. About a year ago, when Blueberry Worldwide stopped working with LIU Post, Hoff was not notified by anyone about the cessation of cooperation. Hoff learned about it through Blueberry Worldwide’s website, by coincidence. Hoff has not experienced any implications and said, “I was a little worried about my scholarship, but not for long.” Hoff adds that she still receives her LIU Post scholarship.
LIU Post and SONOR have an agreement that states that students ho come to Post with SONOR will receive a 25 percent discount and a LIU Post Scholarship of $6,000 a year ($3,000 per semester), if the students have a GPA of 3.0 or higher from high school or previously attended universities.
The LIU Post scholarship amount varies on an individual basis, depending on the student’s GPA. This semester, according to some students, the Bursar office told students who came to check on their finances that students who partnered with SONOR now need a GPA of 3.25 to receive their scholarship. Students who have informed the Bursar about the SONOR 3.0 requirement were told that they would not receive any scholarship unless they provided a document that proved that SONOR had a GPA limit of 3.0 from previous universities or high school education.
Kristoffer Eidissen, junior Business Management major, was one of the students who were asked to prove their GPA for the Bursar. When asked about the relationship between LIU Post and his backer organization, Eidissen said, “SONOR has not yet stopped backing me, that I know of, but there are rumors that they will stop cooperating with our school after Christmas, and that does not feel very good.”
Eidissen believes that it is unprofessional that the students do not get sufficient information about their backer organization and scholarships. When asked about what a termination of the cooperation between LIU Post and SONOR would mean to him, Eidissen replied, “There are not too many implications, but I do feel like Post and SONOR’s collaboration is worth critique. For example, Post raised the minimum GPA level to receive a scholarship with 0.25 points without notifying the students. This could have a lot of implications for students who depend on getting a certain amount of money to be able to study here.”
Kamilla Stoelen, International Student counselor at SONOR, said, “For Fall admission 2013, there has been no change in GPA requirement for Norwegian students, nor for scholarship applications.”
Several students have indicated that the Bursar has notified them that the GPA requirements have risen. However, Joanne Garziano, executive director of Student Financial Services, when asked whether or not the GPA had changed from 3.0 to 3.25 for international students, replied, “Not to my knowledge, no.”
Graziano also said that students who are facing problems should come to the Bursar’s office at Kumble Hall and talk to them. At further attempts to acquire more information about the GPA raise, the workers at the counter asked not to be named in The Pioneer, but said that the GPA was 3.25. Bursar asked that questions regarding the situation be sent by email, but Bursar has not yet responded.
The rumors regarding the relationship between LIU Post and SONOR are false according to Stoelen from SONOR. Stoelen said, “SONOR and LIU Post have a solid partnership that has lasted for several years. We are now working to continue this cooperation in order to secure the best interests of current and future students.”

On Saturday, Oct. 26, LIU Post held its annual Fall Open House. The event, which was canceled last year due to Hurricane Sandy, attracted over 600 prospective students.
“Open House is for prospective students including high school students and transfer students. They are coming for a visit and to interact with faculty, staff and students,” said Janell Rodgers, an Admissions officer.
“We want them to see and feel how great our students and faculty are, and hopefully have them want to become part of our Post family,” said Rodgers.
“I still remember the Open House I went to before entering this university. It was certainly worth it. I experienced how the classes went on an informative tour and it was a good taste of the school,” said Serena Oditt, a junior Marketing major.
There was a welcome presentation, a scholarship presentation and athletic information sessions. Prospective students and their families also attended a student ambassador panel discussion, the Honors Program & Merit Fellowship reception, and student service fair and campus tours.
“[The] open house was good because I [could] get some information about LIU Post,” said Nicholas Rinaldi, a prospective Music major. Rinaldi attended the open house with a friend.
“I took part in the campus tour; the campus was really nice. It’s not like the city,” said Anderson Rodriguez, a prospective Liberal Arts major. “[The] open house was helpful to [learn] that LIU Post offers great opportunities and programs,” Rodriguez added.
The open house offered not only academic information, but also information about student life through clubs and organizations. “The open house is good for prospective students to [learn] about LIU Post’s clubs,” said Jessica Wong, a sophomore Art Management major,
A lot of clubs set up tables outside of Hillwood, which allowed interested prospective students a chance to interact with club members.
“It was a great day to show off all of the wonderful programs and services we have to offer,” stated Jaclyn Russo, an Open House representative and Alumni board member.

Some say distance means so little when someone means so much. Long-distance relationships have appeared through history time and time again. With the start of online dating websites, and easier means of communication, the trend of dating someone from a distance has risen a great deal. Though there are many benefits to long-distance relationships, there are also many drawbacks to it as well.
Maxine Lake, freshmen and undecided major, had a serious long- distance relationship with a guy who lived hours away in Massachusetts while she lived in New York. “The good thing about having a long- distance relationship is that you have enough space to be with your friends and family, while also being in a committed relationship,” said Lake.
Lake also explained that it’s very hard to build a physical relationship and connection with someone you do not see very often. They are not currently dating and still live in the same places. Couples can video chat, instead of talking on the phone or text, in order to help keep the physical attraction to one another steady.
Jacquie Diogo, freshman Art major, who has dealt with a partner living in New Jersey while she lived in New York, said, “The good thing about being in a long-distance relationship is that you learn to have really good communication and trust skills.”
Diogo explains the bad thing about this type of relationship is it is hard to keep the connection going sometimes with not a lot of physical contact. They are no longer in a relationship due to communication and distance. Communication skills are a necessity, but physical contact is also needed for a strong connection according to Diogo.
This type of relationship would be good for people who are workaholics, busy parents, or introverted people. Long-distance relationships definitely require more effort to sustain. Some believe being apart draws you closer to your current partner, but some believe the separation develops insecurities in the relationship, which can bring both partners down.
Jealousy may also develop due to distance from someone for a long period of time because one may become jealous of who the other is with and curious as to what the other one is doing in a certain place.
Hypothetically, if your significant other is going to dinner, a concert, or a game, they are probably going without you and most likely with other friends. It may feel kind of like rejection when your partner is out having fun, while you are home alone. However, this does not mean you should not enjoy the time you, as a couple, have together. Being in
a long-distance relationship is for people who can handle long periods of separation and mostly video chatting and texting. People who cannot deal with this kind of relationship should stick to relationships that require both of them to be reasonably close to each other.

In ancient Egypt, people preserved the dead by mummifying their corpses. Observing the way the mummy is wrapped, and their measurements, help mummy experts learn about the ancient civilization.
“Mummies are like little encyclopedias. If you know how to read them, they’ve got a lot of information in them,” said Bob Brier, Ph.D., egyptologist, senior research fellow, and professor at LIU Post.
Brier, who is also known as Mr. Mummy, x-rayed a female Egyptian mummy’s arm in the medical imaging lab at LIU Post recently for a children’s documentary that will be aired on a new channel, called the Children’s Documentary Network.
The Egyptian arm, named Lefty, was given to Brier one year for Valentine’s Day from his wife. Brier kept Lefty hanging on a wall in a case inside their home for years before his curiosity led him to x-raying the arm.
From studying Lefty, Brier discovered that the arm was from
an Egyptian woman, who was about 50-years-old. Her bones were very white, signaling that she was well mineralized. This told Brier she had a good diet.
“I could also tell that she probably didn’t do much work: meaning she was probably an elite,” said Brier. He explained that if someone has muscle, it shows up in his or her bones because as your muscle increases, your bone density increases as well.
Lefty also had arthritis in her fingers. Brier was able to tell because the spaces between her joints were closed, which explains why arthritis feels painful. This helped him determine her age because most people do not get arthritis when they are in their 20s.
“And she didn’t have a lot of muscle. So she
wasn’t working in the kitchen, you know, kneading bread all the time. You learn a lot about them. And that’s why I x-rayed her arm – to find out what her life was like,” said Brier.
Brier said she was doing very well since she didn’t have a lot of muscle and she was well wrapped. However, she wanted to be buried with a bracelet, which she didn’t have, so she had a bracelet painted on her arm.
“It was kind of sweet,” Brier said about the bracelet painted on Lefty’s wrappings.
The way Brier analyzed Lefty is a very standard procedure that he uses every day. He often uses a computed tomography (CT) scan on the mummies he studies to learn more about their histories, as well,
Throughout Brier’s career he has traveled all over the world to study different mummies, and hosted several educational videos about mummies that aired on channels such as TLC and National Geographic. The oldest mummy Brier has studied was about 5,000-years old and was found in Egypt’s Old Kingdom.
On Nov. 12, Brier will release his new book “EGYPTOMANIA,” in which he discusses why he feels that people are fascinated by Egypt.
“I try to do a couple of things in the book. One is I try to answer the question: ‘Why are people so fascinated with Egypt?’” said Brier. “For example, if you put little kids in a museum and you ask them do you want to go to the Greek section or the Egyptian section, they’re going to pick the Egyptian section. Why?” Brier said his book is his way of answering that question.
“I think it’s partly immortality. I think we look at a mummy, and we’re looking at a human being who lived 3,000 years ago, but he’s still recognizable. And I think we’re a little bit envious. I think when we look at this mummy, who is still in pretty good shape after 3,000 years, that maybe, it’s a kind of immortality that we would like to have also.”
Brier will be giving a lecture about his book, and having a book signing, in the Hillwood Lecture Hall from 1-3 p.m. on Nov. 12, the same day his book is released.

I have always dreamed of traveling and seeing all the different wonders of the world. I already started my journey by studying in Australia for three months during the Spring 2013 semester, but I want to see more. I got a little taste of backpacking life and I loved it.
My next journey is Europe; I hope to start traveling right after graduation. I want to become fluent in Spanish. What better way than to visit Spain? I would also like to learn a little bit of French, and to hopefully be fluent in that language one day as well. There are many places to see in Europe and I hope to see them all. Three months sounds like a long time, but when you are traveling and having amazing experiences, time just flies.
Friends have described the amazing food that they tasted while backpacking through Turkey and India, and it made my mouth water. The way they described the richness of the culture in these countries made me want to go even more.
I have friends in Germany and England, so those two countries are on the top of my list alongside Spain, France, India, and Turkey. If there is time after seeing all of these beautiful places, I would also like to see Italy and then end my trip with visiting Greece.
I don’t plan on purchasing all of my plane tickets or booking all of my hostels; I would like to just book it as I go. Sometimes a tight schedule can ruin the purpose of traveling.
Once I return to the United States, I hope to start saving up for adventures through Asia and back down to Australia, and hopefully I will get to see New Zealand, as well. And for a more enriching trip, I would really like to spend a few summers doing Habitat for Humanity. I’ve looked at a few different opportunities in Nepal, South Africa, and also South America.
“If I had three months to travel anywhere around the world, I’d probably choose either Mexico or Guatemala,” said Carl Martinez, junior Social Work major. As a Social Work student, Martinez wants to work on social reconstruction and mentioned that he would like to spend his time building houses and doing as much community service as he can.
“I hopefully want to travel across Europe. I’d also like to study abroad and work at a hospital in Brazil,” said Jacqueline Marino, a junior in the Medical Imaging Program.
“I honestly really want to see Italy, Hawaii, Bora Bora, France, Japan, and Australia,” said Alex Ochoa, a junior Accounting major.
I see traveling as a great way to learn and to grow as a person. When you are thrown into a situation, or you have a problem and you are in a different country with different surroundings, you have no other option than to grow up and deal with it like an adult. While I was in Australia, I had a concussion and I had to go back and forth to the hospital and see different doctors without my parents there to help me. It definitely helps you mature and understand the different cultures around the world. It is one of my goals to make traveling a part of my career and I will do anything to make that happen. My best advice is to travel to as many different places as you can.

Yes! The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, as Republicans have nicknamed it, will provide healthcare to the 16 percent, or estimated 48 million, Americans who are currently uninsured.
This is a good thing. Obamacare works to provide quality, affordable healthcare through individual mandates. This means Americans without insurance will need to attain coverage through an employer or provider, and those who are covered remain with the same carrier. Previously, individuals were declined insurance due to pre- existing conditions such as pregnancy, accidental injuries, high blood pressure, and more. Under the ACA, insurance companies are banned from denying healthcare to anyone. Obamacare is beneficial for students as well, allowing them to be covered by their parent’s insurance until the age of 26. With this said, Obamacare is a beneficial law that shows social and political progression for America.
However, some individuals feel otherwise, like Travis Ray, a senior History major, who believes, “The government should revise Obamacare.” Ray continues, “It has many parts that harm the people and are not well thought out ideas.” Although he did not specify which parts he considers detrimental, there is something about Obamacare that definitely needs improvement.
Though the actual law is a great change for American healthcare, providing insurance to millions of Americans, the ability to obtain coverage has proven problematic. The Healthcare.gov website launched on Oct. 1 for consumers to shop and purchase health insurance. Unfortunately, it presented a number of technical issues that negatively affected the consumer experience. Individuals are having trouble logging onto the website and browsing insurance plans and encountering error messages and site timeouts.
Some states, including New York, have opted for a state exchange: the decision to implement an online price comparison specifically for the state compared to a national insurance marketplace.
The state exchange has proven to be more efficient than the national exchange. According to The New York Times, the New York exchange announced more than 40,000 eligible people have signed up for healthcare. The faulty website is one very disappointing feature of Obamacare, and bad representation of the health reform law itself.
Alternatives to the Healthcare.gov website have been provided to help Americans sign up for Obamacare with less frustration. One of these is through the U.S. Postal Service. A paper application can
be downloaded from CMS.gov (Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services) and mailed in to start the healthcare buying process. If waiting for the application to be received is less frustrating than waiting for the webpage to be repaired, this may be a better option.
According the Huffington Post, the healthcare reform law has established workers to assist consumers through the process of applying for insurance. Contact information can be found on the Find Local Help page of the Healthcare.gov website, which is unaffected by technical problems. Private vendors offer similar insurance through online marketplaces, allowing consumers to shop and compare plans as well.
Americans are encouraged to use these alternatives if they are frustrated with the website. Applicants have until Dec. 15 to choose a plan that takes effect on New Year’s Day.
Johanna Wills, a senior Art Therapy major, recognizes the website’s issues but appreciates the ACA, “It is disappointing that the website isn’t up to par, but Obamacare is great for America. Everyone else has universal healthcare. It’s about time we caught up.”
Understandably, it is hard to separate the malfunctions of
the Healthcare.gov website from the actual policies of the Affordable Care Act, but this should not discourage students from healthcare. Obamacarefacts.com is a great website, providing everything one needs to know about the new changes to our healthcare system. Students can also utilize the “Find Local Help” feature on the Healthcare.gov website to receive unbiased advice and information on the best healthcare options.

Some moviegoers may not know that the horror movie “Carrie,” released Oct. 18 and directed by Kimberly Pierce, is not just a remake of the 1976 Brian De Palma version, but also based on Stephen King’s first novel, “Carrie.” There is some skepticism about whether the remake does justice to the original version.
When viewing both versions right after each other, it is clear the opening scenes are completely different. The remake starts in a gruesome, frightening way, with the birth of Carrie amid blood and screams. When the new opening scene comes to an end, the film then progresses to a scene similar to the original opener at a high school, with Carrie and her classmates in gym class playing volleyball.
The remake’s casting of the high school students was more accurate than the original. Many of the actors in the 1976 version were in their mid-twenties. Sissy Spacek, who originally played Carrie, was 26 when the film was shot. The characters in the remake look younger, but it seems that Carrie, played by Chloe Grace Moretz (“Kickass”), looks much younger than her classmates. Moretz, at 16-years old, was in fact younger than the character she portrayed.
Carrie is much more shy and quiet in the remake. Some scenes are completely identical, but in the original film Carrie sticks up for herself to an extent, such as when the principal keeps calling her the wrong name.
The 2013 Carrie does not just emphasize Carrie’s oddness, but also portrays the mother, Margaret White, played by Julianne Moore (“The Kids are All Right”) as a bit more extreme. In the original, although still trying to spread her extreme Christian views, Margaret talks to neighbors and seems a little less insane. In the remake, she barely speaks to anyone except for Carrie. In the newer movie, she hurts and causes pain to herself. Her self-inflicted harm includes scratching her arm until she draws blood, banging her head against a wall, and stabbing her leg with a seam ripper.
There is also a classroom scene that was changed. In the original, popular boy Tommy Ross, played by William Katt, has to read his favorite poem aloud in class. The teacher says it wasn’t very good, but Carrie speaks up and says that she likes it. In the remake, the teacher makes Carrie go to the front and read her favorite poem. The teacher, along with the class, finds it a bit disturbing, but Tommy Ross speaks up and says it was awesome, saving Carrie from more embarrassment and torment.
In addition to having more blood, gore and violence, the 2013 Carrie also has more deaths. Some moviegoers felt that it may have been to boost ratings because as horror and action movies are remade, fatalities typically increase. The rise in deaths could also be from the intense cruelty that Carrie has to face in this newer version. They keep the practical joke at the prom the same, and many of the jokes the same, but with new technology. The popular kids are able to torment Carrie on an entirely new level. Instead of the girls just throwing tampons at her in the locker room, one of the popular girls also videotapes it on her smartphone and uploads it to social media.
There is also a visible difference in ethics while shooting. In the original opening scene in the girls’ locker room, many of the girls
are completely nude. In the remake’s locker room scene, the girls are either covered by a towel, in their underwear, or dressed in their clothes. This may be because the filmmaker does not want to show, regardless of the rating, actors portraying high schoolers in an explicit way. Even though the actors and actresses may be much older than the part they are portraying, it is still considered inappropriate to show such nudity of young characters.
Although the remake attempts to make a more effective and traumatic ending, it is my opinion that the original does a much better job at creating a more intense final scene. Many online fans feel that neither of the endings did the Stephen King novel justice but will agree that both endings are good. The only way to judge the remake is to see the original, so make a night of it. Rent the original first and then go and see the remake. That way you can compare for yourself!

Dance and Musical Theater majors were given the opportunity on Friday, Oct. 25, to take part in a master class taught by prestigious tap dancer and choreographer Savion Glover. Representatives from the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts and LIU Post’s Theater department coordinated this invaluable event for students, which began at noon in the Theater Building, before Glover’s show at the Tilles Center that night. The Pioneer had the unique opportunity to sit in and ask Glover questions intermittently throughout the class before attending his show.
Tap dancing since the age of seven, Glover, 39, has established himself as a leading force in not only tap, but also the dancing community as a whole. “I feel like he has a sound and quality to his movement that a lot of other choreographers and dancers do not,” said senior Dance major Angelique Cruz before Glover’s arrival. “He is very unique, [as is] his approach to what he takes as his art of dance. That’s why he’s so relevant in our dance world today, because he’s still an innovator, he’s still bringing back what he feels is important, and he’s also evolving as a choreographer. . . Tap doesn’t have to be so pretty or classical; it can be funky or down-to-earth and grounded.”
Glover studied with greats such as Gregory Hines and Lon Chaney, working together live and on film. His career has launched itself from one event to the next. His resume includes work in the play “The Tap Dance Kid” in 1985, appearances and interviews with people such as Charlie Rose, and providing choreography and motion capture for the “Happy Feet” film franchise. His shows range from solo improv to more choreographed fare, such as his show on Oct. 25 at the Tilles Center, featuring a group effort by fellow dancers Robyn Watson, Ayodele Casel, Sarah Savelli and Marshall Davis Jr.
Glover stressed to Post’s students that there is always more to learn and hone in one’s craft. He asked students to judge what their skill levels were and to display their talents. In doing so it was easier to pick apart what could be improved and what was working in their steps. “Let’s all commit to being beginners today,” announced Glover. “I guarantee you that there are some here who call themselves advanced. There’s always one or two things that they can learn, that maybe they should have learned, but just didn’t go to the right institution or just [were] not in the right setting.”
Back in his native Newark, New Jersey, Glover runs The HooFeRz CLuB School for Tap, an institution dedicated to a more holistic and natural approach to dance, where terms and testing are bunk over personal growth and feeling out particular steps.
“For about eight or nine years, I stopped teaching,” said Glover. “During that time, as I was making my way back to the classroom setting, my approach to teaching changed. And that had a lot to do with the men and women responsible for who I am as a tap dancer. People like Jimmy Slyde, Dianne Walker, Lon Chaney and Gregory Hines.
I realized that there’s more to teach for me than just a combination.
Everyone knows how to do a combination. But what we need to realize is that there are many more tools that we should have, or at least be aware of, as tap dancers. This is what I have been sharing now, going on maybe the past five years.”
It is clear that Glover’s relationship with fellow tap dancers has greatly influenced his dance. His Tilles show featured an eclectic yet palatable mix of jazz, hip-hop, and classical music. Before Glover began dancing in his youth, he played the drums, and it was evident in his percussive style that he treats the dance just like any other instrument.
“Whether its percussive, melodic, woodwind – whatever the instrument is – I have grown to understand that the same application works for tap dancing,” said Glover, “which has broadened my tap dance vocabulary. As I continue to search and learn about these similarities, I see exactly how similar the dance is to one’s playing the drums, or another instrument. It is about establishing or allowing your sound to mean something to the listener.”
Glover was stern and clear about a common stigma associated with tap: Americans might assume it is not a serious dance style. Even when television shows feature tap dancers, they often “miseducate,” in Glover’s words, and fail to represent the style for sustainability. “It’s good that the dance is being seen,” he said, “but when you’re out there, you have to represent it right. You can’t speak to one thousand people without a microphone: You’re not going to be heard. It’s good, but it’s raggedy.”
“It’s like certain stereotypes that have been established in this great America,” Glover continued. “So how do we erase those, or sort of eradicate all of that? It’s hard. It is a hard journey. But I’m in it. I’m in it for the long run. And that’s only because I knew a man, I knew some men, I know some women, who have died, gone, last thing they did was tap dance, walked off the stage, went downstairs and died.”
Glover is referring to the 1990 death of revered tap dancer Steve Condos, who at 71 suffered a heart attack fresh off a show in Lyon, France. Glover often attended shows in the wings of the venue, following his mentors down to the dressing room. “I was a second behind him,” said Glover. “Steve went downstairs to the dressing room and died, on the spot. I was traumatized, as you can imagine. So, when I know of people who have literally died trying to advance people’s knowledge about this dance, that’s when I say I have work to do. The only thing we can do is continue to do the work. I will continue to not allow tap dance to be comedic. . . not allow it to be a joke.”
Glover left the Theater and Dance students with a flourish, asserting the importance of expression in the art world. “Before I go,” he said, “ I want to thank you for your time. I hope you take something away from this session.” That night, when he walked on stage with his entourage, paying homage to his own mentors, the messages of the class were clear: tap dancing will have a future, if only those who are inspired put in their work.

Hoping to close the regular season with a pair of wins, the men’s soccer team hit the road for Washington, D.C. and Queens, N.Y. last week. The Pioneers took on the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds on Wednesday, Oct. 30. Just 13 minutes in, freshman forward Johann Kristjansson headed in the first goal of the game off assists by sophomore midfielder Matias Ruiz and junior forward Eivind Austboe. Senior midfielder Jonathon Watkin followed approximately four minutes later with a second Pioneer goal, off another Austboe assist.
The Firebirds managed to strike back with a goal of their own before the end of the first half. The scoreboard was looking good for the Pioneers, until the Firebirds scored their second goal of the game with under 15 minutes left in regulation. Deja vu of the preceding week set in as double overtime came and went, with neither team managing to score. The Pioneers tied for the second time in a row. The final score was 2-2.
Thirsty for victory, the Pioneers played the Queens College Knights on Saturday, Nov. 2. The scoreboard stayed quiet for most of the game, but there was plenty of physical action on the field. The Knights played rough, earning themselves plenty of yellow cards and two red cards. In the second period, just two minutes after the Knights’ second ejection, Kristjansson managed to score for the Pioneers off a free kick by senior back Eirik Bjoernoe. The Knights did their best to score in the 17 minutes that remained in regulation time, but fell short. The Pioneers brought home the win they were looking for to end their regular season.
The men have finished another successful season as they for the third consecutive year are the ECC regular season champions. The Pioneers host the Mercy College Mavericks in the ECC Semifinals on Wednesday, Nov. 6. at 1:00 p.m.

This past Saturday, the LIU Post women’s soccer team took on Queens College in a decisive ECC matchup. It was a tight battle throughout the entire game. The first half of action saw the two teams split only nine shots, with Queens having a 6-3 advantage.
The greatest scoring opportunity in the first half came in the 38th minute when a penalty kick was called inside the Pioneers’ box. Freshman goalkeeper Hreffie Agnarsdotti rose to the occasion and turned everyone’s pessimism into optimism as she turned away the penalty shot to keep the score locked at 0-0 going into halftime.
The second half of action seemed very similar to the first with no team creating too many scoring opportunities. However, sophomore forward Susanne Vistnes came close to giving the green and gold the lead but her shot smashed off of the crossbar.
In the 74th minute of action, the Queens College offense would finally break down the stifling defense of the Pioneers when the they found the back of the net to give Knights the lead. Queens owned a 10-7 advantage in shots, and an 8-6 advantage in corner kicks on the afternoon.
LIU Post wrapped up its normal season with a record of 13-4, 6-3 in ECC play, which is good enough to clinch the ECC Championships as the fourth seed. Head coach Mark Dawson and the team are scheduled to travel to Bridgeport, Connecticut on Thursday, Nov. 7 for a 6:00 pm kickoff. They will face the Purple Knights of Bridgeport University in the semi-final of the ECC Championship. “This is the part of the season where we rise to the occasion,” said Dawson. “We’re so happy about the opportunity we have to show the conference what we’re capable of. It will be an interesting postseason and we’re looking forward to getting things done.”
