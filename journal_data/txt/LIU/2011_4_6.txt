Waiting in anticipation may be one of the most nerve-racking experiences to undergo,especially when the news you’re waiting for pertains to your dorming fees! Resident assistant,also known as your residence hall floor manager, is a job many people are fighting for. To apply, you must go through a process of activities, projects and interviews before being accepted.
Fifty students completed the Resident Assistant application process for the start of our 2011 school year. Out of those 50 applicants, C.W. Post only had 12 positions available to join the resident assistant staff for the fall 2011 semester. So, once those 12 spots are filled, what happens to the other 38 students who applied?  Students who do not make the final cut are put on a waiting list. “Any student on the waitlist maintaining the minimum criteria of a 2.5 GPA, a clear judicial record, and who is registering full-time may be considered for a Resident Assistant position, should one become available,” said Raymond Gordon, the director of residential
life. Students on the waiting list are reviewed at a later point, in the case where positions become available.
There are two ways to go about viewing the waiting list. Being put on a waiting list is neither an acceptance nor a rejection. I, personally, feel that this list gives false hope to students who are waiting in anticipation for this job. On a more positive note, Residential Life actively continues to hire students from the wait list through the months of the fall semester. This hope of getting the position means that students are strong enough to potentially be given a job, which is why I feel that there could be a chance that a few lucky students may be offered an R.A. position when one becomes vacant and ready to be filled.
“Being wait-listed is not so bad. I was wait-listed the first time I applied and got the position the second time,” said said Jacqueline Favaloro, a current resident assistant in Riggs Hall. “During the period I was wait-listed, I was able to meet with [the] Res-Life staff and go over my application process.” The waiting list gives off a sense of false hope for most students, but the chance of becoming an R.A. is what keeps them waiting in anticipation.

On March 28, 2011, faculty and students in the Media Arts department and the Public Relations program attended the Seventeenth Annual Public Relations Explorations Forum titled “Powering PR: Social Media and Technology Attracting Audiences.” The forum each year focuses on a different theme, and this spring, students learned the various ways social media websites could be used to promote a company and or an individual. The forum was organized and run by Professor Abby Dress, the Director of the Public Relations Program. According to Dress, “Our Explorations Forum showcases how our coursework is current and tied to the requirements of the field. Social media tools for the public relations practitioner are used to facilitate branding, attract audiences, and develop relationships.” Each speaker is a professional in using social media to help promote clients in their respective fields. The speakers Tracey Gittere, Theresa Jacobellis, Don Miller and Janet Caputo use various social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to promote clients and events in their respective fields of event planning, public affairs at a hospital, an issues management specialist and a social media consultant. The speaker Janet Caputo is a summa cum laude graduate of C.W. Post, graduating from the Public Relations program in 2008.  Caputo manages social marketing campaigns through participation in various social media programs such as Twitter and Facebook. She has also utilized other social media platforms such as Flickr, YouTube, Foursquare and LinkedIn.   This fall, Caputo will be teaching Public Relations 38, a course, which focuses on integrating the social media platforms Twitter and Facebook into an effective communications campaign. Caputo was chosen to teach this course because according to Dress, “It is important for our program to reflect the changes in the field and be taught by professionals who are immersed in the day to day implementation and measurement of those technologies.” According to Emily Timpson, senior Public Relations major, “The forum was very interesting and I learned different ways that social media can be used to promote an event.” Each forum is very beneficial, as students learn first hand from professionals working in the field about groundbreaking techniques, which enhance a client’s public relations, allowing the campaign to be successful.

In celebration of C.W. Post’s community, research and character, the Division of Student Success presented an event on March 30th to acknowledge the large amount of experiential education that takes place each day at Post.  The event took place in the Tilles Atrium during common hour on March 30th. The setup and feel of this presentation started off great. Each student who attended was given a raffle ticket for a chance to win a free iPhone. There were light refreshments and an open area where faculty, students and teams could sit together.  Entertainment was provided by a student DJ who goes by the name MarkXclusive, and X-Factor, the C.W. Post step team. Towards the end of the event X-factor performed an amazing routine, which left staff and students in awe.
“Our attempt today is to begin to acknowledge individuals and organizations across the institution that have made a positive an significant impact on our campus,” said Dr.
William Gustafson, Assistant Provost for Student Success. Awards given symbolized the
commitment and celebration of our community’s experiential education. Students and
faculty members were honored for internships, student research, service learning
opportunities, volunteerism and community service. The ceremony included seven different awards. They were given to people who exceed the average charitable work of one individual or team. The first award handed out during the ceremony was the Impact Award. The Impact Award was given to C.W. Post Circle K Club, for its continuous service and time dedicated to our campus and surrounding community.
The Woman’s Lacrosse team was recognized for their 493 hours of community service. The team received the Infinity Award for completing the most hours of
service of all athletic teams on campus. The Gold Heart Award went to a C.W. Post
employee, Professor Matthew Draud in the Biology department, who has shown a great deal of care for his students, in and out of the classroom. “He’s a wonderful facility member,” said Dr. Gustafson, and I can speak for many students when I say I agree.
Attending this event was a group of students who dedicated their free time to
participate in the building of homes in Mexico. These outstanding efforts were
acknowledged when they received the Global Green Award. Some students created poster presentations to organize their studies and research. Angela Calise, sophomore biology major, received the Frontier Award for her contributions in the research field. Calise studied the diversity of larval anatomy and metamorphic processes among marine bryozoans; her efforts and hard work paid off when she was honored with this award.
The character being built on this campus cannot go unacknowledged which is why the Division of Student Success did a great job recognizing those who gave back to our community and campus. Dr. Gustafson ended this event with a memorable quote by Helen Adams Keller, “Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experiences of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired and success achieved.” This event will continue in the coming years so that other students who endure experimental education can be honored and acknowledged as well.

This week, we’re going to take a little tour de Brookville, and see what this town is made of.  Literally.  According to the 2000 census, the village of Brookville has a population of 2,126.  This figure has since increased and the results of the 2010 census show a boost up to 3,465 people.
While a general population figure for the 2010 census is available, the details have not been analyzed yet, and specifics on household size and average income isn’t available, so we’ll stick with what 2000 showed us about the Village of Brookville.
To start, Brookville, New York, is 22 miles east of New York City and is contained to an area of just 4.01 square miles of land.  For every square mile of land, there is a total population of 530.45 people, whereas in New York City for every square mile there are 66834.6 persons living.  Comparatively, Brookville allows its residents much more personal space.
The Village of Brookville has an average household income of (in 2000, mind you) $200,001, and a majority of the population has either a bachelors or masters degree, which in turn helps the village to boast about its largely educated workforce.
Around town, about 73 percent of adults are married, and most families average 3.22 people.  Additionally, 94 percent of houses and apartments in Brookville are owned rather than being rented, and property taxes here are higher than in most areas in New York, which allows them to allocate more funds to local schools and services.
To top things all off, as a reflection of Brookville’s well-to-do lifestyles, each home has a median of 9.22 rooms and, again in 2000, was estimated at an average value of $1,000,001.  I only hope that my time at Post will eventually land me a career that will afford me the luxury of living here in Brookville…how about you?

The Lady Pioneers had not played in 10 days, but on Wednesday, March 30th, that did not affect the outcome of their game against the Bridgeport Purple Knights.
Aside from being their first game in 10 days, Wednesday’s game was also the Pioneers’ first ECC match up of the season. This is the first season that the Purple Knights are in the ECC, moving up from club team status to now face tougher opponents in Division II. The inexperience of Bridgeport was evident, and the Pioneers took advantage early and often, scoring seven times before the game was even five minutes old.
The Pioneers continued to dominate the Purple Knights, scoring a total of 15 times in the first half and then adding an additional nine goals in the second half, all while holding Bridgeport scoreless in the 24-0 beating at Hickox Field.
But it wasn’t just the Pioneers’ offense that stepped up it was also their defense. The defense never allowed the Knights to get anything going, and held them to just two shots for the entire game in the shutout.
In the 24-0 blowout, the Pioneers saw 14 players score a point including Lauren Spagnoletta who scored six goals, while Jackie Sileo led the way with seven points.
The road for the Pioneers got tougher on Sunday April 3rd, when they faced the Bentley Falcons in a game dedicated to the 2001 national championship team, which was honored on the field prior to the match up, for the 10th year anniversary.
The Pioneers opened the game on a 9-0 run. However, just as it looked like a repeat of Wednesday’s Bridgeport game, the Falcons attempted to make a comeback. The effort proved futile though, after the Pioneers added a few more goals to make the deficit unreachable.
Spagnoletta finished the game with seven points, while Michelle Fucich and Jackie Sileo walked away with six and five points in the 19-9 victory for the Pioneers.

Heavy hitting led the C.W. Post softball team to victory on Sunday, April 3rd, over the Lions of Molloy College.  Junior infielder Kendall Bright led the Pioneers, batting 3-for-6 on the day with four RBI and two runs scored.
In the first game, senior Sarah Kiser took the mound for the Pioneers.  Kiser earned the win, walking away with 10 strikeouts.  Solid pitching was backed up by solid hitting when Post overcame a 0-1 deficit in the fourth inning off a homerun by freshman Nicole Hagenah.  Still tied at one, the game made its way into extra innings.  The Lions managed to pull ahead in the top of the 9th, putting the pressure on C.W. Post.  The Pioneers responded in the bottom of the inning with a two-run walk-off single up the middle by Bright, giving Post the first win of the doubleheader.
Christina Berardi started the second game of the day for the Pioneers, earning her 9th win of the season and allowing only one earned run while striking out eight.  Bright picked up right where she left off in the final game of the day, knocking in the first two runs of the game with a two-run hit to right field.  RBI singles from sophomore shortstop Nicole Fierro and junior designated hitter Kristen Morcone, along with some good hitting by Molloy eventually brought the game to 4-3 in the sixth inning, but the Lions’ surge was not enough to keep the Pioneers from victory, as they walked away with the 4-3 win.
The wins brought Post’s record to 17-5 overall and 5-1 in the East Coast Conference while dropping the Lions to 17-7, 4-2 in the ECC.  The Pioneers will take the field again on Thursday, April 7th against Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y.

Coming off a tough, 8-7 overtime loss to the rival Dowling Golden Lions on March 26th, the C.W. Post men’s lacrosse team felt no ill effects, as the Pioneers (10-1) bounced back with a 9-5 victory over the NYIT Bears on Saturday, April 2nd.
The Bears (4-3) jumped out to the early lead behind sophomore midfielder A.P. Nist’s goal with just under nine minutes left to play in the first quarter. However, the Pioneers responded right back with a goal of their own just 26 seconds later, when senior midfielder Mike Messina scored his 20th goal of the season. A few minutes later, the Bears found the back of the net yet again, and went into the second quarter with a 2-1 advantage over the Pioneers.
The Bears wished the first quarter had never ended because the Pioneers came out for the second quarter with a different intensity and determination. Senior attacker Nick Coric was a man on a mission as he went on a scoring spree. He scored three goals as the second quarter began to propel the Pioneers to a 4-2 lead. However, the Pioneers weren’t done scoring just yet. Senior midfielder Jimmy Johnston also tacked on a goal of his own making it 5-2 in favor of the Pioneers in the second quarter.
The Bears continued to hang around the Pioneers, as they answered back with two goals of their own to close out the half. The Bears also continued their solid play with a goal to begin the third quarter, as junior midfielder Joe Herman evened the score up at five goals apiece.
The Pioneers quickly responded back with a goal from junior midfielder Keith Rodriguez to make the game 6-5 in the Pioneers favor. The fourth quarter was completely dominated by the Pioneers, as the Bears were shut out in the quarter. The Pioneers netted three goals in the final quarter, one by Coric, who now has 22 goals on the year, and two more by Johnston, to boost the Pioneers to a 9-5 win.
The Pioneers won the Battle of Northern Boulevard because their offense came through down the stretch, limiting the Bears’ offense to only 23 shots on goal. On the flip side, the Pioneers had a huge advantage as they attempted 49 shots on goal.
The Pioneers next matchup is on Saturday, April 9th against Mercyhurst College at 12 p.m. at Hickox Field. Mercyhurst is 7-1 for the year, and is coming off a big win over Dowling College 16-8. The last time these two teams squared off against each other, the Pioneers had the upper hand, knocking off Mercyhurst 11-9 on May 1st, 2010.

I allude to quotes from stand up comics, a lot of times when I write, because I happen to think that we laugh at jokes most of the time because we relate to them. When a joke isn’t funny, it’s usually because you can’t relate to it. Chris Rock has a very simple joke where he says, “People [are] always talking about ‘life is short’…they’re lying! Life is long.” You might be wondering, “what does this have to do with anything?” If we are fortunate enough to be healthy and to stay out of harm’s way, then, yes, life is very long. And a long life breathes opportunity for a whole lot of potential.
This potential always includes new relationships, new memories, happiness, sadness, and heartbreak. Being that life can be long, there’s always the potential for rekindling old flames, right? Well, if nothing else, it is a thought. Some people don’t believe in doing so. Some would argue that, “the past is the past for a reason.” In theory, that might be right, but I also think that that statement negates the potential for growth and maturity. What I mean is that, with time, things can, and sometimes do, change.
I wouldn’t suggest that you rekindle a toxic relationship, such as one involving verbal, physical, or emotional abuse, for example. That just doesn’t make any sense. But, we have to at least keep our minds open to the possibility that, maybe, things could be different a second time around. We’re all human and simply aren’t perfect. “Everyone deserves second chances because most do not get things right the first time. The issue comes in when one expects third and fourth chances. This is like asking others to co-sign your continuous faults,” says freshman Shira Smith. In any situation, we can always try to better ourselves. In the case of breakups, we can still try to improve ourselves, whether we were the cause of the breakup or not.
“Well,I do believe in giving second chances; we all make mistakes,” said sophomore Michelle Fraser. I just don’t believe we should always be ‘one and done,’ nor do I believe that you give everyone you’ve been with another chance. But, there are certain people in our love lives, whom I like to call “prominent figures.” They are the significant others who have had a profound effect on your life. If things didn’t really go as planned the first time around, then take that for what it was. But, time does a lot in terms of healing, and if you see growth in yourself and growth in the other person, why not take another crack at things?
The only way any of this can be made possible is if the prior relationship ended amicably. I am a big supporter of not burning bridges and of maintaining friendships. Your friendship is a foundation of everything, and in the event that you loved someone, you can always fall back on that foundation. Freshman Jazsmine McDonald says, “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me!” If it’s a true friendship, then respect and appreciation will always exist, and in that aspect, love can’t really become nonexistent. Many times, space is good, and in this long life, you’re bound to have several encounters with some of your prominent figures. Make wise choices in who you decide to give another chance to, but don’t be against giving that second chance because you really never know.

As spring approaches, you may find yourself eager to indulge in the world of shopping.  Despite the fact that in today’s economy we may find ourselves budgeting our money more than ever, there is a possibility that you still need to fill the emotional and physiological need to shop. Here are a few tips on how to spend your money wisely whether you’re shopping on a high or low budget.
Our college community is only 45 minutes away from the greatest shopping area in the world – New York City.  Although students do not always have the money or the time to roam the Big Apple, C.W. Post is right down the road from great shopping malls and other unique stores, where you can purchase something that will last.
Low Budget Shopping
If you’re looking to shop in an area that offers more affordable fashion, but still presents the newest and high-quality fashion items for this spring season, you can check out Roosevelt Field Mall and Broadway Mall. Men and women can get the same look and find prices they love. This season’s new arrivals consist of fringe scarves, cardigans, and comfy tees that are fabulous for all occasions. New canvas combat boots for woman come in a neutral cream color, and are a low price of $32.80. Similarly, men can enjoy the popular leatherette high-top sneaker in many basic colors, such as blue, black, and brown and only cost $21.90.  For a nighttime look, you may want to try a maxi dress paired with a denim jacket or casual blazer. For these trends, you may want to check out Forever 21 or Urban Outfitters; they carry what’s new and hip this season.
If you are one of those gym fanatics and can go for a good work out, light-weight, bright color jackets, and yoga pants just may be what you’re looking for. Basic short sleeved shirts, windbreakers, and wife beaters range in a variety of colors that you can get for only $15.50, at local athletic stores.   For the newest in sneaker technology, try stores like Foot Locker, for a shoe that works for you, such as the Sketcher Shape-Ups and Easy Tone by Reebok. If you look good, you will feel good too!
High Budget Shopping
We may not always have the luxury of spending a fortune, although most people can agree that once we lay our eyes on something we want it. So where are the places you can splurge for the best quality?
The Wheatley Plaza located on Northern Boulevard is right down the road from C.W. Post. If you’re feeling like a high roller and do not mind if your bill ends with a lot of zeros, check out Scoop. This store is versatile for men and women and located in other places including Las Vegas and California. Scoop offers a selection of the season’s best clothing from international acclaimed and emerging designers. Women can slip right into the sweat suit brand “Free City” with the logo “Live, Nature, Love” ranging into colors of baby blue and a mysterious faded black. Men can try a Paul Smith stripped V-neck sweater and finish it off with a flashy accessory, such as a fedora hat by Rag and Bone. Although Scoop is on the pricy side, you may step one foot into the store and feel like a celebrity.
Step into spring’s new shoe trend. New arrivals from top American and European brands include Tory Burch, Jimmy Choo, Dolce and Gabanna, Marc Jacobs, and the famous Michael Kors. Whether you are in the mood for a comfortable sneaker or a high platform heel to strut your style, you can choose from funky colors, bizarre designs, and a variety of styles. Just window shopping will make you realize the hottest shoe trends of the spring are calling your name. Shoe Box is a luxury shore store boutique that may have just what you are looking for.
Maddy’s 360 is a woman’s boutique that sells all your must-haves. We as girls say, “we don’t want something, we need it.” Maddy’s 360 is a must for the hottest clothing, accessories, and hand bags. Other high-quality stores in the Wheatley Plaza include Banana Republic, ideal for men and women, as well as London Jewelers.
Clearly, there are many places to shop and spend your money wisely, whether you are on a low budget or high one. The Wheatley Plaza, one of a kind boutiques, and nearby shopping malls will have you leaving with a feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment. In the meantime, as we are patiently wait for this warm weather to come and long to walk to class in a pair of flip-flops, get a head start on your spring shopping. It is something you don’t want to miss out on!

Sleep is necessary after a long day of grueling classes and extracurricular activities. From a scientific standpoint, the human body requires that the muscles relax and become irresponsive to one’s surroundings.  This is an essential process so that the general condition of the human body is maintained. Sleep is conducive to the body’s maintenance because it is during sleep that tissues are repaired and growth occurs. But what does sleep have to do with college students, especially on this campus?
College students are often perceived to be the most susceptible group where sleep deprivation is concerned. College students are recognized for not getting enough sleep. Having a part time job, being a part of a sports team and the demands of one’s academic schedule are among a variety of reasons as to why college students are not getting enough sleep. And why does sleep appear to be a major issue in the classroom?
Students as well as faculty members have contended with the problems that a lack of sleep has created on the C.W. Post Campus. Lourdes Noguera, a Liberals Arts major, said that the possible reason as to why students fall asleep in class is that they’re “tired [and] not getting enough sleep due to studying.” Noguera also added that she has personally never fallen asleep in class before. However other students differ on this tentative explanation for students that fall asleep in class.  Danielle Nash, a History major said that “one of the reasons students fall asleep in class is because of different schedules from high school and lack of routine sleeping habits.” Nash has also admitted to falling victim to this growing epidemic on campus. She said that although the “teacher was great [for] the first week of biology,” she fell asleep in class. She added that “it was really early and it was pretty much a 2 hour and 50 minute class.”
In addition to not getting enough sleep and taking classes of considerable duration, during a lecture in psychosomatics you have probably learned that “the more sleep [a person gets] the better off [he or she is].” And that “sleep is a basic need and without sleep a person is more likely to contract diseases.” Although this sheds light on the necessity of sleep, another professor felt that sleep deprivation was based on which academic standing, a student belonged to. Dr. Joel Mittler, from the College of Education Information Sciences, informed The Pioneer that “many undergraduate students stay up really late and graduate students have families to take care of and are just at work all day. Some have husbands [and] wives [or] children of their own.” Sleep deprivation does not affect the entire campus community in that it mostly has to do with “different time of life.”
In an effort to analyze all the possible factors that are conducive to sleep, other factors must be considered. For example, what about a student with responsibilities other than the ones mentioned? How do they play a part in this growing concerning on campus? What about stress? This refutes any theories based on the nature of sleep and why it may occur. This is due to the fact that sleep is an individually based phenomenon. A person cannot measure the effects of sleep on a student only on the basis of activity. For example, an athlete’s body in comparison to another student, who is not athletic, may have stronger physical agility and stamina. Therefore, the speculative theory that sleep is mostly not occurring on a college campus because of a part time job, being a part of a sports team and meeting the demands of one’s academic schedule is not accurate. This information obtained about sleep only provides a partial view about the ways in which sleep deprivation is prevalent on this campus.  However, if you do feel the need to sleep in or fall asleep during a lecture, please take a step outside the classroom to relieve your drowsiness. As it may be a sign of lack of respect and courtesy for the professor.

As the spring semester quickly comes to an end, college students are eagerly awaiting their summer breaks. With the thought of going to the beaches and to pools as your island getaway and becoming a beach bum ( no I am not talking about the tanning salon), summer seems as if it cannot come soon enough. You get to relax with close friends, sleep in every day, or, maybe, even take exciting vacations, so why wouldn’t you love summer? Aside from all this fun, C.W. Post students are taking different perspectives on how they choose to spend their summer vacations.
For many students, summer is more than just fun in the sun. Internships at award-winning companies have become one of the many ways to enjoy your summer because you are having fun, while you are simultaneously working and gaining experience. Don’t worry; if you haven’t applied for any internships yet, summer is a perfect opportunity to start building your resume. Internships allow college students to increase their chances of being hired after graduation. And, although it is not too easy to find a job, the summer break is a great way to maximize your chances of networking with organizations and making yourself available.
This process can be less stressful, due to the fact that classes will be over and you can devote  all your hard work and energy to landing an internship. Jimmy Bare, a sophomore political science major and student ambassador, is patiently waiting to hear  back for an internship. Bare is trying to make this summer valuable, as be hopes to intern as an intelligence analyst for the office of naval intelligence in the Department of Defense. If students aren’t quite as prepared as Bare and don’t know where they want to intern, the counselors in the Co-op office in Kumble Hall can help them find internship opportunities.
The summer is also a great time to keep up with your academic activities and,  let’s just say, not have your brain go into hibernation mode. Summer classes are offered at C.W. Post with a variety of classes to choose from. Angela Calise, a sophomore pre-med biology major, is continuing her research at Friday Harbor Labs, a  marine biology field station, located in Washington state, and she is also continuing her duties as a resident assisant, an orientation leader, and a student ambassador.
You can also receive academic credit by taking your learning experience to a whole new world…literally. The study abroad program allows all C.W. Post students to explore their surroundings and is open for students who are beginning their  sophomore year and are approved by the department chair, as well as by the director of study abroad. So, the idea of researching tropical fish and marine life in Fiji, indulging your face into the best bowl of spaghetti and sauce in Italy, and laying your eyes on a koala bear in Australia, may become real experiences for you instead of just ideas. Other popular study abroad locations include China, Spain, India, Thailand, and Costa Rica. Patty Ury, a junior earth science education major, will be spending her summer in Australia. Ury says, “I have always been really interested in going to Australia. I chose to go there because I don’t know if I would actually go there on vacation.”
If you are a gym fanatic, the Pratt Recreation Center remains open during the summer. With a full size competition swimming pool, an indoor track, racquetball courts, a weight room, and a fitness studio, students can take advantage of the opportunities offered to get a healthy and fit body that you can show off this summer. Ashley Swilling graduated from the School of Education last year and hopes to make use of the gym this summer. Swilling says, “I am applying for my master’s and hope to continue my education next year, here at Post. Although I graduated, I have a membership at the Pratt Center, and I plan on coming every day.”
Whether you decide to intern, study abroad, attend the Pratt, or simply soak in the sun, the summer is drawing closer. You can make this summer unforgettable and try new and different things. So, before you start stressing yourselves out and making your class schedules for fall 2011, have you decided what you are doing this summer?

Only 20 to 25 students can be chosen to attend the  M.F.A. in Writing and Producing for Television program offered at Long Island University’s Brooklyn campus.  But be warned, “You must be sure to check your ego at the door” if you’re willing to take it all on.
At an event that took place in the Great Hall, on March 29th, Acting Dean Benjamin Moore introduced screenwriter and producer Norman Steinberg and Stephen Molton, former executive at HBO and Showtime.  Both men are LIU professors in the writing program and have engulfed themselves where there true passions lie: screenwriting and producing.
Their goal for the program, which includes meeting experience with creativity, is to take what they’ve learned in the field and juxtapose that with teaching all the fundamentals of TV writing for audiences today. But they were not shy to admit that it gets a little intense.  “It’s like a writer’s equivalent of being in a band; the fur might fly but the show must go on,” Molton said.  Steinberg quickly added that there is no other program like this in the country.  And he would know.  He is Norman Steinberg.
You might have recognized Steinberg’s name because of his work as screenwriter in “Blazing Saddles,” “My Favorite Year” and “Johnny Dangerously.”  Steinberg has  won an Emmy, a Writer’s Guild Award and a British Academy Award nomination. As far as TV goes, Steinberg has worked as a writer, creator, show runner, and executive producer on shows like, “Cosby”; “When Things Were Rotten”; “Doctor, Doctor” and Showtime’s “Paradise.”  Steinberg can be described as revolutionary, a true pioneer in the television and film industry.  “Norman Steinberg is not only one of the most gifted co-writers I have ever worked with, but he also has been my dear friend since we did ‘Blazing Saddles’ together 300 years ago,” said famous screenwriter and producer Mel Brooks.  “I cherish both his talent and friendship.”
This is the same dedication Steinberg  bestows upon the students who  enroll in his program.  Even David Frankel, director of “The Devil Wears Prada” and “Marley and Me” says, “I’m blessed to call him my mentor and friend.  You’ll be blessed to call him ‘Professor Steinberg.’”
Molton and Steinberg discussed that the program is writing intensive; and by the time you graduate, you will have written an entire year of a TV show.  It is what Steinberg called a collaborative working environment, all of which is combined as an “interesting, frustrating and exhilarating experience.” Classes are held at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York so students can be thrown into what an actual day at work feels like.  Working in this environment  help students learn to work as a team, sharing and supporting each other’s ideas.
“It doesn’t matter what your background is; if you have knack for TV writing it can be a fabulous career path you never thought of choosing,” Pamela Spencer, executive secretary to the Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts said.  “The world of television seems exciting for individuals who have a passion for storytelling.” Film student Marc Riou knew this was his path from the very beginning and after attending the lecture Riou seemed to be even more intrigued. “As a film student, TV writing is always an option.  I would like to learn about how TV is different and similar to film,” Riou said.
Some of the courses in the writing for television program include, “Producing a TV Pilot”; “HD Video Production and Post Production”; “The History of Television”; “Intellectual Property”; and “The Internet and New Distribution Techniques.”  Students taking these courses have the opportunity to attend guest lectures from veterans in the industry who share their personal experience.  Students who  complete the 48-credit program earn an M.F.A. in Writing and Producing for Television.  Anyone with a bachelor’s degree can apply; the program is diverse in ethnicity and age.
“It’s not a seller’s market but when you get your first job, you’re in,” Steinberg said. “It’s important to get into the system.”  Both speakers made it clear that Steiner Studios is a vital place for education, where running into celebs on the lot is common.  “It’s an extremely exciting time for writers with all the new media out there,” Molton said.
As the event came to an end, it became shamelessly obvious that the world will always need storytellers.

Food, it’s what we need to live and it’s also enjoyable, so we should look forward to the times when we do eat, right? When it’s that time of day during class and you go get your food of choice, what do you guys choose? Maybe you hop on the ridiculous line at Subway, maybe it’s a quick bite at Humanities or Pell Hall, or maybe you leave the campus to get your fix, but what’s easiest for you commuters?
Last week, I did a marathon, which would be quicker to go off campus for food or to stay on campus? Obviously, staying on campus was easiest, but what was more enjoyable? One day I grabbed sushi from Hillwood and sat down on a couch and read the newspaper. Sounds placid? The next day I drove over to Moe’s and got a salad. This was all during Common Hour and I must say I wasn’t crazy about the atmosphere at Moe’s. There were hoards of students and there were barely any places to sit. I mean they do serve beer there, which is all the reason to stay, but sometimes I like a nice and relaxed environment. The food was good, but I was rushed by some students who were looking for seats, and I felt bad taking up a large table.
If I really wasn’t happy with the food choices at Post, I would just bring my own lunch and refuse to buy anything from the cafeteria, but I’m all right with the choices and anything is better than my mother’s cooking. So for those of you who are not satisfied with the food choices at Post, it’s fine but it’s not changing at any point soon so to do something about it, you have to rely on yourself. Bring your own food or drive to get yourself something you would prefer. Bringing your own lunch saves a bunch of cash; so maybe it’s worth a try? Or for those who are just neutral about the subject, everything the way it is okay for now. The food at the café doesn’t take that long to prepare and the long line at the Hillwood Café goes quickly. When looking for a place to lunch consider the options of Subway, Java City, the Hillwood Café, the Ocelot, or the library café. For off campus think of Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Yogurt and Such, Moe’s Grill, the few pizza places, the bagel café, Wendy’s, Burger King, or Ben’s Kosher Deli. Take it upon yourselves, we have the cars, so take a friend out to lunch during your break. It’s nice to take some time out for yourselves.

On Wednesday March 30, the presentation in Hillwood Commons gave a whole new meaning to playing with your food. At the event, several faculty members, including Provost Dr. Paul Forestell, introduced the new summer courses promoting the idea of sustainability.  The sustainability courses that will be offered this summer will focus on improving the environment and helping students become one with the Earth.  Courses are being offered by several different colleges in the university, and include classes in journalism, history, art and biology.
Keynote speaker and professor of Art Richard Mills said sustainability in the environment is difficult to achieve, however we should all make an attempt to try. “We are inseparable from nature, we are nature,” Mills said, “It is you and us together that will make the new stories.”
The highlight of the presentation was an interesting and unique performance by Music Department professor, Dale Stuckenbruck and the Long Island Vegetable Orchestra. He and several students played instruments made out of many different types of vegetables, creating a rousing performance that had the crowd amazed. He showed the audience how he creates the instruments and demonstrated the sounds they make. “You’re creating things from everything around you,” Stuckenbruck said, “Food around you can comfort you besides with taste.”
The orchestra consisted of squash, lemon grass, onions, eggplant and celery, just to name a few. After the performance, all vegetables were to be enjoyed by Snowball, a resident horse at the C.W. Post Equestrian Center, or placed in the compost machine in the Interfaith Center. said, “Nothing goes to waste here in an effort to maintain sustainability.”

The Fashion show of 2011 was a truly spectacular event to see.  The Runway, Circus of Sin took place at the Tilles Center on April 2nd.  The audience was filled with students, alumni, and guests.  The show was based on the seven deadly sins, focused around a circus theme.  It was well executed, displaying scenes and different fashions for each sin.  It displayed circus acts in between the scenes to fit in with the theme including show host ringmaster, Gracetelle Joseph.
The show started off with the executive board coming down the aisles of the theater with a zombie like signature walk.  Their clothing was black and the tone was creepy and gothic.  The rest of the models walked the runway doing the same thing, zombie-like, posing in all black gothic clothing.  The lighting and background music made it even more thrilling and exciting for the audience.  It was definitely the highlight of the show.
In the sloth scene, models were dressed in all white.  Men were wearing pants and no shirts.  Women were wearing a variety of styles; some with dresses, shirt and pants, and skirts.  Most of the models had mesh cloth covering their faces and holding and wearing white ropes as part of the fashion.  Their signature walk was very slow and dramatic.  Following this runway was an act by two girls who were circus mimes.
The wrath scene was intriguing in which the stage was covered in red light and all the models were crawling and hovering amongst one another. One by one each model got up from the bunch and walked, displaying again dark fashion.  Designs were made by Moneysha (MOTR). This scene was followed by a ballet performance, by three women to contemporary, classical, and hip-hop music.
The envy scene displayed two different runways, one of men and one of women.  On the first runway, the women displayed fashion that displayed lots of sparkle, glitter and glamour.  The guys wore dressy pants, shirts, and ties.
Some designs featured were by Alicia LaSalle, Shakira Jackson, the Michelle Riley Collection by Daral M. Riley, and Dennis Buchanan.
During the intermission a circus performance entertained the audience including clowns, a man on a mini bicycle, a man on stilts, juggler, mimes, and a ringmaster.
The lust scene was very provocative.  The models wore sexy clothing and seduced one another. Their signature walk was slow and dramatic.            The last scene was gluttony.  The women were wearing colorful wigs and clothing.  The fashion was casual and the women were carrying lollipops. It represented a candy theme with designs by Shakira Jackson.
At the end of the show all models, the executive board, and the behind-the-scenes crew came out and danced. Secretary/treasurer, Ashley Deal mentioned, “We really thought out of the box this year!  We worked really hard and hope we really pleased the audience.”
Angela Calise, sophomore resident who attended the show said, “The envy scene was my favorite.  Everything was glittery, fabulous, and fierce.  I would wear all of it!”  Another viewer, Neidylin Morales, a senior mentioned, “It was an amazing experience for my first time seeing it.  I was really impressed and I enjoyed it a lot.”
All proceeds made by the sales of tickets for the Fashion Show 2011 were donated to the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo. Vice President of the fashion show, Nhya East, mentioned, “All proceeds went to the Wildlife Conservation Reserve and none of this could have been done without the help of the Tilles staff, executive board, amazing models, designers, and of course – all those who attended.”
“The theme was so much fun to plan! This particular executive board had huge plans for this years Spring Show and we wanted to make sure that the show felt like an experience overall,” said East. “The idea was for the fashion to reflect the seven deadly sins and everything in between to feel circus-y, like Circus acts. That was why we had a ring mistress host and all of those act in between each scene.”
“The Fashion Show club is something you do for the experience and so that you can help raise proceeds for the charity we decide to give to each year. I can honestly say that the executive board is hard-working and sacrificial and we’ve done whatever it took to make the show a success,” said East. “We began preparing for this show during the summer of 2010; we wanted it to be early. This school year we held two shows, which we’ve never done before.”
Rebecca Blair, a participant in the show mentions, “Amazing experience!  I think the show went really well.  Shout out to everyone who put everything together.”  Christopher Maye, a graduate student, says, “Hard work pays off!  It was fun and I have never done something like that before.  It is something I would do again!”  Grace Joseph, the ringmaster host, said with excitement, “Fashion show of 2011 was great!  By far the best fashion show I have been a part of!”
Circus of Sin, Fashion Show 2011 definitely was a sight to see Special thanks to DJ MarkXclusive for providing the music.  Of course to all those who performed, models, executive board for all their hard work and for a great show!  “From this experience I’m walking away happy about what we were able to accomplish this year. It took a lot of hard-work and planning, but as always, it was worth it.” said East.

On Tuesday, March 29th, the C.W. Post Student Government Association, sororities Omega Phi Beta and Delta Sigma Theta, the Latin American Women’s Society, the Student Health and Counseling, and the Student life and Leadership held the first annual, “Heel the Sole” campaign. The event took place from 6:00-7:30 in Hillwood Commons and moved to the Long Island Room in Winnick Hall. The dedicated students put together the event to promote the awareness of violence in young adults, especially college students.
Sarah Boles, of Student Health and Counseling, was involved in this event because, “it’s still a very important issue, and students need to understand that there are places on campus they can go to for help.”
Senior Social Work major Kimberly Suarez says the event was conceived, when, “Omega Phi Beta and Delta Sigma Theta came together and decided to do a walk. It’s part of the our national philanthropy which is raising awareness violence against women.”  When asked what she hopes for the future events she said, “I hope it will be bigger and better in the years to come because knowledge for the students is so important and we want to decrease the percentage of domestic violence.”
Senior Psychology Major Jenna Provenzano, gave surveys to the students and encouraged them to stop by the event. She got involved because “one of the clubs mentioned it to me and I decided it was a good cause.”
SGA members Sandra Mendelsohn and Kristy Niemeyer, said “SGA decided to get involved because it is a good cause and we wanted students to be comfortable to talk about it.”
The event started with a sign-in at which purple ribbons were distributed and information packets were available, and then preceded to the Hillwood Cinema, where a basic informational was held. The students then walked together to the Long Island Room where raffles were held and improv games were played. The students then gathered outside for a candlelight vigil.
The walk proved to be a success. Students were engaged throughout the whole event and seemed to be interested as well. The dedicated students, who set up the event, put a lot of time and effort into it in order to make others aware of this issue.

Hello fellow Pioneers!  Last week I had the pleasure of meeting one of the most talented screenwriters and television producers of our time – Norman Steinberg.  Don’t worry I didn’t recognize the name instantly either.  Hell, I walked right passed him at the event in the Great Hall that Tuesday.  I quickly learned that Steinberg has worked with Mel Brooks on Blazing Saddles among many other things, and has been extremely influential to those looking to get into the TV writing industry.  Here, at Post, those looking to get into that industry may be a small few, however, we can all learn a little something from Steinberg.  As I was listening, while rapidly writing down notes for my article, I noticed a kind of manifested passion that exuded from his lecture.  He made me stop and realize, in the midst of graduation and job applications, that it’s okay to search for what you LOVE to do.  This journey that we’re on, should help us find that passion.
At this time, I would like to formally introduce two new successors to the Pioneer, who plan on following in my passion, Jackie Favaloro and Anne Winberry. As editors in training they took on the task of editing the paper this week – with absolutely no complaints might I add.  Job well done ladies!
This week in news, we covered the annual Fashion Show that took place last Saturday night as well as the amazing music majors who performed in the Vegetable Orchestra last Wednesday.  Playing a watermelon drum with an onion mallet – pretty damn impressive.  One reporter also covered the Red Flag event, which is our photo spread as well – check it out on page 12 and 13! Ready for spring fashion? Our features editor gives you an up to date review on what’s in, out, and least expensive.  And as always we have our opinions and sports sections covering what’s new on campus.
At the Pioneer we are proud to announce the Gaming Event taking place today in the gaming lounge in Hillwood Commons, starting at 12:30p.m.and then again in the evening starting at 7p.m.  Free food will be provided and students will get the chance to be re-introduced to all campus media.  Think you’re really good at video games?  Check it out and we’ll see you there!
One more thing!  Make sure to place your ad for our BRAND NEW classified section!  Anyone can place one, only $10 bucks for 20 words.  Thanks for picking us up! We love you.
