In honor of Diabetes Awareness month, the Zeta Phi Beta sorority hosted a “Too Sweeeeet for Me” event on December 3. The event was created to raise awareness of diabetes and other health problems that might affect college students. It aimed to show students how to prevent getting and diabetes and the importance of staying healthy. This was their first event like this and around 15-20 people attended.
Ashley Noble, the sorority’s secretary and a senior Electronic Journalism major, started off by discussing her experience with diabetes. “I found out I had diabetes 10 years ago… I was back to school shopping with my mom when I fainted,” explained Noble after she presented a slideshow on the condition. “I’ve learned to deal with it. It’s easier now that I have an electronic insulin pump that I wear at all times.” 
Her presentation focused on acknowledging the four types of diabetes , which are: central diabetes that deals with damages to your pituitary gland, nephrogenic diabetes which deals with your kidneys, and dipsogenic diabetes that occurs from lack of fluids and gestational diabetes that affect women who are pregnant. The presentation also pointed out some of the symptoms students should look out for.
After going through the preconceived notions about diabetes written on a blue banner labeled “myth wall.” , one of the campus’ dietetic interns, Dana Fierstein, spoke. She explained that because Americans were not eating right or exercising regularly, more and more people are developing Type II diabetes. “8.3% of the American population has a form of diabetes but there are preventative measures you can take,” she said.  
She explained how blood sugar levels spike with too much food, illness, surgery, stress, or when necessary medicine is skipped. You can stay healthy, according to Fierstien, by eating breakfast, limiting late night snacks and alcohol, and increasing your fiber. 
“There are some crazy diets that completely cut out food groups, but they all work together to keep you healthy and your blood sugar stable,” added Fierstein.
Dietetic interns are the campus nutritionists located at the student health and counseling center and they are free to all students who have questions concerning health issues.
 “The event made me take a step back and be a little more careful about what I eat,” said Simone Medley a senior psychology major. “I’m not really a ‘sweet’ person but after the event I got my blood tested because I don’t really eat a lot during the school year. I am a lot more cautious now.”
            “I think the event was good but it could always be better,” said Noble. “I just wanted to speak about my experience with diabetes and keep people aware of… how to eat healthy in general.”

	The residents of Post Hall were invited to make cards for the military and hospitalized children on Monday, December 3, at 8 p.m. In the program, called Cards for Humanities, the staff of Post Hall donated cards for the soldiers to A Million Thanks. “We are trying to spread the love to different people in need,” said Rebecca Fudge, a junior speech pathology major who is a resident assistant in Post Hall. The Post Hall staff, which includes the resident assistants and the residence hall director, was involved. Each residence hall was required by Residence Life to have one staff program a semester in which the RAs and the RHD are involved.
“We brainstormed and then we came up with this idea,” said Amanda Adragna, a junior speech pathology major who is also a Post Hall residence assistant. This is the first program of its kind that Post Hall has hosted. Both soldiers stationed overseas and hospitalized children cannot be home for the holidays so a card can give them a sense of comfort and joy. “We wanted to make cards out of the kindness of our hearts, we know that the troops are out there and there are children with cancer, said Mali Monges, a senior psychology major and resident assistant in Post Hall.  
	The staff at Post Hall encouraged everyone to make a card. “Anyone who wanted to come was invited. We set up in the lobby so people would see it when they passed by and could make a card if they wanted to,” said Fudge. All were welcomed, not just LIU students; family and friends of the students can help as well. “We appreciate every card; every card counts,” said R.A. Mikhail Brown, a senior music education major.  
Another resident assistant in Post Hall, Veronica Hemmienger, a junior criminal justice major, knocked on her residents’ doors informing them of the program. “They are participating and being good sports,” said Hemmienger. One of her residents, Elizabeth Hartmarn, a freshman math major, attended. “She knocked on my door, so I came to the lobby to make a card,” said Hartmarn. She said she attended another program run by Hemmienger where they made bamboo plants. Every resident assistant has to have four programs each semester that they run on their own for their particular residents. 
	There were two tables in the lobby of Post Hall with various construction paper, markers, scissors and glue to make holiday cards. People could make a card for a soldier, a child or both and could make as many cards as they wanted. The staff of Post Hall supplied all of the materials to make the cards.
	“All the R.A.s stopped me when I walked into Post,” said Jade Greco, a senior biology major. She said she walked into Post Hall and wanted to make a card for children with cancer. Greco said she always felt compassion toward children with cancer since she spoke with a nurse who worked with them who said that they are happy and grateful for what they have. Freshman musical theatre major Cody Petit, another Post Hall resident who made a card, said, “I’m making a Christmas card for anyone. This is my thing, I like arts and crafts.”  
	After two hours, the program was still going on. “We thought it would be a good turnout,” said Post Hall R.A. Nick Ciborowski, a senior broadcasting major. “We wanted to reach 70 cards, we’re almost there. We have over 50; we’re going to keep going (into the night) until we reach it,” said Ciborowski. Students from all different residence halls came to the program but most of them were from Post Hall. “It just shows how good Post Hall really is,” said Ciborowski.
Cards for Humanities went on from 8 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. 54 cards were made; 28 for the troops and 26 for children. “It was the best turn out I’ve seen in a long time. It was a proud moment to see how much our staff cares,” said resident hall director Dan Caccavale. He said he would definitely consider a program like this again in the future, maybe for Valentine’s Day for next semester or general thank you cards for the troops.

TRESemme, a brand of hair products at a lower retail price than salon products, has just launched a new interactive website called TRESemme Style Studio. The website that Noise, a company that invents new ways to grow business among young people, helped create for TRESemme is designed to assist young women learn how to wear their hair in different styles while using TRESemme products. 
	TRESemme Style Studio has two options for users. They can view over 100 how-to videos to learn new ways to style their hair, or they can use the “Instant Styler” portion of the site to upload their own photo and see what they would look like if they changed their hair color or cut. 
	“They show you techniques on different styles for your hair without making them too complicated,” Dan Duffey, Public Relations senior who is also a hairdresser at The Studio New York in Babylon. 
	The how-to videos can be filtered by the type of video you are looking for, the type of hair you have, how long your hair is and the occasion you are styling your hair for. For example, a user can enter in that she is looking for techniques to style her long wavy hair with bangs for girl’s night. A specific description such as this could narrow down the selection of videos to only 11 videos. Now the user will have videos in front of her that are made by a model with the same type of hair as hers being done for a similar occasion that she is preparing for. This was designed to cut back preparation time.
“It’s very helpful, although it seems like a giant ad for TRESemme,” Duffey said. 
	On the side of the video there is a still list of the tools and TERESemme products the stylist is using on the model’s hair to achieve the look. When watching the video on a laptop, there is a button on the side that reads “Launch Mirror.” This tool shrinks the video to the corner of the screen and allows the user to use the laptop webcam as a mirror while the video is playing so they could do their hair while the hair stylist in the video is doing the model’s hair. 
	“I actually like this site. The how-to videos are really helpful and clear,” said Devan Farrell, a junior Public Relations major. She plans to use this site to gain hair inspiration. 
	With the “Instant Styler” option, users can upload a picture of themselves to the website to see what they would look like with different hair lengths, styles and colors. If the user takes the photo with their hair tied up they can put on wigs that the site provides to see what they would look like with different types of hair; whereas, if the viewer takes the photo with their hair down, the user can actually brush, curl, straighten or even use a virtual hand to play with her locks of hair.
	“I like how you can go to the Instant Styler and see how you would look with different hair,” Farrel said. 
	TRESemme Style Studio also allows you to use the “Instant Styler” portion of the site by choosing one of four models if the user doesn’t wish to upload a picture of her own. The four models are all women with different skin complexions, which allow users to use one that has the same tones as her. 
	“I’d say it’s an excellent way to switch it up and find new and interesting ways to do your hair,” Duffey said.

	Santa Clause and turkey are symbols for the holiday season, but the body shape of these holiday celebrities is probably not what you are going for.  Back-to-back football games, long car drives, airplanes and amazing gravy are all excuses for looking like a butterball come January. I will try to give some simple tricks for you to keep you shape over the holidays.
1.	Start the day in the gym. When you know you are hitting the road to go to a Christmas party, and you know there will be a high consumption of food and drinks, the best thing to do is to get a workout in before you leave. Getting your heartbeat up will boost your metabolism, and will result in burning more calories. Also, if you get in a workout in the gym, your body and muscles will be screaming for proteins and carbs, and therefore the consumption of the Christmas food will have a positive effect on your shape.
2.	Drink LOTS of water. Water has many positive effects on your body; it keeps your body hydrated, which is key to stay healthy. Some people confuse dehydration with hunger. Drinking a glass of water before you sit down at the table will help you eat more moderately. Water also helps you burn fat more efficiently, so the after-burn effect after your morning workout will be better if you stay hydrated throughout the day.
3.	Eat breakfast. An important point during the holidays is to stay on your healthy regular diet. Don’t starve either before or after the holiday meals. It is not beneficial for you to skip breakfast before you leave for the party, as it will increase your chances of overeating and gaining weight. Studies actually show that those who skip breakfast have a 450 percent larger chance of getting obese or overweight. 
4.	Choose smaller plates. When arriving at the party, if there is a buffet, a small trick can be to choose the smaller plates. If you do, it will take less food to fill it up, and the brain will be tricked to believe you have been eating more food than you actually have. This will help, as it takes the brain 20 minutes to register that you are full, and it’s key to not eat much more after you are full, as it will go straight to your belly. Another rule could be to only taste one bite of things you like, and eat more of things you love.
5.	Stay away from alcohol. If you can, try to avoid drinking alcohol as much as possible. All types of alcohol contain a high number of carbs, but more importantly, it will dehydrate your body. If you decide to drink alcohol, drink one glass of water for every glass of wine, to keep your body hydrated.
6.	Enjoy the parties, but get back on track fast. For most of us who are not on a strict diet, the good food is a big part of the holidays and therefore we like to enjoy all the food and cakes we are presented with. This can be ok, as long as you eat healthy meals when you are not at a party. Stick with your healthy diet as soon as you are not in a social setting, and it’s important for you to get back to your normal schedule as fast as possible after the holidays, so we don’t have an incident where we extend the consumption of soda, alcohol and cookies over a longer period than necessary.
7.	Get back on
For most of us, diets, calories, and workouts are not something we are concerned with during the holidays. We want to enjoy the time with the family and good food, and if that is the case, I urge you to do it without giving the above tips a thought. Still, if you are looking for some small guidelines on how to avoid playing catch-up in the gym in January and February, some of these tips could be helpful. The key is, once again, to stick to your regular diet as much as you can, squeeze in workouts in the mornings before the festivities and stay hydrated at all times. A part of the holidays is to enjoy all the food your family is making, and you should do so, but try to be moderate.

Gabriel the Marine began as a writing collaboration between Long Island natives Michael Desmond (vocals, guitar) and Dylan Ebrahimian (violin, piano, vocals) in 2008. After gathering a full band together, they released a self-titled demo and a five-song album, opened shows for bigger bands in the New York/Tri-State area, all the while gathering a fandom for their unique indie-rock sound. Their work is highlighted by intelligently woven string arrangements, working in tandem with poetic vocals and varied guitar work. The band recently released their second EP “Stars Collecting” and toured with Taking Back Sunday and Bayside. The Pioneer had the chance to speak with Dylan Ebrahimian after his return. 
The Pioneer: It’s been about three years since the last Gabriel the Marine EP. What was the hold-up and how has the band been reaching out to fans in that time? 
Dylan Ebrahimian: Yeah, it has been a while! We put out an EP in 2009 when we were seniors in high school, and for about two years, we went through different bassists and continued to write and throw out songs as we matured as people. About two years ago, we started recording some of the songs with this producer, Jim Wirt in Cleveland, who had done Jack’s Mannequin, Incubus, etc. We did three different sessions with him, spaced out between six months each session. After that, we were talking to labels and so on, and the process just took longer and longer. During that time we’d still play shows and tour, and would make new friends this way. By taking our time we taught ourselves how to eliminate and how to satisfy our tastes/needs as a group. So, this new EP just came out on October 30 and an LP will be out in the first quarter of 2013. 
TP: The band was able to raise money for the new EP through the fundraising website Kickstarter. What was it like jumping into a project like that? 
DE: The Kickstarter was a huge help. We asked for $5,000 and anyone who donated would get something in return. (We’re still sending those out now — sorry!) The more our album got pushed back the more the gifts did. I know it’s kind of controversial, the whole fan-donation thing, within the music world, and I find myself taking different stances on it, but the money was used to make music for the people. Not to buy a tour bus or a freighter or anything like that. Anyway, I think about 40 different people donated. It shows how much difference a few people together can make. 
TP: What can you tell us about the new EP and its content? 
DE: The new EP is called “Stars Collecting,” which is a name of one of the four songs. The others are “In Tension”, “Honest,” and “Like a Child.” “Honest” and “Like a Child” were written and recorded about two years ago and “Stars” and “In Tension” were written and recorded about a year ago. They have different styles but I think all go together nicely. “Stars” is very pastoral and dreamy, and the strings I wrote on it I tried to make sound very Copland-like, really American. “Tension” is my favorite, as it sounds chilled out, but when you listen carefully, every instrument is having a complex conversation at breakneck speed. “Honest” is the straight up rock song. “Like a Child” is the ballad. 
TP: Long Island is home to a host of bands like Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, and Bayside, many of whom your band has shared a stage with. How well do you feel your band has fallen into the music scene and where do you hope to go on a larger scale? 
DE: I think what’s so interesting about Long Island music is that there are so many people to collaborate and create with. I think, although there is a definitive sound that can be mimicked too much, many of the bands that are out today are doing very different things from each other. We just toured with Taking Back Sunday and Bayside and while we all have different styles, I felt that everyone in the audience was enjoying the three bands for different reasons. I’d love to do something like that again. In general, I think there will be a lot more collaborations and crossover projects happening on the island.
TP: You and [vocalist/guitarist] Mike Desmond started writing with each other back in high school. Are you satisfied with where the band has gone in that time? Further, can you tell us about the journey the band has gone through in making your creativity a reality to share with others? 
DE: Satisfaction is a funny thing. It happens and then it’s like it never happened. But the way time works, is that you go through certain thresholds based on your decisions and actions, and that determines who you are. Based on that logic, even stupid mistakes we may have made in the past determined and shaped us into who we are today, so to regret is to regret your own existence. That being said, I find myself feeling blessed to have so many inventive, funny, and warm people in my life that I can share in this journey with. I don’t think many have experienced what I’ve experienced, and at the same time the life of a traveling musician is a well-tread upon path that probably millions have taken. It’s a funny juxtaposition of being a voice amongst the many in the chorus, and being alone.

The men’s basketball team made it four wins in a row on Saturday, December 8, when they knocked off the Dowling Golden Lions with a score of  77-67 and then defeated the Felician College Golden Falcons 90-81 on Monday, December 10. 
 Four Pioneers’ players had double digit scoring on Saturday, led by senior guard Tobin Carberry with 18 points. Carberry shot 7 of 15 from the floor and 2 for 4 from three-point range. Junior guard JaMario Clayton had 15 of his points, shooting 5 of 9 from the floor and 3 for 5 from three-point range. Sophomore forward Tyuan Williams had 14 points and junior forward Vaughn Allan rounded it out with 12 points. 
As a team the Pioneers shot 53.7 percent (29-54) from the field and 41.7 percent (5-12) from behind the arc. 
LIU Post quickly jumped on the scoreboard, grabbing a 22-12 lead just seven minutes into the first half. But the Golden Lions responded by going on a 12 -2 run to tie the game at 24 off a layup from Corwin Austin. The Pioneers grabbed the lead again, eventually pulling to a nine-point lead, highlighted by a stretch of scoring from freshman guard Dillon Burns, senior guard Billy Butler, Clayton, Williams, and Alle?an. They ended the half with a seven-point lead. 
Carberry helped the Pioneers get off to a quick start in the second half. A three-pointer less than a minute in gave his team an 11-point lead. LIU Post controlled the second half and extended their lead to the largest margin of the afternoon, with 1:57 left in the game, when senior guard Jonathan Kohler scored to make 75-59. 
The Golden Lions cut the lead down to eight with 18 seconds left in the game, but two free throw shots by Kohler nine seconds later sealed the 77-67 win for the Pioneers. 
On Monday night, a 27 point performance by junior guard Jonathan
Kohler helped lead the Pioneers to a come from behind victory over the Golden Falcons. 
Kohler was one of four players on the team who scored in double digits.  Allen scored 15 points, Carberry contributed 20 points and Tyuan Williams put up 10 points. As a team, the Pioneers shot 40 percent (27-66) from the field and 33 percent (7-21) from behind the arc.

The second half saw Felician College expand on their lead 17 in the opening three minutes of the half, off points from Anthony Green and Will Thompson. But the Pioneers began to respond. 
Kohler went on a 7-0 run with about 15 minutes left in the half, to cut the Golden Falcons lead to just seven. Buckets from Allen and Charles McCann cut the lead to four. And with 11:47 left in the half Carberry tied the game at 59 off a layup. 
Allen would put the Pioneers ahead by two seven seconds later, but Felician’s David Williamson tied the game yet again at 61. Kohler would put the Pioneers back ahead off foul shots and LIU Post would never look back. 
The Pioneers would hold on for the 10-point. 91-81, win over the Golden Falcons.  The win moves LIU Post’s record to 4-3 overall and extends their winning streak to four. The Pioneers next game is Sunday, December 16, against Bloomfield College at 3:30 p.m.

	The LIU Post women’s basketball team grinded out a victory against Pace University on Saturday, December 8, by a score of 53-43. The Pace Setters—yes, that is really the team’s name—did not do as the nickname implies. In fact, the offense of the Setters (5-3) was quite offensive. The Setters were hesitant to be around the vicinity of the hoop throughout the duration of the game. 
	Both teams played well on defense and that was the reason for only a ten point victory for the Lady Pioneers (5-1). Despite the end-result of a win, the first couple minutes of this contest were tough to watch. After four turnovers and sloppy play during the opening 2:07 of the game, Lady Pioneers head coach Deirdre Moore took out her starting lineup and allowed several bench players to spark some life into the team. 
	Junior forward Shayna Gatling scored the first five points for LIU, and contributed for her entire 16 minutes of action as she scored nine points on 4-5 shooting from the field and secured four rebounds. Senior center Samantha Kopp had another big game on both sides of the floor. And though it might not show in the box score, Kopp’s presence on defense was invaluable. She finished with nine points, seven rebounds and four blocks. 
	When the starters came back into the game after their brief benching during the first half, they looked like a completely different unit. Hustle-defense was played and guards followed through and rebounded their own shots. The Lady Pioneers were re-energized and focused as a team. Despite a rocky beginning, LIU led 26-18 at the half. 
	The second half was an even battle between both sides as the Lady Pioneers only outscored the Setters by two points (27-25). The Lady Pioneers played tough perimeter defense all afternoon long as the Setters rarely set the offense before ten seconds were even on the shot clock. The Lady Pioneers also showed aggressive defense by forcing 21 turnovers. 
	Although she went 1-9 from beyond the arc, sophomore guard Chelsea Williams led the Lady Pioneers in scoring with 11 points. Junior guard Alexis Peters nearly had a double-double as she added eight points to go along with nine rebounds. 
	The next game for the Lady Pioneers is on Sunday, December 16, on the road against the undefeated 7-0 Bentley University Falcons at 1:30 p.m.

The 2012 sports year was jam-packed full of clutch hits, big-name acquisitions and controversial benchings. This list consists of the Top 10 moments of the New York sports world that took place during this calendar year. Enjoy!  
10) The Wright Man for the Mets
	-David Wright signs mega-deal with Mets
	-There wasn’t a whole lot to get excited about for Mets fans this season, but the offseason got off to a great start as the team inked the face of their franchise to an eight year deal worth $138 million. The deal for Wright surpasses Johan Santana’s $137.5 million contract signed back in 2008 for the highest contract in Mets history. Last season, Wright batted .306, hit 21 homeruns and drove in 93 runs. Keeping the six-time All-Star in New York was a top priority of Mets’ ownership. Wright is under contract until the 2020 season, and will soon be the Mets’ all-time homerun leader as he is just 48 behind Darryl Strawberry. 
 9) Tebowmania!
	-Jets acquire Tim Tebow
 	-After the Denver Broncos signed Peyton Manning earlier this year, quarterback (punt protector?) Tim Tebow became expendable. The Broncos were eager to move Tebow, the fan-favorite, but they just needed a team to deal him to. Enter the New York Jets. The Jets had one of their quietest off-seasons in recent memory…only until the Tebow trade caused shock waves to hit New York. Despite all the hype, Tebow has had little impact on the 6-7 Jets this year. He has only attempted seven passes all season long, and his biggest impact has been as punt protector.
8) The Knicks are Back!
	-Knicks beat the Heat…TWICE by 20 points!
	-The New York Knicks have manhandled the Miami Heat in both of their meetings this season. On Opening Night for the Knicks, they cruised to a 104-84 victory in front of the fans of Madison Square Garden. But once was not enough for the Knicks, as Carmelo Anthony, Jason Kidd and Co. defeated the defending champions again on December 6th 112-92, but this time it was in Miami. 
7) No-Hit and Cy
	-Johan Santana’s No Hitter & R.A. Dickey’s Cy Young Award
	-On June 1, after over 50 years and 8,000 games, Mets’ pitcher Johan Santana threw the first no-hitter in franchise history. Here’s another cool stat: Santana became the eighth pitcher in the history of baseball to throw a no-hitter against the defending champions (St. Louis Cardinals).
	-Of course, the story of the 2012 MLB season for the Mets revolved around R.A. Dickey. He became the first knuckleballer to win the Cy Young Award in history. The 38-year-old went 20-6 and led the National League in shutouts with 27, strikeouts with 230 and innings pitched with over 230. In addition, after making his first All-star team, Dickey threw a franchise-record 32 2/3 scoreless innings. 
6) “Sanchise” Hits the Pine
	-Mark Sanchez gets benched
	-After leading the New York Jets to back-to-back AFC Championship appearances in his first two seasons as quarterback, Mark Sanchez got benched Week 13 against the Arizona Cardinals. After throwing three interceptions, Coach Rex Ryan saw enough and pulled the quarterback he drafted. Greg McElroy relieved Sanchez and the team ended up grinding out a 7-6 win over the Cards. 
5) Jay-Z Christens the Barclays, Nets Open with Win
	-Opening of the Barclays Center
	-After several concerts done by Jay-Z to open up the Brooklyn Nets’ new home, the Barclays Center, the Nets took the floor and defeated the Toronto Raptors. It had been over 55 years when the last professional game in Brooklyn was held, so there was much anticipation. Brook Lopez scored 27 points and Deron Williams added 19 points in the W. 
4) RAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL
	-Raul Ibanez comes up clutch in playoffs
	-On October 10 in Game 3 of the ALDS against the Baltimore Orioles, Raul Ibanez pinch-hit for Alex Rodriguez in the bottom of the ninth inning with the Yankees trailing by a run. Ibanez then went deep and his heroics forced extra innings and eventually a Yankees’ 3-2 win to take a 2-1 lead in the series.
	-Twice is just as nice as Ibanez came through in the clutch yet again in Game 1 of the ALCS against the Detroit Tigers. With two outs in the ninth inning down two runs, Ibanez stepped up to the plate, and the magic happened AGAIN! However, the Yankees would go on to lose the game and the series. 
3) Flirting with Trouble
	-A-Rod gets benched
	-A handful of Yankees struggled at the plate during the playoffs this season but the most scrutinized Yankee was Alex Rodriguez. That’s what happens when you make the big bucks! The highest paid player in baseball and one of the greatest homerun hitters of all time was pinch-hit for in the bottom of ninth inning with the game on the line. A-Rod has since revealed that he was playing injured and will be out 4-6 months due to a hip injury. 
2) LINSANITY!!!!
  	  -Jeremy Lin’s Magical Run
 	-There was no escaping it. Everywhere you turned you heard, “Linsanity! Linsanity! Linsanity!” It was a crazy couple of months as the former Harvard baller hit game-winning shots, broke a few ankles, and had pretty much the coolest handshake imaginable with teammate Landry Fields. However, after a contract squabble, Lin and the Knicks parted ways and the sensation is now a part of the Houston Rockets.
1) Giants on Top of the World!
	-G-Men win the Super Bowl
	-The top moment of the 2012 sports season in New York is when the New York Giants defeated the New England Patriots 21-17 in the Super Bowl. It was the second time in five years, Eli Manning and the G-Men knocked off the Tom Brady and the Pats in the Super Bowl. Trailing late in the game, Manning orchestrated his typical late-game, clutch game-winning drive. For his efforts, Eli(te) Manning was named Super Bowl MVP.

	Christmas jingles have been stuck in our heads for weeks now, and it’s becoming that time of year to start holiday shopping. Money is tight for many college students around this time of year since it’s the season for giving. 
But how do you know how to tighten your budget without seeming too cheap? LIU Post students break down their holiday shopping etiquette with these five easy tips. 
Spend the most on those who mean most. Let’s face it; you’re a college student. Many students in college are still working minimum wage jobs. The majority of people aren’t going to be expecting you to be spending every last dime in your bank account during the holiday season. Take advantage of this before you graduate and get a higher paying job by keeping your list short—a shorter list, means you will likely spend less. “I buy for my family and close friends,” said Becky Baron, a Case Program (for special education focusing on autism) graduate student. If you shorten your list by getting rid of your friends who aren’t as close to, you will have more money left to spend on those who mean more to you. “I could spend a lot if it’s my best friend,” said Amanda Miller, a senior Political Science major.  
Remember that it’s the thought that counts. It doesn’t matter how much you spend as long as your gift is thoughtful. Angela Aiello, a senior Speech Pathology major, likes to buy her friends something pretty such as a sweatshirt or a necklace but tries to stay in a low price range. “I’d want to spend $10-$15 on a friend, but I am forced to spend $20 because you can’t get something nice for $10 anymore.” Miller agrees that it’s hard to find something nice without spending too much money. When buying for a friend she often goes to the $1 section at Target because she can find nice things for cheap. In this section at Target you can find miscellaneous things such as colorful socks, picture frames and more. With a little thought, a few not-so-expensive things can be made into a nice gift to receive. One of my favorite low budget gifts to buy is picture frames because you can wrap it with a picture inside of a fun memory that you shared with that person. Frames are a great gift to give because you can find good quality frames at Marshalls for a discounted price, and most dollar stores even sell them. 
Talk about spending limits with your friends beforehand. Establishing a spending limit with anyone you are exchanging with is a good route to go, so you don’t seem cheap if they are a lot more generous than you are when it comes time for opening gifts. `Taylor Hole, a sophomore history major, said “it depends who it is,” when she budgets her money for the people on her holiday shopping list. When she exchanges gifts with friends they agree not to spend more than $20. Miller said that when she does Secret Santa’s there is a price limit of $15-$20 so everyone stays within the same budget. 
Set yourself a price limit before you start shopping. Karin Oberlander, a Health Care Administration Graduate, said that she usually spends between $20 and $40 on each person on her list. She shops for her parents, boyfriend and co-workers; however, she said that you should spend a little more when it’s your boss. Baron said that she usually spends between $20 and $30 on gifts. Setting a price limit is a useful tool to use because it keeps you from over spending. It’s easy to get caught up in the season of giving and start being really generous, but setting a limit for yourself can help keep that dreaded credit card bill that comes in after the holidays at a manageable balance. 
If you receive a gift, reciprocate the action. When you are buying gifts, you are not always thinking about the gift you will receive in return; however, it can be an awkward situation when only one person is giving and one is receiving. “I feel obligated to exchange with friends,” said Aiello. Refer back to tip number two if you get caught in this situation—it’s the thought that counts. The chances are that someone who gave you a gift that was not on your list isn’t a very close friend. Go thoughtful, rather than expensive. Bake cookies and wrap them in cellophane tied with ribbon, grab a clearance piece of sports memorabilia of his favorite team (try Modell’s, Sport’s Authority or Dick’s Sporting Goods), or even a box of their favorite candy. If you put some thought into the gift, you will have something nice to give without going bankrupt. Many people aren’t going to think about how much you spent on them if you got something meaningful, and your friend who gave you the present will be thankful to receive something in return. 
Don’t let the expenses or stresses of holiday shopping get your spirits down. The holidays are supposed to be a fun time of year, no matter what you celebrate. With some thought you can stay within your budget and still show that you care about those on your list. So remember—keep those who are closest to you on top of your list, be thoughtful and think about how much you really want to spend before you let your credit card and generous nature get you into trouble.

When Reba Gallagher (Reba McEntire) discovers that her husband, Bobby (Jeffrey Nordling), a country music legend, has cheated, her world is turned upside down. Reba, who dreamt of becoming a country star herself, packs up her mother, Lillie Mae (Lily Tomlin), and two kids, and heads for California to begin a new life in their Malibu residence. Reba gets to know their neighbor Kim (Sara Rue) and her son, Sage, but also discovers that their relocation is going to be an adjustment. The West Coast is a polar opposite of Nashville and Reba feels like an outsider. 
 	ABC is going country with the comedy “Malibu Country” and drama “Nashville”. Both new shows focus on two older females and their struggle to make it in the biz. McEntire and Tomlin steal this show while the kids don’t serve a purpose and can get annoying after a while. Like the rest of Reba’s family, her son speaks with a southern accent but her daughter does not. This does not make sense considering they all lived together in the south. In the pilot, Reba’s character constantly points out an elephant in the room, questioning Sages sexuality, which may alienate some viewers. The pilot could have been a bit more comedic with characters that are a bit more well rounded. 
Malibu Country airs Fridays at 8:30 pm on ABC following the move of Tim Allen’s “Last Man Standing.” Unlike “Malibu Country,” “Last Man Standing” has a unique family ensemble.

Dear Readers,
I would like to start off by saying thank you. Thank you for reading the Pioneer every week this semester and letting us count on you to help us improve. It is finally the last week of the semester; congratulations, you’ve made it! It’s been a long and trying semester for all of us but also one filled with huge news stories. From local news like Hurricane Sandy, to national news such as the re-election of President Obama, to campus news including the relocation of LIU Post’s commencement ceremony, we’ve covered it all. In this issue, you can find a list of the top Pioneer stories from this semester, as well as a compiled list of other top news stories, movies and songs of 2012.
Unfortunately, this issue is not only filled with holiday cheer. With the announcement of the 2013 LIU Post commencement ceremony being held at the Barclays Center and the coverage of it in the Pioneer, came an enormous amount of student feedback. You can find letters from various students in response to the commencement article in this issue as well. We proudly publish student responses and in this instance, many of us here at the Pioneer share a mutual feeling towards the matter. It saddens me to see that the only sense of “unity” really visible, is that us seniors are united in not understanding or wanting to accept the commencement ceremony being moved from our beautiful campus, that we have grown to love and call our home, to a strange and foreign place many of us have yet to even see.
On a brighter note, I would like to also thank our incredible staff for a semester filled with hard work. I believe that we all learned a lot from each other and I hope to continue to go down this positive path with you next semester as well. Over winter break many of us will be working on coming up with new and innovative ways to bring news to our campus community, so feel free to email us with all of your suggestions at cwpstpnr@gmail.com!
On behalf of the Pioneer, I would like to wish each and every one of you the happiest of holidays, a wonderful New Year spent with loved ones and tons of rest so you can come back ready to take on the spring semester!
Best Wishes,
Olivia Wicik

So seeing as it’s December and all, I usually write about spending the holidays with your boyfriend/girlfriend or what gift to give them. Up until yesterday I planned on writing my column on something of the sort. Then I overheard a conversation, and no I was not eavesdropping, the person was just walking very close behind me. The person was talking about how a friend of theirs had just gotten busted.
Apparently this friend had two cell phones, one for her boyfriend and another for other purposes. Well, to her dismay, the boyfriend found the other phone. The odd thing is, I heard a similar story about a week or two ago except is was the guy with two phones.
Obviously, there’s no need to state what the problem is here. But, just in case you’re one of the stupid people with two phones and don’t see a problem with it, let me help you out. Having a separate cell phone for your girlfriend and a second one to cheat on her with is bad. Girls same goes for you, lying is bad.
What I found funny was that the lying cheaters were thoroughly shocked when they got caught. Almost like they looked at the phone as their significant other found it like, “Oh my goodness, honey I don’t know what that is or how it got there!” For real? Sure you don’t, I’m sure you don’t know the password to the phone either.
If you don’t want to get caught, then why on earth would you bring the phone with you when you knew you were going to see your boyfriend/girlfriend? You were just asking to get busted; it’s obvious that you are pretty dumb. What are you doing with two cell phones anyway?
Are you really lacking a moral center? How do you not know that that is a bad plan and that nothing good will come of it? Honestly, only our generation would come up with such a ridiculous idea and expect it to work.

LIU Post is billing the commencement ceremony at Barclays Center as a “historic event”, but some students aren’t seeing it quite the same way. 
“I think it’s absolutely ridiculous that the year I graduate with the class of 2013, they decide to do it at the Barclays,” said senior journalism major Genna Apfel. “Many students, and myself, feel that it should just be at Post alone and not at any of the other campuses.” 
The idea of a combined commencement has been under consideration since the summer of 2011 and was made in part due to the cost of ceremony. The university is also pushing the idea that the unified ceremony would bring the Long Island University community together, though Apfel does not agree. 
“We don’t know anyone from Brooklyn, Brentwood, Riverhead,” she explained. “So why would we want to be at the Barclays Center… I am very disappointed in the school.” 
Apfel says she won’t be attending the Barclays Center ceremony. She isn’t alone, as Cecilie Nag, senior journalism major from Norway, also says she isn’t planning on attending. However in Nag’s case it is not because of the location, rather, it is due to the fact it is a week after LIU Post traditionally holds it. The commencement will be held on May 16th to accommodate the different academic schedules. 
“Since it’s so late I don’t think I will attend,” Nag said. “I would much rather have it at school where it usually is. My parents were supposed to come see me graduate, but they booked tickets already, and they’re going back the 12th.” 
The limited number of tickets available to students, two per student, has also been a source of controversy and a reason for students declining to attend. LIU Post is holding smaller ceremonies on Friday, May 11th, and Saturday, May 12th, on campus which students are finding more appealing. 
“I’m debating if I even want to walk at all since I’m graduating early,” said Marissa Lando, a senior Electronic Media major. “If I do walk I think I’ll just do the visual arts and sciences ceremony. Barclay’s is a great venture, but we have Tilles [Center] right here. I feel like it just isn’t necessary.”
Since the announcement was made two weeks ago, the University’s Facebook page has been inundated with negative feedback regarding the Barclays commencement. One poster called it “a waste of time.” While another asked: “Why would a student want to have their graduation ceremony at a campus they’ve never been to?” 
And while there seems to be a lot of backlash, it doesn’t seem like Post will change its mind this year or for the foreseeable future. President Steinberg recently told the Pioneer, “If it doesn’t work and if there’s a deep sense of anger, well that’s my successor’s problem. But we’ll probably continue doing it anyway because we are one university.”
On paper the idea probably sounded nice: a unified commencement between LIU’s different campuses at the brand-new Barclays Center. But logistically it is not ideal trying to fit the families of graduates from every LIU campus into a 19,000-seat basketball arena. LIU Post alone has over 8,000 students. It is understandable that students aren’t happy because with the move to the Barclays, you lose the tradition of graduation on the Great Lawn. 
I wouldn’t expect a large turnout from the LIU Post community for the commencement ceremony and hopefully the university will make adjustments to please the students that will be graduating, though President Steinberg’s words aren’t all that encouraging.

	In the United States, Christmas is one of the major holidays of the year. Next to only to possibly Black Friday, Christmas Eve is the shopping day of the year with an estimated $35.3 billion spent on online shopping alone. This holiday is not limited to just our country here in the U.S. There are many common traits to how Christmas is celebrated around the world from singing and dancing, gift giving, feasting and religious activities. 
	Some of the differences that exist in different countries are the date that Christmas is celebrated on and the length of the celebration. It varies according to the various traditions of different churches and local customs. In European countries, where it is common for many to celebrate the holiday, there is a twelve-day festival. It starts on Christmas day and goes on until January 6. It is a holiday known as the Day of Epiphany, giving a literal meaning to the Twelve Days of Christmas. However, the country of Mexico, which has thirty unique customs connected to Christmas, has devoted one of the longest holiday seasons called the Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon. It contains seven holidays strung together and has a period of festivities that is nearly a month long from December 3 to January 6 with a number of different feasts, piñata parties and various other practices.
	Aside for the various lengths of Christmas celebrations, there are also many distinct regional mascots associated with Christmas. Some of these mascots are older than the more well known Santa Clause but have adopted elements to make them more modern and kid friendly. One example is the thirteenth Yulemen or “jólasveinarnir”of Icelandic tradition. Originally a group of troll pranksters and criminals that harassed the farmers and scared children, they have now become the country’s version of Santa Clause. Though a foreign concept here in America, the idea of Christ the Child as the bearer of gifts is a tradition in quite a few countries. In Germany the Christkindel or Christ Child is depicted as a spirit of fairy that gives out gifts, a ringing of bell signals finished putting under a tree. In Latin America, the infant Christ as gift giver goes by different names depending on the country. One gift giving figure that is unique to Italy is “la Befana.” This is a witch that gives gifts to children on the day of Epiphany. 
	Singing and dancing is another aspect of that is common among different people who celebrate Christmas. In Germany on the day of Epiphany groups of youths, usually teenagers, call “Sternsinger” (star singers) go from door to door and sing songs dressed as the wise men that searched for Christ. Often the leader of the group holds a wooden star to represent the star of Bethlehem. In Guatemala, people come together and hold hands and sing wearing a special holiday hat known as Purtnia. The people of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras also celebrate on Christmas Eve with fireworks ranging from small firecrackers and sparklers to the larger roman candles and mortars accompanied with music.
	Of course no Christmas celebration is complete without a holiday feast. In Sweden there is the Smorgasbord feast, its name suggests it has a wide array of native foods such as fried hot dog sausages, Swedish meatballs, a potato casserole called Jansson’s Temptation, along with fish dishes, rollmops, and Lutfisk among other items. Accompanying the large feast is always something sweet. One Christmas dessert that is well known is the Italian Panettone. This is a large dome shaped sweet bread with a sourdough like consistency filled with candied fruit or raisins that is often served with mascarpone cream, hot drinks or wine. Another sweet is bread is the Roscas de reyes. It is known as “the three Kings Bread.”
	This is only a quick look at the various Christmas traditions from around the world. Hopefully this article has been helpful in providing students here a better understanding of the different cultures and how they celebrate Christmas and the holiday season.

On Thursday, December 6 from 8 p.m. to 12pm Black Students United (BSU) hosted LIU Post’s annual Kwanzaa Ball in the Tilles Atrium. The BSU executive board, President Simone Medley, Vice Presidents Akilah Courtney and Jason Reese, Treasurer Brittany Lucas, Secretary Ashley Noble, Public Relations Chair Tynesha Jones and Student Government Association (SGA) representative Maqueba Javois planned an exceptional formal. All proceeds made were shared with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund, an organization focused on Type I diabetes.
The night started off with the vocal styling of Jason Reese singing the Black National Anthem, Lift Every Voice & Sing. Following Mr. Reese was the LIU Post praise dancers Passion for Praise, blessing the dance floor with their grace. The band Something Major provided a unique mixture of Jazz and Rhythm and Blues while the dinner was being served buffet style. Immediately after dinner was served the current E-board lit the candles of the Kinara and introduced Bronx native performance poet, author, and teaching artist, Eboni Hogan.
Then there was the party. Students of all races joined together on the dance floor for the remainder of the night. DJ Sparkx provided oldies, throwbacks, new-aged and a mixture of cultures. Everybody in the Atrium got out of their seats; students and staff alike. There was not a dull moment on the floor!
Kwanzaa is a holiday celebrated by African Americans all throughout the world. It lasts from December 26 – January 1. The holiday was created by Dr. Maulana “Ron” Karenga, a professor in Black Studies, in 1966. The name comes from the Swahili phrase “matunda ya kwanza,” which means “first fruits of the harvest.” The holiday celebrates actions of coming together as one. There are seven symbols of Kwanzaa, the Kinara, the Mishumaa Saba, the Mkeka (the mat), Mazao (crops), Muhindi (ears of corn), Zawadi (gifts) and Kikombe Cha Umoja (unity cup). The Kinara, or candle holder, holds seven candles, three red, three green, and one black called the Mishumaa Saba (Swahili for the seven candles).
After a session of drumming or reading, on the first night the black candle is lit representing Umoja or unity. Each night the new candle is lit and is followed by the lighting of the previously lit candles to reaffirm the previous lessons. This candle is significant to those who celebrate Kwanzaa in representing that their people come first. The next three nights consist of lighting the red candles (struggle) from left to right: Kujichagulia (self determination) Ujamaa (cooperative economics) and Kuumba (creativity). The following three nights the green candles (hope) are lit from the one closest to the center outward.
The Kwanzaa Ball allowed students who celebrate the holiday to honor their beliefs, while providing a night of dancing and culture for others.

	Each December, Hillwood Commons Information desk is decorated with snowflakes for a program called Project Snowflake, which is sponsored by the Office of Student Life and Leadership Development, which gives gifts to children in need. The FEGS (Federation Employment and Guidance Service) Health and Human Services in Syosset sends LIU Post’s Office of Student Life and Leadership a list of what presents, children ages 2-15, are asking for this holiday season. Project Snowflake grants their wishes. 
 	Debbie Weiss of FEGS Health and Human Services Project Manager of Volunteer Services says, “We have been working with Jeannette Murray and Project Snowflake for several years and we are always astounded at the generosity and thoughtfulness that the LIU community shows for families and children in need across Long Island.”
	“I think Project Snowflake is such a wonderful thing,” says senior Education major, Jacqueline Klingler. “Being able to give a child a present for the holidays makes you feel so good inside.”
 	Any member of LIU Post is able to participate in this event by stopping by Hillwood Commons Information Desk and asking for a snowflake. Each snowflake has a number that is matched to the list provided by FEGS, which gives the gender and age of a child and the gift they are asking for. Klinger also says, “I wish I knew about the program before they ran out of snowflakes. I was never aware of this!” 
 	 Project Snowflake has been going on for a few years. Fernando Mendoza, Associate Director of Student Life and Leadership, states that 50 snowflakes were made available this year and were given out within a week. “This is an awesome program… The campus enjoys giving back to these kids and likes getting involved.” 	
All gifts must be wrapped and are due back to the office on December 12 and delivered by SLLD to the children. Mendoza also says: “This year alone we have had students, clubs, administrators and faculty participate and every year the gifts brought back are so thoughtful and sometimes people will supply us with even more than what is asked.” 
Weiss also expresses her appreciation for the LIU community, “Without the assistance from the students, staff and faculty at LIU, our organization could not provide holiday gifts to the many struggling Long Islanders during the holiday’s season.”

Freelance journalist Ruth Bashinsky spoke at the final “Food for Thought” lecture of the semester on December 6 during common hour in Humanities 027. Bashinsky, who has freelanced for publications including the New York Times and Newsday, discussed her experiences with news gathering and how she did everything from crash celebrity weddings to sneak into maternity wards to get a story. With 15 years of experience as a journalist, she has covered stories ranging from murders to fashion shows to the scandal involving former president Bill Clinton’s extramarital affair. 
Bashinsky now writes for the Daily News and largely deals with entertainment stories. She believes that if celebrities “put themselves out there” then their personal lives are fair game and their privacy is compromised. “Yeah, you feel a little sleazy…,” she began. She went on to tell a story about how she once obtained a story overhearing a conversation in a bathroom stall. “The Daily News is a tabloid and it is a whole set of different rules. You try to be compassionate but at the same time, you’re trying to get a story.” 
Along with talking about issues involving celebrity privacy and ethical newsgathering, Bashinsky discussed how students can “make things happen” for themselves. “With Twitter and other social media… there are stories everywhere,” she said. “Back in my day, the internet was just starting but now you have to know how to use [them] if you want to get a job. Who knows where newspapers will be in 10 years, so you have to be good at everything.”
Bashinsky’s career has not centered on just entertainment. “Try to work in as many departments as you can,” said the former public relations practitioner who also mentioned that her experience in public relations helped her journalistic career. “As much as I liked PR and it’s a great field to be in… journalism was where I wanted to go because I had an appetite for news. I’m a news junkie.”
“I thought the lecture was very interesting because you don’t hear too much about journalists that work in tabloids,” said Christopher Infantino, senior English major who attended the lecture. “You don’t really know how much work and research actually goes into getting these stories… I thought it was really cool to hear her perspective on that world.”
The Food For Thought lecture series will begin again on January 24 with Jonathan Clark from 880 CBS Radio.

To the Editor:
I applaud you for publishing the article “Commencement Move Draws Mixed Reaction.” Students have been attending and graduating from this college for over half a century, long before there was ever an LIU Post or a Barclays Arena. To move the Post graduation ceremony away from our campus and its long history and academic tradition is a travesty. The fact that Post will hold “individual Deans’ Recognition and Awards Ceremonies” before the event in Brooklyn proves that the administration recognizes that the students involved in the ceremony at the Barclays Arena will be part of a vast, impersonal blob of students from other colleges that they do not know and have never met and will be seated in an building that is all of six months old that they have zero connection to.
Thus, the administration will have to hold two graduations, as it were, in order to mollify students and provide lip service to individuality before it is sacrificed at the altar of synergized corporate branding. (i.e. the new ‘L.I.U. Post’) I doubt the graduating students will feeling any sense of school pride on the 16th as they sit in the middle of a giant basketball stadium staring at the corporate logo of a multinational financial services corporation. After all, everything is subservient to the almighty dollar sign in today’s impersonal synergized world.

Dear President Steinberg,
In addition to my own personal vendetta, I have been asked to represent the Social Work club and the Social Work Department to express our concerns and disappointment regarding this year’s commencement. As you said yourself in the memorandum sent out November 28, commencement is about “linking each institution to its own roots and all to a tradition that dates back many centuries.” In the case of Post, we have our own roots and traditions which include a ceremony on our campus for the past 53 years. Last year was detrimental to students because of the name change, but at least the class of 2012 was able to hold onto C.W. Post’s tradition graduating in the white tent on the Great Lawn with their entire graduating class. As an orientation leader, I was able to witness the community that had formed and seeing the entire class together as one, really gave me something to look forward to for my own graduation. I am now saddened to find this tradition and unity of C.W. Post has been broken.
This ceremony at the Barclays Center is not an adequate form to celebrate our academic achievements. The maximum of two guests is a perceived potential problem, as many students have expressed already.
To have guests travel to Brooklyn to a large venue and then exclude family members from entering is unsuitable. Not to mention the discrepancies between academic calendars forcing Post to wait for Brooklyn tograduate. However, what is most infuriating for Post students is the new three ticket limit for the ceremonies on our own campus.
Due to the amount of money this school has spent on a frivolous name change, the wonderful tent we look forward to seeing every year will be absent. With the tent on the Great Lawn guests were unlimited and everyone could witness the students graduate. Now with the two separate days for recognitions and awards at Post, tickets are limited to three per student, where in years past this was not the case. Families are going to be distraught and a time of happiness will be turned into pressured decision making for the students on who can watch them graduate and who is not worthy enough to earn the golden ticket. In addition, the separate days will destroy this campus’s unity. Not everyone will be seen in their cap and gown on the same day. Families and friends will not be together for this special event we have all looked forward to for the past four years.
I would also like to acknowledge your quotes in The Pioneer dated December 5. Apparently our opinions about our own graduation is not important enough because “if there’s a deep sense of anger,” oh well. You are passing this problem onto your successor which I find to be widely inappropriate and unprofessional. For you to end your career at this school in this manner, only shows your eagerness to leave and an absent compassion towards this school and the students. We may be one university under our new “logo”, but this is one campus, with one student body who hold one opinion on our one and only college
graduation. I sincerely hope you consider my opinion and the opinions of others I am representing as well. I look forward to your response and I hope we can come to terms where your wishes as well as the students’ wishes are met.
Sincerely,
Audrey Thompson
Graduating class of 2013
