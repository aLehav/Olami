	The change in location to the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn for a university-wide commencement ceremony has been revoked for the LIU Post, Riverhead and Brentwood campuses. LIU Post’s graduation for the class of 2013 will be held in its traditional place—the Great Lawn. 
	“I had a strong sense that Post wanted its own thing,” said LIU president David Steinberg during an interview with the Pioneer last week, after being adamant about the location in Brooklyn being a final decision when the change was released. 
	After President Steinberg announced the university-wide commencement ceremony on November 28, senior social work major Audrey Thompson started a petition to raise awareness that many seniors were less than pleased with the decision to move the graduation to the Barclay’s Center. 
	“It’s our campus and it’s about our Post pride. It’s always been here; we didn’t want it to change. We want to be proud of our campus. It’s beautiful with the big tent on the Great Lawn. It’s momentous,” said Thompson. 
	Thompson reported that she expected to get a lot of signatures on her online petition (found at change.org); however, she did not expect the school to actually change it.
	“Everyone was telling me it was set in stone already—they’re not going to fix it, but good luck. I at least wanted to try and make some noise and let the administrators know that we are not okay with this,” Thompson said. 
	The Pioneer reported on the dissatisfaction of students when the press release of the university-wide commencement ceremony was first released on December 5. 
	“I thought it was a great loss [bringing the commencement ceremony back to the Great Lawn]…[but] I wasn’t looking for a fight,” said President Steinberg. “We are one university; our degree comes from Long Island University,” he adds. He said that the day was about the students and through letters sent to him he felt that they wanted to graduate following tradition and repeatedly said that he didn’t want to fight about it. 
	If the ceremony was to be held at the Barclay’s Center, it would have saved the university thousands of dollars. The tents rented for the ceremony on the Great Lawn cost about $200,000. When the Barclay’s center was built, it made an agreement with Long Island University to give the university access to the venue and discounted tickets for events. The graduation ceremony is complimentary in the agreement and would not cost the university anything, according to President Steinberg. Brooklyn, Hudson and the pharmacy school will continue to have a university-wide commencement ceremony held at the Barclay’s center for the class of 2013. 
	The ceremony at the Barclay’s Center is scheduled for May 16, after Brooklyn’s semester ends. Because Post will now be having its own ceremony on the Great Lawn, the date has been changed back to the original date of May 10. 
	“The officers, the president and the trustees looked at it from the perspective that it is such a phenomenal venue available. Given the recent successful efforts to create a better branding platform for Long Island University, it was thought that we could signal to the world the true value and size and diversity of Long Island University by having everyone graduate there,” said Paul Forestell, LIU Post Provost. 
	Forestell reported that he saw a mixed reaction from students about the location of the ceremony. However, many students put up a fight to have the ceremony back on Post’s campus. 
	“I will be graduating with the class of 2013 this year, and I think the new plan for graduation is completely against what we the students want and deserve. We are not interested in a money-saving, irrational ceremony in which we are not familiar. We deserve to graduate alongside our lifelong friends at one time, together, with our family members watching us, not within a packed center in which we have no personal connection to,” said Samantha Osgood, senior Sociology major and Political Science minor.
Many students felt strongly about the issue and raised their voices about it. The petition had 174 signers and President Steinberg said that he received a lot of emails in regards to the new location. 
“People became all misty-eyed about the tent,” said President Steinberg. 
	Besides students voicing their opinions, there were several other issues that Forestell suggested likely had an impact on President Steinberg’s decision to bring the ceremony back to the Great Lawn after the administration was adamant about its previous decision. Because there would be more students attending the ceremony each student would start off with having only two tickets each (President Steinberg said that this is standard at all American universities) until Long Island University found out how many graduates were actually attending. Another issue was that on the day selected for Long Island University’s commencement ceremony by the Barclay’s Center there were other events going on at the venue. This compressed the amount of time the university had to do the ceremony. 
	“If this is what Post wants this is what they will get…this is about you [the students],” said President Steinberg.
	When President Steinberg retires after the 2012-2013 academic year, the fate of the commencement ceremony will fall in the new president’s hands. As for this year, graduation will follow tradition and be hosted on the Great Lawn. 
	The ceremony will be coordinated by Beth Carson, Registrar, this year as Dana Weiss, associate provost for Business Operations and Auxiliary Services, resigned. She announced her resignation on November 15, 2012, and it was active on January 1, 2013. Carson was asked to take the position to coordinate the commencement ceremony by Forestell. 
	“We will use the playbook of years’ past,” said President Steinberg about how the ceremony will differ with a new coordinator. Weiss left behind scripts and contacts; therefore, Carson will be able to run the graduation similar to previous years.
	“As a leader it’s your responsibility to make decisions that you truly believe are in the best interests of the institution and the people that institution serves. And there are many that say if you’re not ticking someone off, you’re not really doing your job right,” said Forestell.

On January 21, President Barack Obama had his inauguration in Washington D.C., marking the beginning of his second term as the President of the United States. The inauguration allowed the President to get sworn into office in front of the nation, including over 20 million viewers watching on television. The day started at St. John’s Episcopal Church. The inauguration continued with a ceremony with performing artists such as Beyoncé, who sang the National Anthem, and Kelly Clarkson. Afterwards, the President gave his inaugural address. Obama noted the country’s improved economy and ever-growing greatness; he then proceeded to promise his action and responsibility to the nation. He also emphasized the phrase, “We the people,” as a way to connect to his fellow Americans. Vice President Joe Biden was also sworn in for his second term. The event ended with the inaugural parade and at night, the Inaugural Ball.
For the President, this event was an important occasion. Winning his second term is nothing less than pure bliss. However, Post students were mixed about how important this ceremony was for them. “I did not watch it myself, but I think the ceremony is important because it’s a part of the national heritage. As an international student, I don’t feel as compelled to watch it. Even though the President of the United States is someone everyone knows a lot about around the world, I think this sort of ceremony isn’t interesting unless you are an American,” said Mattias Victorin, a junior computer science major and an international student from Sweden.
“It’s not very exciting because it’s the same president as last time. It was more important the first time since it was making history. It’s more entertaining to see the election,” said Tore Hynnekleiv, a junior film major and an international student. Another student, Tiffany George, a senior criminal justice major, also thought it was an important event but it was not interesting to watch. “It is really just about what people are wearing and what celebrity was there.” She believes that this time around it is not interesting, but still important to acknowledge that Obama is president. As a student, electing Mitt Romney would be bad since he, according to her, is not as concerned about education as Obama. She thinks it is important to show our support and that the nation cares.
Even though LIU Post did not screen the inauguration on campus, it is still something that people seem to be well informed about, but maybe not enough to spend their time watching it. After all, on Inauguration Day, students were busy moving back into the dorms and getting settled in for the new semester. Nevertheless, both the Presidential debates and the election are events that a lot of students decided to tune in to. Now that Obama has begun his second term, his actions are more important than ever.

Winter break might be over, but for those looking to start planning spring break already, the sunnier tourist season among the Caribbean Islands lasts until April. Here is why the Dominican Republic might be the right choice and the right price.
When searching online for hotels and roundtrip flight tickets to the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean Sea, what usually comes up are expensive offers to luxurious all-inclusive resorts. But for those looking to experience more than the hotel’s own restaurants, bars, and not-so-funny activity crew, traveling around the country for one week is an affordable option. 
In March, there are still available flight tickets to the Dominican Republic, starting at $350. Booking hotels or hostels with good standards does not have to exceed $50 a night, and depending on how many people are in your party, prices can be shared. 
Upon entering the country, you will notice that prices are remarkably lower compared to the U.S. A twenty-minute cab ride costs roughly $5, a two-course dinner, including beverage can be bought for $10, and when traveling between cities, long-distance buses charge  $10 for a four-hour ride. 
With that in mind, here’s a travel suggestion! Book a one-way flight to the Puerto Plata region in the North, and go to Cabarete, a spot for young people, backpackers, and adrenaline junkies. If you are into board-, wind- or kite surfing, or simply curious to try, this is the place. At the beaches Kite and Encuentro, professionals or amateurs enjoy moderately high waves and strong winds, and hotels/ hostels offer gym classes and healthier food, serving energy smoothies and veggie-wraps. At nighttime, beach bars or local clubs in the area are the places to be. 
Traveling further to explore more, the trip from Puerto Plata to Santo Domingo, a trip from North to South, takes place onboard comfortable coaches. The bumpy, sometimes muddy roads, do not offer equal comfort, but the journey provides a reality check beyond resorts and paradise-like surroundings. Here, people live in thatched roofed sheds, among malnourished cattle, many miles from the nearest grocery store. 
Santo Domingo, the capital, is reached in five hours. The historical city was founded in the late 1400s, and in the Colonial Zone, the castle of Christopher Columbus’ son Diego still stands, together with a statue of his father, today visited by hundreds of grey doves. A stop at the city’s botanical garden, or a stroll down the ocean-side boardwalk is also recommended, but here you cannot go for a swim.
Therefore, finish by visiting some of the best beaches in the Eastern parts of the country, (and book your flight home from the Punta Cana airport). From Santo Domingo, there is access to the Punta Cana area via the recently opened, modern Coral Highway, for $10 per bus ticket. 
Punta Cana is crammed with gigantic resorts built on the pure white beaches. During tourist season, it gets crowded with guests wearing all-inclusive bracelets in every color. The numerous hotels offer many activities such as volleyball and aerobics and there are multiple water sports centers where activities like parasailing, or pirate ship tours can be purchased. At nighttime, parties happen in the resorts, – check out the Hard Rock Café Hotel & Casino. 
Helpful tips when traveling in the Dominican Republic:
Not very many Dominicans speak English. If you don’t know Spanish, bring a dictionary! 
Do bargain. Cab drivers and vendors attempt to charge more than necessary; price negotiation is recommended.
Always bring cash as few taxis and stores accept credit or debit cards.  
Be careful! It gets pitch dark at night since many roads don’t have streetlights. Don’t walk home alone; take a cab.

I would like to announce this all-new column called “Tip of the Week”, dedicated solely to you guys: the students of LIU Post. Each week, a new tip will be published by your fellow students about all the different types of situations you may face during the semester, how to deal with them, and how to eventually benefit from them. Follow us throughout the semester, and if you are facing any problems and want our advice, or if you have a tip of your own, be sure to email us at cwpstpnr@gmail.com!
Now, let’s jump right into this. Most students would agree that the requirement of group projects is a legal method of torture taken advantage of by a large number of professors. We wonder what crime we as students have committed that was so terrible that it caused professors to use this technique to torment us. What have we done to deserve this?
Well, I’m going to let you in on a secret: group projects may not be as terrible as they seem. Once you get the hang of them, you realize that they are actually much more beneficial than they are painful. I know you don’t believe me, so I’m going to give you some tips on choosing, managing and succeeding in your group.
#1: Choose the Right Group Members
The choice you make about who your group members are will definitely impact the quality of the work you do and whether or not you enjoy it. Of course and unfortunately, there are some professors who select your group members for you. If this is your situation, jump to tip #2.
If not, listen closely, because working in groups isn’t about spending more time with your friends. It’s about taking part in an environment that exposes you to different opinions, beliefs, thought processes and approaches to different concepts. It’s about learning how to form relationships and get along with people you know as well as people you have met for the very first time, which will definitely play a key role in any career path you choose.
So, who to choose? I tend to always tell people, “I have no friends when it comes to group projects.” Sounds awful, I know, but it’s the truth. When I have to choose group members, I go after the individuals I know are committed to their studies and will do an excellent job regardless of how busy they get (which most of my friends are). Most often I find that people with really busy schedules tend to do their work on time as compared to those who are “taking it easy.” So, when you are in the process of selecting your fellow group members, make sure you make your decisions based on their capabilities rather than your relationship with them. And, most importantly, never be too shy to tell someone “sorry, I can’t be in your group.”
Mitch Sierakowski, a junior business management major, has a different perspective. He says that if he knows a friend will not do his share of the work, he would “take him on and try to push him to do it,” but, if that doesn’t work, just “give him an easy part.” This is probably because Sierakowski finds group projects “fun and easy if you can work with people you know.” Additionally, James White, a graduate student in the MBA program says, “I will always prefer to work with friends. I do recognize that at times this may lead to procrastination, laziness amongst the group, and a general laid-back nature, but I find that it is a lot easier to get on the same page, and, worst comes to worst, you can usually put a friend in their place with more ease than someone you don’t know!”
#2: Stay on the Same Page
When working on the project, make sure all group members are present at the same time (at least during the first meeting) so everyone stays on the same page. If someone is not there, make sure you email them the details and what is required. As a group, you need to first discuss the project and what steps need to be taken in order to accomplish its purpose. Lay out the steps and let each person choose what step he or she wants to do. If one person ends up with a difficult or time-consuming part, make sure other members take on more than one easy part. Basically, make sure the work is divided evenly and fairly among all the members.
Also, always remain up-to-date with what is going on with each member and the overall project. Do not leave anything until the last minute, including the PowerPoint (if required). Working over a few weeks is much more comfortable and effective than cramming everything to the weekend before the project is due.
#3: Work Together
Always help other group members out. Remember, a group project entails teamwork, which, according to the Encarta Dictionary, is the cooperative effort of a group. If one person has trouble doing something, guide him or her in the right direction and even show them how to go about doing it. 
Most importantly, do not be narrow-minded or intolerant of other group members. You are all in this together. Some individuals might be slower learners or just not understand the material as much as you do. This is not because they don’t try hard enough; sometimes you are forced to take a class because it’s a mandatory elective (ex. Philosophy or Art), but you have no interest in it and therefore do not understand anything. It happens even to the most intelligent of people. So, be patient and understanding, and make sure you motivate each other through the semester.
#4: Be Professional
I know that everything I’ve described so far is easier said than done. Problems and misunderstandings arise between group members very often – whether we like it or not – and although we typically can’t control their occurrence, we can control their magnitude and duration. When you find yourself in a group with people you just can’t work or get along with (whether friends or other classmates), always remain professional when handling the situation. Remember, you’re all in this together and, since most professors will not become your “mom” to fix your problems for you, you’re pretty much stuck where you are for the rest of the semester. As a result, the group as a whole must be able to properly communicate with each other and resolve any problems.
Also, don’t let someone’s attitude affect the group. Not everybody is as sweet as sugar or as outgoing as you would like them to be. Respect each other’s personalities and abilities, and as long as the work gets done, who cares?
Of course, there are always those people who will not do any work no matter what. And they always have an excuse. This is where you wish you were the professor and could straight out give them an “F.” But you can’t. So you have to know how to deal with them. One year ago, I was in a group where everybody was really great, except this one kid. All the work was done except for his. We had given him two weeks in advance to do it, and would every few days send him an email to ask him what happened. Guess what, he never replied. When we saw him in class, he’d say “yeah, yeah, I’ll do it.” Sure he will… If it was up to him, he would have never done it. So I waited, but the weekend before the project was due, I sent him an email and told him, “if you don’t want to do your part, or don’t have the time, fine; I will do your part for you. But, since you did not do any work for this project, your name will be removed from the paper and PowerPoint.” Guess what? The next day his part was completed. Problem solved. No hard feelings.
However, if he didn’t do his part, yes I would have removed his name. Most people wouldn’t have, but I don’t believe anybody has the right to receive my grade when I’m the one who worked for it. Unless they got in a car accident and are lying in the hospital on a ventilator, there is absolutely no excuse.
#5: Learn from your Group Members
Keep in your mind that this is a significant learning experience for you. White confesses, “Personally, I prefer to work in groups. At the end of the day, I know I have a good work ethic and I have confidence that I will get the job done some way or another. But to say that I will have the best ideas or best input is outright silly, and that is where group work excels I think. From my experience, the ideas of 2 are better than the ideas of 1.” He adds, “working individually will only expose you to your thinking and your opinion of the task at hand. Group work almost forces different mindsets to be exposed, and then ideally takes the best parts of each and consolidates an outcome.” Most importantly, White points out how group work is an essential part of graduate studies. He says, “undergrad teaches you the concepts and how they would apply to a particular task. Grad basically says okay, here’s what you learned, now apply it to a particular situation and say how it applied, why it applied and what the outcome was.” This application takes place in a group environment. So, if you’re planning on pursuing a graduate degree, or getting any type of job after graduation, make sure you learn how to manage and be a part of a group. It will pay off.

LIU Post freshman butterfly/backstroke swimmer Joyce Kwok did not realize that her 53.93 and 2:00.16 times in the 100-yard and 200-yard butterfly had ascended her to fastest female in Division II swimming.
“I did not know I was the fastest swimmer in D II until my coach and teammates told me,” Kwok said. “I feel proud of myself that I have come this far, but I know there are more people that are faster than me. I hope to continue improving my swimming.”
The freshman from Middle Village, New York, has been a part of why the Pioneers are currently ranked ninth in Division II swimming. In her last two meets, Kwok has blown the completion away grabbing five first place finishes in LIU Post’s meet against Siena College. She finished with a time of 2:12.85 in the 200-meter butterfly against the University of Bridgeport.
“Her obvious talent has helped to propel our relays to a higher level,” LIU Post swim coach Maureen Travers said. “…and has them currently ranked as high as third in the country for Division II. She is a team player and helps to push her teammates to achieve their best during practices as well as at meets.”
Kwok’s success should come as no surprise. She was a stand-out swimmer at Francis Lewis High School, where she was enshrined in the school’s Hall of Fame in 2011. She spent all four years of her high school career on the varsity swim team and was named most valuable player in 2008. In 2011, she was awarded the Public Schools Athletic League Senior Award and Senior Athlete award.
With all of her high school success, one would believe she had been swimming her whole life. But that is not the case. Kwok did not start swimming competitively until she was 11 years old. “At first my parents did not want me to do any sports,” she explained. “But they wanted me to learn how to swim so that I would not drown. And I came to like swimming so they let me join the swim team.”
Clearly it was a wise decision considering what she has accomplished. Kwok and the Pioneers next swim meet is Saturday, February 2, at 6:00 p.m. in the Pratt Center.

 Today is LIU Post Pride Day! At the Pratt Center tonight, both the women’s and men’s basketball teams will square off against Dowling College. Fans that attend the game are encouraged to wear green for a “Green Out.” Giveaways and other promotions will be available for those who join in the festivities. 
	The first game on the schedule is the East Coast Conference rivalry between the Lady Pioneers (12-5) and the Dowling Golden Lions (15-2). In its most recent game on Saturday, January 26, the Lady Pioneers lost to the Bridgeport Purple Knights 72-66. The last three games for LIU Post have been on the road, but the Lady Pioneers return back home tonight after winning only one of those contests. However one statistic you cannot ignore is that the Lady Pioneers are undefeated at home this season. The team owns a 7-0 record when playing in front of family, friends and fans in the friendly confines of the Pratt Center. 
	The Lady Pioneers are led in scoring by senior forward Nicolette Marciniak. She averages just under a double-double for the campaign with 15 points and more than 9 rebounds per contest. Junior guard Alexis Peters is the only other player averaging double figures in scoring as she puts up 11 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals per game. 
	On the flipside, the Golden Lions are the top team in the ECC, as it owns a 15-2 overall record and a perfect 9-0 record within the conference. The Golden Lions have won 10 consecutive games and the team’s last loss was back on December 11 when it was edged out by Bentley University. On the road this year, the Golden Lions are 4-1. 
	The Golden Lions have an extremely deep team, but the team is clearly led by senior forward Danielle Wilson. She played three seasons at Baylor University. Yes, Baylor; as in the top Division I college basketball team in the country. This season at Dowling, Wilson is having her way, dropping 17 points and grabbing nearly 11 rebounds per night. By the way, the last time LIU Post and Dowling faced each other was back on December 4. Dowling won at home by a final score of 57-46. 
	Just in case you wanted another cool storyline about this game, here it is: senior guard Ashley Caggiano of the Lady Pioneers will be facing off against her sister, Nicole, of the Golden Lions. 
	The LIU Post men’s basketball team also has a 12-5 overall record, it boasts a 7-2 record within the ECC. Exactly like the women’s team of LIU Post, the Pioneers have lost two of the last three games (to NYIT and Bridgeport). In the most recent contest, the Pioneers fell 82-74 to the Purple Knights. In the loss, junior forward Vaughn Allen was unstoppable and reached a career-high 33 points and also secured 14 rebounds along the way. 
	Tonight the Pioneers return home, which has treated the team well this season as the Pioneers are 7-1 at the Pratt Center. The Pioneers are led by two of the top scorers in the East Coast Conference. Senior guard Tobin Carberry is number one in the conference as he puts up 18.4 points per game. Also, Allen is fourth with 17.4 points per game. Allen is also second in the conference in rebounding per game (9.2) and field goal percentage (55.3 percent). 
	The Golden Lions are 7-10 overall and 4-5 in the ECC. In the most recent game on Saturday, the team suffered a tough loss to Saint Thomas Aquinas College by a final score of 68-66. However prior to that, the team has won four games in a row. The Golden Lions have three players that score at least 10 points per game, but the team is jumpstarted by sophomore guard Darien Davis who averages 12.5 points per contest. Earlier in the year when LIU Post and Dowling faced each other, the Pioneers had the upper hand as it won 77-67 on the road. 
	All of your coverage of LIU Post basketball can be found on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org. Pregame for the women’s game starts at 4:30 p.m., with tipoff scheduled for 5:00 p.m. Then the men’s game will follow with a scheduled 7:30 p.m. tipoff. So go to the Pratt Center tonight, show your Post Pride, wear the color green, cheer on your fellow Pioneers and have a great time!

The Pioneers fell to the Purple Knights 82-74 on Saturday, January 26, at Harvey Hubbell Gymnasium. Junior forward Vaughn Allen scored a career high 33 points for the LIU Post Pioneers men’s basketball team against the University of, but it was not enough to help get the Pioneers a win.
In the loss, LIU Post shot 46.2 percent (24-52) from the field and 40 percent (4-10) from the three-point line. Allen led the team in points and senior guard Jonathan Kohler contributed 14 points of his own, along with three assists. Senior guard Tobin Carberry scored 13 points, as well as three assists.
The Purple Knights were quick to jump on the board and by the 12:04 mark in the first half, the team had gained a 20-10 lead over the Pioneers. Junior guard Jojo Swift hit a three-pointer to make it a 14-point game and senior forward Dion Waiters sank a basket and made one of his two free throw shots to make it 27-12.
However, the Pioneers managed to battle back towards the end of the first half. Allen hit a jump shot to cut the lead to nine at the 3:52 mark. He made one of two free throw shots to make it an eight-point game. Kohler hit a three point shot to make it 36-31 Purple Knights. Allen hit another jump shot in the final minute of the half and then, with five seconds left, made it 36-35 Purple Knights off a slam-dunk.
The opening moments of the second half saw the Pioneers gain a one-point lead, but it quickly disappeared.
The Pioneers managed to keep the game from getting out of hand for the first several minutes of the half, but Bridgeport pulled ahead 51-41 with 13:06 left. By the 8:53 mark the Purple Knights led 62-46. The largest lead of the half came with 8:27 left when Waiters hit a three-pointer to make it an 18-point lead.
The loss was the Pioneers fifth of the season and second in conference play. It comes after the team defeated Saint Thomas Aquinas College on Wednesday, January 23, by a final score of 81-60. The game prior to that the Pioneers had the 11 game winning streak snapped by NYIT.
The Pioneers next game is on Wednesday, January 30, when the team will host Dowling College (7-10) at 7:30 p.m. in the Pratt Center.

	On Saturday, January 26, the LIU Post women’s basketball team fell short against the Bridgeport Purple Knights (12-6) by a final score of 72-66. After losing to NYIT on the road last weekend, the Lady Pioneers (12-5) have now dropped two of the last three games. 
	The first half of play was evenly matched between the East Coast Conference rivals, but the Purple Knights led 34-30 at the end of the first 20 minutes. Throughout the second half, it felt as if Bridgeport’s lead was never at risk. The turnovers piled up for the Lady Pioneers, the Purple Knights were nearly flawless in its transition offense, and nearly every time the Lady Pioneers would string together solid possessions the Purple Knights would answer right back with points of its own.  
	Here are a two key statistics as to how the Purple Knights beat the Lady Pioneers: 
1)	Turnovers: Lady Pioneers had 24, Purple Knights had 12
2)	Fastbreak points: Lady Pioneers scored 5 points, Purple Knights scored 18 points
This season the Lady Pioneers have had a propensity to frequently turn the basketball over. For the season, the team averages more than 22 per game. The Lady Pioneers have a 12-5 overall record despite that colossal number. However, the Purple Knights made the Lady Pioneers pay for its transgressions. 
Sophomore guard Chelsea Williams led the Lady Pioneers in scoring with 15 points on 6-11 shooting from the floor. Despite only converting two of her 10 attempts from the field, senior forward Nicolette Marciniak scored 14 points and grabbed 10 rebounds – all while playing on an injured ankle. Junior guard Alexis Peters nearly notched her first double-double of the season as she tallied 14 points and 9 rebounds. 
Although LIU Post struggled in the transition game, the Lady Pioneers out rebounded the Purple Knights 37-22 and nailed five of 10 shots attempted from beyond the arc. The Lady Pioneers had a couple different issues during the game, but the biggest problem for the team was Bridgeport’s senior forward Tanisha Carter. She was nearly perfect from the field as she registered 23 points and connected on 10-12 shots from the floor. Carter hit shots from the top of the key, the baseline, with her back to the basket and inside. She showed a variety of looks and was an issue all afternoon for the Lady Pioneers. 
The Lady Pioneers’ next game is Wednesday, January 30, at home against Dowling College (15-2). Tipoff is scheduled for 5:00 p.m., but there will be pregame coverage at 4:30 p.m. on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org. This game is considered Post Pride Day as fans are encouraged to wear green for a “Green Out.” There will also be giveaways and promotions going on throughout both the men’s and women’s basketball games.

	Little Inferno was released in November 2012 from Tomorrow Corporation and has received a fair amount of attention including honorable mention in the 2012 Independent Games Festival. It interested me to see what made this game so notable. 
Right from the start, Little Inferno has very nice graphics and a unique style. This is a casual puzzle game with an almost ‘sand-box’ style. However, the only gameplay is pretty much where you burn random stuff and objects in a fireplace. You basically burn things and collect money to unlock and buy more weird items to burn and create combos based on a list of hints the game gives you. The whole experience feels like an achievement system where you always have to unlock everything to move on. 
	While at first I didn’t think this game would be fun, I do admit it was pretty cool and kind of interesting in a twisted, morbid kind of way. I like the dark humor and the eerie presence this game gives. However, I do feel this game is a little too simplistic and I kind of wish there was a little more to it, especially for a $15 game. I would have liked to have seen some different backgrounds or perhaps a better story behind it. There does seem to be a story but it’s very shallow and could have been elaborated a bit more. Another thing that I really hated was the “waiting period” every time I bought a new item. I don’t understand the point of it at all. I don’t want to wait for an item to load for two minutes! If you ask me it’s just a way to extend the time you play an already short game. Also, there is a limit to how many items you can have in your inventory which doesn’t make any sense either. 
Overall, I am giving the game a bit of a hard time but it is only fun if you’re into a more casual and not so much gameplay and action. It has its flaws and its fair share of criticism as well as praise. It’s a pricy casual game so I do recommend waiting for a sale rather than paying full price. You can purchase this game on Steam and on WiiU for $14.99. My final score: 6.8/10.

Ok, to kick off the semester I thought I’d help out the men/boys on campus. I have decided to be your saving grace. I am going to decode the female language for you. No need to thank me for this public service. Now, if a girl says:
1.	Fine: Do not take this as her actually being fine. Something is definitely wrong with her and she either doesn’t want to talk about it or wants you to work harder at figuring out what the problem is so tread lightly here. A girl will also say this to end an argument. However, she is not subduing to your point, she just doesn’t want to argue anymore and still thinks you’re wrong and an idiot.
2.	Go Ahead: Stop whatever it is that you are doing or planning to do. This is not permission; this is a subtle challenge to see if you are stupid enough to go ahead with your plan. If you do continue with your plan, be prepared to face the cold shoulder later on.
3.	Nothing: Almost never actually means nothing. It’s always something so proceed with caution because chances are you pissed her off somehow.
4.	Whatever: This is your cue to back away slowly. She has had enough and is now a ticking time bomb. Your best bet is to just leave her alone for a while.
5.	Do you really want to…:  Your next move should be to say no I don’t really want to. Whether it’s where you are going to dinner or the movie you’re going to see, if she adds a really into the question it means she does not want to do/ go where you suggested at all.
6.	Thanks a lot: You are not being thanked. She is seething and being very sarcastic. Whatever you do, do not say you’re welcome because there is a strong possibility that you could lose a limb.
7.	Don’t worry about it, I got it: Run away! She is now doing something that she most likely asked you to do several times and you ignored it. Now she’s doing it and is ready to pounce. Also, when you later ask her what is wrong and she replies with a “nothing,” refer back to #3.
8.	WOW!: This is not a compliment, she is not amazed by your greatness. Although, she is amazed that one person could be as stupid as you are.
Here it is gentlemen.  A complete list of things you should be aware of when dealing with your lady. I’m sure there are many, many more. Now, you may be thinking to yourself, “Why don’t girls just say what they mean?” A word from the wise here, don’t ever ask a girl that. We are complex and emotional beings, you are not. Boys are much more simplistic in their approach to relationships. Just buck up and deal with it.

We’ve all done it before. Whether we’d like to admit it or not, most of us are guilty. Some people just can’t run away from it. It’s almost natural to fall into the trap of a new beginning. A starting point that comes every year, and every year a new promise arises followed by a three week halt. This standstill is of course due to lack of interest and/or desire followed by a list of excuses that will hopefully justify the laziness. The world has made a name for such behavior: New Year’s Resolution. 
Many people are caught saying, “I’m going to finish what I started,” or “this year will be different,” but the only different aspect of a new year is the date. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not a skeptic, I’m just going by the majority of what I see happening at the end of every January. It’s always the same story, “Well, I’m under a lot of stress,” or “Classes start soon and I can’t have any distractions,” or, one of my favorites, “It’s okay; I’ll do it next year.” It’s amazing how much will-power some individuals can have in December, and how quickly it fades in by the end of January. It’s almost depressing. 
Purvika Khurana, a junior Nutrition major, says that people give in too easily. “In a while, they see how hard it is to manage and it doesn’t stay a priority.” She says lack of will-power and time management are huge deal breakers. Khurana mentions an idea to help. “Visual things attract me, so I make visual clues that I see often and it sticks.” She also says rewards for the little steps keep her motivated. Divya Mary James, a third year Biology major, believes that people who make a mental note of their resolutions in the beginning of the year tend to forget or allow it to fade. “If we keep thinking about our goals, we won’t forget them as easily as we do.” She also says that if the goal was a priority, “People would be aware of what they are doing.” James likes to make goals for the whole year and keeps her motivation up by writing her goals down and calling them “goals” instead of “resolutions.”
There seems to be a pattern in which resolutions fade away. They aren’t up close and personal like they should be. Here are a few ways to kindle your memory: write them on your fridge, have a post-it in the car, put little notes all over your house or dorm, write little notes for yourself in your notebooks, create a symbol which reminds you of your goal/s, and most importantly, never give up. 
But we know how flawed mankind is and just how easy it is to backslide, which can only mean that we will mess up sometimes. The key to recovering from your weakness is to come back stronger than ever by admitting you messed up and not only how bad you want to overcome this goal, but the effort that you are willing to put in to get the maximum results out. This, if conscious and aware of your actions and environment, will help individuals a great deal when fighting for their resolutions.
Maybe we can all get back into the habit of not breaking our own rules. And with these helpful hints, we’re one step closer to completing our long lost New Year’s Resolutions.

	It’s the start of a new semester, and guess what that means? Time to buy books.  However, before you go out and spend a bunch of money on overpriced textbooks, make sure that your purchases will be worth it. There is nothing more frustrating than buying a book that does nothing but collect dust. These are some helpful tricks I’ve acquired during my four years here at Post:  
	Wait to buy your books. I know a lot of students like to get their books ahead of time so that they can have them for the first day of class. However, waiting can help you determine if purchasing the text will truly benefit you or not. On the first day, as the Professor goes over the syllabus, they usually express the importance or unimportance of the book. Some Professors even hand out a homework schedule along with the syllabus.  Skim through the schedule; see if there are homework assignments that are going to require the textbook. There is no point in buying something that you are simply not going to use.
	Search online for texts that you may need. Many websites now offer full texts for free. I once took an English class that required me to read the book Frankenstein.  Instead of purchasing the book, I did a Google search and found the full text online, for free. If this is a route you may take, there are some things you need to look out for.  Make sure that you found the right text; check the author, edition, ISBN (this is an identification number for a book), publishing and copyright. Also, when I suggest looking for a text online, I am not talking about Wikipedia or Sparknotes. As a college student, I would stay far away from these sites, they’ll only get you into trouble. 
	Used books can save you lots of money. When you find yourself in the campus bookstore with the option of purchasing a new or used book, always go for used. I have experienced cases where my used book is half the price of the new book. Who cares if there’s a little highlighting, or the covers a bit beat up. New or used, it reads the same.
	Renting textbooks is another money-saving avenue to go down. This is much less expensive than buying the book. If you decide to rent, keep a few things in mind: There is a rental return date. If you do not return the book by that date, you will be charged. If your credit card was used to purchase the rentals, then the credit card on file will be used to automatically take the money out of your account. Also, you are responsible for the text if lost, stolen, or ruined. To get more information about renting, you can contact our campus bookstore or check online at www.liunet.bncollege.com
	Purchasing books online seems to be one of the most popular ways to get your books for class. There are many websites that sell, rent and trade textbooks for cheap.  Before buying the book full price at the bookstore, it wouldn’t hurt to check out sites like Amazon, chegg.com, half.com, bookbyte.com, or ecampus.com for better prices.  
	Etextbooks are a digital form of an actual book. This can be bought or rented, and it downloads onto your computer. You can even highlight and take notes. This is great for people who are on campus all day, taking multiple classes and don’t want to carry big have books around for hours.
	Today, students have many different options that should be looked at before having to buy a text at full price. Classes are expensive enough and having to spend an extra $500-$800 on textbooks should be avoided at all costs. Take the time to shop around and compare prices. Make your book worth the buy.

	Despite what your past semester was like, you should look at the spring semester like a second chance. You have time to correct the mistakes that you made, and obtain the grade point average you believe you deserve. A successful semester is all about how much of yourself you put into your schooling. You need to be organized, work hard and stay focused.
	I’m sure most of you have been told before about being organized. It really is an important part of being successful. Take time out of your day to write out your schedule of classes, work, study time, and availability to hangout with friends. To eliminate panic over lost papers/homework, you should have a notebook and folder for each class and label them. Now, instead of rummaging through a pile of papers, you can go to the classes folder and pull out the paperwork that is needed. Also, think about buying a planner. This way, you can write down when things are due or what meeting you need to attend. Organization is a great way to eliminate unnecessary stress in your life.
	Throughout the semester you should apply yourself just as much as you had the first two weeks. Attend classes, get to them on time, don’t leave early, sit in front, and join in on conversations. The harder you work, the more you will be rewarded. Students who participate gain more from the class, and can have a better grade. Make sure that if there are study sessions or study groups that you get involved. Not only will this help you become more knowledgeable about the subject, but it will also allow the Professor to see all of the effort you are putting in for a good grade. Don’t forget, always do extra credit, it can’t hurt.
	Distractions are everywhere. It’s not easy trying to study or get some work done when your cell phone won’t stop going off or your friends are begging you to go out with them. The trick is to pick the events that you really want to attend, and go to the others another time. You need to stay focused. If you get too caught up in your social life, the chances of you falling behind on your school work become greater. You’re an adult and need to start making adult decisions, even if that means staying into study and not going out to the bar with your friends. Another good way to keep focused is to put your cell phone on silent during class and while you study. You don’t want any distractions to interrupt your focus.  
	As long as you apply yourself, this semester can be a promising one. Make sure you do all that you can to keep up with work. If you catch yourself falling behind, don’t just give up, push yourself a little harder. Finish as strong as you started. Good luck!

2013 is here, and this is going to be YOUR year. Why not start with taking care of yourself? The best way to help you and your body to feel and look better is to eat healthy and exercise. Fitness awareness is becoming more and more popular. It is no longer about losing weight; it is about being strong and feeling good. Some even say that strong is the new skinny. 
Knowing how you can shape your body and having the correct knowledge to actually do it can be a revelation to people , especially when they discover how easy it really is. Sure, it takes time, discipline and patience (a whole lot of it), but once you reach your goal, you start to wonder why you never got yourself to do it sooner. 
The journey to a fit body is fun and giving, and you learn how to break boundaries. Gaining knowledge also helps you to kill off ridiculous myths you once used to believe in, and you start to find yourself easily annoyed with all the diets that people have tried out. 
So, now that you have found the fitness spirit, you should also keep in mind that it is not only for you to feel and look better. Pursuing a healthy lifestyle prevents many diseases, and diabetes is among them. Some scientists claim that many people have type 2 diabetes without knowing about it, and a healthy lifestyle can help you avoid this disease.
Your body is your mind’s only home. It is your temple. Treat it with respect because no one else can do it for you. Listen to it, and do not ignore its needs. It is all about making the right choices. Start with that, and then you will be halfway there. 
Jonathan Anthony Palmiotti, a junior Musical Theater major, said that a healthy lifestyle keeps him going and builds confidence. “It’s something that puts me in a good mood and gives me something to look forward to. I work in a gym so I get my support and help from that family too.” 
”As long as I have healthier options available, this is what I’ll choose, but I feel like pursuing a healthy lifestyle has become a trend,” said sophomore Business Management major Pernille Winness Haldsrud.

As a public service to the campus community, the Pioneer will be publishing a campus crime blotter each month during the spring semester. A federal law called the Jeanne Clery Act, also called the Campus Security Act, requires that colleges make available information about crimes on and around their campuses within two business days. The Pioneer will obtain this information from the Office of Public Safety. Following is the information that Public Safety made available to the Pioneer on January 24, 2013. Public Safety informed the Pioneer that December and January crime statistics are not available.
• November 6, 2012 – Underage students were caught in possession of beer and alcohol. The minors were found in Riggs Hall by housing staff and the Resident Officer. Marijuana was also found. The students were not drinking or smoking at the time of the report.
• November 7, 2012 – Marijuana was confiscated on campus in Post Hall when a resident was caught smoking with their guest. No arrests were made, but the resident was informed of the schools drug policy.
• November 15, 2012 – A cell phone was stolen from the first floor men’s bathroom in Riggs Hall. The student filed a police report.

	Much to the dismay of the Pioneer newspaper staff, a theft occurred in the newspaper’s   Hillwood Commons office sometime between the last meeting of the fall semester and the beginning of the spring semester. On January 16, co-editors-in-chief Alexandria Parker and Olivia Wicik returned to their offices to prepare for the upcoming semester. The two were surprised when they discovered that two iMacs were missing. “Alex and I were shocked to realize our two most significant computers were missing. A million questions went through our heads like, ‘Who did this? Why? When did this happen?’” said Wicik.
 The editors-in-chief had been in the office for an hour discussing news stories and layout ideas for the Pioneer. “We got to the office around 10:00 a.m. but did not realize the computers were missing until around 10:45 a.m. Nothing else was missing or out of place,” said Parker. The computers, which were in the back layout room, were the only target of theft, and one that will temporarily harm the publication of the newspaper this semester. The Pioneer’s door had been locked and there was no sign of a break-in.
These particular computers were specifically used for the newspaper’s layout and their unknown whereabouts are hindering the production of the weekly papers. Parker and Wicik immediately notified the Pioneer’s advisor as well as the Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, and then filed a report with Public Safety, the campus security department. “Public Safety did not say much about it; we filed a report and we are still waiting to see what they come up with,” Parker said.
It has been a week and a half and there are still no leads about who might have taken the computers.
	At the same time, it came to the Pioneer’s attention that the locks to the Pioneer offices had been changed over the winter break. This information was provided by Alerie Trisch, the director of Student Life and Leadership. She told the editors that the change had been made for “security purposes.” Ironically, after this helpful change, the office had a theft.
The Pioneer contacted Ms. Trich’s supervisor Dr. William Gustafson, associate provost, who said, “There have been no reported incidents of this nature in Hillwood Commons in recent years. The locks were changed on the office doors on January 14 by the campus locksmith as part of Hillwood Commons’ regularly scheduled key maintenance program. The lock changes are unrelated to this incident.” Dr. Gustafson does not believe that a staff member would cause detriment to the production of the school’s award-winning paper either. 
Upon being asked if there should be a record of who enters and exits the office, Wicik said, “Yes, absolutely…technically, no one other than Pioneer staff members and the maintenance crew should be in our office without our permission. It would be nice for the workers at the desk to write down the names of the people who asked to be let into our office and let us know. It would also be courteous of the administration to let us know if they were in our office.” If such a precaution is put into place, incidents as such may be avoided in the future. 
Evidently, there was a possibility of the computers being taken for repair, although the staff was not notified that any repairs were planned. However, after discussing that with Gary Miller, who maintains the computers for the Pioneer, that possibility was quickly eliminated. Nancy Marksbury, head of the Information Technology department, graciously loaned the Pioneer a retired iMac so that the first issue could be published.
Parker said, “Gary Miller got us replacement computers and installed them with the Adobe software we need. He has been a great deal of help to us.” To support Parker’s statement, Wicik said, “We were very lucky because two temporary computers have been loaned to us while we wait for new ones to arrive. However, we lost our entire layout and a lot of other important information on those computers. We have a very hardworking and dedicated staff that is working diligently to reconstruct the layout before our first issue. In the end, this was merely a headache, nothing else.” 
With the work ethic of the newspaper staff, there is no doubt that the setback will be only a temporary problem. If anyone has information about the Pioneer’s missing computers, please contact Public Safety immediately.

	On January 24, Jonathan Clark, Assistant News Director for CBS Radio, visited LIU Post to share the story of his success, and answer students’ questions regarding the fields of journalism or communications. The crowd, which had been an incredibly diverse assortment of journalists and communications majors, was diligent in their arrival. The students were all very keen to hear what this successful alumnus of Long Island Universities class of 2000 had to say, and waited patiently even though Clark was about ten minutes late. The energy in the room reflected the genuine interest of all participants, and the front table offered refreshments, which helped keep everyone content. 
		 Clark discussed how he landed his job at CBS Radio through his first internship. Unlike many other college graduates who are obligated to do extensive research prior to finding their niche in the working world, it virtually “found” him. Audience members listened closely, relating to Clark a great deal due to his young age (30) and common interests, and took in the story of his success; from his involvement on campus at WCWP, the campus radio station, to declaring his major (communications) a year into his schooling. The September 11th tragedy finally triggered his decision to pursue a career in news reporting. “To know that what you did has an impact on people’s lives… is a responsibility you can’t take lightly,” he expressed with enthusiasm. News reporters play such a role in delivering news to uninformed citizens. This, to Clark, is ultimately the most worthwhile factor of being involved in news casting.
Throughout the lecture, Clark further articulated his views on being a news reporter, claiming it to be a very time consuming yet rewarding occupation. From assigning stories to reporters, being reachable for employees to contact, keeping up to date on the goings on in the world and delivering the most accurate information as possible, it’s a lot to do. The job doesn’t stop after work hours, because something is always going on in the world. It’s an endless cycle of events that need to be covered. Yes, there’s always a matter of ethics when it comes to choosing appropriate stories and ways of obtaining the information, but once the news is out and citizens are well informed, there’s an inevitable feeling of importance that comes with being the source of information. Another significant point Clark made was that it’s crucial to try and find a balance with working with all sorts of people, no matter what field of work it is. There are going to be people in higher positions, and lower, but there must be a mutual respect; relying on others in the work force is just as important as relying on your own integrity.
		His incredibly passionate views on the position of news reporters, and perspectives on student-to-professional success, proved captivating for all who watched. Professor Abby Kenigsberg, who teaches Fundamentals of Media Literacy, was pleased with Clark’s representation of media. With the execution of virtue, diligence, and hard work, she said, he took his profession very seriously and had positive ideals regarding it. “I liked how he was devoted to telling news as a service, [rather than simply contributing for the resulting funds] and I loved his awareness on the industry itself.” 
		At the close of the lecture, the audience was extremely satisfied at the information given to them. A few students stayed after to speak with Clark one-on-one, touching on further questions and concerns regarding internship opportunities, and he provided them with information on how to apply for CBS internships just as he did. The lecture was seemingly very beneficial to those predisposed to journalism and communications. Keep an eye out for guest speakers around campus; LIU Post often holds events such as these to motivate students towards building a future for themselves.

Long Island University offers a December graduation option for its students. Many students who enroll part-time or as transfer students do not progress through their programs in the same manner as a typical full-time student might. December graduation allows students to graduate before the typical May graduation date. This gives students time to figure out their next move, career wise or educationally.
Students begin their studies at all different points of the year such as in the fall, spring or summer semesters. Therefore their completion term varies depending on when they begin, how many transfer credits they came in with and how many credits they choose to take each term.
The majority of students goes into college and do not know what to expect, what major to choose or if they are even attending the school that is most suitable for them. For many, it takes a semester or two to fully figure out what path they want to take. This sometimes sets students back, requiring them to take more time in school to meet their program requirements.
Beth Carson, LIU Post’s registrar said, “So far, we have conferred 480 degrees (in December). We have not completed the process and anticipate another 50 or so to be conferred. About 60 percent of the December degrees conferred are graduate degrees.” There are over 90 majors represented in the December conferral group.
Carson said, “These students did not necessarily graduate early. Some might have accelerated their studies by taking summer courses and heavier loads. Others planned to graduate earlier but had outstanding incomplete grades to finish. And still others were right on schedule based on when they began and the amount of coursework they needed to complete.”
Long Island University does not follow a lock-step program; for students who start at different times, the university allows for completion at different times as well. There are three conferral dates each year – one in January, one in May and one in September. LIU Post student Rebecca Martelotti thinks that this is a great policy for the university to have. “I feel that this gives students more flexibility with their schedules and allows them to do better in school since there is less stress with graduation deadlines,” she said.
Compared to last year’s December graduation class, there are just about the same amount of graduates in this year’s class.
LIU Post only conducts one commencement ceremony each year in May. Students who graduate in December are invited to participate in the May ceremony and get to walk with all of the other students. The ceremony will take place on the LIU Post campus on Friday, May 10, 2013.

	The rising cost of tuition and shrinking acceptance rates are no longer the sole worry when applying to college. As parents and students engage in the college process, they are facing an even bigger, more basic problem.  College campuses are often portrayed as secure and serene places, but how safe are they really?  Tragic school shootings such as Columbine, Virginia Tech and the more recent Sandy Hook, have brought awareness to the many campus safety risks.
LIU Post is an open campus due to the many commuter students and faculty traveling to and from classes. This also means that any person can come onto to campus. The Department of Public safety works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management to help keep the LIU campus safe. In order to do this, the department bases its safety procedures on the guidelines of the United States Department of Homeland Security.  Due to the increased concern of campus shootings, public safety has posted the campus firearms and weapon policy on the college website stating that anyone in possession will be subject to disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution.  
Public Safety has its own full-time staff which includes 22 officers that are trained, licensed and certified by the state of New York.  The officers patrols the campus 24 hours a day to look for any suspicious activity that could put the campus community in danger.
A place where learning and the free flow of ideas occur can sometimes be the most dangerous. Students are inclined to feel safe in their classrooms and dorms, but there is a false sense of security. Most campus crimes are committed by other students. The LIU Post website indicates that a total of 8,700 students attend LIU Post, with approximately 1,900 of those students living in residence halls. Gabriella Ianiro, journalism major, said, “Our school has so many commuters so the buildings are all open. No one can truly monitor who comes on our campus and what their intentions are.”
Even though daytime access to the academic buildings is unrestricted, residence hall entrances are locked 24 hours a day. Students must use their LIU cards to gain access to residence halls.
          The various dangers of college are always lingering in the minds of parents as they send their children off to school. Public safety has taken many steps to keep campus safe.  The college emergency alert system is able to notify students instantly via text message and LIU email account in the case of an emergency. This system proved to be very efficient and useful during Hurricane Sandy. It kept students constantly informed about important school closings and delays. The LIU Post campus also has emergency sirens and loudspeakers which are outdoor warning systems. There are four on campus located on the men’s soccer field, Brookville residence hall, sculpture building parking lot and the roof of the Tilles Center.            
          With multiple violent incidents occurring in schools and universities, students’ safety while at school has gained national attention. Still the enriching experience of campus life attracts millions of students every year. While college campuses seem like idyllic places, not even manicured lawns and ivy-covered walls can prevent unfortunate circumstances from occurring.
