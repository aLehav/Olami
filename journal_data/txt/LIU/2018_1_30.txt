As the spring 2018 semester begins, the LIU Post student body will grow with the admission of around 150 spring transfer students.
Students from the U.S. and some international applicants will join the Post community. They were introduced to campus on Friday, Jan. 19 at 10:30 a.m. at a transfer orientation, according to Rita Langdon, executive director of strategic partnership and campus operations. During the orientation in Hillwood Commons, new students were given tours of the campus, and had the opportunity to ask questions, register for classes, and learn more about the Post community.
According to Langdon, “Transfer students study in all majors at LIU Post, including art therapy, business, health sciences, special education, criminal justice, biology, speech-language pathology, and forensic science.” Students also transfer from a variety of universities, including “local community colleges such as Nassau Community College, Suffolk County Community College and Queensborough Community College as well as students from out of state such as Miami University, Bucknell, University of Delaware, and NYU,” she said.
Katie Ello, a sophomore transfer student from the University of Alabama, said that the transfer process to Post was, “super easy. I filled out some papers, gave them my transcripts, and it was all done. I then made my schedule two days later.” Ello also said the university accepted almost all of her incoming transfer credits, and allowed her to change her major from advertising to public relations.
Stephanie Giovine, a senior nutrition major who transferred to Post in spring 2016, said her “advice to incoming transfer students would be to branch out and get involved as early as possible to become a part of the LIU community.”
“[When first transferring to Post] I was really nervous to be far away from home but Post has a fantastic sense of community that eases almost every worry instantly,” Megan Breit, a musical theater major and transfer student from upstate New York who is now in her second year at Post, said.
For Breit, her transfer process was easier than expected. “The staff in transfer admission were more than willing to help and when I went in for that help, they even offered me a job in their office,” she said. Through that office job in the admissions office, Breit has “been to a lot of open houses” similar the ones held for incoming transfer students, and said they are “always a great time.”
There are many opportunities for transfer students to get involved with campus life by participating in student-run businesses, clubs and organizations, recreation and athletics. “For example, one of our transfer students just returned from meeting with companies in China as part of the LIU-iQ consulting firm in the school of business. Others are riders on our Equestrian team or serve as RAs in the residence halls,” Langdon said. “Transfer students thrive here.”

This semester, WCWP has launched a new phone application that enables listeners to stream live music directly from the airwaves of WCWP FM, MY WCWP, and WCWP Talk/Sports. LIU Post alumnus and current employee of the IT department, Panagiotis Sacoulas, created the app. “Throughout, my college career I always found web design to be fun, so one day I decided that I should take things a step further and try to develop an app,” Sacoulas said.
After researching other radio station apps from surrounding areas and seeing what the common standard of what an app should entail, Sacoulas thought that WCWP radio and its listeners could benefit from using an app. “The purpose for the app is to play the radio streams of WCWP,” Sacoulas said. The app currently only offers the audio streams, but will incorporate a ‘now playing’ feature that allows listeners to see the name of the song and artist or display the name of the show that is playing in a few months.
Starting in January 2017 and finishing in May 2017, the new WCWP app took Sacoulas a total of four months to create. Dan Cox, the director of WCWP and other employees at WCWP began to talk about the idea of providing an app for students and Sacoulas stepped up to get the job done. “We started this app project three years ago, but we didn’t have the resources to hire someone to make it so at that time a student volunteered to write the app and it took a while but he did an outstanding job,” Cox said.
Cox explains how he is fortunate that upon graduation, Sacoulas was able to finish the app while working in the IT department. Sacoulas began working on the app while still a student and employee of WCWP. He finished the app months after graduation. “The app was developed as I was still a student towards the end of my senior year, I jokingly compare the app to a thesis paper,” Sacoulas said.
Sacoulas built the application using Android Studio and the iOS application using XCode. Sacoulas created the app with the idea that if made with simplicity, it would accessible to all audiences. “I typed in the station and it was the first one that appeared, it took five seconds to download,” Brie Gittens, a senior public relations major said, about her experience with downloading the app for the first time.
Sacoulas hopes the application will be used by students, LIU Post alumni, residents of the surrounding communities, and faithful listeners. Janine Celauro, who has worked as the secretary at WCWP for 10 years, never imagined an app. “When I first started working here, it was very different, then but I really like the app because it is very important for the students because that is the way of the world right now,” Celauro said.
One week into the spring 2018 semester, students on and off campus have already tried the app. “The app helps me learn more about WCWP radio station because there is a tab for each stream which not only gains more media attention but attracts students who do not live on campus,” Caitlin McNeil, a senior and public relations major, said.
Students have grown fond of the station’s new app rather quickly because of the app’s simple instructions and easy to understand format. “It’s like iHeart radio but for LIU,” Danyell Timothee, a senior film major, said.
Sacoulas has even more in store for the app and its fans. “At WCWP we have a tradition of Alumni returning to the station during homecoming. As I never had a show but was tasked with ensuring all technical aspects of the station, operating and updating the app will be my responsibility during each homecoming,” Sacoulas said.
Sacoulas has faith that WCWP will continue to move in the direction of fresh, fun, and modern advancements such as the app. “My successor [as director of technical operations] is Griffin Ward [a sophomore broadcasting major], who I have full confidence in to push WCWP further into the future. As far as my career, I have plans to continue to create apps for other businesses,” Sacoulas said.
The new WCWP app is available on wcwp.org as well as on both Android and iPhone application stores at no cost.

LIU Post has introduced Spanish for Health Professions, a minor choice for students majoring in Nursing and Health Professions.
Lo reconoces? [Recognize him? In Spanish] He is Jorge Rosario, the chairperson of the foreign language department and a professor of Spanish. Rosario emphasizes the value of learning a variety of languages so that students can widen their perspective on different cultures and give quality service in the workforce. He encourages students, especially those pursuing a degree in health care fields to add the Spanish minor because there is a high demand for bilingual healthcare providers. “Students are motivated to learn this language because they want to assist their patients the correct way,” he said.
“Learning Spanish helps the students learn to translate information with health care providers, documents, and educate others in need of medical assistance,” Rosario said.
The minor was implemented two years ago. This semester, the foreign language department is offering Spanish 15 and Spanish 16: Conversation and Spanish Medical Terminology, which will integrate medical terminology in Spanish. These courses are comprehensive classes that allow students to learn how to integrate grammar, conversational skills, and medical terms in Spanish. This helps them learn pragmatic vocabulary that allows them to efficiently communicate with patients and health care providers. The two courses also focus on cultural knowledge of the Hispanic culture.
“It is imperative that health care providers have a better understanding of the Hispanic people; therefore, the course covers subjects such as immigration, religion, nutrition, traditions, and other subjects that distinguishes Hispanics,” Rosario said.
The foreign language department also offers courses in Italian, French, Japanese, and Russian. Rosario believes that the Spanish program is successful and will continue to give benefits to students, especially those in the health professions. This semester, 15 students are enrolled in the class.
“The Hispanic, Chinese and Korean populations are going to keep growing and hospitals are looking for bilingual people,” Rosario said. “If you are a healthcare provider and are able to speak or willing to learn another foreign language, you are going to be hired,” he continued.
Dr. Marci Swede, associate professor and chairperson of the department of health sciences, prepares students for careers in healthcare, medicine and the hardcore sciences.
She is focused on making sure students not only learn basic science, but also about direct human health. Swede’s department offers a variety of minors, including minors in nutrition, social work and healthcare administration.
“Healthcare is done in interprofessional teams. Although students learn about different professions, they must understand the idea that to be a really good and effective health care provider, you have to be able to build relationships, have empathy and to be able to connect with people, not only your patients but with the people you work with and the community you serve. That goes above and beyond just knowing your biology, your chemistry, and your physics,” she said.
Swede and Rosario have worked together on the minor as an opportunity for students to have this extra skill and to be able to connect with patients on a higher level.
“Health care professionals who have Spanish speaking patients will be able to really build a relationship,” Swede said.
“Medical terminology in Spanish, additional coursework and Spanish culture are important for students to better understand the community in which [their] patients potentially come from,” Swede said. “[They] gain some insight on their cultural differences that students may come across,” Swede said.
Swede and Rosario value the interdisciplinary work between their departments. “It is good that I can go to one department and see how it benefits both; Dr. Rosario does an outstanding job giving students an opportunity to build this extra skill,” Swede said.
Katerin Martinez is a first year student who plans on graduating with a B.S in Nursing and minor in Spanish. Martinez is from Lima, Peru. She is currently working as a gastroenterologist at Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center, an outpatient center located in Westbury. Martinez says that the Spanish minor has already made a signi cant difference in her work place.
“As a medical assistant, patients tend to feel more comfortable when they can freely converse in their native language,” Martinez said.
Martinez believes that she can explain information to patients and families efficiently and she is developing a trust between them. “I am also able to advocate for my Spanish speaking patients by knowing their needs,” she said.
“The Spanish language is becoming so prevalent in the United States; I believe knowing Spanish will be an essential commodity in the medical field,” she said.

Margaret Hallissy, Professor of English, spent her sabbatical during the fall 2017 semester delving into the writing of Alice McDermott, for her book to be published later this year. The book, “Understanding Alice McDermott, will be published by the University of South Carolina Press as part of the “Understanding Contemporary American Literature” Series.
Hallissy resonated with McDermott, as they are both Irish Catholic Women raised on Long Island. Apart from admiring her writing, she also noted that Long Islanders can point on a map to where McDermott’s characters go. Her novels usually take place in Nassau or Suffolk county, with characters from Brooklyn or Queens.
Not only is that compelling to anyone who was raised on the Island, but it gave Hallissy an upper hand in her research. She did not have to travel for research purposes because she is familiar with Long Island’s features, sights, and landscapes.
Writing about a native Long Island author also gave her an ideal workspace, right from her home office on Long Island. “When I’m doing the actual writing, I do it at my office at home,” Hallissy said, “I have to be all by myself to write. I can’t write in a busy environment. I have to shut the door and be completely alone.”
Hallissy has finished a draft of eight chapters of her book, which discuss the eight books of McDermott. She is hoping to finish the introduction and conclusion, as well as final revisions, during her spare time and summer break.
Hallissy has been a constant in the English department since 1974. During her last sabbatical, seven years ago, Hallissy also took the time to write a book, “Understanding Irish Fiction and Drama.” It was published in 2016, also by the University of South Carolina Press, as part of its “Understanding Modern European and Latin American Literature” Series.
Hallissy teaches English 10 (Intro to Literature), English 35 (Childhood and Literature), and English 36 (Adolescence and Literature) as well as a class on Irish fiction and drama. She has also taught in the learning communities and in the Honors College.
While she was away, English Professor Wendy Ryden taught English 10. English 35 was not offered during the fall semester.
Hallissy hopes to eventually be able to teach her novels in her classes as well as write about them.
Hallissy’s manuscript is due to her publisher at the end of August 2018, and will the go through a publication process for a number of months. Books from this press are available via the press’ own website, www.sc.edu/uscpress, as well as through Amazon.com or bn.com (Barnes & Noble). The university library will also have it on the shelves in circulation.

On Jan. 1, 2018, the pay rate for on campus student work study positions increased from $10 to $11 per hour. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program is a form of financial assistance offered by the federal government to students through part-time employment at their colleges. At LIU Post, there are a variety of on-campus jobs available for students eligible for financial aid.
Students interested in receiving federal work-study must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application to apply for financial aid and indicate an interest in the work-study program.
Ilkania Maldonado, the director of enrollment services, has managed LIU Post’s financial aid department for two years. She has witnessed how beneficial this program is to students of all majors. “I love
it because the students have an opportunity to grow personally and professionally, fulfilling administrative duties while also staying on top of personal academic responsibilities, which allows them to be more prepared for the real world,” she said. Most of the students working in Maldonado’s office are in the work-study program. She ensures all students in her office have satisfactory academic performance while employed. Maldonado has a strong initiative, “school first, work second.” Federal mandates require that students maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA all semesters to qualify for and stay in work study.
Students have the option of having their earnings paid into their bank account via direct deposit or sent to LIU to pay for charges such as tuition, fees, room and board.
Monica Kurup, a senior computer science major, has been in the work study program at LIU Post, working in the academic advisement and financial aid office for the past two years. “I love my job; I love that we received an increase and I love meeting new people while assisting them with any issues they may have,” she said. Kurup uses her earnings from work-study to pay her tuition; without that opportunity, she would have to take out private loans to pay for school. According to The Institute for College Access & Success, 71 percent of all students graduating from four-year colleges, or about 1.3 million students, graduate with some form of student loan debt.
Some students believe that the work study program should be available to all interested students, not just students receiving financial aid. “I truly don’t think it’s fair that work study is only available to students who qualify for aid; just because your tuition is paid, doesn’t mean you don’t need the extra money,” Sydney Duffy, a junior political science major, said. Maldonado responded that students who are not eligible for financial aid can still work in-campus jobs, through budget positions. “Our university gives the opportunities for all students to earn money in between classes; we have budget positions throughout campus where students who don’t qualify for federal work-study can still work at stores in Hillwood, faculty offices, etc., where they can earn money paid for directly from the university budget”.
Yessica Guevara, a senior criminal justice major, works in the financial aid office. “The most important part of my job is helping students like me get the aid they deserve; I love helping people during their time in need. The increase helped me and my family a lot,” she said. She too uses her earnings to help off set the cost of private school tuition.
Robert Doran, a senior digital game design major, has a different view on his work study job in the enrollment services office “I think it’s so intriguing so see how the university operates, how objectives are met, and how far the university goes to help its student financially.” Doran uses his earnings to off set the cost of living expenses like gas, food and personal bills.
The financial aid office is located at Enrollment Services in Kumble Hall;516-299-2323; postenrollmentservices@liu.edu.
The office hours are Monday to Thursday: 9 a.m. – 7 p.m.; Friday: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.

Welcome back to the first semester of 2018! I hope everyone got the rest and relaxation they needed to be refreshed to start o the new year. It can be challenging to get back into the swing of things at school but we somehow manage to do it each semester.
Kelly Montenero, sophomore, arts management major with a concentration in music got to spend time with her friends that were home from school and she also worked on writing songs and recording in the studio with her sister, Kat. When it comes to adjusting back to the school grind, she struggles but quickly switches from break mode to school mode. “The first week is always a little hard to adjust back but after that I usually get right back into the swing of things”, Montenero said.
Leaving the comfort of your home to come back to school can be difficult but looking at the positive side of it can help the adjustment. Once you get back, you get to see all your school friends and catch up on what they did on their breaks. “Get yourself organized so your ready for the semester, contact some of your friends so you feel like you have a strong social network and don’t worry too much because the semester flies by,” Montenero said.
You have the ability to change the perception of a situation. If you go into the school year with a negative outlook it will be exactly that. Try approaching it with a more positive outlook. Doing this will help you get through school a lot easier than it would be to fill your head with doubt and gloomy thoughts. Think about all the new things you will learn in your new classes and how it will help with your future. School for some people might be something you want to rush through just to get over with but if you take the time to step back and enjoy your life currently you will be much happier with your day to day life.

Super Bowl LII kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 4. The underdog Philadelphia Eagles go up against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. The Eagles have had a tremendous season, finishing the regular season 13-3. During their dominant season, they lost their starting quarterback Carson Wentz, who was replaced by Nick Foles. Since losing Wentz after a knee injury, they have been considered the underdogs, but they have proved that they are still determined to win this year’s Super Bowl. They beat the Vikings 38-7 in a blow out on Jan.19 to advance to the Super Bowl.
On the other hand, Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, and the Patriots have made their way back to the Super Bowl, AGAIN! The Patriots also finished the regular season 13-3, and Tom Brady is looking to beat “Father Time” and add another Super Bowl ring to his collection of 5, all with the Patriots. The Patriots came out of a tight game on [date], with a late run to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 24-20. Tom Brady has the most Super Bowl rings among all quarterbacks to ever play in the NFL.
Eagles fans are extremely confident about their team, given their tremendous season despite injuries. “Eagles all day! I’m predicting the score will be 24-17,” Kyle Eustace, a senior digital art and design major, said. “I believe that IF we lose, it will be because Tom Brady is an amazing quarterback and he can make any receiver look good,” he added. Another Eagles fan did not want to jinx his team with predictions. “As an Eagles fan who’s waited 14 years to see them back in the Super Bowl, there is no way I’m going to jinx them with a prediction. But I will tell you that I think anyone who thinks the Patriots are the better team haven’t been paying attention to the Eagles this season,” Adam Hornbuckle, senior political science major, said.
Patriots fans are also confident.“I think it is going to be a great game between two great teams,” Kal Finesse, sophomore broadcasting major, said. “As a Patriots fan I am obviously going to expect a Patriots win. I don’t expect that it will be an easy win, but I think it will be another Super Bowl comeback by Tom Brady, with the final score 38-35,” he added.
Taylor Hill, a senior broadcasting major who isn’t a fan of either team, believes that the Patriots will win the Super Bowl. “A lot of people are divided but I’m going to go with the Patriots because they have Tom Brady and they did it last year,” she said. “You can’t really predict a score; look what happened last year to the Atlanta Falcons,” she added.

If you ever wander the second floor of Humanities Hall, you may have come across a room outlined in pieces of paper with words like ‘thesis’, ‘citation’ and ‘MLA’ in bold font. This room has been help to many students in regards to everything English and home to department member Mary Pigliacelli. Pigliacelli, an adjunct English professor, is the director of the campus Writing Center and an avid reader. She is one of the unsung heroes of Post.
After earning her BA in English Literature from Marymount Manhattan College, Pigliacelli landed a job at McCall’s Magazine, “It was the 80’s… it was a lot easier to do that then,” Pigliacelli said. At McCall’s, Pigliacelli edited, wrote and assigned articles. “I wanted to make connections in the publishing industry because I knew I wanted to freelance when I had kids. A few years later she decided that family should take precedence, and she elected to write on a freelance basis. “It was quite lonely, freelance,” Pigliacelli said. “You’re calling people who very often don’t quite want to talk to you,” she added. The experience, opportunities and the growth of her family encouraged her to go back to school and study for her graduate degree in English.
Pigliacelli has been at LIU Post for 12 years now. While she was in the graduate program at Post in 2006, Pigliacelli joined the Writing Center to assist fellow students in everything writing related while studying for her M.A in English. “I came for a degree and never left!” she said.
Piglicelli began teaching in the English department 12 years ago, mainly introduction course such as English 01 and English 02. In Sept. 2015, Pigliacelli became the director of the Writing Center. The Writing Center, located on the second floor of Humanities Hall, provides students with assistance in writing for an array of classes. “We help with any kind of writing that students are doing not just assignments,” Pigliacelli said. Whether it be an assignment or free time creative writing, the Writing Center offers assistance to help students put thoughts to paper.
Pigliacelli’s passion for literature stretches further than the classroom. She makes this apparent when she discussed the book she’s currently reading, “Future Home of the Living God,” by Louise Erdrich. “It’s very interesting and terrifying,” Pigliacelli said. “Evolution is reversing itself and nobody really knows how and why,” she added. Her all time favorite book is more mainstream?. “I’m going to go all English teacher and say “The Iliad.” I reread it every time I teach it and I think about it all the time, it’s so applicable to life,” Pigliacelli said.
“It’s the type of thing you can read over and over again and get something new from it,” she added.
Seren Jones, an LIU Post alumna who graduated in 2016 with a major in English and minors in journalism and geography, worked with Pigliacelli in the Writing Center throughout her time at Post. “She is one of the friendliest and most approachable professors I’d come across during my time at Post,” Jones said.“But she was also someone who really cared about the well being of the students who came into the center to seek help, as well as that of her workers,” she added. “Basically she was the coolest boss I’ve ever had!”
Junior Brianna Licausi, a 2015 majoring in health and physical education took Professor Pigliacelli’s English introduction class. “She actually cares about you, and takes the time to learn about the students,” Licausi said. “Professor Pigliacelli is one of those professors I actually want to talk to!” she added.
Pigliacelli said that all are welcome in the Writing Center. With that, her true passion for the job and what she does at Post shone through. “This is 100 percent my dream job, my favorite thing to do in the world is to talk to people about writing,” she said.

Master of fine arts students performed a devised play, “Rm: 99, Fl: 13,” on the Little Theater mainstage from Jan. 26-28. The show featured a creative blend of stories that illuminate the dark truth of the American lifestyle, sexism, stigmas, and modern- day struggles. With its opening song ending in the words, “Everyone you know someday will die”, the production first sets a tone of ominous anticipation that makes the audience believe it would turn out to be a horror production based around a murder. However; audiences soon discovered that the play would instead use abstract shadow figures and artistic screenplay to draw attention to the conflicts and struggles that lie beneath ‘The American Dream.”
The production uniquely tied together old and new burdens of our world. Some scenes accentuated the struggles and emotional confusion behind the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. Others brought to light the ridicule, judgment and inhumane treatment of those who don’t conform to society’s black and white standards of sexuality. There were also moments that drew attention to the emotional despair of housewives in America’s earlier years who were to be prim, proper, and presentable for their neurotic and unstable husbands. While the ideas presented in the play were well-received, the production style was interpretive and conceptual, allowing for viewers to conceive various perceptions of its symbolic meaning.
“We started the production in class by thinking about things that inspire us and things that light up our imagination as artists,” Brady Ness, a second-year MFA student, said. “We really just brought a whole bunch of things into the room initially and then started finding themes and structures that we could put all of our ideas into.” The production was inspired by issues the actors deal with individually as well as ones that affect them culturally.
“Although this is something like [my] 40th show, it’s the first piece that I’ve written, directed and performed in… the experience is always very exciting to see your work go from page to stage,” Kayleigh Jacobs, a second year MFA student, said.
In regards to the title, “One day in class, someone said Rm: 99, Fl-13, and we just found it interesting and made it into a place where anything could happen, a place where any number of stories could be told,” Ness said.
The four students enrolled in the course, Ness, Mary Aalbue, Kayleigh Jacobs, and Chamila Priyanka, all worked together to write, direct, produce, and perform the show. “[We] gave each others work an outside eye, making the show a total collaborative effort,” Ness said.
“We started with literally nothing for this show,” Jacobs said. “And since each of us is a very different artist, we needed to find a way to make our work intersect each other.”
Since none of the students are traditional playwrights, the hardest part of putting the show together was generating material to compose the script. “Putting something together where there was nothing was definitely tough,” Ness said, “But all of it was worth it when things really started coming together into something that looked like a production.”
The show came together after the four actors conducted a survey. One of the questions included was: “What is a recurring dream or nightmare that you have?” According to Jacobs, they found many similarities in people’s responses. “[It] got us thinking, ‘What are our nightmares and how do they intersect our lives?’” Jacobs said.
Putting aside all the abstract displays and interpretive screenplay, the show closed with a simple line many people may benefit to live by: “Don’t take yourself too seriously… cause’ in the end, we’re all going to return to the same cosmic nothingness, so why not fill the void with light, laughter and love?”

“Advanced Visions 14” was a visual art exhibition shown in the S.A.L Gallery, located in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library from Dec. 12 to Jan. 24. The show highlighted work done by high school artists from local school districts. The event, in its fourteenth year, allows high school artists in advanced placement and international baccalaureate classes to submit original pieces to be judged by art professors. From those submissions, three “juror’s awards” are granted, and six honorable mentions are given.
The student work hung on the gallery walls included a variety of paintings, sketches, and photographs. The gallery also included sculptures.
Cristina Lomangino, exhibition coordinator, helps plan student art shows on campus, including the “Advanced Visions” event. “We send a call out to local schools, and teachers enter [students],” Lomangino said. “We usually have 70 pieces, but this year there are 78. From that pool, LIU art department professors survey the work and select the winners.”
The three student artists chosen for juror’s awards were Casey Goldstein from Half Hollow Hills High School for her work “Age Translated into Wisdom,” Meghan McCarthy from Floral Park High School for her work “What’s Inside,” and Sehjin Kim from the Paul D. Schreiber High School, for her work “Mirrors.”
In “Age Translated into Wisdom,” Goldstein illustrates two male faces. In the first, the man’s face is comprised entirely of skin, apart from his mouth, nose, and cheeks which are covered by sketched paper. In the second, the man’s face is entirely sketched, but his mouth, nose, and cheeks are covered in peeling skin. In McCarthy’s “What’s Inside,” the figure of a woman measures her thighs and waist with measuring tape. In Kim’s “Mirrors,” the artist works with paint to illustrate a bathroom with sinks and mirrors lining the walls. Student artists were encouraged to take home their work after the event.
Seung Lee, an art professor at Post and one of the judges of the student artwork explained what judges look for in the pieces, mentioning the key components of concept, method, and form. “Usually we look for concept: artwork that shows a unique idea,” Lee said. “We look for technique that is more traditional, how [the students] use materials, and how they compose.”
Students that exhibit these qualities receive accolades for their work. “[Winners] get to put this on their resume and in their portfolio for college,” Lee said. “To be selected is a big deal.”

DC Comics published their first Elseworlds, a publication imprint associated with DC Comics, to create, “Gotham by Gaslight,” in February 1989. The author, Brian Augustyn took Gotham’s nest characters from their caves and cages and put them in a different time period. Fast forward to 2018, Warner Bros. Animation produced a movie based on the standalone story titled, “Batman: Gotham by Gaslight.” 
This cartoon film takes place in England during the Victorian era when a serial killer named, Jack the Ripper is out for blood; but can the world’s greatest detective stop him? The film starts in a theatre. A woman is performing something similar to a belly dance in front of an audience of crude men making vulgar remarks. When the show ends, an unidentified man approaches the dancer and murders her. This is where the story commences.
The setting of Gotham City is very different than what avid fans have read in comics and seen in movies. The city’s population travels by horse and carriage, lights are fueled by gasoline instead of electricity and Batman’s costume looks more like a medieval executioner as opposed to the multi-million dollar bulletproof suit he wears now. The cast is also different, Batman is voiced by Bruce Greenwood instead of the legendary Kevin Conroy, and this may be a turn off to certain fans. However, it provides a different take on Batman; Greenwood’s voice is similar enough to Conroy’s, so it is not distracting.
The motive of Jack the Ripper (Scott Patterson) is the same as the real criminal who lived over 100 years ago, and because of this, the movie is rated R. The film contains some graphic violence, but nothing terribly gory. The R rating seems to be more of a heads-up to the parents of young Batman fans so their children don’t hear the degrading language towards women. This isn’t the first time Warner Bros. Animation has done this to an animated film.
Back in 2016, they released “The Killing Joke,” a movie about The Joker’s mission to drive Commissioner Gordon to the border between sanity and insanity. It was a great read but a bust of a film. “The Killing Joke” and “Batman: Gotham by Gaslight” are very different, the former was uncomfortable to watch at times while “Batman: Gotham by Gaslight” was a bit hard to listen to at times due to the diction of the story.
The film makes viewers stop and think about some of the names of the characters. The names of some of Batman’s greatest allies are homeless children, and foes are just normal people with no hostility as opposed to their psychotic ways in modern day Gotham City. This makes the film more interesting and adds to the plot. Visually, the movie has some aws: the illustration of some of the characters is inconsistent, and Batman’s stature is more square than cut, making the illustration look rushed at times.
Overall, Warner Bros. Animation delivered when necessary. “Batman: Gotham by Gaslight” is a brief reminder that DC Universe movies aren’t doomed.
“Batman: Gotham by Gaslight” can be purchased through the iTunes Store and Amazon video.

What many people of the LIU community do not know is that Riggs Hall is not just a dormitory. It is also the home of the LIU Post wrestling team. Practice for the Pioneers is not like any other student athletic team at LIU. The team does not gear up and go to the Pratt Recreational Center. Rather, they head to practice in the basement of Riggs Hall.
The wrestling team has not always been around. Three years ago, the program returned to Post and the team is currently working to make the program successful in its fourth year back on campus. “We are getting better and better each year so our recruiting is getting better, and because the competition is getting stronger so are we,” Head Coach Joe Patrovich said.
Midway through their season the Pioneers’ record is currently 5-8 in dual meets this season, but according to Patrovich, their overall record is not what is important to them at this point in the season. They have an NCAA tournament in Iowa in March that they are trying to qualify for.
Some of the team’s goals this year are to compete against some of the best competition; being a Division II wrestling program they try to compete against some of the top division I teams in the country, including Purdue, Air Force, and Drexel. In the next month, they have their regional tournament in Johnstown Pennsylvania, with the hope of sending four team members to the NCAA championship. “If you get 2 you’re happy, but I think we can get 3 or 4 and that would be a great year for us,” Patrovich said.
The second string team was supposed to be wrestling in a wildcat opener on Friday, Jan. 26, but due to the budget for buses, they will be taking all of the guys three hours away to Kutztown, Pennsylvania to compete.
The Kutztown University duals begin at 6 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 26.

When it comes to collegiate sports, time is precious. Each student athlete is given four years of eligibility. Once used, it is all over. What if one or more of those years are taken away from you? Sadly, that’s the harsh reality many athletes face when they receive an incapacitating injury. The National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II (NCAA D2) revisited its rules regarding medical red-shirting this past year, thanks to DII student-athlete representatives across the country.
In late 2016, each Division II school voted, based on the views of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), to change the criteria for medical red-shirting. Debbie DeJong, LIU Post’s new athletic director, explained the previous rule. “If you competed in less than 20 percent of your maximum contest, you can put a waiver in through your conference office for red-shirt,” she said. “That 20 percent is of your entire season”. If you stepped foot on the field, court or pitch in over three out of 12 games, you were no longer eligible for a medical waiver. This is hard for many, as a whole year of eligibility can be wasted on a three game season. With increases in concussions, ACL tears and various other incapacitating injuries, this was a change that many student-athletes felt needed to happen.
Due to the voices of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) and the ears of the NCAA, action has been taken. As of August 1, 2017, red-shirt rules have changed. Now, “a student athlete may participate and remain eligible for hardship waiver to three contests or dates of competition or 30 percent of the maximum number of permissible contests.” And it must be in the first half of the season. Not only did the SAAC representatives want to accommodate the growing number of injuries in DII sports, but they also felt that the bylaw should match that of Divisions I and III.
Implemented at the beginning of this school year, the new red- shirting rule does just that. “Now the legislation for medical red-shirt hardship years are equal through all divisions that you play,” DeJong said.
The new rule is not only a successful change as it protects the student-athletes competing, but it is also a great tribute to the SAAC representatives on a national scale who made this happen. “Almost no bylaw change is made without the membership voting on it. Which means every DII institution gets one vote,” DeJong said. This change was made successful by the student-athletes, for student-athletes, without any administrative or governing body’s influence.
DeJong stressed the importance of this change, as all will reap the benefits. “All sports will see the impact, every single student athlete that participates in any division will see the impact,” she said. “This will help all student athletes be able to participate and feel like they get the opportunity to participate and represent their university to the max.”

On Jan 27, the women’s basketball team took on the NYIT Bears in an East Coast Conference matchup at NYIT. Coming into the game, the Pioneers had a 9-0 win streak within the East Coast Conference, but in the NYIT game, they came up short in overtime.
At the end of the first half of the game, the score was tied at 32. Kylie Garrett, a senior guard, broadcasting major and journalism minor dropped nine points, accompanied by two assists. Asia Turner, a sophomore guard, health science major, also had a fine first half, knocking down both of her two three-point attempts.
However, the mood of NYIT’s recreational hall became more tense since the first half when Sasha Patterson, a senior forward, political science major and criminal justice minor, racked up a total of 27 points and 17 rebounds, which earned her a double-double along with a staggering 36 minutes played. With nine seconds left in regulation, Patterson drew a foul, sending her to the free throw line, sinking both shots and sending the game into overtime.
Overtime ended up being less fortunate for The Pioneers as they ultimately lost the game 79-72. “We played good defense, but it was our offense that really let us down in the game,” Turner said.
The Pioneers will hit the road for their next game against the University of Bridgeport on Jan. 31 at 5 p.m.

On Saturday, Jan. 27, The Pioneers took their last dip into the pool, ending the season on a positive note by defeating Kutztown University 154-103 and Millersville University 170-79 at Kutztown University’s Key Stone Hall.
The first event of the day was a strong one for the Pioneers, as they won the 200 medley in 1:49 with the combined effort from senior international business major Laura Bendfeldt, junior chemistry major Caitlin Johnstone, sophomore business major Tove Sparrman, and junior sociology major Karis Fuller.
The third event was the 200-yard freestyle. Junior political science major Eline Swenson won the race with a time of 2:03.
The 50-yard freestyle was all Pioneers as Bendfeldt, Johnstone and sophomore childhood education major Jessica Argelander took the three wins in the race.
The meet was one to remember for four of the Pioneers’ swimmers as Fuller, Johnstone, Cassie St. Angelo, a sophomore biology major, Bendfeldt and Sparmann earned two wins each to help the Pioneers defeat Kutztown University and Millersville University. “It felt good because I helped get points for my team,” St. Angelo said. St. Angelo also commended the team’s effort as a whole this season. “We have all done a great job and we’re going to kick butt at championships.”
The Pioneers finished the regular season with a record of 7-1, undefeated in their home pool. The Pioneers will return to the pool at Rutgers University from Feb. 16-18 for the Metropolitan Conference Championship.

On Saturday, Jan. 27, The Pioneers went up against the NYIT Bears in an East Coast Conference dual at NYIT. The Pioneers did not have a strong first half; they only shot 34 percent from the field with a large score difference of nine points.
The first 20 minutes of the game were slow; it took just under six minutes for The Pioneers to start to close in on an eleven-point deficit in favor of NYIT. However, after freshman guard, business administration major, Austin Kennedy sank three of five straight three-pointers, The Pioneers began to even the score at 32-32 after the first half.
At 12:45 in the second half, an entirely new team awoke from the first half; The Pioneers converted 10 straight buckets in a row, taking a 76-71 lead. The Pioneers went from a field goal percentage of 34 percent in the first half to an impressive 54.8 percent and a free throw percentage of 95.5 percent on 22 attempts. Jared Rivers, a sophomore guard, physical education major, totaled 14 points with six assists. The Pioneers’ bench was putting in their share of points by generating 38 of the 92 points, which ultimately led them to a landslide victory over NYIT. “We finally just wore them down and we focused in and made shots. The pressure we put on made them panic and we stayed poised,” said Aary Bibens, a senior guard business management major said.
The Pioneers will hit the road for their next game against the University of Bridgeport on Jan. 31 at 7 p.m.
