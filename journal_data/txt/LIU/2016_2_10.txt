For once, let’s just take a step back, and be honest with ourselves; not just as people, but as a society. Doesn’t America have the ‘weirdest’ relationship with marijuana?
Seriously, look at the 1960s, where most of the youth started to smoke marijuana, only to love and embrace it. Fast-forward 20 years or so to Ronald Reagan’s America, and the only thing Americans could agree on was “Say No to Drugs!” (Oh, and death to the U.S.S.R). Fast-forward another 30 years to Obama’s America, and the marijuana every person above 45 tried to burn out of existence permanently, is now decriminalizing marijuana, one city at a time. In some states, it’s now legal to smoke recreationally, while in others, it’s legal to ‘intake’ for medical purposes.
The Columbia Care New York Medical Marijuana Dispensary in Riverhead, the first of its kind to open on Long Island, doesn’t require patients to smoke the marijuana for treatment, according to CEO Nicholas Vita. “What we offer is a sublingual oral tincture, which is effectively a liquid that you place underneath the tongue and then gets absorbed into the system,” Vita said.
What about side effects? Well, in an interview with CBS News Riverhead, Vita said, “The side effect profile for our product is euphoria and increase in appetite.” Vita insists that the ingestible form of marijuana he’s prescribing to his patients is a safe, non-addictive form of treatment, that allows the patient to live “comfortably” while taking on his or her illness(es).
“I think that’s the problem with medical marijuana,” says John Berry, father of two LIU Post graduates. “Number one, is it really that much more effective than traditional medicine? Two, what kind of sickness does one need to qualify for this form of treatment?”
That’s a great and honest question by Berry, and one that deserves answers in much further detail, especially via federal law. According to California law, one can ingest medical marijuana if it assists the patient in dealing with arthritis. However, if that same person with clinically diagnosed arthritis wishes to receive a prescription from a medical marijuana facility in Louisiana, Delaware, Connecticut or Colorado, he or she will not be allowed a prescription.
Drugs that are abused can destroy homes in an instant, and is one of the main contributing factors for why drugs carry such a terrible stigma, for valid reasons, of course. However, with America becoming a more forward-thinking country, our ability to better understand drugs like marijuana, and how we can use them effectively, instead of boycotting them all together, reflects our growth as people.
If you were to ask me if medical marijuana has potential to be an effective way to treat patients with pain, I would tell you this, “I don’t know yet, but it’s a good conversation to have, and I’m glad we’re at a place where a conversation about drugs, is no longer taboo.”

Poetry, a popular form of writing in the past decades, has gradually fallen from its pedestal as the epitome of creative writing. It seems as though the majority of the world today no longer values poetry in modern times. If it isn’t a devaluing in poetry by the audience, it’s a complete lack of effort in the writing completely by the author, but the writers are the ones who I need to speak on the most.
As much as it pains me to say it, poetry has lost its creativity over the years among the young student poets of my age; whether that creativity be in finding their voice or addressing certain topics that the world today just refuses to acknowledge.
In my opinion, being a poet and writing poetry in general are two very different concepts. Poetry, like many other forms of creative writing, is art. What do you do in art; you sketch, draw and paint pictures, however, you don’t draw or paint simply for the sake of doing it. You don’t even do it just to send a message. You do it to get your voice out to the world, and I don’t feel poetry has that same meaning to poets my age anymore.
Everyone has a voice but I think that a common cliché in poetry has become that of people either trying to get too deep or they just throw a bunch of words together that have no real meaning to what they’re trying to convey.
For example, I read some poetry on ThePoetryProject.org, a website I had originally hoped to submit my own work to, and these are a few lines from one submission called, I Show My Emotions:
“And then I run through a residential area.
And then I stand in the bus shelter of the light rail station.
And then I stand in a gas station parking lot.
And then I go to the hospital but I am released as a non-threat. And then I go home.”
This was only one of the many poems I had an issue with in my reading mainly because of its vagueness, given the writer titled it as such. This was a common issue I had with the other works I’ve read. They were either excessively long, like a short story, or they were a bit too heavy on imagery that never related to their title.
Maybe I’m picky but I think sometimes we miss the point about poetry. Maybe you can see certain aspects of the world differently like love, nature, books, issues in the world…the possibilities are endless. It can be both short and simple, or long and intricate. But in my opinion it should always be painting a vivid picture or story in a reader’s mind, and relate to the title should you choose one.
Poetry is the written form of painting; the canvas is the notebook and your voice is the paintbrush. It’s a written artistry and it’s not treated as such these days. I’ve seen many young poets try to be real deep and poetic but steal quotes from artists or pictures off of social media. I get it. Rappers like Tupac (an esteemed poet himself) and Biggie are great and have amazing quotes just as modern artists like J.Cole, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar—but be original.
Another issue I have with how poetry is viewed today is the topics. Some topics for poetry today are regarded as taboo. For instance, what is so wrong about sexual poetry? I think it’s deep and intimate.
I think as a society we’re afraid to explore those forbidden feelings and thoughts within ourselves to the point that we reject them in favor of what society deems as appropriate. If one were to write a poem about his girlfriend or wife and what he loves and finds attractive about her, then he has every right to be as forthcoming with his love for those qualities about her, whether it’s her mind or her body. I just think that we should embrace our inner thoughts and feelings when it comes to writing poetry regardless of what anyone deems as appropriate.
Overall, I’m passionate about these issues because I feel that there is an ongoing lack of appreciation for art these days, especially poetry. It’s like the world as a whole is losing its creativity and we’re gradually becoming more and more robotic. We’re human. It’s not wrong to express yourself or what you feel. It’s nobody’s life but your own and that’s what poetry exhibits.
Poetry doesn’t always have to be deep and profound or fancy. It can be simple and relatable. Paint whatever you want; write whatever you think. Do whatever your heart desires but be creative, and be yourself because you never know when your masterpiece could be an inspiration. It could eventually become someone’s sunshine in this world of grey.

“For college kids, not skipping meals is really important,” according to Heather Dibiassi, a graduate student majoring in nutrition.
We’ve all had that day when we’re running late in the morning and miss breakfast. For most of us, before the day starts coffee is simply the only answer. This quick fix may give a temporary boost, but it also causes dehydration and fatigue when we forget to balance it with water.
If you’re an athlete, you may be having a hard time juggling a healthy diet with that hefty schedule. There are many obstacles we face that affect our diets; medical conditions, weight and time management all play a role in our eating habits. Whatever your stubbing block, trying to maintain a consistent diet is a challenge that we all face.
In Pell Hall, room 150, reside this semester’s campus nutritionists, Dibiasi, Stefani Pappas and Kelsey Kettell. They are part of Post’s dietetic internship program. Each semester, this advanced certificate program is offered to graduate students to prequalify for upcoming steps in becoming a registered dietitian nutritionist. They offer free nutrition counseling to students, staff and faculty on campus.
As certified nutritionists, they are professionals who are dedicated to working with you to overcome any adversity preventing you from maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Some of the areas they assist with are developing meal plans, goal setting and on-and-off campus eating tips.
“Good nutrition allows you to prevent and reverse illness and diseases,” said Kettell, a 2015 graduate from the University of New Haven.
As a certified personal trainer (CPT) and certified weight management specialist (CWMS), Pappas, who is a graduate student in nutrition at NYU, feels that, “nutrition is everything.” Their objective is to learn your desires and goals and modify your habits to help meet these goals.
You may have seen those pictures of meal plans prepared Sunday for the week on social media. For the average college student who dorms, these expectations are unreachable. This doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to adjust your habits. “It’s not about extremes; strive for balance,” said Dibiasi. “Telling you exactly what to eat is pretty unrealistic.”
You may be thinking that seeing a nutritionist entails excessive green drinks, organic leaves, wheat and oats. If you’re a pizza lover, none of that sounds appealing. However, there’s much more to having
a balanced diet. The campus nutritionists provide aid and counseling in teaching you how to incorporate health habits, while not completely giving up the things you love.
They are willing to meet with you at different locations around campus for your convenience. They’ve prepared information on intuitive eating and recognizing your body’s natural hunger signs. There’s also a lending library with books to assist you on your journey to a healthier life. You’ll have access to many different resources while working with a nutritionist.
The nutritionists’ offce hours are Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. by appointment, with flexibility. They can be reached at post-nutritionist@liu.edu and 516-299-2881. You may also follow them on Instagram @sensible_bites to stay up to date on their tips and bulletins.

Our lives change every year, therefore, so do our priorities. Work comes before play, study comes before sleep, and sometimes the only time you can relax is when you sleep.
For most students across the country and particularly at Post, work doesn’t just happen in the classroom. In fact, you’d be surprised how many students work full-time, in addition to being a full-time student.
“It’s a grind,” says Gabrielle Patino, a junior forensic science major, who works full time as nanny. “Your day begins [with an] 8 a.m. [class], because you scheduled it that way to coincide with your work schedule. Your last class finally ends at 3:20 p.m., and you run to your car to beat the traffic, and pick up the kids in Roslyn by 3:55 p.m.” It’s at that time, 3:55 p.m. when ‘phase two’ of her day begins.
As a nanny, Patino studies while she feeds, and bathes the twin boys, Matt and Ryan, until their parents come home at 9 p.m.; and by that time, she’s just entering ‘phase 3’ of her day.
“After that, it’s me time, if you want to call it that,” Patino said.
“Come 9:30 p.m., it’s time for homework, a shower, a quick chat with my parents and then I’m o to bed.”
Now, just how many days does Patino do this a week? “Four times,” she said.
Although the week for Patino can become a ‘grind’, she appreciates it, claiming that work like this makes her appreciate the little things, builds character, a stronger work ethic, and a skilled time manager.
“I’m no martyr, and I’m not alone. I know plenty of people, students and non-students, who do what I do, and kudos to them. I can’t speak for anyone else, but I certaintly know, I wouldn’t change a thing,” Patino said. Soon after the conversation with Patino, she embarked on the routine she’s come to know all too well, picking up the kids, or as she’d like to call it, ‘Phase 2’
Patino’s balancing act is one that should be revered and respected, in large part because it is so uncommon to see a student voluntarily sign themselves up for that kind of sacrifice.
As Patino said earlier, she is no martyr, but she is an example. She’s an example to all students that if you have time on your hands, and make the most of it; whether it is devoting two hours to study, better positioning you to earn that A in Chemistry, or even applying for a job at the local convenience store.
Fully expend your potential; you go to school barely 10 miles outside the capital of the world, New York City. Recognize your potential, and find out how good you really are.

He’s six-foot-five, 245 pounds, covers 40 yards in 4.59 seconds and can pinpoint a deep pass 45 yards down field into the hands of a wide receiver running at a top speed of more than 20 miles per hour with defensive backs draped all over him who are doing everything in their power to break up that pass.
No, his name isn’t Superman. He’s just 26-year-old Cam Newton. Born Cameron Jarrell Newton, Cam led the Carolina Panthers to just their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history.
For Newton, the road to Super Bowl 50, which was played on Sunday, Feb. 7, in Santa Clara, California, was not paved in gold cobblestone with cheerleaders, champagne and roses on each side. In fact, it was a road filled with twists and turns, with nay-sayers blanketing each side casting doubt on Newton. They claimed the only destination he would reach was a dead end, a pitfall of some sorts; where many athletes’ careers have come to an unwanted and forgettable rest.
“Very disingenuous — has a fake smile, comes off as very scripted and has a selfish, me-first makeup. Always knows where the cameras are and plays to them. Has an enormous ego with a sense of entitlement that continually invites trouble and makes him believe he is above the law — does not command respect from teammates and will always struggle to win a locker room . . . Lacks accountability, focus and trustworthiness — is not punctual, seeks shortcuts and sets a bad example. Immature and has had issues with authority. Not dependable,” said NFL draft analyst Nolan Nawrocki, of Pro Football Weekly, who published this scouting report a month before the 2011 NFL draft.
Despite the criticism, Newton was the taken first overall by the Carolina Panthers and not even one year after Nawrocki’s ‘bold’ comments, Newton took the league by storm; breaking Peyton Manning’s rookie passing yardage record and earning Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. Newton was also the only rookie quarterback named to the Pro-Bowl that year. (NFL’s All-Star Game)
Fast forward nearly five years and Newton is still fighting off the critics, but one thing has changed, and that’s the narrative of said critics. “He’s a showboat,” says Craig Carton, co-host of Boomer & Carton sports radio show, who said this about Newton, “I think he’s just one of those flash in the pan guys, his style of play can’t sustain winning over a prolonged period of time.”
Even members of the Post community were still skeptical of Newton the week before the Super Bowl. “Cam Newton? You mean Scam Newton right?” said Paul Innamarato, a senior health major, dressed from head to toe in his Philadelphia Eagles attire; which makes one wonder, why Innamarato would refer to Cam as ‘Scam’, considering that Newton’s Panthers blew Innamarato’s Eagles away 27-16 on a nationally televised Sunday Night Football matchup on NBC.
Is race an issue for Newton? (Asked a reporter at Super Bowl Media Day on Feb. 2). “It’s an issue for you,” Newton said. “I don’t even want to touch on the topic of black quarterback, because I think this game is bigger than black, white or even green. So I think we limit ourselves when we just label ourselves just black, this, that and the third. I’ve said numerous times that I play to have a stage that people will listen to, and I pray to God that I do right by my influence. So when you ask me a question about African-American or being black and mobile, it’s bigger than that.”
Regardless, and quite frankly, we will never truly know if race is a factor in how Newton is treated by the public and the media, but one thing is for sure, Newton is adding a fourth law to the laws of motion.
Newton won a National Championship in college. He’s won the Heisman Trophy as college football’s best player. He won this year’s NFL MVP and if Newton’s Panthers would have beat Peyton Manning and
the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50, a classic old school vs. new school matchup, Newton would have become the first player in NFL history to earn all four accolades as a quarterback.
With that said, let Newton be Newton. If you don’t like him, his team and his post-touchdown celebrations, then stop him from scoring. After all, he essentially is the reason the ‘dab’ has become the dab. Despite the difficult loss, Newton and his Panthers will be back and Newton will still tell his critics, “I’m just being me.”

WCWP has several events planned for the spring semester. The campus radio station will hold its biannual rooftop party in April, although the exact date has not been set.
The radio station will also broadcast three concerts through WCWP’s FM public radio station, “Spero Plays Nyro, The music of Laura Nyro” by the Christine Spero Group, playing on March 26 at 8 p.m. The group, THE BAND, presents a tribute to Bob Dylan and The Band on April 3 at 8 p.m. and ‘Imagine’: John Lennon Celebrating 1971, the ‘Imagine’ LP, and other Beatles and Solo Classics,” on May 19 at 8 p.m. They are all set in the Hillwood Commons Recital Hall.
The radio station has three services broadcasting shows throughout the semester. According to Dan Cox, WCWP’s director of broadcasting, those services are “88.1 FM – the public radio station of LIU Post that can be heard at 88.1 FM and worldwide at www.WCWP.org, myWCWP; the student radio station of LIU Post that can be heard on the PA system in the Hillwood Commons on channel 95 campus cable TV, 89.7 FM on campus and worldwide at www.mywcwp. org, and WCWPTalk, an internet only station of student and community volunteer produced talks and sports talk shows.”
To broadcast these shows, “WCWP uses the best equipment available in the industry for the people working there,” said Station Production Director, Chris Maffei, who graduated in 2013 with a degree in broadcasting.
Maffei has been with the radio station for five years. “We have developed talk shows on our FM station, which didn’t exist when I started and we also have nine shows running in the morning.”
As for the future of the station, Maffei thinks the equipment at the station will become more modern as the industry advances forward and the state of WCWP will be “determined by the next five years of kids walking through the doors.”
According to Cox, the most popular events for the radio station are the rooftop parties held during the fall and spring semesters. “Last semester we held two and they included live music with Nick Tangorra in September and our scavenger hunt was celebrated at out Halloween rooftop party in October.” The parties have been held for the past two years on the roof of Hillwood Commons with 75 to 100 students in attendance at each. Cox stated the purpose of the parties is for students to “have a good time and to promote the station.”
Though new shows have not premiered since last fall, Cox said new members of all majors are always welcome to join the station and create a new radio show. Cox attributes the lack of new shows this semester because new members join the current shows at the station as opposed to creating new ones, and just want to be connected to the station in some way.
WCWP meetings are held in Humanities Room 020 on Feb. 27, March 24 and April 26 at 12:30 p.m.

Yuan Yin is a fine arts major currently in her last semester. She is also the most recent artist to have her work exhibited at the SAL Gallery in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library. Her exhibit will run from Feb. 9-13, with the opening reception on Feb. 10 at 8 p.m.
When Yin is creating new pieces of art, she draws inspiration from “[her] real life, [her] memory, and the deep feel from [her] heart.” To promote her work and inform readers of upcoming exhibits, Yin operates her own website. In this exhibit, Yin’s art is based around the idea of who she is. “I will be doing a performance in this show, to use my body to climb the mountain and the idea is dependent on a question – who am I?” Yin said.
For the past two years, she has been studying contemporary art. During these two years, she was inspired to create artwork based around the image of a mountain. This mountain, due to the connection she feels with it, inspired most of the artwork in her exhibit. “In my mind, it is not only a mountain landscape. It has a deeper meaning for me personally, but also gives me a sense of security. I have always been attracted by the shape of the triangle, it indicates stability and life.”
For this exhibit, Yin chose a large canvas to draw a mountain. She is always striving to challenge herself and improve as an artist. Throughout her life, she has been reaching for higher goals that are outside of her comfort zone. Her recent work represents her feelings and acts as a summary of the past two years she has been studying art. Yin feels that the past two years have been very important for her as she transitions from what she calls a traditional painting artist, to a more rounded, contemporary artist.
According to Noel Zahler, the dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, students in the fine arts program “are expected to have a solo show or a shared show by their senior year.” Dean Zahler also stated that the art department makes the final decision on what exhibits are present in the SAL Gallery, since they are the experts in the field.
This upcoming exhibition represents an important time in Yin’s career as an artist. She wants this show to be a perfect ending for the first part of her career, as she starts a new chapter to become an independent artist. After Yin graduates, she plans to continue her career as an artist by receiving the O-1 visa, a nonimmigrant visa that is given to those who are particularly advanced in fields like the arts, sciences, or education. With this visa, Yin wants to travel the world for a year while putting on exhibits in different countries and garnering reviews for her work.

Add women’s rugby to the long list of sports at Post. The announcement was made on Feb. 1 at the Pratt Recreation Center.
Rick Hamilton, senior associate director of recreational sports, had a part in the introduction of the program to Post, and said, “As an institution we are constantly evaluating and exploring ways to create opportunities for women within athletics. Women’s rugby is one of the fastest growing and emerging sports in college athletics.”
Hamilton is right on the money there. In a survey done by the American Sporting Goods Manufacturers’ Association, rugby landed the top spot of fastest growing team sports with over 2 million new players. (A very close second was lacrosse).
For those who aren’t familiar with rugby, it is one of the few full contact sports and the only one offered by the NCAA for women according to usarugby.org. There is physical contact on almost every play, but that’s not all that comes with the sport. “Successful rugby teams combine tackling, speed, strength, agility, passing, kicking and driving for a multifaceted attack.” In comparisons to a traditional American sport, rugby comes closest to football, but is still a vastly different game.
“We believe that women’s rugby will attract student-athletes not only from the region, but national as well. Several institutions in the region have started women’s rugby and have had success with it,” said Hamilton. Some of the division II universities who have started a women’s rugby team include: American International College, Central Washington University and West Chester University.
Bryan Collins, who is the athletic director, said that women’s rugby has great potential at Post. “[Women’s rugby] was not always on our radar. We were looking to increase opportunities for our students, specifically on the female side. We feel this would be a good fit for LIU Post. The popularity has shown great growth.”
In the spring of 2016, the athletics department will hold clinics and practices with the hopes of gathering talent and getting a team together. The plan right now is for women’s rugby to open up as a club sport in 2016-2017 with the intention of moving to varsity a year later.
When asked if a men’s rugby team may be in the works, Hamilton stated, “If there seems to be an interest there, we would explore this as a club opportunity, but not with the intention of moving to varsity status.”

On Wednesday, Feb. 3, the women’s basketball team took care of business against Mercy College in an East Coast Conference matchup, winning by a score of 67-32. The Pioneers were again led by senior guard Jalyn Brown who scored 15 points en route to the Pioneers second straight win.
The Pioneer defense was fantastic all afternoon, limiting scoring opportunities for Mercy and forcing turnovers. Mercy was held to just 18 points in the first half and halftime provided no answers for the Pioneer defense, as they only scored 14 in the second half. The Pioneer defense forced eight turnovers which directly led to 17 points in the open court. Junior forward Melsha Messam finished with 13 points and six boards while freshman guard Shannon Doyle totaled nine points to go along with six rebounds.
The Pioneers returned home on Saturday, Feb. 6, and played host to St. Thomas Aquinas College. The Pioneers gutted out a gritty 64-62 win to earn their third straight victory.
Senior forward Nyasia Davis was the catalyst early on; scoring key baskets to give the Green and Gold a lead in the first quarter and later on extend their lead to seven points in the second quarter. Davis and the Pioneers took a 29-25 lead into halftime.
The theme of defense carried over from their previous game as the Pioneers were stout all afternoon; especially in the third quarter. After St. Thomas put a few mini runs together to cut the Pioneer lead to just two, the defense stepped up and made stops. Messam extended the Pioneers lead
to nine after hitting a pair of free throws. With the score standing at 47-42 in favor of the Pioneers, sophomore guard Naya Williams converted on a lay-up at the horn to give her squad some momentum heading into the final period of action.
Senior guard Khea Gibbs put the team on her shoulders in the fourth quarter, scoring 11 points and willing the Pioneers to a win. With the Green and Gold up 64-62 and just under ten seconds to play, the Pioneer defense stepped up once again; getting back-to-back stops to secure a win.
Gibbs finished with 15 points while Messam added 13 points and seven boards. Brown totaled nine points and was a perfect four of four from the charity stripe.
Deirdre Moore and her team are back in action on Wednesday, Feb. 10, when they welcome Molloy College to Brookville, N.Y. Opening tip in this ECC showdown is scheduled for 5 p.m.

With just under ten seconds remaining, the men’s basketball team (13-9) gave up a coast-to-coast lay-up as time expired to drop their fourth consecutive game, 67-65, against Mercy College (8-9) on Wednesday, Feb. 3 in an East Coast Conference matchup in White Plains, N.Y.
After trailing 64-61 in the final moments of the contest, junior guard Jared Hall cashed in a pair of free throws on two consecutive trips to tie the game at 65. Immediately thereafter, Mavericks guard Tyseem Lyles sprinted down the floor for a fast-break lay-up to secure the win for the hosts.
In the first half, the Pioneers and Mavericks each had their fair share of runs, but the Pioneers were down 31-30 at the break. Hall led the Green and Gold with 15 points in the opening stanza.
This was truly a game of runs and the second half did not disappoint. Post erupted with a 10-0 stretch highlighted by senior guard Chris Orozco who tallied five points. Senior guard Devon McMillan buried a three as the Pioneers grabbed a 40-31 advantage less than three minutes into the latter half.
However, Mercy continued to hang around using an 11-2 spurt to even up the score at 42 at the ten-minute mark. Both teams continued to trade blows, but the Mavericks eventually finished strong enough to give themselves a chance to win, which is exactly what they did. Mavericks guard Jason Quijada paved the way with 20 points and three steals. Similar to their last meeting, the Pioneers defense was unable to contain forward William Robinson who was one rebound shy of a double-double, logging 17 points and nine rebounds.
Hall racked up 26 points and converted 13-of-14 free throw attempts while McMillan added 12 points, eight rebounds and two steals to his stat-line. Junior forward Greg Dotson was quiet with just eight points, but crashed the boards with 10 rebounds and recorded two blocks and two steals.
Things didn’t get any better when the Pioneers came back home to the Pratt Recreation Center on Saturday, Feb. 6, as their losing-streak extended to five in a 71-58 defeat to St. Thomas Aquinas College (18-4); a team they beat earlier in the season.
Although the Pioneers shot lights out throughout most of the game, they were unable to contain junior guard Chaz Walter who scored 29 points for the Spartans.
The opening stanza was a three-point shootout as the two squads combined for 11 made trifectas. Although the Pioneers finished the day shooting over 72 percent from downtown, they were sloppy throughout majority of the contest, committing 22 turnovers and shooting just 36 percent from the charity stripe.
In the opening twenty minutes, there were three ties and five lead changes as the Spartans brought a 30-27 edge into the locker room. Walter and sophomore guard Shaquille McFarlan each totaled eleven points for the visitors. Hall led the Pioneers with nine points, five rebounds and three helpers.
Once senior guard Dillon Burns knocked down the game-tying three to open up the second half, the Spartans picked apart the Pioneers to take a commanding 49-36 lead. Walter continued to dominate for the guests, scoring from everywhere on the floor.
That would end up being all she wrote as the Pioneers only came as close as eight points (51-43) the remainder of the game. Dotson led the squad with 18 points while Hall inked 17 points, seven boards, three assists and two steals, but also had five turnovers. Burns chipped in with 11 points, five assists and nicked three steals.
Head Coach Erick Smiles and the Pioneers hope to bounce back when they return to the floor on Wednesday, Feb. 10, when they square off against Molloy College in an ECC duel at the Pratt Recreation Center. After getting off to a hot start in ECC action, the Pioneers now sit at 8-6 in conference play. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

John Scott is the last of a dying breed in the National Hockey League. At six-foot-eight and 270 pounds, Scott’s main role on the ice is to fight and to stick up for his teammates. Players like Scott are also known as enforcers and are slowly becoming a part of hockey’s past. Enforcers and fighting have been slowly pushed out of the NHL over the last few years as the game has gotten faster and more fragile.
Former enforcers Derek Boogaard, Wade Belak and Rick Rypien died during the summer of 2011 from a mix of depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE, according to news reports at the time.
Since entering the NHL eight years ago, Scott has 11 points in 285 games. Though Scott is far from one of the best players in the league, he is extremely popular with his teammates and excels in his limited role. When it came time for fans to vote players into the All-Star Game starting on Dec. 1, Scott ended up with the most votes, becoming captain of the Pacific Division team.
Hemel Jhaveri wrote in the beginning of January, “So, how exactly do hockey fans unite to make Scott, an unlikely at best candidate for the All-Star Game, into a favorite? On the surface it’s as simple as fans getting in on the joke, but the impetus to vote Scott into the game was an off-hand remark that caught fire.
Right after the new 3-on-3 for- mat for the game was announced,” Yahoo’s Greg Wyshynski mentioned on his very popular podcast how fun it would be to see Scott in the game. However, the NHL was allegedly embarrassed that Scott earned a spot in the game over more talented players and asked him to decline his nomination, according to Bob McKenzie, TSN hockey analyst. McKenzie tweeted, “John Scott was previously asked by both NHL and Arizona Coyotes to bow out of NHL All-Star Game. He refused.”
After encouragement from players and fans, Scott refused to decline his spot after being asked by the NHL and was subsequently traded from the Arizona Coyotes to the Montreal Canadiens. He was then sent down to Montreal’s minor league team, preventing him from participating in the game because he was no longer part of a team in the Pacific Division and was classified as a minor league player.
The NHL hoped to diffuse the situation by trading him to Montreal, but that only made fans and players root for Scott that much more. Scott was then reinstated into the All-Star Game by the NHL after fans threatened to boycott the game and a petition on www.Change.org addressed to NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly for Scott to stay in the game gained nearly 10,000 supporters.
Throughout All-Star weekend from Jan. 30 through 31, Scott was swarmed by the media and became the golden boy of the weekend. After participating in two events for the skills competition, he took over the game by scoring two goals, winning MVP and taking home a new car. Even though the NHL handled this situation very poorly by trading Scott out of the Pacific Division and sending him to Montreal’s minor league team, I was very happy to see them fix their mistake and let him play. With Montreal currently out of the playoffs, it is unlikely he will be called up from the minors to help the team push for a playoff spot.
John Scott is truly a one-of-a-kind player, enforcer or not. He has a true passion for the game and will do whatever it takes to help his team win. He became a huge success story and helped make the All-Star Game fun again. Whether it is with the Montreal Canadiens or another team, I look forward to seeing Scott play in the NHL once more and keep the role of the enforcer alive.

Tyler McGarvey, a junior biology major and music minor from Babylon, N.Y., is a cross country runner and indoor track and eld runner. McGarvey is an experienced runner who was a three-time county cross country champion while attending Babylon High School. He also helped the Pioneers earn a third-place finish at this year’s East Coast Conference Championship.
Q: Can you explain to us the difference between track and cross country?
A: Cross country is a set course that can range from either eight kilometers or ten kilometers, which is typically on a trail outside. Track can be indoors and outdoors, but it’s only on a track. Indoor track is 200 meters while outdoors is 400 meters and it usually includes field events.
Q: What inspired you to start running?
A: It’s a funny story. In grade school, there was this small competition called, ‘Turkey Trot,’ and people encouraged me to run in it and I won. In seventh grade, I went to try out for soccer and I found out that cross country was actually a sport, so my friends told me I should do that. Once I started doing cross country, I’ve been running ever since.
Q: What is the strongest asset of your running?
A: Definitely my endurance. I mean you need both speed and endurance, but being able to go on for miles is my specialty.
Q: Have you ever considered running any marathons?
A: That’s the first thing I’m going to do when I finish college, is to start training for a half-marathon. Then I want to eventually prepare for a marathon and hopefully a triathlon.
Q: What is your biggest aspiration as an athlete?
A: My biggest goal as a runner would be to finish a marathon in under three hours, but in general I want to do an ‘ironman,’ which is like swimming, running and biking.
Q: How does your experience as an upperclassman brush off on the younger guys?
A: Well the biggest difference between high school and college is the upper mileage, so the freshman are usually terrified when they first come and find out that they have to run 10-12 miles a day. I came from a really small high school, so my change was really drastic compared to kids from most schools.
Q: Have you always wanted to run track or were you interested in playing any other sports?
A: It was really hard me to distinguish which sport I wanted to pursue because I played basketball, baseball and soccer. I really wanted to be a college baseball player, but I was just better at track.
Q: What ultimately influenced your decision to choose LIU Post?
A: The track and cross country program was a huge part of it because I got offered a scholarship and met the team before and they were all a great group of guys. I figured it would be fun to be a part of that.
Q: Can you tell us what your day is like as a student-athlete?
A: I wake up at 7:30 a.m. for a morning run, which is about two miles just to get the lactic acid out. Then, I’m in class from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. During common hour, I’ll go to the gym to lift and do core. After that, I have class again from 2:00-3:20 p.m. which leads up to practice at 3:30 p.m. Then we’ll run for an hour or two and do some more core [workouts]. The team gets dinner once practice is over and around 7:30 p.m. is when I start my homework. Once that’s finished, I’ll go to bed and then start all over again.
Q: What is your biggest accomplishment to date as an athlete?
A: I started out sixth on our team and there [are] only six guys on the team. At the end of the season, I moved up to third, which was with a stress fracture, so that was really important.
Q: Name something interesting that people might not know about you.
A: I’m a vegetarian and I’ve been one for eight years.
Q: Any plans at the moment after graduating college?
A: After graduating I plan to go to medical school and hopefully become an emergency room surgeon and I’d also like to continue running.
Q: Who is the one person you admire most?
A: That would probably be my teammate, Ryan Gioe. He’s the one that keeps pushing me and he’s always been there for me. It’s really great to have him around and he still has a great spirit, despite all that he’s been through.

It’s a cold Monday afternoon, and the growing snowfall is soon going to send students at LIU Post home early for the day. In a Tilles Center dressing room, I’m trying to search for any sign that this is the temporary den of a world artist. Except for the man with the beanie sitting in front of me, all I can find is a whole ginger root on the dressing table.
Despite the throat-soothing vegetable, Billy Joel hasn’t come only to sing. He is here to help support the survival of the Long Island High School for the Arts.
In late January, Joel, a Long Island native, announced that he would pledge $1 million from his foundation to help save the school. The gathering on Feb. 8, however, was an effort to address what remains as the school’s biggest threat – declining enrollment.
Invited guests, including students from the arts school and LIU, filled the 490 seat capacity Hillwood Recital Hall. The event, called an “Afternoon of Questions & Answers . . . And a Little Music,” lived up to its name. An excited, seemingly star-struck audience shot questions at their local hero, resulting in a mix of career anecdotes, tips for aspiring musicians and, as promised, a little music.
While Joel shared information about how he writes his songs–for example, the names of people and places in his songs are usually picked only because they sound good– he played bits of popular tunes like “All for Leyna” and “Allentown.”
“[Long Island] is like a breeding ground for talent. To not nourish that, and to not fund it makes no sense to me at all. That’s our future.”Photo: Moa Golster
Joel started his foundation to help young people in the music field. Budget cuts, Joel told The Pioneer, has become an unpleasant norm in public schools, and while sports are usually kept in place, music and arts programs tend to be reduced or eliminated first.
“I came up through public schools,” Joel said. “There were music teachers, there was band, there was chorus, there was music theory, there was music history.” Today, Joel said, a lot of young people may not have the chance to get the music education they want.
Joel spoke warmly about the public music programs offered in his early years, and emphasized their importance for his career. “The man that was teaching the music classes in my high school was probably the biggest influence on me of all,” Joel said. “As a matter fact, he was the one that said to me ‘you should consider being a musician, a professional musician.’ No adult had ever said that to me in my life.”
While others warned him that a career in music was a probable future of “struggle, poverty, drugs and misery,” having the support of an adult was a revelation for Joel. “That made a big difference in my life… All my music teachers made a big difference in my life.”
Despite the uncertain future of the high school, happy faces filled the audience, and some arts students and educators took their chance to thank Joel for his support.
“It’s wonderful to have such support from a fellow artist,” said Dina Denis, dance department director and teacher at the arts school. Denis said she was devastated when she heard that the school might have to close. “We are changing lives, and we are cultivating young artists,” Denis said. “These are our future creative thinkers. Don’t take that away from them.”
The support from Joel, Denis said, as an artist and community member, has been honorable. “To come out, talk to our students, and just raise awareness about the importance of music and arts education. It’s wonderful,” Denis said.
“We need the arts just like other students need other every-day school curriculum stuff,” said Aggie Lesser, a senior drama student at the art school. “To have someone appreciate that as much as Mr. Joel did, it’s very exciting.”
Enrollment declines and dwindling tuition revenue has led to threats that the Long Island High School for the Arts will close after June 2016, Newsday reported on Nov. 19. However, in a letter addressed to Nassau BOCES trustees in November, Joel urged them to keep the Island’s only public high school arts program open. He offered the monetary contribution under the condition that Nassau BOCES keep the school open for three years, Joel’s spokeswoman told Newsday on Jan. 21.
The Long Island High School for the Arts was established in 1973, and has shared its Syosset campus with the Doshi STEM Institute since 2013. The total enrollment in both schools is 138 students, according to Newsday, which is less than half of the facility’s 300-student capacity. Ninety-two of these students attend the arts school, Nassau BOCES officials told Newsday.
When Joel heard about the possible closing of the arts school, he knew that he could help. “One of the reasons I’m here today is to raise the profile of this school,” Joel said. “I hope that people learn that there is a place like this on Long Island.”
“If you think about all the talent that came out of Long Island,” Joel said, “musicians, actors, comedians, people who are in the entertainment field… This is like a breeding ground for talent. To not nourish that, and to not fund it makes no sense to me at all. That’s our future.”
At the age of 66, and with over 50 years in the industry, Joel is possibly going stronger than ever before. When he announced that he would be doing a once-a-month show in Madison Square Garden for as long as it sold out, he didn’t know that he would still fill the prestigious venue over two years later.
“I just assumed we were going to run out of people, out of ticket buyers,” Joel said. Thirty-three shows have sold out, and there are only three shows left this year. “So by all appearances, we’re going to be able to keep playing there, and it may go on ‘ad infinitum.’ Not that this is a problem, it’s a nice quandary to find yourself in,” Joel said.
The success has reached outside of his home state as well, with sold-out shows in cities like San Diego, Seattle and Pittsburgh– places in which he said he was never very strong– and appearances at Wrigley Field and Fenway Park for the third year in a row.
“This is crazy,” Joel burst out. “I’m a little overwhelmed by it. I mean, I’m 66 years old.” How long he will be able to continue at this pace is uncertain. “I figured, if there is a demand, I’ll try to satisfy that demand,” he said. “But if I become physically decrepit, I’m going to stop,” he continued, chuckling.

February is Study Abroad Month, which means that each week, Hillwood Commons will host “different tables highlighting different study abroad programs,” according to Patricia Seaman, director of the Study Abroad program.
On Tuesday, Feb. 2, and Wednesday, Feb. 3, multiple professors sat behind tables filled with flyers on faculty-led study abroad programs, which are offered in the summer. Each program varies depending on the professor’s eld. Some of the locations include England, Slovenia, Tanzania and France. Courses offered include economics, English, nutrition and theater. These programs offer a hands-on experience while also gaining credits, according to Seaman.
Caitlin Kennedy, a senior health science major who is also a study abroad ambassador, has been involved in helping with the events at Hillwood Commons this month. She is able to share her experiences travelling abroad to Peru through a FLSA program and studying for a semester in Sevilla, Spain. During her time with Professor Hiatt’s political science and history course in Peru, she said she got to study and experience the local culture and history during overnight trips to other parts of the country.
“Taking a history class at the site is really an incredible experience because you are not just reading about it,” Kennedy said. “You are going out and touching the stones of the sites and seeing the magnitude of this ancient culture.”
The study abroad tables are an easy way for students to get detailed information from study abroad ambassadors like Kennedy and the professors who teach the courses abroad.
“If it were up to me, I would make it a requirement to study abroad,” Kennedy said, pointing out that she not only learned a lot about the cultures of the countries she was studying in, but she also learned about herself. While in Budapest, she said she was able to navigate the streets, which she never thought would have been possible.
Other tables for Study Abroad Month include both affiliate and non-affiliate schools, where representatives will speak with students; student ambassadors who have already studied abroad; and LIU Global. Students not only get to learn about different opportunities around the world, but information on scholarships and financial aid are also available.
The tables will be set up throughout the month, two days a week in front of The Treat Shoppe in Hillwood Commons from 12:30-2:30 p.m. This week IES, a non-affiliated school, was here on Feb.
9, and study abroad ambassadors will be available to chat on Feb. 11.
For more information, visit LIU Study Abroad office in Winnick or the LIU Study Abroad Facebook page, where the schedule of events is posted.
