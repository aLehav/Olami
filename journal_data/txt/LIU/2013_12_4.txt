The Student Dance Association (SDA), along with the Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC), sponsored the Department of Theatre, Dance, Film, & Arts Management’s first annual dance gala on Sunday, Nov. 24. The fundraising event was held in the Tilles Center’s Atrium, and was co-hosted by Dan Potenzieri, Student Government Association (SGA) president, and PCDC manager Alyssa Harrington. The event’s chief coordinator was Freyani Patrice, a member of PCDC.
The audience at the gala consisted mainly of students from the Theatre, Film, Dance & Arts Management department, their families, and Post faculty. The event’s staff sold raffle tickets throughout the night to help raise money for the Dance department’s anticipated trip to the American College Dance Festival (ACDF) in June at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.
ACDF’s primary focus is to support and promote the talent and creativity throughout college Dance departments, and give Dance majors the opportunity to learn and dance with different professors and students from other universities.
Members of both PCDC and SDA performed choreographed pieces at the gala. The first act featured PCDC juniors and seniors performing a piece titled “Phenomenal Women.” The opening was a lively performance that featured movements that spoke a powerful message. The dance was dedicated to Alerie Tirsch, the director of Student Life, for all her contributions to the university. There were two solo acts performed as well, “Passion for Praise,” performed by Technicolor-costumed Akilah Cassells, and “Beloved,” performed by Meagan Kolakowski.
Post senior Holly Maddock choreographed the performance by Dance majors of “Genius is the Recovery of Childhood at Will”. The piece showcased the dancers performing a very fluid and alluring routine. The gala’s final act, “Rose Rouge,” was performed by the entire Student Dance Association, and was a fun and fiery finale that rounded out the night. The members of the ensemble were dressed alike and simply, wearing black slacks and white button-ups.
“The contributions and donations [to this event] cannot be counted in dollars and cents,” said Potenzieri about the importance of funding the arts. “There are many programs [on campus] that [the university] is unable to contribute to because of costs.”
PCDC, along with SDA, are helping to make the trip to the American College Dance Festival possible.” The president explained his high hopes for future SDA fundraisers: “The gala was a huge success, [and there was] tremendous support from faculty, administration, and the families [of performance students].”
Patrice, the gala’s coordinator, was also in good spirits. “I’m excited that it went well, and that there was a full house and things ran smoothly. We’re thankful for the efforts of Tilles as well as Post faculty to help make the evening a success,” she said. When asked about future galas, Patrice said, “Now we know how to run and plan it better. [We’re focusing on] more promotion and hosting in a bigger space for a bigger crowd; also a varied crowd to experience a variety of acts.”
Patrice also expressed how much it would mean to the dance department to attend ACDF. “[The festival] gives us a whole new outlook on dance, as well as the opportunity to work with different professors and students. [It’s an] enlightening and new experience that we’ve been attending for many years, and we want to keep [the tradition] going. We want to keep the arts going and not be defeated by budget cuts.”
In past years, Dance majors have been able to attend ACDF by funding from the school; this year, the fundraising event was organized to raise sufficient funds for the trip to D.C.
The First Annual Dance Gala’s promotions, and raffling for the event, helped SDA and PCDC reach their monetary goal to attend the American College Dance Festival next June.

Plans to reconstruct Hickox Field, within the last recent years, have been stalled by pending approvals from the Village of Old Brookville’s zoning board. The awaited permits have hindered the process since August 2012, when the university planned to start the project. The zoning board was concerned about the noise parameter and height requirements of the work, but the permit was finally granted in November.

The last renovation of the field was back in 2006, when the LandTek Group of Amityville, N.Y., provided an all-weather, turf field. The press box was also installed, but most of the bleachers stayed the same, and have been so since the original construction in the 1950s, according to the Pioneer website.
A major renovation is expected, including brand new bleacher seating, as well as a new, modern press box with a VIP suite. The project started on Nov. 18, and will be divided into two phases. First, the home side bleachers, as well as the running track, will be demolished before the installment of new utilities. Thereafter, fencing, asphalt and landscaping is going to be shaped. After finishing up phase one, the workers will start right away with the visitor’s side. Finally, the press box will be modernized with, for example, its own VIP suite and a filming area.
Jamie Apicella, associate director of Facilities, is determined that the workers are going to be done before the fall 2014 season starts. “We are looking at the beginning of August until the new face of the field will be ready,” Apicella said.
The Athletics Department started a fundraiser campaign in order to cover the estimated $4 million project, and throughout the wait, they have made an approximate of $2 million, counted last August.
The university has promised to cover the second part, however, the possibility to sell the naming rights have also been discussed, which would LIU Post’s portion of the bill. Apicella revealed his confusion of the costs, but seems comfortable with the school’s calculations. “I am not familiar with the exact amount, although, I can assure you that a good portion of the money comes from fundraised money,” said Apicella.
Student reactions about the costs of the project were diverse. Julia Romell, an undeclared visiting student, was positive about the project, despite the fact that she does not participate on a school athletic team. “Since it has been planned for years now, and fundraised money has been collected, I believe that this seems to be a project worth investing in,” she said.
Jeniel Terrero, sophomore Broadcast major, on the other hand, is not quite sold by the project, as he believes that the money is needed elsewhere. “I don’t think a new stadium is worth spending money on. Instead, I would like to see some changes in, for example, renovating the dorms, or improving the food at Winnick,” Terrero said.
Thomas Bowen, graduate M.B.A. student and soccer athlete from Wales, is not surprised by the diverse opinions that students seem to have regarding the project.
“Someone who is not an athlete will probably find other projects more important, because a new stadium does not really affect them,” he said.
However, Bowen also emphasized the importance of new facilities in order to attract players to the university. “Compared to most other facilities we’ve visited this year with the soccer team, ours is clearly a bit outdated.” He continued, “If we want to improve as a school and attract good athletes, then modern facilities will definitely help.”

This year marks the 42nd anniversary of the War on Drugs, an initiative started by President Richard Nixon in 1971 to prohibit and reduce the production, distribution and consumption of illegal drugs.
The 1960’s were a time of youth rebellion and music, literature, and drugs became symbols for the uprising. With the increase in usage of marijuana, opium and psychedelics, Nixon declared these substances illegal and harmful, without further scientific research of the medical safety of the drugs, according to Drugpolicy.org. The main drug control tactic of then and now relies on law enforcement restraint of the supply instead of other strategies like education and decriminalization.
When the initiative began, the issue with drugs was not the dangers or the risks, but who was associated with it. Drugsense.org reports that Chinese and Mexican immigrants were highly connected to opium and marijuana in the past, leading to the first anti-drug laws. And today, illegal drug use is largely related to African American and Latino communities.
Although these populations are no more likely to use or sell illegal drugs than whites, blacks were arrested for drug related violations 2-5 times more than whites from 1980-2008 as reported by Richard Branson of CNN. In his article “War on Drugs a Trillion- Dollar Failure”, Branson explains that these are the populations that are targeted, disproportionately criminalized and incarcerated.
A study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration published in September 2013 shows that whites use cocaine and heroin more than blacks. However, the reports from the Human Rights Watch organization display that African Americans and Latinos are 10.1 times more likely to be sent to prison for drug law violations than whites.
The roots and strategies of the War on Drugs have proved to be a complete failure, according to studies done in 2007 from the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. Results show drugs have become cheaper and more potent over the last two decades. Also more people are criminalized for low-level violations, first time and non- violent offenders, than when the “war” was started.
When asked about the effect of the War on Drugs today, Kristina Bonrall, a senior Psychology major, declared it “useless”. ”It seems like America is wasting a lot of money on something that isn’t working,” Bonrall said.
Since the “war” was declared 42 years ago, America has spent about $1 trillion in efforts to restrict drug distribution through law enforcement. In an article written by Fareed Zakaria on Timesmagazine.com, it is expressed that 1.66 million Americans were arrested for drug law violations in 2009 alone—with 4 out of 5 being for possession. If the intention of the War on Drugs was to increase the number of Americans behind bars, then the campaign would be considered a success.
However, U.S. drug usage has not been reduced, but increased enough to make the U.S. the number 1 nation in the world for illegal drug use, according to a 2013 New York Times article entitled “Cheaper, Purer, Illegal Substances” by Katie Hunt.
The well-known picture of a law-enforcement team posing with piles of confiscated illegal drugs usually associated with the War on Drugs misconstrues the actual progression of the campaign.
A new approach is obviously needed to better address the drug problem in the U.S. Drugpolicy.org states that over 1.5 million people are arrested, prosecuted, and incarcerated each year in the U.S. for drug violations. Criminalizing the drugs and those that use them can create more of a problem than the drugs themselves. The Drug Policy Alliance, activists for better drug policies, stresses the idea of abusers being treated for their addictions instead of stigmatized and handcuffed.
With the many efforts used to reduce the drug supply failing, new strategies are needed, like drug education and addiction treatment. Drugpolicy.org states that the U.S. spends more than $51 billion annually to prevent drug distribution and use. The Drug Policy Alliance works to shift funding from the usual law enforcement tactics of the war to effective drug treatment plans and educational programs—new efficient strategies that the U.S. government could fund.
Conviction for drug violations for first time offenders or low-level violations can result in devastating consequences. Low-level offenders could be non-violent people with minimal or no prior criminal history. These people are incarcerated and labeled as criminals, often causing them to lose their employment, financial aid for school, the right to vote and more.
Michael Brown, a senior Criminal Justice major, posed a pragmatic question. “A lot of people do drugs; does that mean they’re all criminals?” Brown continued, “We need to find a way to deal with drug use that actually works.”
According to the National Institute of Justice, the evaluation agency of the Department of Justice, of the offenders released from prison, 60-80 percent of them experience recidivism, repeating the same crime or going on to commit other crimes, usually drug related. The National Institute of Justice also states that about 95 percent of offenders return to drug abuse after release from prison. These results add to the argument that the War on Drugs is failing to prevent drug use and distribution, and that new tactics are desperately needed.
Using educational strategies to replace law enforcement ones can aid in making the War on Drugs more efficient. This in turn would better aid in tending to the U.S. drug problem, ending racial inequality in drug law enforcement and prosecution, and finally change the view on drugs in this country and those who use them.

“Advertisers should just quit. Nothing will ever top this Volvo ad. Makes me want to sell my house and buy a Volvo truck!” was one of thousands of Tweets about Volvo’s new truck ad, featuring Belgian martial artist/action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, performing a symmetrically perfect, but unreal-looking, split atop two reversing trucks. The advertisement, which has left viewers gaping in awe, attracted more than 50 million YouTube views in two weeks.
Is this real or is this fake? How on earth was it shot? Is it even physically possible? Volvo’s new truck commercial certainly stands out for its originality. By associating Van Damme’s unwavering stability, and focus, to endure his split, with the dynamic strengths in their FM Series trucks’ steering features, Volvo goes beyond the typical car commercial. The best part is the performance was real, and in addition, shot during a single take.
The ad, named “The Epic Split feat. Van Damme,” starts off showing only the actor’s upper body, with closed eyes, while viewers hear him talking about his legs being strong enough to defy the laws of physics. The camera begins to zoom out to the sounds of Enya’s “Only Time,” revealing that Van Damme stands with one foot atop each side mirror of two golden trucks traveling in reverse next to each other. As if that was not enough, the vehicles start to separate with exact equal timing and precision, gradually forcing Van Damme to perform a perfect split – a position held for almost 30 seconds.
How was the commercial made, then? Are Van Damme’s legs really strong and stable enough to defy the laws of physics? Anders Vil- helmsson, Volvo Truck’s Public Relations Manager, and Anders Nilsson, the video director, said in a Wall Street Journal article that the elements in the ad are real. “The stunt is real and performed in just one take. Van Damme’s feet were never secured to the mirrors.” Vilhelmsson added, “even though we nailed it in one take, there had been plenty of rehearsals before we filmed it.” However, Nilsson noted that some safety precautions had to be taken during the shoot. “Van Damme needed to be rigged, since we did not want to be responsible for killing the Muscles from Brussels [a nickname of Van Damme],” he said. The measures included safety lines that were later made invisible in the commercial and small platforms attached to the mirrors to create a flatter surface to stand on.
Chris Lorentzen, junior Business major, is highly impressed with the commercial. “It’s hard to believe that the stunt is real. It’s logical to think that Van Damme has been cut into the image, because it is just so unreal that anyone would be able to perform a perfect split on top of two trucks,” he said. “Van Damme’s extreme body control and agility is also crazy. This commercial was definitely an uplift for him and everybody is impressed by his split,” he added.
Even though this might have been one of the more epic splits in Van Damme’s career, the Muscles from Brussels is well known for showing off the most agile performances on the movie screen. His martial arts career began at age 11, when he became a practitioner at the National Karate Centre of Belgium, after being inspired by super heroes in comic books. He began fighting on professional level at 16-years-old, and trained in bodybuilding and kickboxing on a daily basis to gain physical strength and grow muscle.
Ballet classes were also part of the training program, to improve his flexibility. He landed his first leading role in 1988, starring in “Blood sport,” and became the highest paid martial arts actor in the world during the 1990s. Two years ago, his well trained body was seen in “The Expendables II,” where he starred together with some world famous action stars, such as Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Van Damme has revealed to plenty of health magazines that training and healthy eating are large parts of his lifestyle. He eats a lot
of vegetables, and also prefers intense repetitions rather than going fast and maxing out as part of his workout regimen. He said in an interview with Men’s Health News that “mixing karate with ballet has greatly improved his flexibility. Ballet takes impossibly hard work in your body and mind, yet it must look all effortless, isometric, perfect.”
Making it look effortless, isometric and perfect is exactly what Van Damme manages to do in Volvo’s truck ad. Now, Volvo has to wait and see if potential clients are looking for dynamic steering models featuring the same qualities. But one thing is sure; other car companies might have to step up their advertising game.

Social media has a tremendous impact on today’s generation of kids, teens, and young adults. Social media can be defined as websites and applications used for social networking. Most students on campus agree that Facebook and Twitter are among the most popular social media outlets. However, has everyone forgotten about the site that started it all?
MySpace.com is a social networking service with a strong music emphasis, which launched in August 2003. MySpace was the not only the most visited social website from 2005-2008, but also surpassed Google as the most visited website in the U.S. in 2006. When Myspace was created, users had the opportunity to create their own profiles as they liked, with their favorite music and friends displayed on their page.
When asked if he remembered MySpace, Anderson Summers, Criminal Justice junior, began to chuckle. “Man, MySpace used to be the site when I was in junior high school,” he said. “My friends and I used to go on it every day, listen to artists’ new music, and started making new friends that didn’t go to our school.”
Users were able to upload photos, send private messages, post public messages, and upload videos. But in 2009, growing usage of Facebook overshadowed MySpace.
Facebook is similar to MySpace, with enhanced features, such as a newsfeed that allows the user to view friends’ and friends of friends’ posts without viewing their profile. Posts could include a personal status such as thoughts, videos, photos, or even website links. Facebook gives people the opportunity to connect with old friends by listings of the previous schools they attended or neighborhoods that they lived in.
Katie Cohen, senior Biology major, said Facebook is the only social media site she is involved with. “I love Facebook; it’s a way for me stay close with my old friends from middle school and my distant family that lives in Colorado. It’s a great way to stay in contact with people, and get informed about news around the world.”
Another social media site that is used heavily by students on campus is Twitter. It is a site that enables users to send and read tweets. Tweets are posts, limited to 140 characters, in which users express their thoughts, activities, etc. Twitter is also a way for celebrities to interact with their fans.
“Twitter is one of my favorite social sites,” said Marquis Pagan, sophomore Finance major. “It’s a way to express your thoughts and feelings, and contact people on a different level than you can with any other network,” Pagan added.
A newer site that is also being used by students on campus
is Instagram. Instagram is an online photo/video-sharing site that encourages its users to upload videos and pictures, apply digital filters to them, and share them on other social websites, categorizing them with hashtags. A hashtag is a word or phrase that is preceded by a pound sign, used to identify the message on a specific topic.
It is hard to find a college student who does not have an account on a social media website. Social media are ways to connect with friends, network yourself, and inform yourself and others about what is going on around the world. Every few years, it seems like there is something new that people join and grow to love. Now, the question is, what social network will affect the world next?

Many people say that chivalry is dead – but is it? Chivalry is defined as being a gentleman for one’s significant other. To women, chivalry may be when their partner opens doors for them or picks up the check at a restaurant or bar. Sometimes, a guy can even carry a woman’s books or purse to show his consideration. Chivalry, for the most part, is about respect – not superiority.
Emily Esfahani Smith is a feminist writer who has a lot to say about the chivalry in today’s society. Smith wrote, “Chivalry arose as a response to the violence and barbarism of the Middle Ages. It cautioned men to temper their aggression, deploying it only in appropriate circumstances.” By doing this, it would end the torture and assault of women. Of course, men did not abide by society back then, and even today, but chivalry changed societies outlook on women. Chivalry may not be 100 percent better than it used to be, but it is becoming more and more of a social norm, according to Smith.
Men may be physically, chemically, and mentally different than women, but even so, they should still respect women and be polite, helpful, and kind around them. Danielle Coccia, freshman Undecided major, said, “I think people who grew up watching their parents practice chivalry are the only ones who use it now.” She believes that chivalry comes from family and parental guidance. However, it might also stem f from environment, friends and associates, Coccia explained.
Alexander Ayala, Graduate student, said, “Well, it’s not dead – – it became more open, and easier, to have sex due to the new social nature of society. Why be a gentleman if you don’t need to be to impress a girl’s parents? Girls think more like men nowadays.”
Ayala stated that he is chivalrous, though. He continued, “My girlfriend, for example: I’ll hold the door for her and I’ll walk to her to class if we hang out. I’ll bring her coffee also. So it’s not dead, there are just different forms of it.” Chivalry is different in every era and society. Fighting a war for your woman had become holding the door open for your lady. Ayala uses chivalry to respect his girlfriend and not feel “above” her.
The main question still stands; is chivalry dead? Most people believe it is not dead, so why should we suspect it is? Maybe there are just different forms of it.

Now that the breaking of bread over Thanksgiving tables across America has come to a close, it is an appropriate time to welcome winter and the rest of the joyous holidays ahead. Finals are quickly approaching, and a much needed month-long break is on the way for the LIU Post community.
How do students and faculty plan to spend the holiday season? During the winter, most people tend to stay shut in; cuddled up with hot cocoa, or some like to frolic in freshly fallen snow. Those are just two of the endless activities that winter has to offer.
I love Manhattan on any given day, but there is something unexplainably special about Christmas time in the city. New York
seems to shine brighter with breathtaking window displays, beautiful decorations adorning the city streets, and tourists from around the world taking in the spectacle of the season.
Manhattan offers a wide variety of activities at this time of year, most famously the Radio City Music Hall’s Christmas Spectacular, a classic for the whole family to enjoy. A favorite among tourists and locals alike is taking a spin on the city’s ice-skating rinks. There are three Manhattan locations at Bryant Park, Central Park, and Rockefeller Plaza, where you can glide alongside Rockefeller Center’s famous Christmas tree.
A new feature this season is the musical adaptation of the beloved holiday movie, “A Christmas Story,” at The Theatre at Madison Square Garden. The show will run from December 11-29, and tickets can be purchased at http://achristmasstorythemusical.com.
If you are not one who craves the urban beat of the city, the possibilities are endless if you prefer hibernation. ABC Family’s “25 Days
of Christmas” lineup is enough to make anyone excited, with programming synced to the spirit of the holidays. The channel broadcasts favorites such as “The Santa Clause” franchise, “The Polar Express,” “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” and many others. On a cold, dreary day, there is nothing better than kicking back under cozy blankets with a hot beverage and watching heart-warming holiday programming.
An underrated winter activity is doing anything at all by the fireplace. The comforting crackle of wood burning acts as the perfect background music in tandem with your lengthy holiday playlist. Activities such as making gingerbread houses (no, you’re not too old for that), baking Christmas cookies (get creative instead of buying the pre-made Pillsbury stuff; you eat all of it raw anyway), and trimming the tree can be even more enjoyable beside the fireplace.
Of course, winter break signifies that special time of year when college students can reunite with high school friends. A great way to spend time and catch up with old friends is by hosting a pot-luck dinner party. Pot-luck requires each guest to bring a food item to be shared in a sort of feast among friends. Together, the group can eat, drink, and
be merry while sharing stories from the past semester and reminiscing about the glory days.
Perhaps the greatest thing about winter’s activities is the emphasis they place on joy and goodwill. The holidays are a time for family and friends, excitement and entertainment, laughter and love—I could alliterate all day. Enjoy the season for making spirits bright, and remember to take advantage of all the wonders winter has in store. Happy Holidays!

Typhoon Haiyan devastated the eastern island of Leyte and the coastal city of Tacloban in the Philippines on Nov. 7, 2013. The horrific incident left around 2,000 dead and more than 600,000 families homeless and desperate for help. Now that the typhoon is over, the survivors are taking in all the damage and trying to rebuild their lives. The typhoon is recognized as one of the worst storms ever recorded. What the survivors now need is hope and assistance. Organizations around the world including the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the Red Cross, and Global Giving are lending helping hands to clean up the catastrophic mess.
UNICEF is focusing on the children of the Philippines. It’s new campaign “There for the Philippines” is working toward immediate and long-term relief for the children of the country and their families who were affected by the storm. The organization is asking for donations, which will be used to rush in emergency supplies such as water and medicine. The organization has celebrity supporters, as well. Rihanna is a huge benefactor of the campaign and has donated toward the cause. If anyone wishes to make a donation, it is only a click away. Simply go to http://www.unicef.org/ philippines and choose either “give monthly” or “give one-time” on the left of the screen.
The Red Cross is a well-known organization that has helped millions around the world in need. They help support America’s military families, provide health and safety training and education, are huge providers towards disaster relief, and help those who need blood by holding blood drives all over the country. The Red Cross helps out with over 70,000 natural disasters, fires, floods, earthquakes, and more each year. They were a great help to Hurricane Sandy victims and are now doing the same for the Philippines. Those who wish to donate can at http://www.redcross.org.ph/donate. The money is going toward food and the many other materials the survivors are in need of.
The Global Giving Foundation is also working hard to help those living in despair. The Global Giving Foundation is a fundraising website for charities that gives non-profit organizations and social entrepreneurs around the world the chance to raise money for their cause. All donations made to the non-profits and social entrepreneurs working toward helping the Philippines on Global Giving will support the personal and physical recovery in the country. The Disaster Response Program, a unit that is run by the Conference of State Court Administrators (COSCA), is managing the relief efforts. The organization is looking to help rebuild the affected areas and help develop a much more improved approach to managing disasters. They believe it is not only important to help improve the condition of the country now, but also help to make sure that this does not happen again. Donations to the Global Giving Organization can be made at http://www.globalgiving.org.
The typhoon has devastated the country, leaving many with nothing. It was only last year that the Tri- state area was hit by Hurricane Sandy. We needed help, and now those living in the Philippines need our help. Donations are extremely important to not only help the survivors get back on their feet, but to also keep them alive. Organizations are doing all that they can, but with our help this tragedy may be over as quickly as it began.

Each year, LIU Post Film juniors form groups for production lab films. The assignment mandates students to take various roles from director, to screenwriter, to production designer, and build an original film with a small stipend, plus any other funds they can gather. One of the promising projects this year is the satirical college comedy, “Love Less Naked.”
The group combines the efforts writer/director Michael Mirabella, cinematographer George Cayea, producer Candace Rizkowsky, art designer Dillon Idone and editor/sound designer Rich DiLeo.
Taking place on the fictional college campus of Coxington University, home of the venerable Mighty Cox, “Love Less Naked” follows hopeless romantic Bert, whose misconception of love and lack of confidence are painstakingly changed in his trial-and-error exploits. As such, the film will require funding to create a particular world for its characters and humor.
The “Love Less Naked” group is trying to raise $1,000 to fund their efforts to make a better film, with costs going toward a camera, technical equipment, elaborate set dressings including clothing, posters, banners, flyers, casting, catering and more.
Donations can be made at the “Love Less Naked” IndieGoGo campaign page, where the group describes its goals. The page also features a hilarious promotional video. Those who contribute can receive gifts including buttons, t-shirts, DVD copies and film credit, depending on the amount of money donated.
“The film lampoons the typical definition of love. Our goal is to make the audience question whether or not romance exists, or if the feelings we often call love are merely a derivative of lust,” the group wrote on their IndieGoGo campaign page. “[It] raises these questions through a comical and heartwarming narrative.”
The IndieGoGo campaign will run through December, and has already raised over $500. To donate, visit http://www.indiegogo.com/ projects/love-less-naked.
