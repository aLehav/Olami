LIU President Dr. Kimberly Cline announced that Bethpage Federal Credit Union (BFCU) would be the corporate sponsor of the new athletic stadium that’s currently undergoing renovation, and slated to open at the beginning of the Fall 2014 semester.
At a press conference held in the Hillwood Commons lobby during common hour, on Wednesday, March 19, Cline said that the Bethpage Federal Credit Union is providing $1.5 million to be the new stadium’s namesake. The naming sponsorship will be paid over a period of 10 years and will cover the stadium renovations. “There has been additional $1.5 million contributions from alumni and friends of the university,” Cline said.
Post students, faculty administrators and representatives from BFCU headquarters, and local news outlets covering the announcement, were present at the conference. The stadium sponsorship also marks the beginning of a new partnership between the university and BFCU. A new “high-tech” branch of BFCU is scheduled to open on campus this summer, and will provide banking and financial services to the LIU Post community to replace NEFCU, the bank that moved off campus last December. The credit union will co-sponsor numerous LIU activities along with the administration that offers benefits to the wider Long Island communities, such as financial literacy seminars and summer sports camps.
“We were submitted a proposal from the university that stated the school was looking for a partner for naming rights,” said Linda Armyn, senior vice president of Corporate Strategy for BFCU. “We listed what our capabilities were and what we thought we would be able to do in working with the [Post] community as a whole, and based on our proposal, [Post] awarded us with the opportunity,” she added.
“We’re also going to hire interns to work at our headquarters [in Bethpage] so that they can learn and be a part of a career in financial services, if that’s what they wish to pursue,” Armyn said.
“We’re going to work with the Tilles Center, the alumni association, and the Student Government Association (SGA) to provide enough sustenance for the whole campus,” she added.
“We are thrilled about this partnership,” said Kirk Kordeleski, president and CEO of BFCU. “Not only will the naming rights for the stadium build our brand in this community, and hopefully among the students and staff, but really the involvement with the entire university community…[is something that] we’re really looking forward to. We hope we can be a great partner since we love working on projects like this,” Kordeleski said.
“The relationship with Bethpage Federal Credit Union is a wonderful initiative for the university because not only do we have our students [on campus contributing to our relationship with BFCU], but we are also now going to be bringing the [off campus] community into the university [with the establishment of the BFCU branch in the Commons],” Cline said.
“The partnership with Bethpage Federal Credit Union is not only one that will bring great opportunities to our students, but will also bring great partnerships in regards to the stadium renovation and the renovation of the NEFCU bank space in Hillwood, which will lift everyone up at Post and make everything a little bit better,” said Daniel Potenzieri, president of the Student Government Association (SGA) and a senior Political Science major.
The Pioneer reported in March 2013 that the Athletic department had then raised approximately $2 million for the renovations of the stadium through the use of a fundraising campaign, and that the total cost of the renovations was estimated to be $4 million. “Many of the donors were football alumni. Some members of the community bought a brick, which cost $500 a piece. The university agreed to help pay for the field by matching the amount of money the athletic department earned,” according to Bryan Collins, Post’s athletic director.
According to the March 2013 Pioneer article, “Athletic Renovations Delayed,” the naming rights were being sold for $1.5 million, but had not yet been purchased, although there were a few prospects that the university had been working with.
“The new Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium will open in Fall 2014, and will serve as home field for the football, lacrosse, and field hockey teams,” Collins said. “The stadium will feature an all-new, high-tech press box and sound system, signage, bleachers and grassy-hill seating for picnicking.”

The Campus Concierge, formerly known as the Hillwood Information Desk, has been transformed with a new look and new student- friendly services. The Concierge had its opening day on Monday, March 17.
“The desk was redesigned to improve the campus life experience for all students. Our new tag line is—‘making campus life easier, more affordable, and fun.’ It really sums up the entire project. The Hillwood Information Desk has provided great amenities to the LIU Post community for many years, but the Campus Concierge is about providing students with access to more services and programs,” said Michael Berthel, the associate director of the Office of Student Life & Leadership Development.
The redesign of the desk includes a repainted back wall, a new computerized point of sale system that will be used to conduct all sales and transactions, a new photo wrap above the desk, as well as Campus Concierge signage. The changes are meant to provide a more professional and welcoming face to the Hillwood Commons lobby.
“The concierge focuses on four main categories for services and programs,” Berthel said. “Complimentary items will be provided to students who need them, including pens, highlighters, ice scrapers, and feminine personal care products,” he added..
“There will also be a new ‘Take a Faculty Member to Lunch’ program for students who want to collaborate with faculty. Interested students can come to the Campus Concierge and get up to three free lunch vouchers that can be redeemed in the Winnick Student Center or the Hillwood Café,” he added. “Ticket sales will incorporate any on-campus student events and off-campus trips. This includes Broadway shows in Manhattan, campus sporting events, senior week events, and so on. One of the most exciting sales is our discounted movie tickets. Students can purchase tickets for any AMC, Loews, or Multiplex Theatre for $8, that’s $4 cheaper than buying them at the actual theater. There are no restrictions and the tickets do not expire,” Berthel said. This is a partnership with the corporate offices for each movie theatre. The University purchases the tickets in bulk and sells them at cost to students.
Students can borrow or rent umbrellas and scientific calculators and return them within 48 hours. Additional services will be added throughout the semester. “Soon we will introduce laundry and dry cleaning services for students, faculty and staff with a two-day turnaround. The prices for this service will be competitive,” Berthel said. All dry cleaning and laundry would be done by an off-campus vendor and delivered back to the Campus Concierge.
All of the old features of the Hillwood Information Desk are still part of the Campus Concierge, including the game room equipment lending, student locker rentals, lost and found, and general campus information. The hours will be the same under the new Campus Concierge, every day 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., including weekends. “While walking through Hillwood, I was pleasantly surprised by the new design of the Information Desk.
The Campus Concierge looks so much more appealing. Everyone is in Hillwood at some point or another, so it was a great idea to improve its appearance. And now that I know about the services, if it ever starts to rain and I don’t have an umbrella, no big deal! I can borrow one from the Concierge!” said Courtney Simone, a sophomore Math Education major.
“Calling it a concierge is meant to highlight the higher quality of customer service that students will come to expect from it,” Berthel explained.
The Campus Concierge will staff student employees; however, the position names have changed from ‘Hillwood receptionists’ to ‘Concierge Assistants.’ The job responsibilities have been adjusted to reflect the new services and programs. All student concierge assistants are supervised and trained in customer service by the Office of Student Life and Leadership Development. The concierge is staffed with around 25 student employees.
Josh Deshommes, a sophomore Physical Education major, said, “I never really used to stop by the Hillwood Desk in the past. Now that I know about the new services, if I need an extra pen or need to borrow a calculator or umbrella, I know where to go. The concierge has so much to offer, [and] students should take advantage.”
The Concierge is equipped to keep track of the amount of visitors seen every day. This information will help identify what services are most popular, and also determine how to staff the concierge in the future. The new point of sale system automatically keeps data on what products are selling and how many people utilize the services. Berthel said,“Now that we are open, we will begin to identify our most popular services.”

Robert Hannafin, dean of the College of Education, Information, and Technology, has announced that he will resign from his position at the end of the spring semester after three years at LIU. Hannafin has recently accepted the position as Dean of the Graduate School of Education and Allied Professions at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, effective July 1.
Hannafin has a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from Arizona State University and a B.S. in Accounting from St. Francis College. Prior to his time at LIU Post, he was a director in the learning and development group at Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, and a former professor and curriculum developer at three universities. From 1997 to 2004, he was an assistant/associate professor of curriculum at the College of William and Mary. From 2004 to 2008, he was an associate professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Connecticut.
Most recently as dean, Hannafin managed eight academic programs on three campuses of LIU. When asked about his favorite things about being the Dean he said, “I love the students and my colleagues. The faculty is extremely dedicated to student success and to making this world a better place. My least favorite things are budget cuts. But we needed to get leaner so that we can continue to provide the kind of quality education our students deserve.”
Hannafin made the decision to leave Post in order to be closer to home in Connecticut. He has been commuting from Connecticut to Long Island during his time here. Hannafin has every intention of staying connected to LIU Post, and has fond memories of his time here. He explained that the College of Education has recently been experiencing difficult times because of the decline in the number of teaching jobs available to graduates on Long Island. There are, however, a decent amount of jobs available if students put the effort into looking for them.
Hannafin explained that there are a number of “shortage areas,” such as math, and jobs that require bilingual capabilities. Other disciplines, such as mental health counseling and speech keep growing, and jobs are becoming more and more readily available to prospective education professionals.
When asked about his ideas for the future of education professions at LIU Post, as well as other universities, Hannafin offered these words of wisdom: “Education is a great career. If you are called to the profession, follow your heart. The job will be there.”
The matter of appointing a new dean has yet to be decided.

An information session for Fulbright Scholarships during common hour on March 20, drew nearly 20 students to the Kahn Discovery Center. The scholarship for study, research, and teaching assistantships abroad is available for graduating seniors, graduate students, early-career professionals, teachers, and creative and performing artists.
For all students who wish to go abroad after graduation, and add some prestige to their resumes while doing it, the Fulbright Scholarship is a great opportunity. The scholarship offers two types of grants: a Research/Study grant, and an English Teaching Assistantship (ETA). The first includes doing research, study, or art projects abroad; the other helps teach English and U.S. culture in another country. Dr. Glynis Pereyra, LIU Post Fulbright Program advisor and assistant dean of the College of Liberal Arts, explained that experience is valuable to students who wish to teach, and that tutoring is a great opportunity to gain some expertise in the field.
The Fulbright Scholarship was created by Congress in 1946, and is granted by the U.S. Department of State. Through the years, the Fulbright Program has had a large number of notable grant recipients who have gone on to occupy key roles within government, academia, and industry.
In order to be eligible, you have to be a U.S. citizen and have at least a bachelor’s degree or equivalent by the start of the grant. Since the preparation and application process is long, juniors are permitted to apply, but only through the LIU Post campus Fulbright Program Advisors. Many host countries also require exchange students to be proficient in the language of that country.
The Fulbright Scholarship offers a monthly stipend, accident and sickness coverage, and a round-trip airfare. Other potential benefits may be offered depending on the country a student is going to. These include dependent support, research allowance, tuition, language lessons, enhancement activities, and disability-related accommodations.
The four general qualification requirements of applicants are: high level of academic and/or professional achievement, demonstrated leadership ability, sufficient language proficiency, and a well-developed feasible project. This might sound overwhelming, but if a student is weaker in one area and stronger in another, “it will balance out,” Pereyra said. “No one should feel discouraged by that.
The application should consist of a cover letter (CV), a short essay including a statement of grant purpose, a foreign language evaluation (developed by a Post language professor), references, and transcripts. A research/study application should also include an affiliation letter from an advisor in the host country, while an arts project application should include supplementary materials such as a portfolio.
“Many students are intimidated by the process, but it’s really not that bad,” Pereyra said. She explained that a lot of students don’t complete their applications for this reason, and that you have a great chance of getting the scholarship if you do.
Fulbright applications are to be submitted to the campus Fulbright Program Advisors by September 9. A second information session about the scholarships will be scheduled later this spring.
Pereyra and Joan Ruckel, fellow Fulbright Program advisor and administrative assistant of the College of Liberal Arts, encouraged all students to take the chance and apply for the scholarship, explaining that it is a great personal and professional experience.
For more information, visit us.fulbrightonline.org/home.html or contact the campus Fulbright Program advisors: glynis.pereyra@liu.edu or joan.ruckel@liu.edu.

Networking is a term that is often used and emphasized today. But do college students really know what it means, and more importantly, understand its significance?
On Tuesday, March 18, LIU Post’s Career Services and Experiential Education department hosted a networking event and welcomed college recruiters Jeannie Toscano and Jennifer Tudda-Githens from the Geico Insurance Company to teach the importance of networking when searching for jobs.
The event, which was free of charge and open to all students, was held in room 121 of Humanities Hall. A dozen students whose majors ranged from English to Marketing, gained skills that will help them when visiting networking fairs and searching for jobs. They were taught how to initiate conversations by correctly using icebreakers, skills that are relevant to have when networking.
Networking, according to Tudda-Githens, is a process where you develop long-term relationships with others for mutual benefit. For college students, the concept of networking appears nerve-racking and intimidating. Many assume that to become a successful networker, you must be a “people person.” However, if you are aware of how to communicate in a variety of different ways, be it formally or informally, anybody can master the skill.
The purpose of the event was to prepare students for what lies beyond life after Post. At some point in time, students will begin to search for a job, thus being able to network successfully and confidently is a vital key that will contribute toward the career path of the students. Additionally, the lecture aimed to help those who plan on attending the career fair that will be taking place from 11 a.m. to 2.30 p.m., on April 10 at the Tilles Center Atrium. The students will have a better idea of what to expect when surrounded by the 50 companies that have been invited, as well as how to communicate with potential employers.
“College students fail to understand the importance of networking,” Toscano said. “When networking, you can do all sorts of things. You can get to know people, investigate career ideas, learn from others’ experiences, find jobs and opportunities that are not publicly advertised, build a support team or mentor for you career, and develop your soft skills[which are communication and listening.]”
Toscano also remarked on the notion that networking isn’t all about verbal communications. “When you attend an event there is a lot to be done before the actual networking [begins]. Students should know to arrive early at such events, in order to avoid the consequence of being late, which is finding everyone else already in deep conversation, making it harder for you to communicate and network,” Tudda-Githens said.
“Leave bags and coats at the check in or entrance, it makes it easier to move through the crowds without them. Also, make sure your business cards are handy and always smile and make eye-contact.”
Tudda-Githens and Toscano will return to campus for the career fair on April 10 to recruit for Geico’s Management Development department.

Commuter students, faculty, and staff know how difficult it is to find a good parking spot on campus in the morning. Here at Post, it is first come, first serve. This ongoing issue has become even more of a problem for faculty and staff since Canrock employees were granted permission to park in the faculty/staff parking lots near the library.
As The Pioneer reported in its January 29 issue, Canrock Ventures LLC, is an early stage technology venture capital fund that moved from Hicksville to the LIU Post campus, during Thanksgiving weekend.
Canrock’s temporary offices are in the basement of the library, but it will move to its permanent location at the top of the Commons in Hillwood soon. In the parking lot near the library, there are 137 parking spaces that are available on a first come, first serve basis, for all faculty members and staff. These spots are now available to Canrock employees as well.
“There are approximately 30 Canrock employees working on the campus. However, there are no more than 20 employees working each day, and they all come to work at different times of the day,” said Marcia Harrington, director of Public Relations for Post.
Since their current location is in the basement of the library, they have been assigned parking in the lot next to the library, according to Ryan Attard, director of Entrepreneurship. That parking lot, which is one of the closest to the classroom buildings, is not as big as others. It is one of the most popular parking lots for faculty members, and since December, they have been sharing it with Canrock workers.
When Canrock moves to its permanent location in Hilllwood Commons, its employees will then be able to park in the parking lot behind Hillwood, where again, it’s also first come, first serve, for students, faculty, and staff, but where more spots might be available.

LIU Post offers more than 250 undergraduate majors. From Business to Biology to Broadcasting, there is a vast majority of programs. For the class of 2014, the five most popular undergraduate majors are a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Bachelor of Arts and Science in Psychology, Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice, Bachelor of Science in Childhood Education, and Bachelor of Science in Nutrition. The class of 2014 includes more than 2,200 students, according to LIU Post’s Registrar Beth Wilkow.
“Being a Business major is pretty stressful because not only is it a lot of work, but it isn’t easy to find a job,” said Ryan Kelly, a senior Business Administration major. “I am focusing on Finance and am definitely nervous about finding a job when I graduate. Our school does have a lot of networking programs during the year, though, for the Business college,” Kelly added.
“I have a heavy course load with tests pretty much every day,” said Thomas Durso, a freshman Business Administration major. “Business majors are really competitive in general because it is probably the most common degree in the country. The Business school here is okay, and hopefully my counselors are good at helping me find internships.”
Business Administration majors can pick a concentration in Finance, Management, Marketing, or International Business. This allows them to focus on the specific type of business they hope to work in when they graduate.
The Bachelor of Science in Business Administration is an accredited program by the International Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (IAACSB), which is the world’s leading business school organization.
The Criminal Justice major gives students hands on training in the field. “So far, I am really happy with my major and the program here at Post,” said John O’Donnell, a junior Criminal Justice major. “My professors are great, and I feel that Criminal Justice is a popular major here. All my classes are full.”
Childhood Education majors are required to pick a concentration in the Liberal Arts and Sciences. Concentrations include American Studies, French, Philosophy, History, Sociology, to name a few. They are required to complete a semester-long program where they work in real classrooms helping students. “The professors were great and I feel totally prepared to be a teacher,” said Brittney Cataldo, a senior Childhood Education major. “For a full semester, I got to be a student teacher, which helped me learn and showed me that I definitely want to do this for a living.”
The hardest decision can be choosing a major. LIU Post has Academic Advisers assigned for each college, who help to guide students in the right direction so they get the most out of their courses and graduate on time. The Academic Advisers help students understand the requirements of their majors, assist in selecting the best courses in order to meet their specific academic, and career goals.

Four times a week in the early evenings, you can find LIU Post student Nick Butera heading north on the Meadowbrook Parkway. On Wednesday morning, March 19, he sips on his coffee, the beverage burns his tongue, and he increases the volume dial on his car, as he heads to his 8 a.m. class. The beats per minute (BPM), is steady and supported by multiple synths and sirens. “It’s mixed well; the lead isn’t too loud,” he said. The song ends. However, this wasn’t some famous radio DJ — it’s Nick’s original material. He goes by the name DJ Niko.
Butera, a sophomore Business Administration major has aspirations to one day make a living from music. However, currently he is also dedicated to creating electronic dance music (EDM), which is a form of music that rose in popularity during the late-2000s and reached mainstream popularity by 2010. Electronic dance music is categorized by percussive rhythms for dance based entertainment and is usually played at concerts or nightclubs.
At 12:30 p.m., the same day, Butera opens up his laptop while seated in the media lab in Humanities Hall and reveals he has an independent album coming out soon. “Right now, I have five songs on my Soundcloud from it, none of them are available for download yet. It’s going to be between eight and 11 songs.” Butera further explained that he plans to release the album this summer.
Butera grew up in Merrick, 20 minutes south of Post. He recalled his first experience with creating EDM and how it coincided with the mainstream explosion. “I made my first complete techno song on Fruity Loops [a production program] in 2009. Soon after that, it really took off. I really appreciate it and enjoy it making it.” Fruity Loops is a pattern- based, digital audio workshop used to sequence music as you please, for various forms of music.
At 1:30 p.m., Butera is still talking about his music and insisting that his tracks hold a sincere amount of originality. “I try not to veer too far off from what the majority of EDM is today — at the same time, I try to spend as much time as I can to make my song sound original.”
Burcu Altintas, a freshman Psychology major, has heard Butera’s dance songs in between classes and likes what she has heard so far. “It was different with Nick; his music was actually something different. It didn’t sound like something that the kid in my Bio class formulated. It sounded like something I would have heard partying in Cancún.” Butera cites multiple influences, ranging from heavy metal, rap, and pop in his EDM music.
At 2 p.m., Butera gets up to go study for an exam. He will go to work at 4 p.m. He works on music roughly 40 hours a week, all the while going to school full time and also working part time at the Greenvale Pharmacy.
“I have my set up at my house and working on music is always readily accessible whenever I want to use it. It is something that I enjoy so much that whenever I get a second — even if it’s for 10 minutes, I’ll hop on and mix a couple songs,” he said.
“It could be in the morning before school, during common hour, after work when I get off work after 9 p.m.; any free time I have, I’ll use,” he added.
“Not that well,” Butera said jokingly after being asked how he balances school and his music aspirations. “I think the most important thing is to always keep your priorities in order and always be ahead of yourself. Try to plan ahead, think ahead, and think about the next day. I have class at this time and work at that time. I always bring my laptop and head phones everywhere, so I can always access my music.”
Butera, claims he will always have music in his life, whether it’s through having his own studio, seeing thousands of fans dancing to his music as he gazes out at a festival venue, or doing engineer work for productions and recording. He is always thinking of ways he can incorporate his Business major into music. Labels and music brands are never out of the option.

The easy access to mobile Internet connections has literally put our online life in our pocket. More and more people use social media on a daily basis. Though it’s a common part of our lives, is social media a good thing, or a dangerous thing?
There are many benefits of social media. There is a constant flow of information. Social media has transformed us into people who are quickly informed on everything. We know about news from all corners of the world in a matter of minutes. Social media is making the world smaller, and creating what communication theorists refer to as a ‘global village.’ That is wonderful.
Social aspects are also beneficial. Social media is the best way to keep track of and keep in touch with family, friends and acquaintances. The effectiveness of having everyone you know gathered at the same place makes it easy to know what’s going on without too much inquiry.
There is also professional potential, which is closely related to the social aspect. The key word here is connection. Many people who use social media, including possible employers, are just a scroll away. A good way to use social media is to follow these people of interest while putting out meaningful and relevant posts on your own sites. You could include interesting things you’ve read or a viewpoint you have, rather than posting what you had for dinner last night. Keep it interesting and relevant.
If your posts are interesting and relevant to what you want to do, and you follow people who have the same interests as you, then potential employers might look at you while they’re hiring.
Despite these benefits, there are also negative sides of social media. When using social media, make sure that you think about what you write before posting it. The first danger of social media is that it can really hurt you. What you post on the Internet is rarely private. Almost anyone can see what you post. The thing that you are laughing about today can be the thing that keeps you from a job in the future.
Lack of privacy can be a downside to social media sites. Everyone is entitled to privacy, but you as an individual also have an obligation to yourself to make sure that your privacy is protected. When you sign up for a service on the Internet, do you really know what that company does with your private information? Not many people know because reading the Terms and Agreement section is cumbersome to read. When you press, “I agree,” you are signing a binding contract. It is something to think about.
Have you ever noticed that the advertisements on the sides of your Facebook page are related to your life in the weirdest ways? It’s like Facebook, or whatever the service you are using, knows you. This is actually true. Social media tracks your movements so that they can match ads to you. Convenient or creepy?
The amount of personal information that we have shared on social media is endless. Social media is a great thing, and it’s only going to grow and become an even bigger part of our lives. However, as college students, be aware of the lasting effects, and make conscious decisions about what you share, all the while continuing to enjoy the benefits of these sites.

As I was writing my thesis, I stopped and took a deep breath. I realized that I am now entering a new chapter of my life. I have no idea where this next one will lead me, but I am pretty sure it’s going to be just as amazing as this last one. I know for sure that it doesn’t matter where I go next; I know that it’s all about the people and the environment I will create for myself.
For a long time, I regretted coming to the United States. I didn’t feel like New York was for me, or that I fitted in. People kept asking me questions about my career, who I wanted to be or what I wanted to achieve. These people stressed me out, and I felt misplaced. I’ve always wanted to be a person who just “goes with it.” Lately, I have to admit that I am very grateful for the last two-and-a-half years. Never have I experienced so much, learned so much about myself, and found friends that will definitely last a lifetime.
Many Americans have asked me why I would ever choose to come to America to study when education in Norway is free. The answer is that no amount of money could make up for the experiences and values you get from studying abroad.
Even though I have another semester left after this, it feels like it is ending now. Most of the friends I made when I first arrived at LIU Post are leaving, and it will definitely not be the same without them.
Sometimes I forget how incredibly lucky I am to be studying here, all the while still being able to afford an extra beer or two. So cheers, and thanks to all who made this chapter come true for me!

The entertainment world consists of musicians, artists, and filmmakers that are considered good, or even great, but who fall into the spotlight for varied reasons. Sometimes, a particular form or group of entertainers can be underrated, and have a lack of exposure to potential fans and consumers. Being underrated can be beneficial to a career, with some entertainers enjoying a consistent underground fan-base, but most of the time a lack of attention hurts. LIU Post students are able to name at least one artist, movie, or TV show that they feel is underrated.
Cynthia Theodore, a sophomore Psychology major, believes that R&B singer Melanie Fiona, and the movie “My Sister’s Keeper,” are underrated. “As far as movies go, I believe ‘My Sister’s Keeper’ is very underrated,” Theodore said. “Not many people know about the movie, but it teaches you the importance of family, and to live your life to the fullest.” For music, Theodore said that Fiona sends out powerful messages in her songs, but she doesn’t get the recognition she deserves.
Mahleik Mccargo, a junior Criminal Justice major, was very passionate when expressing his opinion on the most underrated movie. “‘Note To Self’ was a great movie,” McCargo said. “This movie should have gone mainstream; the message that was delivered was so powerful that it helped me with my life battle.”
There are many shows on television, especially reality shows, which get more recognition than others that are considered good on an artistic level. One show that many may agree on that doesn’t get enough publicity is “Sons of Anarchy,” a show that explores biker culture. “Yeah ‘Sons’ is a great show, and definitely deserves more attention than it gets,” said Nick Butera, a sophomore Business major.
For many reasons, such as appearance, crowds, or maybe even bad agents, some good musical artists are not recognized even though they make quality music. Christina Charles, a freshman Instrumental Performance major, believes that pop artist Tori Kelly is underrated. “Tori Kelly is an amazing songwriter with several albums.
Unfortunately, the way she is treated causes her to be underrated,” Charles said. “When she was a contestant for ‘American Idol,’ she received great feedback from majority of the judges, but could not continue because Simon Cowell thought she was not eligible. After that, she has made albums, but they have not been so popular.”
It’s extremely hard to make it to the mainstream in the entertainment business. The amount of competition is appalling, with many talented entertainers slipping under the radar. In any field you look into, there is always someone or something that is underrated, or considered an underdog. Can we fix that? No. However, we can help by promoting or at least continuing to support our favorites — despite popularity.

“House of Lies,” a Showtime TV series that entered its third season on Jan. 12, is a comedy-drama about a management consultant from a top tier firm. Starring Academy Award nominees Don Cheadle (“Crash”) and Kristen Bell (“Veronica Mars”), the show quickly has you hooked. Cheadle, portraying the lead character Marty Kaan, is a self-loathing management consultant who brings home a seven-figure paycheck, but struggles to be happy in his home life, as he deals with a divorce from his drug addicted wife, and attempts to raise his son. The show, which released its season three soundtrack on March 3, features jazzy songs by many artists.
The album is highlighted by slow-tempo jazz songs, which are relaxing to listen to. Its 12 tracks are a compilation from artists such as Gary Clark Jr., Aloe Blacc, and Count Basie. “Brains Out” by Kim Cesarion stands out for its pop-techno vibe. Other songs include “This Love is Here to Stay” by Norwegian singer/songwriter Thomas Dybdahl, and “Clean the House,” by Reggae and Soul group Fat Freddy’s Drop. These songs are slow, but definitely worth a listen.
Each track on the album is very distinct, especially vocally, but fit together very well as a collection. Two-time Grammy-nominee Chris Douridas worked with Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein to put together the album. The songs were selected from the show’s three current seasons. “House of Lies” will have its final episode of the third season on April 6. The soundtrack can be purchased on iTunes.

As the top-ranked Pioneers traveled their way back up the East coast, they stopped in Philadelphia, P.A., where they beat up on Holy Family with a 22-2 victory on Saturday, March 15. After a 1-1 tie 10 min- utes in, the Pioneers went on a 13-1 run to take a commanding 14-2 lead at halftime. Senior attacker Morgan Chiarenzza led the burst tallying (2 G, 2 A).
In the second half, the Pioneers (6-0) shut out the Tigers (0-3) by an 8-0 run to close out the game. Senior attacker Jackie Sileo tied
her career-high, scoring 13 points, leading the charge for the green and gold. Freshman attacker Stefani Vagelatos, red-shirt sophomore at- tacker Alexis Newman, and senior attacker/midfielder Samantha Losco all scored three points. Sophmore defender/midfielder Kaitlin Gaghan also got a piece off the action, tallying up two goals. Junior defender Kali Maxwell forced two turnovers and won an astonishing nine draw con- trols. Senior goalkeeper Katie Hannan made five saves in the pen. The Pioneers played lights-out on both sides of the field, leading to such a dominant showing.
Senior attacker Jackie Sileo mentioned that the team is trying to challenge themselves to do better than the day before. Sileo factored in that her teammates have great timing and do a great job of getting open and cutting full speed to the net, which supplements her great vision be hind the cage. As the Pioneers look to keep their momentum going, they continue to focus on their goal of winning another national champion ship by taking it game-by-game, winning, and moving on. “What hurts more; the pain of hard work or pain of regret?” Sileo said.
Led by Head Coach Meghan McNamara, the Pioneers would return home for an ECC battle with Mercy on Wednesday March 19, at Hickox Field, in Brookville.
The Pioneers struck early and often against Mercy, as seniors Sileo and Rotan teamed up for the first two goals of the game within
the first 2:47. Sileo ended up having (1 G, 4 A) by the 7:10 mark, as the Pioneers blew out Mercy 23-1. Attacker Losco locked up the game-high with 10 points (5 G, 5 A), and fellow attacker Sileo racked up eight points on the day with (3 G, 5 A). Freshman attacker Vagelatos chipped in with five points (3 G, 2 A). Senior Rotan and freshman Cara Douglas were both forces on the field, each recording a hat-trick.
The scoring just kept pouring in for the Pioneers (7-0), as they scored 13 unanswered tallies to shut out the Mavericks (2-5) in the second half. Pioneers senior goalie Katie Hannan picked up four saves between the pipes. Freshman net keepers Shianne Judson and Jillian Rocco combined on nine saves for Mercy. The Pioneers decimated the Mavericks in shots (37-9) and ground balls (25-9), while holding an advantage in draws (16-10) and converting on (7-12) clears.

Only two months into their already successful season, women’s softball Head Coach Jamie Apicella became a member of the 600 wins club, as the team swept Le Moyne College from Syracuse, N.Y., on Thursday, March 20, at the LIU Post Softball Complex.
The Pioneers defeated the Dolphins in two games, with scores of 5-4 and 7-0. Although the Pioneers were challenged by their opposition in the first game, the second game was a completely different story.
Freshman hurler Ashley Martin stood out among the Pioneers. The freshman recorded nine strikeouts, and let up just three hits over seven innings of work for the shutout, while her teammates knocked three home runs. Junior catcher Aly Dzierzynski swatted a three-run home run, scoring sophomore catcher Paige Swantek and senior shortstop Nicole Hagenah, in the second inning, and a two-run home run plating Swantek in the fourth. Swantek then joined in and smacked her second of the day in the sixth inning after a lead-off double by Hagenah to put the game out of reach, finalizing the score at 7-0.
This result confirmed Apicella’s 600th win in his 16-year tenure. Assistant Coach Carla Campagna mentioned that despite Apicella’s achievement, the team still has business to take care of. “The goals for this year are like every year, to win the conference championship first, enter the NCAA’s for their 15th straight year, and have the opportunity to play for a national championship.” The team has returned all of their players from last season, and has an additional four freshman. The women and coaches look forward to what the season holds.
The Pioneers prepare to next take on the Molloy College Lions on Saturday, March 30, at 3 p.m., in Rockville Center, N.Y.

The LIU Post Pioneers Baseball team snapped a three-game losing streak with a pair of wins over Stonehill College on Sunday, March 24.
In the first game of a double header, the Pioneers won a 14-inning affair 2-1 and followed it up with a 4-2 victory. LIU Post had dropped games to Adelphi and Bentley University leading up to Sunday.
In the first game against Stonehill, the Pioneers fell behind in the third inning. Stonehill’s Brian Campbell was on third base when Christian Baglini hit a sacrifice fly out to centerfield, allowing Campbell to score. The score remained in favor of Stonehill until the bottom of the ninth when LIU Post tied the game.
Freshman third baseman Brian Tinney reached base on an error and the Pioneers had senior Connor McCarthy come into the game as a pinch runner. McCarthy made it to second base off a wild pitch and a ground out advanced him to third. A passed ball allowed McCarthy to make it to the plate and tie the game at one.
Junior shortstop Rick Alessi won the game for the Pioneers in the bottom of the 14th. Alessi’s single to third base allowed sophomore outfielder John Bellock to score the game-winning run.
Freshman pitcher Dan Jaqiello earned the win throwing five innings and struck out six batters, while allowing no runs or hits. Starter Joey Arena threw nine innings and struck out nine. He also gave up three hits and one run.
In the second matchup of the day it was the Pioneers who jumped to the lead early on.
Stonehill made a comeback attempt in the top of the fourth inning, tying the game at two, but the Pioneers jumped back into the lead in the bottom half of the inning.
Senior third baseman Tom Tolan hit an RBI single to make it 3-2 Pioneers. Tolan drove an insurance run home in the bottom of the sixth to make it 4-2. Junior Pitcher Mike Eckerle earned his third win of the season. He pitched seven innings and struck out 10 batters. Eckerle also allowed four hits and two runs.
Earlier in the week the Pioneers had dropped three straight games starting with Tuesday’s game against Adelphi, which they lost 4-0. LIU Post then fell to Bentley on back to back days; Losing 3-2 to them on Friday and then being shutout for the second time in a week 5-0 on Saturday.
The Pioneers are now 6-5 this season and return to action on Wednesday when they travel to Felecian College.

After a 5-5 tie at half time, the no. 5 men’s Lacrosse team were defeated by Molloy college in a tight 8-7 clash on Saturday, March 22, at the Dean Skelos Sports Complex in Rockville Center, N.Y.
The Molloy Lions came out strongly for the game, by jumping up to a 4-0 lead early on in the first quarter. But junior attacker Joe Costello scored two quick tallies before the first break. Costello continued to produce for his Post team, and finished scoring three goals and assisting
to one. Starting off the second quarter in the same pace, the Lions managed to extend their lead with another goal, making the scoreboard blinking 5-2 in the host’s favor. The Pioneers then woke up, and found the net three times in a row, which resulted in an even score (5-5) at the intermission.
Once again, the Lions took control of the game by scoring three quick tallies. Thereafter, the Lions held Post off the board for the first 27 minutes, to keep track of the three-goal-margin lead. Finally, though, the Pioneers rallied late, and netted twice to make the last minutes of the game intense. Two sophomores, Matty Beccaris and Ryan Slane, stood for the performances, as they both unassisted found the net in the important last minutes of the game.
However, the Green Machine was not able to hit the net again, and Molloy walked away with their first victory against Post since 2004. This also meant the Pioneers’ first ECC defeat in 2014, with an overall record of 4-2 (3-1 in Conference sheet).
Head Coach John Jez and his Lacrosse squad will be on the road against Chestnut Hill in Philadelphia for an East Coast Conference battle on Saturday, March 29. The game is scheduled for a 4 p.m. kickoff.

Although the Lady Pioneers’ basketball season ended with their 83-62 loss to the Falcons of Bentley University on Monday, March 17, the season they had was one to remember and one of the best that LIU Post has ever seen.
The Pioneers outscored their opponents by over eight points a game, which explains their tremendous 24-7 record. Their scoring prowess translated to their shooting percentages from the field and behind the arc as well, outshooting their opponents on average in both categories. In addition to their shooting percentages, they also averaged more assists a game and outrebounded their opponents.
 
Their best assisting game came against Mercy College when they accumulated 15 more assists, showing their ability to play solid team basketball. Their best game on the boards came against Bridgeport in early January, as they outrebounded their opponents by 30, showing their toughness and determination to extend their own possessions, as well as end possessions on the other side of the court.
The Pioneers’ longest winning streak of the season was 10 games, but they also went on a roll winning 17 out of 18 at one point, outscoring their opponents on average by double digits during that span. For the season, the Pioneers were led by their leading scorer, junior forward Chelsea Williams. Williams averaged 20 points, six rebounds, two assists, and shot over 40 percent from the field. She also shot over 200 free throws, getting the other team in foul trouble and getting easy points at the charity stripe.
Senior guards Alexis Peters and Kiki Sears averaged 14 and 13 points respectively. In addition to her scoring, Peters also averaged six boards and five assists a game. Senior forward Shayna Gatling averaged 11 points a game and shot 58 percent from the field, which led the ECC.
The Pioneers tallied their most wins since the 1982-83 season when they went 25-8. This season yielded the most wins under Coach Deirdre Moore, who has the team moving in the right direction. Moore and her squad were able to win two games in the tournament, a step in the right direction from the season prior. Coach Moore has led the Lady Pioneers to the tournament in mid-March for four consecutive seasons now, and her efforts were recognized this season when she won the ECC Coach
of the Year Award. The awards and honors were bestowed before the ECC conference championship slew of games.
In addition to Coach Moore’s award and the great season the Pioneers had as a team, the green and gold also had several players stand out in the ECC. Williams was named the 2014 ECC Women’s Basketball Player of Year and also named to the All-ECC First Team. Peters and Sears were named to the All-ECC Second Team.
Seniors from this year’s roster include Peters, Sears, Gatling, forwards Dominique Pagan, Jessica Little, and center Nijah LaCourt.
