B.A.S.I.C (Brothers and Sisters in Christ) held their Love Seminar 2011 in the Pioneer Room in Hillwood on Friday, February 25th Love Seminar 2011 was about relationships and marriage based on Christian principles.  It taught ways young people can approach temptation in college and the real world.  The goal of B.A.S.I.C is to model God’s love as shown through his words.
Not many students think about the idea of saving sex for marriage, resisting temptations, and knowing the limitations with your partner. A married couple, Bob and Carol, guest speakers of the Love Seminar program said, “It was just a way of knowing.”  Bob explained when they were dating they would instantly know their limitations if hugging and kissing went too far.  Carol and Bob met through a Christian fellowship program.  So far, they have been married for 19 years and have three girls of ages seven, 10, and 12. The program went over the importance of recognizing flags within dating, and marriage. “It is important to pick up these red flags early and be aware of them,” said Carol. “Don’t waste your time with someone who you’re emotionally involved and can’t get away from.”
Another guest speaker, Pastor Chris Pandolfi, mentioned, “If he loves you, love waits!”  He says that it is important to build a friendship before having a relationship and to get to know the person well before getting emotionally involved with them.  His sermon was about placing God first besides anything else.  Living by God’s words and wanting to live by how God wants us to live.  He told the group that after he had been saved and knew more about God’s word through the Bible, he changed and met the right one for him.  Pastor Pandolfi said, “Being with a believer is more likely to treat other the right way.” Kimberly Weaver, graduate student and president of B.A.S.I.C, says, “We promote fellowship and raise awareness in general, [although] we might sometimes receive controversy.”
The mission of the B.A.S.I.C is to educate students about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and provide a spiritual and supportive environment for all students. They hold different events every year such as Battle Cry, Campus Day of Prayer, and Thirty Hour Famine. B.A.S.I.C meets every Monday at 5:30pm in the chapel.  The program is non-denominational, so it welcomes everyone to join and spread God’s word.

Manners in the classroom are becoming scarce; that’s why when our new Features Editor asked to cover a story on it, I immediately agreed.  Attention students: our generation is currently drowning in technology obsession.  If this were a magazine, that would make the front page.  When I see students walking on campus Smartphone in hand, head down, thumbs moving a mile a minute, I can’t help but think of that commercial that’s been on recently advertising the new search engine Bing.  Everyone acts as a human search engine until we reach an information overload.  (I always laugh at the part when the guy spits out the guacamole.) It’s an exaggeration, but the overall message is true! We are making ourselves crazy at work, at school and at home.  My mom has a new rule now: NO Blackberry’s at the table during dinner.  I cannot deny that I am not one of these students either.  Anyone that knows me at all can say I am one of those anti-multi tasking texters – basically you cannot tell me something important while I’m texting or writing emails on my phone.  I will not hear you.  There’s an imaginary wall that blocks all receiving sound waves.  Yea, it’s annoying, I know.  But when that little red light flashes or when you feel a vibration, you have to look.  It’s an addiction.  Smartphones are the new cigarettes of our generation.  So you can imagine what our professors must think when our phones have to be inches away from us at all times.  It’s really sick if you think about it.  Sometimes I would love nothing more than to chuck my Blackberry like Anne Hathaway does in The Devil Wears Prada.  But I would never… let’s get real here.
Now it’s time for a Pioneer overload!  We are 28 pages thick this issue.  Great for you, not so great for our budget.  But oh well, we are meant to enrich you with information.  The news section is stocked with what we have missed the past two weeks: job fairs, art exhibits, parking on campus and how it’s been a crazy hassle.  Our front page story is on the potholes on and off campus – what is the school doing about it?  As for our opinions section, Kahlil’s relationship column is back to back this week on the latest issues.  On-campus parties? Are they popular this semester? Where are they? One reporter has the scoop!  Oscars obsessed? Our review editor has it covered in our Loomings section this week.  And as always our sports writers have the latest on what’s going on in athletics.
Thank you for picking up the Pioneer this week.  We always appreciate feedback, questions, concerns and what we can do to cater to the student body as much as we can.  If you are interested in joining our team, contact us anytime at cwpstpnr@gmail.com.  And look out for our NEW CONTEST! Mad you didn’t win that Ipad? We have something better if you play.

After reading this past week’s paper, my favorite article had to be the news piece, “What’s a Grab N Go?”  Being a commuter student and not having the option of eating at the Winnick, I really appreciate it that Hillwood has certain foods such as chicken fingers, burgers, chicken sandwiches and fries already made and stored in labeled containers. It is definitely a great improvement since last semester because students who want food from the grill don’t have to wait on a huge line. I think Post is going a good job trying to improve some of the negatives associated with Common Hour, and making getting lunch quick and easy is a step in the right direction.
Matt Murray- sophomore
My favorite article from this past week’s edition had to definitely be the features piece “Recycling on Campus.”  I agree that the campus is making more of a conscience effort to recycle and prevent unnecessary garbage, but I feel that other things should be done.  More recyclable bins should absolutely be placed around campus to give students more of an opportunity to recycle, but other things could include having more contests which focus on recycling. I remember last semester when there was a fun competition between clubs to collect the most wrappers, and the winner won prize. Little things like adding more contests, which are geared towards getting dorm students and clubs involved can help make recycling more fun.
Stephanie Leverone- sophomore
I really liked the article Brookville’s Microwave Madness. Partly
because of the catchy headline but also because it was written from a
student’s perspective and was not too “nice” towards the school. I
like that the Pioneer tell me what’s really going on at Post and not
what the school wants us to know and think. Overall, the Pioneer is a
great school news paper and it just keeps getting better and better!
Ulrika Berg, junior
As a C.W Post Freshman reading the Pioneer has helped me in different
ways. Such as informing me of events coming up on campus or important
information that can help me on campus. I like that it gives us
information on the sports teams and how our school is doing in the
athletics department,but one thing I might like to see different is
more on the arts of the school such as Dance, Thearte and Film and the
Visual Arts. One article i enjoyed was the article of ways to beat the
Freshman 15 being an incoming freshman, it helped put things into
prespective to me. All in all reading the Pioneer is not only
educational but enjoyable.
-Alyssa Harington, Freshmen

The C.W. Post baseball team dropped all four games in their first action of the season in Morehead, North Carolina two weeks ago, opening their 2011 season with a 0-4 record.
The Pioneers, who were selected 3rd in the East Coast Conference Preseason Poll, had a tough schedule, driving fourteen hours on Thursday night, February 17th, to arrive in Morehead in the morning on Friday, February 18th. After practicing that same day, the Pioneers’ first game, a double header was at 2:30 p.m. against Felician College, followed by their second game at 6 p.m., against Southern Connecticut. The Pioneers dropped their opening game to Felician, losing by a score of 5-2. Post was held quiet offensively, failing to get base runners into scoring position to create runs. The Pioneers’ second game against the second-ranked team in the region, Southern Connecticut, was a much better game from a pitching standpoint, as junior Glen Hudson held the Owls to one run on three hits. The Pioneers were tied with the Owls the whole game until the bottom of the fourth inning, when the Pioneers collapsed defensively, making three errors in the inning.  The Pioneer offense could not overcome the deficit and lost by a final score of 4-1.
The second day of games proved to be an improvement, offensively, for the Pioneers, but to no avail. They dropped the opening game of the day to Felician by a score of 12-6. The team was able to muster some offense and get on the board early, but the defense collapsed again late in the game. Starting pitcher Rafael Martinez had a strong outing, pitching five solid innings and holding the Golden Falcons to four hits while giving up only one earned run and striking out five batters. The nightcap would prove to be much more interesting as the Pioneers were down 4-1 going into the eighth inning. The Pioneers tied up the game, beginning with freshman Phil Loprete’s solo home run to set the tone for the Pioneer offense, followed by crucial two out hits to extend the inning. The Pioneers managed to hold the Southern Connecticut Owls hitless in the bottom of the ninth inning to take the game into extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth, the Owls loaded the bases. After freshman pitcher John Susino exited the game after one and a third scoreless innings, freshman Conner McCarthy came in to try and shut down the Owl’s offense. McCarthy got the first out with the bases remaining loaded. The next batter hit a chopper up the middle on the first pitch and, although McCarthy knocked it down, the play could not be made to throw out the runner. The Owls went on to win the game 5-4 in the tenth inning.
The Pioneers left North Carolina without any wins, but have much to look forward to in the coming weeks because of each game’s improvement in North Carolina. The Pioneers are scheduled to play three double headers next weekend.  Friday’s double header will be against Southern New Hampshire, and both Saturday and Sunday’s double headers are against nationally-ranked Franklin Pierce. The games will be held at home and take place at 12p.m. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Being a man, I know that there’s no shortage of people who have been scorned, be it men or women. Women seem to voice their pains with past situations more than men do. Maybe, they’re a bit more discouraged since they’ve been going through so many of the wrong guys.  While both sexes have experienced some of the same treatments, I’m inclined to think women experience more of the negative than the positive overall. More times than not, there is a situation that reverts back to the issue of deception. Women are deceived by these men who “wooed” them, and now, they’re left thinking, “How did I fall for that?” Usually the signs are all there, you may just be too proud to address them.
Many of our relationships are recycled, especially during these college years. You may have had a great relationship that maybe grew apart, but you ended amicably and left possibilities for the future. Then you have the relationship where someone really gets hurt, and it’s usually because someone put a world of faith in somebody, and that person let him or her down with his or her actions. The latter scenario can still be salvaged, I’m sure, but I’m also sure that doesn’t happen too often.
My question this week really is: What allows women to fall for that “wrong guy?” Men seem to try to avoid the feelings of deception and pain by simply not committing, and that surely helps, but as I’ve said in past articles, women don’t have the luxury of sharing that same opportunity without fear of being seen in a negative light.
“I always say fool me once, shame on you, and fool me twice, shame on me. After the first few times, and I was shaming myself, and I had to start putting my foot down and confronting my issues with guys head on. I handled my business like a ‘woman,’” said Senior Gracetelle Joseph.
When you are a good woman, the truth always comes to light. Most women will love a man blindly, and love should never be the excuse for why you want to stay with a man or accept any type of bullsh*t that he’s going to offer you.
Freshman Jeanine Jones weighed in on the issue of women staying with men they can immediately tell aren’t good for them.  “I think a lot of women always have it in their head[s] that they can change a person and hopefully make them into the man they want them to be,” she began, “but in reality, you can’t make people be who you want them to be; they are who they are, and you guys just weren’t meant for each other.” She went on to say, “Then, you have the females with low self-esteem, who are led to believe that they can’t get anyone else besides the person they’re with, and then you have those girls, who just love drama so they purposely put themselves in a relationship of the sort.”
“From birth, women are taught that they need and should want affection. Because of this, they are very willing to settle,” says sophomore David Johnson. He goes on to say that some women will allow themselves to be disrespected just so that they won’t be alone.
I would have to agree with almost all of the points made, but I think there might be one way you could avoid some of this headache from even happening. Making seemingly long term decisions on what really is a short term burst of emotion isn’t the smartest thing. As a guy, I’ve gotten caught up at times; these things happen. When you have situations in which you feel things are damn near perfect, there definitely is an area of vulnerability on your part. This feeling of vulnerability is telling you to pay closer attention to where things are going and how they are going.  This doesn’t mean things won’t work out, but what it does mean is that you need to pay better attention to who you’re dealing with and their tendencies before you just up and get with them. The philosopher Sophocles once said, “Quick decisions are unsafe decisions.” When put in the right context, I’d say he’s right. So, make safe decisions, and be more patient.

Are you wondering who might be performing at this year’s spring concert? Well, the Pioneer has got updates on what you can expect this year. Elon Daniel informed the Pioneer, about the upcoming spring concert, which will ultimately rely on several factors. She said that the person who will be coming to perform “depends on what the students [at Post] are looking for and the Association for Campus Programming’s budget.”
Although these factors may have an influence over who comes to perform, students play a large role in finalizing it. A survey was conducted in order to assess students’ specific preferences. Daniel said that the ACP used that information and that they have chosen the surprise artist but are now in the final stages of getting him/her. Daniel explained that even though all the details as to who will perform have been completed, the ACP must consider “whether the chosen artist is available and the amount of money we [ACP] have in the budget.”
You may be wondering why it has taken so long for the student body to be informed, and ACP feels that it’s because students need to be kept on their toes and coming back for more. The name of the artist will be released one to two weeks before the concert is scheduled to take place. In spite of pressing for clues as to who might be in the running, Daniel insisted that it’s best for us to wait and enjoy the surprise. She went on to say that the moment of silence will prevent giving students misleading insights that would “create anticipation for a concert that is not realistic.” The objective is not only to entertain but also to “make sure a well-rounded concert [that will make] people want to come out.” With last year’s success when Trey Songz came, the goal is to be new and different each year.
After asking several students who they would like to see perform this year, a variety of music genres emerged. For example, a student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he would like to see Dead Mouse or Linkin Park perform, whereas Melissa Nyman, a music major, said that she would like to see Lady Gaga perform. How cool would that be? I definitely agree with Nyman on that. I think Lady Gaga’s performance would leave you “Gaga, ooh, la, la.” Nyman also insisted that it would be cool to attend the spring concert if it was “someone you would not expect to come here.” After much digging, it looks like we’ll just have to wait until one to two weeks before the concert to see whom our Trey Songz predecessor will be.

The C.W. Post men’s basketball team had won five consecutive games before being handed tough back-to-back losses to the Queens College Knights and the Bridgeport Purple Knights last weekend. The absence of sophomore guard Jonathan Kohler to injury during the last three games has proven to have really hurt the Pioneers. With the loss of Kohler, the Pioneers have lost an average of 13 points and six rebounds per game.
On Wednesday, February 23rd, the Pioneers hosted the Queens Knights (19-7). On this night, two different streaks came to end. The Pioneers came into the game riding a five game winning streak, but the Knights played an outstanding game securing an 81-75 victory. Lans Lamonte led the way for the Knights with 26 points on 8-15 shooting, as well as seven rebounds. Khalil McDonald (19 points) and Edil Lacayo (13 points) were perimeter threats all-night long as the two made several three-pointers to give the Pioneers their first loss of the season at home. Prior to this game, the Pioneers were 10-0 at the Pratt Recreation Center.
The Pioneers had four players reach double figures in scoring, led by junior guard Stefan Bonneau with 20 points. Senior forward Aaron Hall had a solid game, putting up 17 points and grabbing a game-high nine rebounds. To complement Bonneau and Hall, sophomore guard Tobin Carberry had 15 points, and off the bench, freshman forward Vaughn Allen had 10 points to go along with 5 boards.
The Pioneers held a slim lead at the half, but the soft touch of the Knights shooters caused the Pioneers to give up their lead and eventually fall 81-75.
The Pioneers’ next game was nationally televised on the CBS College Sports Network against the rivaled Bridgeport Purple Knights (18-8). This game was also senior night, as Gilbert Montalvo, Aaron Hall, and James Mutlu were all recognized before the game started.
This game lived up to the hype as both teams swapped baskets for most of the first half. At halftime, the Purple Knights held a one-point lead over the Pioneers, 40-39. The second half continued the same way as the first half, as both sides traded buckets to make for an extremely exciting finish.
With just over one minute remaining in the game, the score was evened up at 65. However, Bridgeport’s Msoo Ikyaator hit a layup with 1:09 remaining to give the Purple Knights a two point advantage. Neither of the teams would score again, leaving the final score 67-65 in favor of Bridgeport. The Pioneers had a couple of opportunities late in the final few seconds of the game to tie and win off shots by Carberry and Bonneau, but their late chances failed.
Bonneau led the Pioneers in scoring with 23 points, and Allen added a double-double by scoring 15 points and snatching a game-high 12 rebounds. Seniors Aaron Hall and Gilbert Montalvo each played well. Hall had 13 points, while Montalvo spread the ball around with 11 assists. But these efforts were not enough as the Pioneers ended the regular season on a two game losing streak, both losses in front of their home crowd.
The Pioneers finished the regular season with a 19-9 record and will now look forward to the East Coast Conference Championships, beginning March 5th.

The C.W. Post women’s basketball team powered their way into the ECC Tournament with victories in four of their last five games. In those games, the Pioneers seemed to finally all be on the same page after a relatively up and down regular season.
In the first round of the tournament, on Wednesday, March 2nd, the Pioneers will have to face the Queens College Knights, a team that matches up in favor of Post.  This season, the teams faced each other three times and C.W. Post won each time. In the first game, the Pioneers pounded Queens 82-46. In that game, four Pioneer players had double digit points while Post cut the Knight offense down, allowing them to only shoot 28.6 from the floor.
The next game had the Pioneers traveling to Queens. The game was evenly matched but Pioneer junior Felicia Joyner had a big game, totaling 25 points that proved to be the difference for Post, who walked away with the 76-67 win.
This past week, the Pioneers went for the sweep of Queens.  This time, however, it was Queens that appeared to be in charge for most of the first half, leading 24-22 at halftime, but it was a tale of two halves. In the second half, Post took over for the win. Nicole Marciniak had a double-double and hit a few key shots in the second half, and Janea Aiken added 24 points in the 59-53 victory.
A key for the lady Pioneers will be to stop Queens guard Amanda Bartlett, who has averaged over 20 points per game this year. If Post can keep the momentum that they had at the end of the season rolling, they should have no problem moving on to the ECC semifinals.

The C.W. Post women’s basketball team ended their regular season on a hot streak, winning four of their last five games.  On Wednesday, February 23rd, C.W. Post locked up a playoff berth in the ECC tournament with a 59-53 victory over Queens College. The Pioneers then wrapped up the end of the season with a 60-53 win over the University of Bridgeport on Saturday, February 26.
On Wednesday, the Pioneers found themselves in a close contest with the Queens Knights, who led by two points heading into halftime.  In the second half, neither team was able to pull away until the 7:40 mark, when the Lady Pioneers went on a 13-3 run that gave them a 10 point advantage over Queens. C.W. Post never looked back after that run, finalizing a 59-53 victory.  Janea Aiken lead the way for the Pioneers with 24 points, while Nicollette Marciniak had a double- double with 18 points and 15 rebounds.
On Saturday, February 26th, it was all about the seniors, each of whom was honored before the game. Among those honored were Aiken, Anthia Smith, Alyssa Lombardi and Shatima Greer. The Lady Pioneers and Bridgeport went toe to toe for much of the first half. Bridgeport held a 13-12 lead early, but the Pioneers worked to take the lead back with a 15-3 run that gave them a 28-15 advantage. Heading into the half, Bridgeport trailed C.W. Post by nine points. Bridgeport managed to cut Post’s lead to just two points in the second half, but sloppy play by the Purple Knights prevented them from ever taking the lead, giving the Pioneers a 60-53 victory to end the regular season.  Aiken and Felcia Joyner led the way for the ECC tournament-bound Pioneers with 18 and 16 points, respectively.
The ECC championship tournament begins on Wednesday, March 2nd, when the Lady Pioneers host Queens College at the Pratt Center for a 6PM tip off. Coverage on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org will begin at 5:30PM.

The C.W. Post men’s lacrosse team is off to a great start to their 2011 season.  The team continued their undefeated streak last weekend, defeating both Chestnut Hill University 13-7, on Saturday, February 26th, and American International College 18-2 on Sunday, February 27th.
The pair of wins brought the team’s overall record to a perfect 5-0, 2-0 in the East Coast Conference as the Pioneers have begun to prove why they deserve their ranking as the top team in Division II.  In their first five games, the team has defeated opponents by an average of 13 points, only once allowing their final score to be less than double that of their challenger.  Most recently, the Pioneers glided to an easy 18-2 victory over the Yellow Jackets of American International College at home, on Hickox Field, on Sunday, February 27th.
C.W. Post took an impressive lead early in the game, leading 8-0 at the end of the first quarter thanks to goals from seniors Nick Coric, Mike Messina, Tim Russo, Jimmy Johnston, and junior Eddie Plompen.  With the safe cushion of an eight-goal lead, the Pioneers continued their assault of AIC into the second quarter.  Post maintained its composure as goals from senior Vito Minerva, Owen Campbell, and Tom Giordano combined with additional goals from Messina and Plompen to boost the Pioneers’ lead to 13-0 going into the half
The Yellow Jackets scored their only two goals of the game in the fourth quarter, but their efforts proved futile as the Pioneers were able to score five more by the end of the game, finalizing the score at 18-2.  Plompen, who walked away from the contest with a team-high four goals, and sophomore Justin Patterson, who notched five assists on the day, led the reigning national champions, who outshot their opponents 46-22.
The Pioneers will look to continue their perfect run when they hit the road this weekend, travelling to Greensburg, Pennsylvania to face fellow ECC member Seton Hill University (1-1) on Saturday, March 5th.

What are the perks of living the ‘college life’ without the social aspect? Not much! Of course, as college students, we jump at any opportunity to have a good time, as long as it fits into our budgets. Generally, the student body is very excited when there is a party being thrown on campus. Everything is done right to make sure people on and off campus look forward to the party. The theme is chosen, flyers are put up weeks in advance, the best DJ is booked, and the word is put out on Facebook and Twitter. Party seekers from campus as well as other schools come dressed in their best attires just to wait on line for a while, hoping to buy a ticket for the night’s main event before it reaches the maximum capacity. According to Wendell John, a junior political science major, “The parties are always good when I come here, even though I have to wait more than an hour on the line. I transferred out of Post, and I still come back because it is worth it.”
So what’s happening this semester in terms of the C.W. Post campus party spirit (and no, we don’t mean having ‘a gathering in your dorm room’ kind of party; we mean the ones you won’t get in trouble for)? Parties are thrown on campus to boost and maintain campus morale. Since January, when the spring 2011 semester began, the campus “welcome back” party thrown by ACP, with a “geeked out” theme, was the only party on campus party to date. However, the party was cancelled because only three people showed up. “I could not believe that no one showed up to the party, especially since I was one of the few people there! We received a refund of our money, so that was alright, I guess,” said senior business major, Chantelle James.
The welcome back party was so low in attendance because of what we would call “bad timing.” In the time period that the party date fell on, there was also a huge snowstorm, as well as the virus outbreak on campus. Apparently, people just weren’t in the partying mood.  Another reason why the welcome back party may have had been low in attendance could be the fact that this party did not allow for off campus guests. A lot of students love to bring their friends to Post, and, for this party, it was not allowed.
A student, who wanted to keep his identity confidential, stated, “I feel that a Post-student-only party is a very bad idea. This campus is already known as a ‘suitcase school,’ so most people go home if there is nothing to do on campus. So, why would anyone pay money to see the same people they could see on campus any other day, or for free, in someone’s dorm party? It just seems like a waste of a club’s money to have a party like this, especially if it is only going to be held in the Winnick!”
Even though that party was cancelled, there are a few more to look forward to before the end of the semester. Greek life will hold the Greek Week “Toga Party” in March, and the Black Students United will hold the annual “Pajama Jammy Jam” on April 16, 2011, during Spring Fling Week. These are parties that have always been known to sell out and are rumored to be worth your buck, so look out for flyers around campus for additional information about these events.

Do you remember growing up and being told to raise your hand in class and not speak while someone else was? These rules are what we grew up with and were the only thing we knew or thought was correct. While these rules are still enforced today, other ones have been added to the guidebook of do’s and don’ts list while technology remains a necessity inside the classroom and out.
Starting from middle school your teachers gave you a piece of paper at the beginning of the year, otherwise known as a syllabus. While it had a course description of what you would be learning each week and of classroom expectations, it also had a list of rules and regulations you were expected to follow. Some were no gum chewing, no food or drinks allowed, use polite words, no hats allowed, and don’t leave class without the bathroom pass.
Now, as college students, the rules may have changed. Teachers are now known as “professors” and looked up to as peers or people who you can use for networking. College students should be well aware of what is expected in class , but lately have become daringly ambitious.
Lets face it: most college students have cell phones. We’re walking to class and BBMing with our Blackberrys, checking our Twitters to see what your favorite celeb is doing today, and/or constantly updating our Facebook statuses.  And the thought of your phone in your bag and not on your desk two inches away from you can give you anxiety of missing an important phone call or text.
This all forces us to wonder: have our social lives subtracted our priorities and manners in the classroom? If you look carefully and observe, you will come to find almost every college student has his or her phone, computer, or iPad with him or her in class. Students are so focused on these pieces of technology that they forget they are paying thousands of dollars to get an enriched college education.
Professor Lichten teaches Honors Sociology and tells his students to shut their cell phones off in class and not to text. Lichten said, “When in class, students should focus on our work together. Cell phones divert the student’s attention from our difficult lectures, complex ideas, and new theoretical perspectives discussed in class. The phones limit the students’ attention to the material, limiting their potential participation in discussion.”
While some students see this as manners, due to the fact that it’s important to obey and respect those who are in a higher position than us, others see this as a rule that must be followed in order to pass the class and get a good grade. Lichten added, “In the past, I have witnessed students inappropriately chuckling while looking at their phones at the same time as I was discussing genocide, war, or racism.”
While a professor may not tell students that they are not allowed to bring their computers and cell phones to class, they are well aware of what is behind that screen. There are some students who strive their best and take notes properly, while others play around with Facebook and instant messaging. Then comes the issue of the iPads. Free iPads to freshman and transfer students and iPads that are half the price to all other students seemed like a decent bargain. Some students now view the school as responsible for causing a distraction in the classroom by supplying the iPads.
Chelsea Serra, a sophomore environmental science major, feels that the iPads are more of a distraction because the professors do not use them to teach. Serra said, “I don’t think the iPad does any good, and I don’t use it in the class. My professors don’t like it either.” Serra feels classroom manners include showing up on time, not packing up early, not texting during class, staying awake, not talking in class, and respecting your professor.
The question to consider all depends on how you see it. Is this breaking rules or is it knowing better, which ties into good manners? It’s like Douglas MacArthur said, “Rules are mostly made to be broken and are too often for the lazy to hide behind.” Believe it or not, aside from all the craziness in a dorm building or in a classroom, rules are rules. Maybe breaking rules when you know you shouldn’t is fun in life. Then again, manners will always be a part of values. Values come with rules that are made to be followed, but in this case, apparently broken.

On February 23rd, students and faculty poured into the rounded room located above the Hillwood Information Desk for the grand opening of C.W. Post’s new TV Room. What was once a semi-circular room with bare white walls, a dirty brown floor, and little to show for itself, has transformed into a beautifully well lit creation by the Student Government Association.
Before the room became the TV Room, it wasn’t being utilize and seemed like a waste of space. Now it is equipped with a 60” Samsung plasma TV and surround sound connected to a laptop for DVD and video game use. “The room turned out better than I anticipated,” says SGA President Jared Chiborowski, who made opening remarks before the ribbon cutting ceremony. “In the future it will be utilized more and more as people start to realize it’s here”.
So where did the idea for this room come from? Commuter students have been looking for a place to hang out and have meetings, rather than fall sleep on those nice comfy couches Hillwood has provided for us. “The TV Room has been on the ‘project list’ for a while. I’m glad to see it completed!” Graduate Assistant Jackie Russo said, “It’s great to see a space for everyone to enjoy! Thanks to all who helped make it happen!”
The floor, the carpet, the chairs, and the windows that look over Hillwood Commons were hand-selected by the Student Government Association. “I think it’s great; it brings us to the 21st century and there are a multitude of activities that students can use,” Billy Achnitz added while commenting on the transformation of the room from its former state.
Provost Paul Forestell gave a speech before helping C.W. Post President Steinberg cut the ribbon off the TV to make the opening official. He stated that in the creation of the room, the students’ ideas were being implemented. “You guys made it happen,” he said. “Nothing happens over night.”
On the count of three, President Steinberg cut the ribbon, signifying that the new TV Room is now open to all students and faculty alike. When asked how he feels about the new space, Steinberg stated that this room illustrates student leadership and cooperation coming together to come up with a productive way to increase campus activity.
Now that you know there is a new TV Room, and it won’t come as a shock to you if you hear it from a friend, get out there and see it for yourself! It is open during Hillwood hours.

Throughout the week of February 21st an exhibit by Garam Lee, an MFA student in the Art Department, entitled “Alien’s Footprint (trace)?” was displayed in the Student Art League Gallery.
Garam Lee, whose art exhibit revolved around his unfamiliarity with the American language, is a Korean artist who will be earning his MFA in the spring of 2012. In reference to his limited command of English, Lee decided on a medium such as the human mouth and glue to utter concepts he could not express.  “[I] used [my] mouth to blow hot glue [into creating his works] because the mouth is precious and important,” said Lee. His various works of art, which included a life-sized sailboat, a pair of sneakers covered with hot glue and an oversize sweatshirt, among others, took him at least a week to three weeks to accomplish.
In sharing his experience in coming to the United States, Lee’s works appealed to a number of students. Caleb Kim, a digital photography and film photography major, found the art exhibit “interesting…I remember as a child I used to use glue guns to build houses.”
The opening night reception, on Wednesday, February 23rd in the Student Art league Gallery, began at 5 p.m. 12 people gathered to view the art works of Garam Lee. Many students took the time to ask Lee questions about what motivated him to take on such project.  “Since, I came to America, I feel like I’m alien [in] here,” said Lee. “Communication is so hard to me because I have language problem and I am from another culture.” Lee also said that his art exhibit represented his feeling into his artwork.  Jordain Lee, another MFA student in the Art Department, who helped Lee in creating the life-size sailboat said, “because he [Lee] studied abroad in Korea he wanted to find something to say with his mouth.” Lee’s art exhibit not only portrayed his emotions as a foreign student studying in the United States but his artwork also gave an insight on the limitless options a person has to communicate.

For most commuter students at C.W. Post, scouring the campus for an available parking space has become an all-too-familiar routine. However, this semester’s lack of spots near the main academic buildings on campus has left many students irritated over having to rearrange their mornings simply to find available parking on campus without having to trudge to class.
Cheryl Mosher, an education major said, “Time management is something every student struggles with, and having to account for 20 extra minutes each time we have a class, in order to find a parking spot, is just plain unfair.”
Mosher was not exaggerating; if students do not arrive early to class, they will be hard-pressed to find open spaces to park in the Tilles Center and Hillwood Commons parking lots. Adjacent to Kahn Discovery center and Humanities Hall, these lots house the most sought-after parking spaces on campus and are usually filled before 9:15 a.m. Failure to arrive early almost ensures that students will typically have to park further away, often in the parking lot near the Pratt Recreation Center. This is a far walk from the main academic buildings on campus, and it can feel even longer in the bitter winter weather.
Students generally put up with the bothersome facets to parking with few complaints, so they feel it is a slap in the face when they occasionally arrive on campus to find Public Safety has blocked off sections of the Tilles Center parking lot for vehicles carrying attendees to events, such as elementary school field trips. Students are not notified about this prior to driving onto campus, and it can certainly make their already stressful mornings even more distressing.
Tim Moshman, a junior marketing major, summed up the sentiments of most commuter students by saying, “If there is an event going on at the Tilles Center, they shouldn’t close off the lot to students. It should be on a first-come, first-served basis; we pay to park in those spots, not in Guam.”
Paul Rapess, the C.W. Post director of public safety said, “Occasionally the parking lot near the Tilles Center lot is closed to accommodate school buses carrying school children, who attend events at the concert hall or for a very special event such as a meeting for the Long Island University board of trustees. The Tilles Center for the Performing Arts is part of our community and extends a wonderful opportunity for children, high school and college students, as well as the general public, to experience world-class dance, theatre and music. Approximately twice a month, the lots are blocked to accommodate 10 to 30 school buses with school children attending a performance or event.”
Rapess further explained that the lots must accommodate busses because state law mandates that school busses must park as close to the destination as possible, and the school wants to ensure safety for the passengers coming to the campus.  “Tilles Center, in conjunction with the C.W. Post Conference Services department, is careful to select dates, such as Fridays, when there are fewer classes as to not interrupt parking patterns or parking space availability for C.W. Post students.” However, on the morning of Tuesday, February 15, 2011, sections of the Tilles Center lot was closed off to students.
The aforementioned quandaries raise the question as to how C.W. Post can resolve the parking problem and accommodate more commuter vehicles.  Angela Prudente-Gervais, a senior Accounting Major, suggested the University should “get rid of all that grass near the Tilles Center because it could be used for spots, and they should build up the Tilles Center lot to a parking garage with a bunch of levels.”
Gervais’ suggestion is not too far-fetched. Adelphi University, a nearby university to C.W. Post, installed an underground parking garage under its soccer field to accommodate more commuter vehicles. While it did not completely solve the University’s parking dilemma, it did alleviate the burden on some commuter students by giving them additional spaces to park. This may be a worthwhile consideration for C.W. Post; however, C.W. Post Administration could not be reached for comment.
Junior Nicole Mylonas, a marketing major, agrees with Gervais’ idea, and she also thinks that Public Safety should allow commuter students to park in the empty spaces in the Life Science (Pell Hall) faculty parking lot. “It never gets full, yet the student parking gets filled up right away.”
For now, until a solution is drawn up to solve the parking predicament, C.W. Post students have no choice but to continue to arrive early for class or face a long walk from their cars to their classes. One can only hope that fewer students than the current 6,400 commuter students, according to Public Safety, commute to class by car in future semesters, or that C.W. Post administrators work with students to find a parking solution that works for everyone. Until then, happy walking!

On Wednesday, February 16th, a variety of non-profit organizations and companies gathered on campus in search of future employees and interns at the Summer Internship and Job Fair.
Joan Harrison, a professor in the art department, spoke to the students about how our generation will have to think outside of the box to generate jobs for ourselves in today’s world. The summer job fair was an effort by the school to spark interest in student minds, and motivate them to pursue valuable employment opportunities.
“Employers in the job market today are looking for social media and computer skills,” said Christiane Leonardis, a representative from SPOHNC, Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer. “Life skills and job experience are crucial elements of a resume because they help you find your future. Even if you don’t have tons of experience, a little helps.”
Freshman Sophia Ventouris spoke about her experience at the job fair. “I loved the representatives from ESPIRIT. They were really chill and friendly,” said Ventouris. “They would be great to possibly get an internship with.”
Other students didn’t share Ventouris’s enthusiasm. “There weren’t enough jobs that offered students a promise of long-term employment with opportunities for advancement,” said a student who wished to remain anonymous. “It largely consisted of non-profit organizations looking for free or cheap labor and several companies looking for replaceable, low-level employees. As a math major, the job fair offered no job opportunities that would make use of my major. I was deeply disappointed.”
Without a clear economic recovery plan aimed at creating entry-level jobs many college graduates may find getting jobs and moving out of their parents’ houses difficult. Young workers have been among the hardest hit during the current recession – in which a total of 6.9 million jobs have been lost.

Have you ever sat down on a Wednesday night to write a paper due Thursday and had no clue where to start? As students, we know that waiting until the last minute to do an assignment is usually how most of us function. Thanks to the C.W. Post Writing Center, our questions will no longer go unanswered. This semester the Writing Center has created a service called After Hours, to help students with late night assignments.
The service is available Monday through Thursday from 8:00 to 10:00 pm. “This semester we’re really excited about the After Hours service,” said senior Stephanie Main, a tutor at the Writing Center. “It’s designed to help students with their writing or English-related needs at a time when most students are doing their homework either in the dorm or home.”
There will be at least two tutors available to help students with any questions they have. The tutors, which are full time students ranging from undergraduate to graduate, can be reached in many different ways such as in person, by phone, and even Skype. “We’ve been utilizing an e-mail system and Skype for those who physically can’t be at the Writing Center,” said Meryl Lumba, a tutor. “Students who don’t want a full 45 minute session to ask short questions would most likely benefit from the service. We would hope that students will utilize it.”
According to Lumba, After Hours was created to help cater to all the students who may have short questions. “Recently, during the day, it gets really busy and when students come in with simple questions, sometimes they might interrupt other sessions or not get helped right away,” said Lumba. “We decided it would be best to have some time set aside to help them in a more appropriate time and fashion.”
Some students are already praising the service. Senior Riley Cassidy says, “I think it is a great service that students should utilize. The service is really helpful.” Junior Dan Caccavale has had a different experience. “They only give you a certain amount of time,” said Caccavale. “If you still need them you have to reschedule, which makes it useless when you have a deadline. I don’t think the service will be beneficial.”
If you would like to check out the new After Hours service yourself, you can stop by Humanities 202, call 516-299-2732, send an e-mail to writing@cwpost.liu.edu, or check them out on Facebook, Twitter (@WritingCenterCW), or Skype (cwpwritingcenter).

According to CBS News, over 2,000 potholes have been reported this season in the town of Hempstead, compared to 127 last year.  For those of you who aren’t familiar with potholes, they are bumps or perforations in concrete, which are usually a direct result of ice on roads. Typically, when the temperature drops the ice or snow break down pavement to make it weak; and as more cars drive over the ice, the pothole forms by chunks of pavement leaving an area.   So how does the pothole situation look at C.W. Post?
Junior Kelli Fisher, a nutrition major says, “I think the school should pave it at some point, since most of Nassau County is taken over by them, especially the Long Island Expressway.”
“I find them annoying and dangerous, especially the way some people drive on campus,” Junior Emily Rawson, photography major who lives on campus said.  “I’ve heard a few people talk about how it’s hard driving in the rain because they don’t expect them, and then they’ll hit them. It really could destroy their car.”  Some people have spent over thousands of dollars to pay for new tires and to fix the rims of their cars all due to pothole related incidents.
Some students haven’t noticed any potholes or faced a problem by them. When Senior Christina Kay, broadcasting major, was asked whether or not she has encountered a pothole on campus, she said, “They haven’t caused a problem for me at all.” Apparently, neither does Public Safety, who has refused to comment on the pothole predicament on campus and whether or not students have reported them.
In the past month, towns have been filling and paving the potholes. Most likely, with the weather still cold, the potholes will still appear. Around campus, the potholes have stayed, so a warning for student drivers is to be careful when driving anywhere.

Over the past few weeks, I have been getting the same complaint from different guy friends of mine. Many of them have complained about either a current girl or a past girl having random outbursts of anger or irrational behavior. When I hear complaints, my first instincts are to try and help and get an idea of the scenario. This is increasingly difficult when the guy involved is just as lost as I am.
There was one day when my fellas and I were in the car, and one of my friends was explaining a scenario with his woman and how erratic she had been behaving. Before I could even utter a word, one of my other friends simply asked, “Is she on her period?” I laughed briefly, but I began to think if this was a legit question or not. By the next day my friend said,“yes she was on her period, and everything’s good now.” I was shocked; I began to think that maybe there was a correlation between a woman’s cycle and how it affected her emotions or decision-making. I wanted to get a better consensus on the issue and decided to ask a few ladies about their experiences; here’s what was said:
I asked Junior Schavon Greene about her feelings on the issue, and she said that this doesn’t affect her personally, saying, “My attitude never changed because of my period.” She went on to say that “Too many women use PMS as an excuse to be the bitch they really are.” A female senior, who has asked to remain anonymous, said that it definitely affected her. “I’m definitely easily angered because I’m in pain; I’m not irrational just more short-tempered,”she said. Junior Anny Jules said that she doesn’t get “bitchy,” but she does feel the effects of being way more emotional than usual.
What we have here is a variety of experiences that lead me to believe that there is much validity to the feeling that many women do act off of emotions more often around “that time of the month.” I often tried not to solely blame the sudden arguments or changes in attitude on Mother Nature, and I still don’t think you should totally, but obviously, for some women, it is a real factor. You can’t really change what seemingly comes so natural to a woman I would suppose. What I would say is that, to the ladies whom this does affect, you have to remain a little more cognizant about the people you are in contact with and the decisions you make.
If you’re a man, understand how certain things may affect your lady, and try to give a little more leeway around that time. I’m sure this is a prevalent situation for a lot of us, and I was actually surprised that some of the ladies I interviewed admitted to the changes in emotions or demeanor. My personal experiences saw women denying that their periods affected any other aspect of their life that was non-physical. This issue has had me thinking back and wondering if maybe big disagreements I’ve had with people had anything to do with that girl being on her period. Personally, I can’t really put a finger on it. One thing I can put a finger on is that I now know that this is something to look out for and so should you, fellas.
