The Brooklyn Nets have made it to the 2022 NBA playoffs. After a chaotic regular season filled with COVID-19, injuries and off the court drama, the Nets have wiped their slate clean, and now have a shot to compete for their first NBA Championship. 
After starting their season projected to be one of the top seeds in the Eastern Conference, they fell short of expectations, finishing the regular season as the #7 seed with a record of 44-38. 
On Tuesday, April 12, the Nets defeated the #8 seed Cleveland Cavaliers at home in the play-in round 115-108. This secured them a spot in the first round, where they currently take on the Boston Celtics in a best of seven series. 
The Nets did this with many of their top players missing time throughout the season. Former MVP Kevin Durant missed over a month and half with an MCL sprain. Star Kyrie Irving did not come back until the new year due to his vaccination status, and then was not allowed to play at home until the indoor vaccine mandate was lifted in New York at the end of March. Veteran Lamarcus Aldridge missed time with a hip injury as well. Lastly, 3-point specialist Joe Harris, the longest tenured player on the Nets, went down 14 games in with a season-ending ankle injury. The Nets also had to deal with a COVID-19 outbreak involving seven players during the middle of December. 
However, this did not stop Brooklyn from pushing through, as second year Nets Bruce Brown and Nick Claxton stepped up when the team needed them most. The Nets also called upon rookies Cam Thomas, Kessler Edwards and Day’ron Sharpe, who all played productive minutes throughout the season. While all of these players were big contributors, it was off-season pickup Patty Mills who shined the brightest, as he had one of the best seasons of his career. Mills played in 81 of the Nets 82 games, and averaged 11.3 points-per-game (PPG), while shooting 40% from behind the arc. 
Despite all this, it was the trade the Nets made on Feb. 10 that completely altered their season. After trading for 3-time scoring champion James Harden in early 2021, they would trade him away a little after one calendar year. Harden played well during his time in Brooklyn, but it ultimately didn’t work out for both sides, which led to the end of his tenure as a Net. 
In exchange for James Harden, the Nets received Andre Drummond, Seth Curry, and Ben Simmons from the Philadelphia 76ers. Simmons has yet to play a game due to a back injury. However, Drummond is a consistent player in the paint, and helps provide quality minutes at the center position. Curry has also played a pivotal role, and gives the Nets some options as they now rotate Irving, Mills and Curry in the guard spots, allowing one of them to rest while still having a great combo on the court. 
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher felt the intensity of everything that went on this season. 
“When I watched the regular season I can define the games to one phrase—‘Ramping up’, with the amount of injuries and Covid situations the season was stressful.”
Boettcher was initially surprised at the blockbuster trade involving James Harden, but is satisfied with the way it has worked out since. 
“I was at first disappointed because Harden didn’t even give the Nets a chance to get back to full strength. Harden was understandably frustrated, but Kyrie was going to be back soon and Durant was rehabbing,” he said. “Post trade it has been ok, as Bruce brown has broken out a bit and the Nets finally got another complementary shooter in Seth Curry.”
Boettcher was excited when he found out Kyrie Irving would be able to play again, feeling it was about time. 
“At first I understood the vaccine mandate and the reason why Irving was unable to play, but after the vaccination requirements were lifted to attend a game it was like pulling teeth to get Kyrie back,” he said. “Mayor Adams was trying to keep his good PR up and didn’t listen to the science.”
Boettcher is looking forward to cheering on his team, but feels there is a strong possibility of them being out matched whoever they play. 
“Right now I’m just happy they’re in the playoffs. The Celtics are a really good team and I’ll root for the Nets to win a championship, but I won’t be surprised if they lose in the first round,” he said. 
Boettcher feels there are many holes and weaknesses in the team on both sides of the ball. 
“The overall lack of detail and attention on the defensive end is disgusting,” he said. “Also the Nets don’t have enough motion in their offense, as Irving and Durant are being put in Isolation plays too often”.

New York Islanders’ legend Mike Bossy passed away on Thursday, April. 14, at the age of 65 due to a tough battle with lung cancer. While his career lasted just 10 years because of injuries, no player in NHL history has a better goals-per-game average than Bossy (0.76) and is one of only six players to score 50 goals in 50 games. 
Bossy has the most consecutive 50-goal seasons at nine, with his final season being the only one he didn’t score 50 goals. He is also tied with Wayne Gretzky for the most 60-goal seasons at five. Mike had 573 goals and 553 assists for 1,126 points in just 752 games, as well as 4 Stanley Cups from 1980-83. 
He was named to the NHL Hall of Fame in 1991, had his number 22 retired by the Islanders in 1992, and was named one of the 100 greatest NHL players in 2017. The hockey community will forever remember him for his skill, but also his charming personality.
Sophomore broadcasting major Brady Campbell recalls how for younger fans, it is hard to realize how good of a player Bossy truly was.
“As a younger fan, you hear so many stories from the people that experienced his time playing in the NHL, and they talk about just how good he was, and you almost don’t want to believe it. You wonder how someone can dominate the game like Bossy or Gretzky did until you actually see the highlights. You hear all the stories about his 50 goals in 50 games, winning the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff MVP) one year and how important of a piece he was to the four straight Stanley Cups that the Islanders won,” Campbell said. “Hearing that, you’re so surprised that someone can be this important to a franchise and a team, and you see how loved he is by the NHL as a whole, especially the Islanders’ fan base. He was a great person on and off the ice, a very likable guy and obviously an amazing player that the whole islanders’ franchise is so proud to have played for them.”
Chet Tempesta, an Islanders fan since the very first game in 1972, spoke on what it was like watching Mike Bossy live.
“He was completely different than most other players in his approach to the game,” Tempesta said. “He was a pure shooter, and you knew when he got the puck, and he’d take a shot that it almost always seemed to go in the net, not to the surprise of anybody. He was an unusual player, he knew how to shoot the puck and that skill was well-honed when he was a young man.”
Campbell explains how a player like Mike influenced the new generation of athletes.
“Players and prospects coming out of college, if they’re a really good goal scorer like Austin Matthews and Connor McDavid, they are immediately compared to Mike Bossy. Obviously, the game today is different than it was back then, but to put up the numbers he did is ridiculous,” Campbell said. “He inspired a lot of players today and a lot of people around the league to be the best they can be, and he was a part of one of the greatest teams in NHL history and became one of the most influential players ever. He was a great player who made the players and people around him look better.”
Tempesta mentioned how the skill of Bossy helped those around him and how players today, while talented, score goals in different ways than Bossy did.
“In his own way, he was a leader, and I think he really had to be a motivator for the young guys to score. He was probably one of the best to ever play the game skill-wise. With his scoring ability, he had the effect of a leader, and that made the other players around him better. At some point in time, you might see someone become like Bossy. There are a couple of guys in the league that have the potential to be excellent goal scorers,” Tempesta said. “You’ve got Matthews in Toronto who seems to stand out. There’s a couple kids on the Islanders who have potential, they aren’t pure goal scorers, but they’re hustlers. They play the dirty areas and come away with a goal, but it will be a long time before you see a guy like Bossy.”
Cambell debates whether anyone can match Bossy’s scoring ability.
“Considering that the game has changed a bit since he played, I want to say no. I obviously never got to watch him play, but you watch the highlights, and he was always around the net. He was a great finisher, and he could shoot the puck. Today you see players who are incredible around the net as well, but their styles of play are a little different. Maybe by the end of Austin Matthews’ career, we’re talking about him being one of the greatest goal scorers ever, but I think if you look at the statistics of goals-per-game, and even though Matthews is still young, what Bossy did in that department was absolutely ridiculous,” Campbell said. “Scoring 50+ goals in just about every season is unbelievable. Obviously, he had great teammates too, but I don’t think anyone will really put up the numbers he did. Bossy only played for 10 seasons, and if he didn’t have his career cut short, who knows what the numbers would be.”
Despite the Islanders missing the playoffs this year, Campbell thinks they will be back stronger next year.
“This was a tough year, starting with the road trip, which they did okay on, but to start with 13 games on the road is very hard. Then they got home and got destroyed by Covid. It’s hard to play with half your team being minor league players. You can always make excuses, but even when they were healthy, their play wasn’t particularly good, although there were plenty of bright spots. It is also very tough losing three legends in Clark Gillies, Jean Potvin and Mike Bossy, who were all a part of that dynasty team. This is probably one of the worst years for a franchise in professional sports history,” Campbell said. “I think they can bounce back. The Eastern Conference, especially the Metro (Metropolitan Division), is a tough division, but they are built for the playoffs. It’s just making it there. The last few seasons we’ve seen towards the end of the year, they have stumbled their way in, but once they get in, they are one of the teams to beat, being one goal away from the finals last year, which was heartbreaking. They need to get someone who has a bit more of a goal-scoring prowess, and then they’ll be a dangerous team again for years to come.”
Similar to Campbell, Tempesta thinks the Islanders can come back from this tough year.
“I absolutely think they can bounce back. I think the scheduling, covid, the cancellations and the fact that they started with 13 games on the road has an awful lot to do with this disastrous season,” Tempesta said. “Next year will be completely different. The possibilities for a (playoff) run are there, and the chances are excellent.”
The Islanders honored Mike Bossy before Tuesday night’s game against the Florida Panthers. His legacy as a player and a person will forever live on in the hearts of hockey fans all across the world.

Cat declawing has been common practice since the 1970s, while dating further back to the 1950s where it originated in the underground before being adopted by the veterinary community. 
The declawing of cats, or its commercial name, “onychectomy”, is a technique that veterinarians adopted in the early 1950s from a very unexpected source, the underground dog-fighting community. 
Despite its name, the procedure is not as straightforward as a manicure. Instead of a filing or trimming of the claws, the equivalent of up to a human’s first knuckle is removed from the cat’s paw. Essentially, the root of the root of the nail is removed. 
It’s theorized that cats get declawed by the handlers of dogs that participated in the underground sport. The cats would be used as live bait for the dogs in order for them to prepare for the impending fight, but even with the disadvantage of strength and size in comparison to the dogs the cats would scratch and sometimes injure the handlers’ fighters. 
As a result, handlers would declaw cats before tossing them into the dog pit so they would be left defenseless for the dog to “warm up for its fight” without risk of injury. 
In the 1950s (theorized to be 1952) declawing was commercialized by Dr. Grant Misener, a veterinarian in the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). He made the procedure known as “a humane procedure to declaw cats” according to the AVMA in the doctor’s obituary. 
Today, it is largely seen as cruel and on the cusp of veterinary malpractice in modern legislation. 
“I think it’s unethical, I don’t think it’s really necessary because it really only benefits the human so let the cat live,” sophomore liberal arts major at Suffolk County community college Ethan Epstein said. 
In fact, the AVMA now strongly discourages the procedure entirely, declaring it as “a major surgery involving amputation and is not medically necessary for the cat in most cases.”
The symptoms that follow the declawing procedure range from pain and infection, to lameness, back pain and tissue death in the inflicted paw. If tissue death occurs, further amputation may need to be considered for the cat’s well-being.
“Because they might rip up your furniture or something or, like you said, scratch one of your friends, and at that point most people would be like ‘the claws gotta go,’” cat owner Anthony Wachter said. 
The most common reasons for owners to get their cats declawed are, the cats ripping up the furniture or, they’re scratching other members of the household, such as younger children or elderly people with thin skin.
“No, because normally if my cat scratches you, she doesn’t do it often, so if she does it means you’re a bad person and shouldn’t be in my house to begin with,” Wachter said.
Despite the recent growing exposure on this topic and states attempting to ban declawing altogether, an anonymous survey of 3,441 veterinarians was performed in 2014. The results of the survey found that 72 percent declawed cats when requested while 24 percent stated they did not. 
The leading reasons for today’s declawing procedures among the veterinary practicioners are for behavioral purposes or an alternative to abandonment or euthanasia. While the majority of those who don’t declaw believe that behavior is not a good enough reason. 
For those who look into declawing for behavioral reasons, they will be pointed in the direction of behavior modification before committing to a major operation in these cases. Especially if it is regarding scratching furniture within the household as opposed to family members. 
“I’ll just reupholster everything myself, don’t get an animal if you don’t want your stuff to get ruined,” Epstein said.
Other safe and affordable alternative solutions to declawing are trimming, nail caps, training and feliway. With all being relatively simple, they are substantially viable alternatives. 
Cat declawing is an out-dated, archaic practice that is as stubborn as its underground origin. With more awareness being spread on the topic and more veterinarians denying the procedure, the hope for kittens and their murder mittens is as strong as your cat when you try to pick them up.

On Tuesday, April 12, a man attacked the N subway train in Brooklyn. He set off smoke grenades and opened fire, leaving 23 people injured. He was disguised as a construction worker and turned the subway car into a bloodbath. 
Commuters were riding the subway as it neared the 36th Street subway station in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park just before 8:30 a.m.. A gunman opened two smoke grenades, a 9 mm handgun and fired at least 33 times hitting 10 people, seven men and three women. Those victims hurt are in critical condition but are stable and will soon make a full recovery. 
“I heard a pregnant woman was sadly shot. It just breaks my heart knowing there are people out there that have so much hate in their heart that they could hurt so many people, especially a woman who is carrying a child,” freshman psychology major Olivia Nawara said. 
Left behind at the scene were a 9 mm Glock handgun, three extended magazines, a hatchet, gasoline, four smoke grenades, fireworks and a credit card. Within those findings, they also recovered keys to a U-Haul van that had been rented in Philadelphia.
“It makes me scared to ride the subway again, especially knowing how easy it was for the person who did this to bring all these weapons into the subway. Living in New York the subway is our  number one transportation and I’ll never be riding one again,” sophomore education major Alana Fried said. 
A manhunt for the suspect had been put into place and the NYPD identified 62-year-old Frank James as the person of interest. It took about 24 hours to find James. Police received a tip regarding his whereabouts, only to find out it was James reporting on himself. He called the police saying he knew he was wanted and that they could find him at McDonald’s at Sixth Street and First Avenue in the East Village in Manhattan. 
Junior education major Ashley Calley was nervous about the time it took for police to locate James.
 “It’s really concerning that the police took a long time to find him,” she said. “If they took longer, who knows maybe he would’ve fled to another country. It’s absolutely scary.”
James made his first court appearance on Thursday, and will be held without bail after being charged with conducting a violent attack against a mass transportation system. He had made no remarks during the appearance except understanding the charges against him. His lawyers requested that James be given a psychiatric evaluation and magnesium pills for his cramps. 
Currently, there is no known motive for the actions of James.f he is found guilty, he will face a sentence of life in prison.

LIU Brooklyn Student Government Association (SGA) sparked outrage among students when they posted a press release on their Instagram account denouncing the newly approved LIU Post American club on March 7, 2022. 
Many students took to change.org to sign a petition to “abolish” the American club, which is sponsored by Turning Point USA, Young America’s Foundation, Young Americans for Liberty and Students for Life of America. As of April 16, there are 854 signatures on the petition.
Post Black Student Union (BSU) Vice President and senior Amanda McCollum commented on the matter in an interview with Reyna Iwamoto of the Seawanhaka.
“The existence of the club itself, BSU has no problem with — it’s the affiliations with white supremacist organizations that we take issue with. This is a common misconception,” McCollum said. “They have a right to exist, it’s just their affiliation with racist, sexist, homophobic interest groups—that is the problem. They are funded and supported by them…” 
President of the American club and sophomore Matt Cairo defended the American club affiliations due to the termination of several employees of Turning Point USA after racism scandals were made public.
“Turning Point does supply a lot of support for our organization. They are the biggest organization that we are affiliated with, and the loudest and the proudest. But, that also makes them the most controversial,” Cairo said. “The thing about Turning Point is a misconception that the people involved with the organization are making racist statements or some sort of hate speech and … I understand where it came from,  but the thing is, anyone affiliated with Turning Point who has said something hateful has been terminated. I view that as a positive for Turning Point, if they’re terminating people who have said disrespectful stuff in public…”
As students on campus debated whether or not the club should exist at all, or if denouncing affiliations with larger organizations was necessary, many questioned how the club was approved in the first place. The original press release by the Brooklyn SGA stated that the club violates LIU’s values of maintaining diversity, equality and inclusion, and turned some of the focus on the individuals that approved of the club: LIU Post SGA.
President of Post SGA and senior Rob LaPollo explained that the process to approve a club or organization on campus is solely up to LIU Promise guidelines, and that SGA members’ personal beliefs towards a club cannot impact decisions on approving the club.
“The SGA approved the American club in early March. They met all of the requirements [to become a club] of Promise,” LaPollo said. “When [SGA] approves of new organizations, we are supposed to do so without political preference. We have a diverse group of people in SGA and they have a lot of different political backgrounds, but when we’re approving any club, especially one that deals with politics, it’s our job to be blind to [personal beliefs] and approve organizations that meet the rules of Promise. At the time of their approval, [the] American club met all of the guidelines of Promise, and therefore, [SGA] took a vote. The vote was unanimous.”
LaPollo said that he was surprised when he saw Brooklyn SGA’s Instagram press release, as he had not heard from Brooklyn SGA all year. Additionally, the process for approving clubs may be different for each LIU campus.
“Immediately, I thought that we [Post SGA] should have a conversation about it with them [Brooklyn SGA], but things started to escalate pretty quickly,” he said. “[Post SGA] thought about putting out a statement, but I always believe that statements without actions being followed up are essentially useless. After [Post SGA] saw that, we were debating what the best course of action would be.”
LaPollo believes that there is a misunderstanding regarding the relationship of SGA and the American club.
“I think that students are not understanding our association with the American club. This SGA is not affiliated with the American club in any way beyond the fact that we approved them. I don’t want people to think that the SGA takes political sides, or believe that we have bias for one side or another. SGA just approves the clubs that meet the requirements of Promise. And then obviously, we monitor it afterwards and we hope that these clubs we approve make the right decision and don’t do anything to make students feel unsafe or unwelcome on campus. And if that is the case, we encourage them [the club] to reflect on how they can change that.”
Post SGA will be releasing a statement about their values on Instagram in the coming days.
On Sunday, April 3, an incoming students day at Post, many members and supporters of the BSU protested outside of the East campus gates following the LIU administration not meeting the demands of the BSU, as well as a racial slur being posted in a GroupMe chat with approximately 500 Post students, created by the SGA. These demands were listed on an Instagram post via @liupostbsu and were as follows; “the American club to denounce their affiliations to national orgs that have a history of spewing white supremacist ideology, acknowledgement from the Promise office, actionable steps taken by the Promise office to ensure that black students feel safe on campus, equality in how we are treated by university employees and a position in the Promise office that is dedicated to organizations who promote equality.”
Vice President of student affairs, Michael Berthel, wrote to students regarding the hate speech in the GroupMe chat in an email on March 28 before the protest. The chat was also deleted after the slur had been posted.
 “The use of hate speech will not be tolerated and is contrary to Long Island University’s values and our commitment to fostering a community of respect and inclusiveness,” Berthel said. “Every member of our community has the right to feel respected and be equally valued.”
Berthel says that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) practice of more speech, not less, is a guiding principle for how administration is corresponding with the BSU regarding the issues the club is raising.
“As an institution of higher learning, the University recognizes the First Amendment as the cornerstone of our democracy, even when we may disagree with what is being said,” he said. “Our position is consistent with the ACLU which has written, “An open society depends on liberal education, and the whole enterprise of liberal education is founded on the principle of free speech. How much we value the right of free speech is put to its severest test when the speaker is someone we disagree with most. Speech that deeply offends our morality or is hostile to our way of life warrants the same constitutional protection as other speech because the right of free speech is indivisible.”
This statement opens up the conversation further regarding freedom of speech at LIU, and indicates that administration will not require the American club to remove their affiliations. Berthel and McCollum both confirmed that there was a meeting regarding BSU’s request between administration, McCollum and the President of BSU, Alexis Pieters. 
“And [the] administration said there is nothing they can do [to remove the affiliations with the American club] because of free speech,” McCollum said in an interview with Seawanhaka. “As someone who studies the law, free speech is protected by governmental sanction … There are certain things that can’t be said … Constitutional rights are protected from government intervention — free speech doesn’t necessarily exist in this context which is something they don’t understand.”
McCollum told Seawanhaka that there was no productive conversation during that meeting regarding the American club. 
Turning Point USA chapters have been banned or denied recognition from numerous high schools and colleges across the country, including Baylor University, Texas Christian University, University of Florida, Lynn University,  Drake University, University of Scranton and Northwestern University. However, there are currently over 1,300 Turning Point chapters in both public and private schools in America.
Ultimately, if LIU administration is not requiring the American club to disaffiliate with organizations that many students feel are controversial and discriminatory, it is up to the American club members to determine how they are going to exercise their free speech, and if that free speech is appropriate given LIU’s values and club guidelines.
