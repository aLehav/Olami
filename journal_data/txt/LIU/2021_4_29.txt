As the semester comes to an end, many students find themselves preparing, and potentially cramming, for finals.
‘[I’m] dreading all of my final assignments due to the fact [that] they are on the last day of classes,” freshman English major Joseph Interrante said. “It would be different if I had to complete them individually. Since they’re all due the same day, it is almost as if they’re grouped up in my mind as well.”
Some students, however, find their exams enjoyable. Junior philosophy and criminal justice major Thomas Digennaro is excited for a final that he gets to prepare an argumentative presentation.
“I love to talk, let people know what’s going on inside my head. I always like the opportunity to present and talk about something,” he said.
To aid in concentration while preparing for exams, it’s common to listen to music.
“I listen to all kinds of music when I study,” Interrante said. “But recently I have been listening to a 24-hour Chill-hop radio playlist on YouTube. It really helps me zone out and do my work.”
Digennaro’s music taste differs from Interrante.
“I’m a pretty big Grateful Dead fan,” he said. “They’re known for their long jams, and there’s not a lot of singing going on – it’s very LoFi, and it’s good background music. I like to play it very faintly to provide a mellow vibe for my studies.” 
It can be crucial to allow time to relax and take a break from studying during this time.
“I’ll give myself a little reward once I finish what I’ve planned to do for that night, and I’ll sleep so much better because of it, so I just tell myself: ‘just get through the work’,” Digennaro said.
Some students prefer to focus on their physical health during their study breaks. 
“I personally use physical fitness as my outlet,” Interrante said. “I feel like exercise helps me remain being productive while still taking a break from my mentally taxing work.  It has been extremely rewarding as well.”
When finished with finals, students are already planning their summer vacation.
“Honestly, I’m just really looking forward to getting to the beach,” Digennaro said.

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended a pause in the production of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine after six individuals had cases of rare and severe blood clots. The pause was from April 13 to April 24.
Though only six out of almost seven million people who received the shot reported a blood clot, this was still cause for concern for the CDC and FDA, who held numerous emergency meetings to assess if the Janssen vaccine should be permitted for use again. The FDA announced that it would resume use of the vaccine on April 24.
The one-shot design of the vaccine is beneficial in many ways for people who are afraid of needles, and for people who are unable to go to two appointments to receive the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
Though the chances of developing the blood clot disorder is less than one in a million, recipients of the vaccine should still be weary of symptoms. Symptoms include blurred vision, backaches, severe headaches and seizures. 
Students that received the Janssen vaccine on campus were nervous when they heard about the blood clot cases.
“If I feel something I will go immediately to the doctor but also I do know that it was only about six cases,” junior musical theatre major Ricky Dobbs said.
Dobbs received the vaccine at the LIU Brooklyn campus over a month ago, but still made sure to keep up with this evolving story when it broke. 
The Janssen vaccine was the first vaccine made available to Dobbs, and he jumped at the opportunity to protect himself and others around him. 
“I got vaccinated because I just want life to go back to normal, and if you want something you have to be a part of the solution,” Dobbs said.
Dobbs understood that if he was one of the affected individuals, he most likely would have felt a symptom already, which provided him with some peace of mind.
Dobb’s roommate, junior musical theatre major Devin Butera,  received the J&J vaccine the same day, and has been watching the news as well.
“I was actually very tentative at first to get the vaccine in general, I was afraid of the side effects just for myself, just being in school,” Butera said.
Butera has to be physically active as a theatre major, and he is also in a dance show right now. His hesitation stemmed from seeing how others faced side effects from the vaccine.
After receiving the shot, Butera said he could feel it inside of him. He said he felt heavy and like the vaccine was pumping through his body.  
“It buckled down to the fact that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity right now that you don’t really know when it will come again, so you take it or leave it,” Butera said.
Butera is glad that the CDC and FDA resumed the production of the Janssen vaccine, and calls having three vaccines being distributed at once “monumental.”

The 2021 NHL season saw players seeking to compete with rival teams in the midst of a global pandemic and a sluggish economy, providing players and fans with some much-needed relief from the gloomy realities of the outside world. 
There are four divisions within the NHL: North, East, Central, and West. 
For the sake of limiting travel across the U.S.-Canadian border during the pandemic, the NHL instituted a divisional realignment to give both players and fans the best and safest experience possible.
The Northern Division consisted of the following teams: the Calgary Flames, the Edmonton Oilers, the Montreal Canadiens, the Ottawa Senators, the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Vancouver Canucks, and the Winnipeg Jets. 
The East Division consisted of the following teams: the Boston Bruins, the Buffalo Sabres, the New Jersey Devils, the New York Islanders, the New York Rangers, the Philadelphia Flyers, the Pittsburgh Penguins, and the Washington Capitals. 
The Central Division consisted of the following teams: the Carolina Hurricanes, the Chicago Blackhawks, the Columbus Blue Jackets, the Dallas Stars, the Detroit Red Wings, the Florida Panthers, the Nashville Predators, and the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
The West Division consisted of the following teams: the Anaheim Ducks, the Arizona Coyotes, the Colorado Avalanche, the Los Angeles Kings, the Minnesota Wild, the San Jose Sharks, the St. Louis Blues, and the Vegas Golden Nights. 
Initially, fans were not allowed in the stadiums for most teams, but the Dallas Stars, Florida Panthers and Arizona Coyotes allowed a limited number of fans at their home games. Social distancing protocols were enforced, and coaches were required to wear masks around players.  
The season began on Jan. 13 and set to end on May 8. 
The NHL will have a 16-team playoff. The top four teams from each division will compete in a round-robin to decide the division winners. Then the remaining four teams will be re-seeded based on point totals and face off for another round-robin format to determine the Stanley Cup Championship. All rounds will be best of seven. 
The playoffs begin on May 11 and end sometime in July. 
Aaron Wayne, a freshman finance major, is looking forward to watching the Islanders compete for a title.
“I hope the Islanders see some success,” Wayne said. “I’ve been watching the Islanders since I was a kid. They’re a part of who I am, and I’d love to see them do well.” 
Tara Eckhardt, a junior English major, is excited for what is to come of the unusual playoff format this season. 
“It’s a little confusing to keep up with all these divisional changes,” Eckhardt said. “But hopefully, an exciting end to the season is on the horizon. Go Islanders!” 
Though the season may have seemed different, the spirit and devotion of NHL fans and players persist, and executives are determined to have a successful end to the season.
“While we are well aware of the challenges ahead, as was the case last spring and summer, we are continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our participants and the communities in which we live and play,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said.

 After going 4-2 in the regular season, field hockey wrapped up their season, falling to #1 seed Rider University 0-5 in the Northeast Conference Championship in Lawrenceville, New Jersey on Thursday, April 22. 
Rider got an early start on LIU by scoring a goal in the first and second quarters before scoring two goals in the third and their last goal in the fourth. Senior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis saved eight shots, earning her All-Championship Team honors. 
In addition to Women’s Field Hockey making the NEC Championship game, freshman Sol Espona was named NEC Rookie of the Year. Espona, who previously won Rookie of the Week three times this season, was also awarded second-team All-NEC recognition.
 “It is an honor to be recognized as Rookie of the Year. It marks my path for the rest of my college career as a student-athlete. More importantly, I have so much pride to represent LIU  with the award,” Espona said.  
Coach Raenee Savin was proud of her freshman player for winning this honor.  
“We are so proud of Sol for being recognized as NEC rookie of the year. She is a force to be reckoned with. She works hard offensively and defensively but when she gets that fire in her eyes, she raises the bar to a whole other level,” she said. “The combination of her skill,  speed, and nose for the goal set her apart from other players on the field. Her reverse chip shot  is amongst the best I’ve ever seen.”  
While the Women’s Field Hockey season ended earlier than the team would’ve liked,  Coach Savin already has her sights set on next season and is hopeful that they will be able to reach an attainable goal, an NEC Championship title. 
“The number one goal for next season is for us to win the NEC Championship. In our first two years at the Division 1 level, we have finished third and second respectively. We want a  championship title,” she said.

This year, the National Football League (NFL) did not hold their annual combine, where top scouted collegiate players get to showcase their abilities in front of NFL teams and the country. Instead, athletes had their “professional day” tryouts at their respective colleges. 
The NFL came out with their draft board, and they have the First 10 picks as Trevor Lawrence #1 to Jacksonville, Zach Wilson #2 to the New York Jets, and Mac Jones #3 to San Francisco. That is three Quarterbacks right away. The #4 pick, Kyle Pitts, Tight End from Florida, is projected to go to the Atlanta Falcons, at #5 Penei Sewell, offensive tackle for Oregon, may go to Cincinnati. Miami sits at #6 and possibly looking for receiver Ja’Marr Chase from LSU. At #7 we have Justin Fields, Ohio State Quarterback, who the Denver Broncos could take. Chicago Bears are projected North Dakota State Quarterback Trey Lance at #8, at #9 the Detroit Lions could take Micah Parsons, Linebacker from Penn state. The Dallas Cowboys sit at #10, and they’re also predicted with a defensive choice in Cornerback from Alabama, Patrick Surtain II. 
Sophomore health sciences major Rudy Silvera expects quarterbacks to go in the first three spots.
“Obviously Trevor Lawrence at #1, Zach Wilson #2, and then at #3, everyone says Mac Jones, but I think the 49ers should go Justin Fields,” he said. “They have many playmakers on their team. I feel Fields being more mobile than Jones could open up an already explosive offense.” 
Sophomore business administration major Anthony Gambino believes Smith is the top receiver in this year’s class.
“Without a doubt, Devonte Smith. He won the Heisman as a receiver, that’s irregular. I know people and scouts are saying his size is a problem being underweight, but he’s the best football player in college football. He deserves to be called the best receiver,” he said.
Undecided junior Damien Caffrey thinks that the best receiver is Ja’Marr Chase.
“He’s a stud. He had such a crazy season, he was able to sit out the following year and prepare for this year’s draft. He’s tough,”  he said.
Caffrey hopes that the Jets’ first-round pick works out this season.
“I’m okay with Zach Wilson as our pick, but another QB in the draft, I hope this one pays off,” he said.
Silvera has high hopes for the Giants’ potential.
“I’m a Giants fan,” he said. “We are currently rebuilding. With a few trades this off-season, we could use a young defensive star in edge rusher Kwity Paye.”
  The first-round of the NFL Draft takes place on April 29 at 8 p.m. on ABC, ESPN and NFL Network. Rounds two & three will be on Friday, April 30 at 7 p.m.. Finally, rounds four through seven will be on Saturday, May 1 at noon.
