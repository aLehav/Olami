“We will be the number one private university on Long Island,” said Dr. Kimberly Cline, LIU’s new president, in response to critical reports regarding the university’s finances that were published this past summer.
An article published in Forbes Magazine in August, titled, “Is Your College Going Broke? The Most And Least Financially Fit Schools In America” claimed that LIU has been running at an operating deficit for the last three years.
“I think the Forbes article was really talking about issues that happened previously and so I believe that life is a runway and you have to look forward,” Dr. Cline said.
To combat low enrollment at Post, which the Forbes article estimated as the school needing to fill at least 250 empty seats in its 2017 class, the university has been targeting high school students. “I know for a fact that if we’re out in the schools and we’re out talking to principals, superintendents, and guidance counselors and we tell them enough of what we have to offer here, we’re going to have many more applications than we need to do really well,” said Cline.
One hit to enrollment, Cline speculated, happened last October. “I understand it as when Hurricane Sandy [hit] last year that was when the open house was. It was never rescheduled and that was damaging.”
Post hosts several open houses and informational sessions throughout the year. The open houses are opportunities for transfer, graduate, and high school students to learn about residence life, clubs and activities, faculty and academic programs.
“It’s not damaging permanently; it was an unfortunate incident of weather,” Dr. Cline went on to say. “Like I said, the [high school] guidance counselors recognize that we have great programs.”
In July, Newsday published an article titled, “LIU Restructured Under New President.” Professors and other employees
speaking with anonymity, according to the reporter Candice Ferette, said 25 to 30 jobs were cut.
“I started July 1, so a number of those folks were members that weren’t let go, but took early retirement in January and some other folks were at the end of June,” Dr. Cline said.
“We want people to stay here; we aren’t looking to let people go,” she added.
Also under the restructuing was the elimination of the Provost position, which was held by Dr. Paul Forestell, who was in charge of day-to-day campus operations.
Dr. Forestell is currently working as the director of experiential learning and service learn- ing, according to Cline.
Over at Brooklyn, Gale Stevens Hanes, vice president chief operating office and legal counsel, still serves as the LIU Brooklyn Provost,
Cline stated. “For now, she [Hanes] retains the title of provost and this one [at Post] technically is vacant, but we’re going through a process,” said Dr. Cline. “We’re hearing from faculty, we want to make sure it makes sense [to retain the position] and if it does, we’ll make that decision in January,” she added.
Dr. Cline spends her days between the Brooklyn and Post campuses, fundraising and meeting donors. She also spends her time talking to students and LIU community members about the changes they want to see.
“We want to hear what students want because we could all sit around a room as administrators and faculty and put things forward, but there are things that are in our head and [students] may have some different views.”
Dr. Cline has been on the job for four months and has tackled some of the challenges associated with being president. However, getting to know the students, departments, faculty members, and campuses has been one of the most exciting aspects of the new job. “We’re good, but we could be extraordinary if we all work together,” she stated.

Just want Dr. Cline that I will never forgive or understand why MY HISTORY as a BLACKBIRD was erased because the Blackbird–had a racial implication???????????????????????

Students at LIU Post are entitled to some privacy, including the protection of their scholarly records. That is a reason why Congress passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in 1974. For students attending LIU Post, the institution provides an “Authorization to Permit Access to Educational Records” form.
According to the description of FERPA provided in the form, this act is designed to guard the privacy of records containing information about a student’s education. It also gives the students the right to “inspect and review the educational records within 45 days of the receipt of a written request.”
The form states that if students find a mistake made in their records, FERPA provides guidelines that will assist students in correcting the data. A correction of a mistake made in a student’s academic records is usually made through a series of “informal and formal hearings.”
FERPA, according to Gaetan Pamphile, the office manager for the Registrar,is usually something that parents are concerned about.
Pamphile explains that, once a student turns 18-years-old, all educational records become inaccessible to that student’s parents. These records not only include the grades and courses being taken by students, but also everything concerning a student’s educational life.
FERPA protects everything from student infringements to parking tickets. However, a student who wishes to allow parents access to all, or certain areas, of their academic records, can fill out the FERPA
form. “[Students] can actually choose what records [they] want to disclose,” Pamphile added.
On the Authorization to Permit Access to Educational Records form, students can list the names of people that they would like to give access to, and the relationship they have with them. They can also decide which records can be released under their consent.
The records that students can release include: grades, academic standing, transcripts, Bursar/financial records, and disciplinary records. Pamphile also explains that in order to prevent a parent from forging their child’s signature on the form, “[the form] has to be signed in front of a notary for the form to be authorized.”
Students were informed of FERPA and the Authorization to Permit Access to Educational Records form during orientation and in an email that was sent out in the beginning of the fall semester.
According to Tamara Napoleon, a freshman Biology major, FERPA is important. “As an adult, [FERPA] gives you some sense of privacy,” she added.
Napoleon believes that it is the student’s right to keep educational records hidden from parents unless they consent otherwise.
Gabriela Garcia, a sophomore Chemistry major, believes that parents shouldn’t have to be subjected to the authorization form. “From experience, since my mom pays for my tuition, I believe that she should know how I am doing in school. If I was paying my own tuition, I wouldn’t tell her [anything].”
Students interested in completing the form should check with Registrar for more information.

It was 1989 and LIU Post, formerly known as C.W. Post was going 25 years strong. A woman who was looking for a change in pace sought a position. She already had 10 years experience from working at Adelphi University as the Director of Purchasing, but she was ready for something new.
At that time, the college only offered three residential campuses. “It provided me the space and opportunity I needed to do the job,” she recalled. “It was exactly what I needed.”
Margaret Natalie joined LIU Post as the Director of Sourcing Services, a position that gave her the opportunity to provide school vendors for the faculty and students. Top vendor listings included Xerox, Office Depot and P.C. Richard & Son.
As a member of the Purchasing Department, she was responsible for making sure that the school had the necessary supplies to function. When students and staff of the school were in need of certain items for their departments, it went through her. The Purchasing Department is the ‘middle man’ of school supply imports.
Twenty-four years later, Natalie’s decision to join LIU Post changed the direction of the school. In her time at LIU, she has contributed to several of the school’s conveniences.
She was involved in supplying the Xerox contract to the school, allowing students and staff members to have access to copying machines on campus.
Natalie was also responsible for condensing student needs onto the LIU ID card. Prior to that, students were given multiple cards with different uses. One was used for entry to the school and another was used for meals. Her new system provided convenience to students and cut down the numbers of cards lost each year.
Her involvement included suggesting green rooftops, which promote plant life for buildings on the campus. When a building has a green roof, the roof of the building is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium. Natalie pitched the idea in order to help LIU Post move forward in becoming a ‘green school.’
“The school was constantly adding new things to its list and I was excited to be a part of that,” said Natalie.
Natalie predicts that in the future the school should expect to become more technology-based. By the end of this academic year, staff will be able to use LIU Buy, an electronic market that will allow staff members to order Office Depot Supplies online. Natalie was also involved in this project.
However, her retirement won’t allow her to experience it. Natalie is ready for another change. “I want to travel,” she laughs. “It’s just time.”
Natalie was employed at LIU for 24 years. Her sons started their careers after graduating from LIU Post. Her career blossomed here and her legacy will be left here.

The fall is upon us, which means Sunday and Monday nights on campus are not just dedicated to homework and studies, but are also heavily dedicated to America’s own sport. The NFL season is in its fourth week and students are extremely thrilled and passionate about the big games and their teams.
There are local bars and restaurants in the LIU Post area in which you can watch the games. According to students, Buffalo Wild Wings (BWW), located in Broadway Mall in Hicksville, is the most popular for football on Sunday and Monday nights. This is mainly because of the deals on their delicious wings and the more than 30 flat screen televisions. BWW gives its customers the opportunity to watch several different games at the same time while enjoying a great meal with friends. What more can you ask for?
“Football is extremely influential on campus,” according to Electronic Media sophomore Akeem Victor. “Before I started dorming at school, I used to just watch the Super Bowl, but since my friends are so heavy on football, it’s an every Sunday routine for me. We get together in someone’s room, order Papa Johns, argue, yell, and just have a good
time.” On campus, there are a few places in which students get together and watch the games on Sunday and Monday nights besides their dorm rooms. A slim number of the football athletes get together in the Winnick Hall and watch the games on the new flat screen that was installed this year. Some of the students may also watch the games together in the Brookville Dormitory lounge that has a TV. Once in a while, when the big games are on, students may go into the Fishbowl in Hillwood Commons
to watch a few of the games together. Sophomore Matthew Ferere, an Information Technology major
and defensive back for the LIU Post Pioneers, believes that football is heavily supported on this campus. “On Sundays it’s all football here. Whether you’re male or female, there’s a good majority of students all together watching it,” says Ferere. “I, myself, stay in my room watching the games while doing a little homework with friends. I love football so it’s a chill, relaxing time for me on Sundays and Monday nights.”
Football is America’s sport and the most watched game in United States. This campus is no disappointment when it comes to supporting the NFL on Sundays and Mondays. Yes, there is lot of yelling, screaming, and arguing, but it is all from the thrill that the game delivers and all out of fun.

The leaves are changing colors and the air is becoming brisk. This can only mean one thing: autumn has arrived! The weekends are a great time to take advantage of this beautiful weather and do some fun things with friends and family. Long Island alone has endless possibilities of fun things to do, but LIU Post is close enough to New York City so that students can experience some of the events the city has to offer during this time of year as well.
Long Island is a great place to be during the fall. If you have a car, you can travel out east to some of the pumpkin farms, such as Schmitt’s Farm in Melville, to pick out that perfect pumpkin for your jack-o’-lantern. While there, Schmitt’s Farm offers free hayrides and a corn maze you can get yourself lost in, plus other various attractions. The farm is open seven days a week and there is no entrance or parking fee, so for college students this would be perfect. Who doesn’t like something free? The pumpkin picking season for them started on Sept. 28, so head over there for some pre-Halloween fun.
Jacqueline Marino, a junior in the Medical Imaging Program, said “I went pumpkin picking this weekend and I had the greatest time ever. I went with my boyfriend and afterwards we went back home and carved faces out of the pumpkins and painted the little ones.”
Long Island also has a variety of apple farms, including Fort Salonga Farm, in Northport, which is about 30 minutes from campus. There is a $15 minimum for adults, but they do provide you with a bag to fill up on all the apples you want. If apples aren’t your favorite fruit, the farm also has an option to pick raspberries for a $5 minimum admission charge. For the raspberries, you are given a container that will
allow you collect up to one pint. Alex Ochoa, a junior Accounting major, said “Probably my favorite part about going apple picking, or pumpkin picking, is buying the candy apples at the food stands in the farm.”
Huntington will be hosting a Fall Festival at Heckscher State Park from Friday, Oct. 11 through Monday, Oct. 14. The admission is free, and throughout the weekend there will be different carnival attractions, food, crafts and retail vendors, and also live music.
Oyster Bay will also hold its annual Oyster Festival on Saturday, Oct. 19 and Sunday, Oct. 20. According to the Oyster Festival website, the festivities will go on rain or shine, as they have been for the past 30 years. The Oyster Festival offers many different shopping stands, rides, and, of course, seafood! Volunteer chefs from all over set up stands of different kinds of seafood, primarily featuring oysters and the many different ways they can be served. Like the Huntington Fall Festival, the Oyster Festival will also feature live music.
If you would rather travel into the city, then you might want to check out the Columbus Day Parade on Oct. 14, starting at 11:30 a.m., which has been going on since 1929 on 5th Avenue. The parade features many different floats and also live musical performances.
Another parade that might be interesting is the Halloween Day Parade in Manhattan. It will be the 39th Annual Village Halloween Parade. TimeOut.com describes it as “a drunken event of hundreds of people dressed up in Halloween costumes consuming New York City.” They also mention if you’d like to take part in the parade you can head over to 6th Avenue between Canal and Spring Street at 6:30 p.m., in costume. The parade goes from 6:30 p.m. until 8:30 p.m.
Make some of these ideas your own. This weather doesn’t last very long before it starts snowing, so take advantage of the things you can do on Long Island and in Manhattan.

Having to figure out what to bring for lunch every day is not always easy, and many fall into a pattern of eating the same foods day after day. Most students at LIU Post live off campus. Many buy their lunch at school, but making your own lunch can be easy, healthy, cheap and twice as good. Here are some tips to make your lunch delicious.
Omelets
The assortment of what you can put in your omelet is vast, and they are easy to heat up using the microwaves at school. Some options are onions, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, any kind of cheese, cooked broccoli, cured ham, crispy bacon and regular diced ham, just to name a few.
Suggestion:
Chop up Portobello mushrooms, onions, green peppers and ham into small pieces. Let them brown for 3-4 minutes on high heat before adding 2-3 whipped eggs. Cook until the egg is no longer fluid, and flip to complete the folded omelet.
Cooking with cupcake pans
You can use cupcake pans to reduce portions, try something new, or impress your co-workers or fellow students by making tiny omelets or mini pizzas. Not only is it inexpensive it takes 15 minutes at most.
Suggestion:
Pour a whipped egg into two of the holes. Place a cooked broccoli in the middle, top it off with minced bacon. Put in the oven on 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes.
Chicken and rice
Mix the two together with your choice of vegetables, such as steamed red peppers, carrots, peas or all of the above. You can also heat it up or enjoy it cold.
Norwegian Crepes
Crepes, or really thin pancakes, are a convenient choice for lunch, since they can be rolled up with a thin line of sugar, Nutella or fresh strawberries. You can also bring a portion pack of your desired jam, and
you can eat them plain, hot or cold. A mix of 11⁄4 cup of flour, 2 cups of milk, 3 eggs and one tablespoon of sugar will serve four people.
Tortilla wraps
Wraps are easy to make, because if you have tortillas lying around, you may have enough ingredients in your fridge to fill it without going grocery shopping. Start with chicken, steak, salmon, ham, peppered turkey, or make it vegetarian. Choose from ingredients like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, red peppers, guacamole, sliced avocado, pesto, cheese or any kind of mixed salad. Go for whole wheat tortillas to make for a healthier option.
Suggestion:
Wrap lettuce, onions, red peppers, grilled chicken and one half sliced avocado together for a fresh and healthy choice.
An easy option is to wrap lettuce, cucumber, ham and cheese.
Quesadillas
Quesadillas take about five minutes to make. Put your choice of meat, cheese and sauce between two round tortillas. Place it in a pan, without butter or oil, on the highest temperature for a minute on each side until the cheese has melted. Serve plain or with toppings like sour cream, tomatoes and guacamole.
Suggestion:
Fill the bottom tortilla with a thin layer of pesto. Spread peppered turkey ham across it, and top it off with provolone cheese.
Junior Political Science major and commuter Maiken Prestmo says her favorite lunch to bring is “Fried rice, vegetables and chicken, or
yogurt.”“If you are living by yourself, you should make extra food for dinner the night before and bring it to school as lunch the next day,” advises Kaaynat Afgun, a Psychology major and commuter.
As easy as that, you can make and bring lunch that cost under $5, and you get to use up the leftovers in your fridge, all in under ten minutes.

This is nothin’ for the radio, but they’ll still play it though ‘Cause it’s that new Drizzy Drake, that’s just the way it go
In his third studio album released on Sept. 24 entitled “Nothing Was The Same,” Drake showed exactly the type of artist he is. He can let loose and just run with a beat and impress you lyrically. Then on the very next song on the track he can slow it down to an emotional, sweet song you may want to hear at your wedding.
“Started From the Bottom,” a song that some people consider a rap anthem which was released back in February, features a bit of an edgy and angry Drake explaining how he, well, started from the bottom and is now essentially, at the top being successful. It has long been speculated that Drake had plenty of money before rapping due to his role on the TV show, “Degrassi.” But the 26-year-old rapper wants it to be known that he had to work hard to get to where he is now; which is no longer at the bottom.
In August, Drizzy released the first official single off the album called “Hold On, We’re Going Home.” Really, this is simple song. But sometimes, simple is best. No need to get fancy. This is the song men- tioned earlier that people have told me they want played at their wed- ding. It currently sits at No. 7 in Billboard’s Hot-100 Songs. When you hear this song you may think you took a trip back to the 80s. It’s a pop disco feel without of any rapping whatsoever. While radio stations and consumers clearly enjoy this song, not everyone agrees that the “soft” and emotional Drake is best.
“I like the album overall. The only negative or downside of the al- bum is like every song is slow,” said Alexis Peters, a senior broadcasting major. “I like the old Drake when he actually rapped.”
Well, some of the old Drake was found on this album too. “Tuscan Leather” is a beautiful example of Drake absolutely getting in the zone. He even says it himself in the song, that he “could go an hour on this beat.” Noah “40” Shebib, a friend of Drake’s and producer on the song, flipped Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing” three different times to make this song a standout. In other words, there are three different beats during this one song. The first beat change happens just before the two- minute mark and the drums kick in. Shortly after, Drake raps his face off. Then near the four-minute mark, the beat slows down and Drake becomes the “soft” rapper that some people think he is.
The last song on the album owns the only rap feature on the album as Jay Z teams up with Drizzy on “Pound Cake.” Jay Z says the word “cake” 17 times on one of his verses in the song explaining just how rich he is. Jay Z’s part is interesting for a couple different reasons. Aside from the several clever “cake” metaphors, he says that he’s “just get- ting started.” That’s the icing on the cake; there’s more in store for Jay Z soon. In addition, the constant repetition of “cake” in the song is remind- ing people of Rihanna’s song “Birthday Cake.” Though, she was talking about a different kind of cake…
With any album, there are highs and lows. The beat changes in “Tuscan Leather” are exquisite. “The Language” is a smooth track that may not get as much publicity as some of the other songs. “From Time” and “Too Much” feature Jhene Aiko, and Sampha, respectively. Both are emotional songs. The former is about his past loves; the latter is about what fame has done to his family-life. However, there are low moments such as in “Worst Behaviour.” It song takes too long to get started. Drake gets mad for a few bars, but it takes nearly three minutes for him to begin.
Overall, I feel that “Nothing Was The Same” was an album released by an artist who is extremely comfortable of where he is right now. Drake is the sensitive rapper, but his point gets across that he can rap, and on the next song he can sweet-talk you.
With Drizzy, there will always be comparisons made to his second album, “Take Care,” and if “Nothing Was The Same” is better or worse. It’s fun to debate because both are popular, creative, well-done pieces of work.
And with Drake’s elevated status in the rap game, “Nothing Was The Same” will ultimately be compared to the other big album releases from this year such as Jay Z’s “Magna Carta Holy Grail,” and Kanye West’s “Yeezus.”
Nothing was the same? Ahh, I hear some familiar tendencies that make Drake the unique artist that he is. He blurs the line between rap and R&B, and he can please almost anyone with his different styles and approaches to his work. He can have one song with the soft-spoken Jhene Aiko, then another with features from 2 Chainz and Big Sean. If everything was the same, would that be an issue? I have no problem at all with Drake, the chameleon in music.
Drake isn’t only involved in music, he just became a Global Ambas- sador for an NBA franchise, the Toronto Raptors. With that, here are my favorite sports references in “Nothing Was The Same:”
“I’m with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib, this way I can beat Serena when she playin’ with her left”
“I had to Derrick Rose the knee up ‘fore I got the re-up” “I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn’t reach” “The contract like ’91 Dan Marino”

The Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC), founded in 1996, is a touring ensemble of student dancers who foster talent and explore the history and legacy of their art through a slew of residencies with established companies, such as Pilobolus and the Paul Taylor Dance Company. In the past, only upperclassmen in the company were able to attend an annual trip to the American Dance Festival held in March, but the opportunity extended to the entire company two years ago. “However, with the [campus] budget cuts it is hard for the entire company to go,” said Freyani Patrice, a junior in PCDC and the group’s Fundraising Manager. The PCDC must have its registration and funds together by the end of the month, a sum totaling $10,000.
According to Patrice, the funds collected will help pay for registration for all of the dancers in the conference. Three choreographed pieces will be performed and judged during the competition. In addition, the funds that are needed will go towards the expense for the hotel and bus, as the conference is held at SUNY Brockport. Despite the funds,
dancers “will be responsible for getting their own food throughout the week at the school where the conference is held, as well as buying food, water, juice, etc. to keep in the hotel,” continued Patrice.
This trip is a chance for the PCDC to represent LIU Post on a wider scale. “Other schools and outside professionals get a chance to see what the dancers do at Post, and we get to network with dancers and teachers from schools upstate, in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania,” said Patrice. “We call it our Dance-cation.” The dancers are able to strengthen their technique, grow as a group, and have the chance of their choreographed pieces going to the gala and the Informal Concert.
“As a company, we are trying to do everything we can to raise that money,” she added. The first of the fundraisers on campus is a bake sale. Those willing to donate to the cause can also do so by writing a check or giving the money directly to the Director of Dance, Theater, and Film, Cara Gargano. The dance office number is (516) 299-2353.

They’ve done it again. The LIU Post men’s soccer team brought its record to 8-0 after hosting the Philadelphia University Rams and the New York Institute of Technology Bears last week.
The Pioneers hosted the Rams on Wednesday, Sept. 25. It didn’t take long for the action to begin. Sophomore midfielder Per Forgaard set up junior forward Eivind Austboe for the first of his pair of goals just 35 seconds into play. Austboe’s second goal of the game came less than four minutes later, with assists from both senior midfielder Jonathon Watkin and senior back Eirik Bjoernoe. The Rams finally answered with just over 10 minutes left in the first period when sophomore midfielder Patrick Groh headed the ball into the goal off a corner kick by sophomore defender Angelo Dambalas. Their efforts weren’t enough though. A pair of goals by Pioneers’ freshman forward Johann Kristjansson and sophomore midfielder Matias Ruiz, with assists from Austboe and Kristjansson, secured the 4-1 Pioneers win.
The NYIT Bears made the trip to LIU Post on Saturday, Sept. 28 looking for a repeat of last year’s 2-1 win over the Pioneers. To the Bears’ dismay, Austboe was first to score, with an assist from senior forward Cemil Turan just past halfway through the first period.
The Bears came back from halftime with a vengeance. Goals by senior midfielder Vinny Caccavale and sophomore midfielder Alberto Ruiz put the Bears in the lead with less than 10 minutes left in regulation, but the Pioneers weren’t going down without a fight. Austboe headed the ball towards the net, and Kristjansson finished the job with
less than five minutes left in the game, bringing the contest to a 2-2 tie. A handball foul on NYIT led the Pioneers’ captain, Bjoernoe, to a game- winning penalty kick that sailed beautifully between the pipes, into the net. The Pioneers came out victorious in overtime with a 3-2 win against the Bears.
The Pioneers are next set to host the Roberts Wesleyan College Redhawks on Friday, Oct. 4 at 2:30 p.m. and the Daemen College Wildcats on Sunday, Oct. 6 at 2:30 p.m.

“Wise Up Ghost,” a collaborative album by musical chameleon Elvis Costello and hip-hop legends The Roots, was released on Sept. 17. While Costello is known for his varied sound, he has never worked with hip-hop musicians until this album. Many people find two diverse groups don’t always mix well. Luckily, Wise Up Ghost not only blends rock and hip-hop successfully, it also adds in some R&B and Funk to the mix.
The idea of collaboration began when Elvis Costello was the musical guest on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon” in 2009. While backstage, The Roots covered Costello’s famous “I Don’t Want to Go to Chelsea,” which Costello absolutely loved. By 2011, after Costello and The Roots finished their respective albums, they finally had time to work on “Wise Up Ghost.”
“Wise Up Ghost” is definitely not the best work by either party, but it is refreshing. It’s a group of brilliant friends getting together to record an album. Musicians having fun is a great thing to listen to.
Some of the songs do carry on a tad too long, like the six-minute “Can You Hear Me.” Outside of that, many of the songs find themselves within the five-minute range, which slowed the album a bit.
The biggest loss on the album is the fact that Black Thought, MC of The Roots, doesn’t appear on the album. Black Thought has paved his way with The Roots as one of the greatest rappers, and his absence is notable in “Wise Up Ghost.” They missed a great opportunity on the track “Come the Meantimes.”
On a positive note, Costello’s vocals are quite charming and make up a lot of the pleasures of the album. From his rocking, raspy voice on “Walk Us Uptown” to his delicately beautiful mark on “Tripwire,” Costello gives us plenty of sounds to make the album feel fresh throughout.
Lyrically, it does sound a lot like some of Costello’s earlier work, which isn’t necessarily bad. For some of his avid fans, it seems as if Costello is trying to be younger. However, I do find the lyrics enjoyable, and nowhere near a midlife crisis Costello.
Musically, the album contains some of the greatest musicians since the birth of rock. In his own right, Costello is one of the greats, accompanying different tunes with his signature Fender Jazzmaster

With the release of the latest update to Apple’s iPhone, iOS 7 has evolved the phone from ‘traditional’ ways that framed its original look. While the war on cell phones continues between Apple and Google, the companies that design the iOS and Android software, right now everyone is talking about the new update.
What do LIU students think of the new iPhone update? Beatriz Vacacela, a senior Political Science major, spoke favorably about the new iPhone update. “It’s different, but I like it. It’s a very modern system, and I prefer it over the old one,” Vacacela stated. She continued, “I think the new update has a lot of efficient tools. For me. . . Apple did good.”
The iOS 7 update is more than just another patch to fix possible bugs and errors. The purpose is to make old and new users feel more than welcome to experience it. The application icons are displayed in 2D instead of 3D, to give the iPhone a fresher, more vibrant feel.
Charlie Moerler, a sophomore Broadcasting major, seems to agree. When asked how the new iOS update was compared to the previous ones, Moerler expressed that it was, “like having a new phone, but not in a physical sense.”
Some students, however, cannot help but think that iOS 7’s appearance is strikingly similar to Android. Aneeb Siddiqui, a freshman Pharmacy major, did not have a favorable opinion. “I feel like the lock screen looks well designed, however, everything else could have been better,” he added.
Siddiqui felt as though Apple was attempting to adapt to resemble the style of Android. “I feel like the app structure could have been better. . . It wasn’t original. I feel like they copied Android and made it look like it, as well.”
Students like Yasmine Jones, a senior Criminal Justice major, are still getting used to the update. “I mean it’s alright. I’m still adjusting to it because once you adjust to one thing, now you have to adjust to something new. However, overall I think it’s pretty good, for what it is,” Jones stated.

New Haven added to its lead with a touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Ty Headen on the next possession.
Staring at a 14-0 deficit, the Pioneers needed to respond. Junior wide receiver Chris McGrane was the beneficiary of a five-yard pass from junior quarterback Steven Laurino. Having cut the lead in half, the Pioneers narrowed the deficit even further when Chargers’ senior running back Anthony Tillman could not escape the Pioneers’ rush defense. The safety made it 14-9.On their next possession, the Pioneers put together a masterful drive, going 49 yards in seven plays. The result was a Laurino touchdown run that gave the Pioneers the lead.
With less than one minute remaining in the first quarter, New Haven’s senior quarterback Ronnie Nelson hooked up with sophomore wide out Courtney Moshood on a 73-yard touchdown. That score proved to be the go-ahead score and the Chargers did not look back from there.
Later on, Nelson added three touchdowns (two running, and one passing) to pad to the New Haven lead. The Pioneers tacked on a touchdown in the fourth, but it was too little too late, as they fell
48-23. Laurino finished the day with 312 yards and one touchdown while going 34-52 in the air with an interception. Laurino also ran for 73 yards and a score. Red shirt freshman wide receiver Michael Richardson and red shirt junior wide out Kamron Palmer each caught six balls for 49, and 53 yards, respectively.
