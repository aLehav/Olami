Three sets were all the Pioneers needed to defeat Mercy College on Thursday, Oct. 15. The green machine opened up the match with a commanding and convincing first set victory by a clip of 25-11. It seemed as though the Pioneers would roll over Mercy, but the second set saw some bumps in the road, but a big opportunity as well. The back and forth set eventually saw the score evened up at 19, but the Pioneers went on a 5-1 spurt and eventually claimed the set.
The third set, much like the second set, saw Mercy battle to stay in the match, but in the end, the Pioneers finished with seven unanswered points and claimed the victory. It was a total team effort as eight players totaled kills, led by junior middle hitter Taryn McCullouch and senior setter Monica Amador who had nine apiece.
After a game that was all Green and Gold, the Pioneers got a taste of their own medicine on Saturday, Oct. 17, when they played Queens College in their house. They fell victim to the Knights from Queens and ultimately fell 3-1. After dropping the first set, the Pioneers snatched the second set by a score of 25- 23, led by freshman setter Giulia Genna and her three kills. The tightly contested third and fourth sets, which were both won by Queens College, were decided by a combined five points.
The Pioneers serve up their next match against Molloy College on Thursday, Oct. 22, at 7 p.m. from the Pratt Recreation Center.

Freshman forward Emily Miller’s lone goal on the day was enough for the Pioneers to upend Saint Michael’s College who was visiting LIU Post on Saturday, Oct. 17. The goal came in the 10th minute off of a rebound from junior midfielder Steph Mocerino. Even though they only had one tally, the Pioneers got 12 of their 16 shots on goal.
For the Pioneers, junior goalkeepers Ericka Parks and Savanah Cummings each played a half and each held their own, shutting out the Saint Michael’s.
The win was the third straight for the Pioneers who will return to the field today when they host Pace University. Game time is set for 4 p.m.

Thursday, Oct. 15, was a career day for senior forward Susanne Vistnes, who broke LIU Post’s program record for most career points.
The Pioneers welcomed Philadelphia University to the Pioneer Soccer Park, and Vistnes wasted no time getting the scoring started. She received a pass from sophomore midfielder Klara Berggren and notched her 13th goal of the season, and, in the process, broke the LIU Post record for most points in a collegiate career. Later in the second half Vistnes provided the assist on a goal from freshman forward Hillevi Eklow.
Another late Pioneer goal gave LIU the commanding 3-0 win.
A few days later, the Pioneers were back in action against Mercy College. Although they didn’t score three times like on Thursday, they did notch the first goal, and that was enough for the victory. Freshman forward Andrea Huntzinger teamed up with Berggren and after a few passes, Huntzinger found the back of the net.
The Pioneers return to the pitch on Friday, Oct. 23, when the host Roberts Wesleyan College. Start time is scheduled for 2:30 p.m.

The singles flight carried the team on Friday, Oct. 16, as they won four of their six matches and claimed a 6-3 victory over Roberts Wesleyan College. With the win, the Pioneers earned a spot in the East Coast Conference Champion- ship for the third straight year. Freshman Shanice Arthur and seniors Didi Fatchikova and Lucie Chrastecka all won in straight sets in singles play to give the Pioneers a big advantage.
After holding their own in doubles and claiming the victory, the Pioneers looked to do some damage against Daemen College one day later. In that matchup, the Pioneers were unstoppable, dominating their opponents and winning by a score of 9-0. It was the second shutout for the Pioneers this season and the second in their last three matches. They are cer- tainly on the right path heading into the ECC Tournament. They have secured the fourth seed going into the tournament and will wait to hear whom the play.

On Saturday, Oct. 17, the football team (5-2) rushed for 261 yards as they beat Pace University (1-6) 30-7, in a Northeast-10 tilt at Pace Stadium in Pleasantville, N.Y.
Junior running back David White and red-shirt freshman running back Malik Pierre both had field days, combining for 227 total rushing yards. Pierre finished with 22 carries for 108 yards and a touchdown, while White paved the way rushing 18 times for 119 yards. As a team, the Pioneers have now racked up over 200 rushing yards in four games this season.
LIU jumped right out of the gate as junior quarterback Jeff Kidd rifled a 36-yard pass from midfield, which was hauled in by red-shirt junior wide receiver Shane Hubbard to set up shop inside the red-zone. Kidd scored on a four-yard keeper three plays later to put the Pioneers up 7-0.
Kidd and Hubbard were a fierce duo once again as the Oregon native connected with his top receiver for a 16-yard touchdown late in the first half, giving the Pioneers a 16-7 cushion heading into halftime.
In the latter stanza, the Green and Gold continued to dominate and distance themselves from the Setters as they tacked on two more touchdowns, which put the game to bed.
Kidd completed 12-of-27 passes for 209 yards throwing two touchdowns and two interceptions. Hubbard and red-shirt sophomore wide out James Higgins were on the receiving end of the two scores. Red-shirt senior h-back Tyler Heuer led all receivers with 107 yards on five receptions.
The Pioneers currently sit in second place in the NE-10 standings just one game behind Assumption College. Head Coach Bryan Collins and his LIU Post squad look to keep the momentum and win their third straight when they travel to West Haven, Conn. on Saturday, Oct. 24, as they square off against the University of New Haven in a NE-10 battle. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.

Goals in the second half by Forgaard, sophomore mid- fielder Harry Pearse, and senior forwards Matias Ruiz and Alfred Lindberg rounded out the scoring on the day, giving the Pioneers the dominating 6-1 victory.

“Too little too late” — a phrase teachers of all kinds would reiterate to me.
In the case of Lamar Odom, too little too late is just too true. Watching someone fall from grace is eerie, yet still, entertaining. Odom, once Kobe Bryant’s running mate to three straight NBA finals appearances, is now fighting for his life in a Nevada Hospital, after he was found in a brothel, unconscious, and reportedly with “every drug imaginable,” according to Dan Feldman’s NBC Sports article entitled, “Report: ‘virtually every drug imaginable’ in Lamar Odom’s system, on Oct. 14.
Addiction and hardship were never strangers to Odom’s life. His father is a recovering heroin addict; Odom was just 12 when his mother passed away from cancer; and when his seven-month-old son was taken from him by Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the pain only became worse.
Odom is a man who’s simply lost his way, but does society see him as such? Check the news blogs and social media. Odom isn’t a sad story; he’s a news story, who’s labeled as “Kardashian Casualty,” or just another drug addict, scrutinized under the microscope of society.
Could it be any more obvious what the real problem is? We ignorantly crucify this man for his current situation, but we fail to acknowledge why he could have fallen into addiction. We fail to realize and recognize that there are millions of people struggling like Odom all around us. Whether it is drug addiction, family, bills, school, or even the possessions we own, people struggle all over the world.
Truth is, we are too busy judging one another, instead of being honest and accepting of each other.
“I struggle every day with bills to pay,” said Amanda O’Rourke, a junior Education major, who lives with her single mother and younger brother. “The pressure can get so immense, it’s hard to see why someone wouldn’t resort to drugs or alcohol as an escape from such adversity.”
Ismael Nehhas, a junior Pharmacy major, agrees. “I know several people who fell on hard times, and ended up resorting to drugs,” he said. “I can see sometimes that people get so caught up in their perception, that they just can’t take it, and look for a way out. Drugs, alcohol, even gambling, can be that ‘way out’ for people.”
According to DrugFree.org, nearly 23.5 million Americans are battling drug addiction, and according to newsmax.com, approximately 50 million people in America live below the poverty line.
I personally sympathize for Lamar Odom, because I’ve had people in my life who’ve lost their way, and found themselves immersed in addiction. I don’t believe drug addiction as a whole is something that one day can leave society for good; but I firmly believe that addiction is avoidable, if the individual feels that he or she can just say “Hey, I need help.”
I recognize that not everyone has that kind of support system so readily available to them, but that just says to me, as a member of society, I need to step up and be there for anyone who has a problem; not necessarily become their private Dr. Drew, Dr. Phil or any kind of doctor, but just be someone present, someone to talk to.
That said, I will end with this: More likely than not, we all have or have met a Lamar Odom in our life. In any event, be selfless, be vigilant, and don’t ever hesitate to help someone out. Just holding the door open for someone can make a difference in that person’s day.
Step up and be a part of the support system of someone else’s life, because we can all make a difference, one way or another.

As of Sept. 17, Post has once again teamed up with EverFi and is expecting students to partake in the Haven and AlcoholEdu online course, in an attempt to better their understanding of sexual assault and ways to prevent it.
The first part of the course was due Oct. 5, and the second part of the course is due Nov. 18.
During the last academic year, the Haven course wasn’t “expected,” but “required” of Post students to fully complete. The online course has a passing exam score of 75, which will result in whether students passed or failed the course.
Nick Morgasen, a senior Broadcasting major, believes that “people don’t care about the test.” He said that it could be effective, but the way it’s almost enforced upon students “it makes people, like myself, feel stupid, and that we don’t know anything.”
But Richard Renelique, a senior Broadcasting major, disagrees. “The course is very informative and has facts essential for a college student.” Renelique said. “There’s no guarantee students are savvy about these issues and if they aren’t, how will they conduct themselves when the situation arises? Knowledge is power.”
On the effectiveness of the course, Renelique contrasts Morgasen’s thinking, stating, “it is decently effective. It is one thing to show information, but the program doesn’t take into account the full range of learners. Some learn with text, others with audio, and some with acting it out. It hits one type of student but not all.”
“I personally enjoy the Haven course and I think its goal is admirable and should be followed by more schools,” Renelique said. “Students need to know certain subjects that classrooms just don’t teach.”
Meanwhile, Morgasen states his singular-statement opinion on the overall, functionality of the course. “If you force people to do things, it can very well cause problems, and make the situation hurt the person, instead of serving them well,” Morgasen said.
The Haven course for the current semester concludes on Nov. 18. That said, what do you, the student, think about the Haven course, and online courses in general? Should they be expected of students to take? Was it better when it was required? Or are they unnecessary?

The majority of us, as students, seem to lack this great notion of ambition. We seem to not care about what we want to be, nor do we show the work ethic we need in order to accomplish our dreams.
Too many of us are bystanders in a world that needs doers! The world outside of college is harsh and hard, and doesn’t tolerate people who don’t have a direction of where their ultimate goal in life is. Having ambition doesn’t require you to have an athlete’s mentality of “never giving up” or “pushing yourself so far to the edge” that it becomes unhealthy. No, it’s having a clear picture of where you want to go, what you want to achieve and how you are going to achieve aspirations.
Ambition is something you may not “dream” about doing but it gives you this inherent sense of goodness and accomplishment, if you work towards what you want. It is so important for our minds to have stability, something we can hold onto and set targets to achieve.
Many people of our generation like to be lazy, and don’t like to think of all the responsibilities that they may have to face after college. Sometimes this isn’t a bad thing, and if it “floats your boat” then be my guest to pursue an attitude such as this one. But realizing what you want for yourself, and a place where you feel as though you have accomplished your main desires, is something of the gods. Extremely rewarding.
It doesn’t have to be a big dream of becoming a Heisman trophy winner, or the MVP in the NBA. Ambition is something that can be such an easy concept to understand, but it does take work. But then again, doesn’t anything you want to achieve require some sort of mental, academic and physical work?
For example, maybe you want to have a good internship in your sophomore year, which means you will have to make sure you do well in your classes from the start of your freshman year; you may want to join a club, which will look great on your resume; or you might want to get physically fit so you look good for your interview.
Any of these reasons are part of someone’s ambition. You want to be able to reach all of these small goals to then achieve your ultimate goal, which may be a job in the field that you have a degree in. An ambitious mentality and desire to triumph will lead you closer and closer to your end game.
Some other people may not be going that extra mile, or practicing their inner ambition, so how about you go above and beyond to succeed? Surely you just increase your chances, right?
Many of us don’t know what we want, and we don’t have to, to have ambition. That’s not how it works! Ambition stems from your mind, your psyche. It is a mentality of achievement, in anything. So let’s all try and get an A on that English essay, or win the national championships, or maybe start to drive in 2016! These are all things that people can make happen with just a shift toward ambition.

The tenth anniversary of New York Comic Con was possibly the best one yet. Panels such as “The X-Files” and Marvel, and guests like Bryan Cranston and Natalie Dormer, made this convention from Oct. 8 to 11 at the Javits Center, one to remember.
Starting off with the panels, there were several panels that stood out over the four-day excursion of all things pop culture. Possibly the most anticipated event this year was the X-Files panel. Attending were Agent Fox Mulder played by David Duchovny, Walter Skinner played by Mitch Pileggi and creator Chris Carter. The big highlight of this panel was that the first episode of season 10 revival was screened, three months before it officially airs on Jan. 24, 2016.
Another popular event this year was the Marvel Netflix panel. This event centered on season two of “Daredevil” and season one of “Jessica Jones.” Season two of “Daredevil” premieres spring 2016 while “Jessica Jones” will be available on Netflix on Nov. 20.
Stars of both Netflix shows were in attendance, including the star of “Luke Cage,” Mike Colter. During the panel, Marvel showed off a sizzle reel of season one of “Daredevil” and a trailer for season two that introduced Jon Bernthal’s antihero, the Punisher. In an unexpected move, Marvel also revealed the first episode of “Jessica Jones” to the lucky audience.
Attendees to NYCC were also treated to a fair amount of popular actors and comic book artists. Some of the more popular guests included Vin Diesel of the “Fast and the Furious” franchise, Robert Kirkman, creator of the “Walking Dead,” and Heisenberg himself, Bryan Cranston.
Instead of making public appearances, several actors decided to attend the convention wearing disguises, to hide their identities. On the final day of the convention, it was revealed that Jared Leto and Mark Ruffalo attended the show and walked the floor in disguise. Both movie stars wore masks. Leto even took pictures with fellow cosplayers.
Speaking of cosplay, where people dress up as their favorite characters, the number of people who dressed up also seemed to increase compared to last year. Some of the most popular costumes included the ever-popular anti-hero Deadpool and the crazed psychologist and enemy of Batman, Harley Quinn. Both characters will appear in movies next year, Deadpool in “Deadpool” and Harley Quinn in “Suicide Squad.”
There were many variations of the Harley Quinn costume; with the most abundant one being Margot Robbie’s take on the character in Suicide Squad. One of the more inventive cosplays was a giant Hulkbuster suit of armor from “Avengers: Age of Ultron” which stood at least eight feet tall.
New York Comic Con is only getting bigger and better, with each year topping the last. By the time Comic Con comes to New York next fall, word of mouth will have grown once more, as more people flock to one of the best events in the Big Apple.

Every week, the S.A.L Gallery will have an exhibition of different artists who are usually graduate students attending Post, according to Karina Cuba, a sophomore Art Education major. Cuba works at the gallery.
Throughout the week, visitors are welcome to go into the gallery and view the pieces of art that will be displayed. On Wednesdays, there is an opening reception where the artists usually have a speech, and mingles with audience and faculty.
This week, graduate student and teaching assistant for the Art Student’s Foundation and Advanced Life Drawing, Candice Licalzi, presented her show “Visual Chapters”. Being so active in the arts department, Licalzi was invited to participate in this event where she agreed to show the work she has done in the passed six months.
“There wasn’t a specific number of pieces we could bring but I put up 12 pieces that I think were enough,” said Licalzi. “I didn’t want it to get too overwhelming with the pieces, and I also have a collection going and so far it’s these 12 pieces.”
All of the work that Licalzi displayed was based off of her personal life. Most of the paintings, if not all, featured insects in some kind of way, which she claims, hold a special meaning personally. “What really started it was that I had a seizure disorder my freshman year all of a sudden,” said Licalzi. “Before I had these seizures, I had hallucinations of bugs that I started to include a lot into my art.”
Once Licalzi had finished these pieces, she delved into the meaning behind the bugs. “I was just curious what the symbolism behind insects was,” said Licalzi. “I found out that these bugs represented each of my emotions. As a kid I was very quiet so I feel like that was my mind kind of compensating for what I didn’t do as a child and bringing it into now.”
Other than bugs being a prominent feature in her art, Licalzi started to involve herself even more by painting her own face as well. “I started doing this new collection of my face because I was always trying to find the best way to explain what I am going through; what my communication is as an artist,” said Licalzi. “So I decided what better way to describe myself than to put my face on everything.”
One of the pieces in particular Licalzi spoke about was called “The Garuda” that featured her head on the body of a bird that had a chain attached to her head and went into the heart. It usually takes her a couple of weeks or months to make a piece, but with this one in particular she had it done in three days.
Some of her most recent pieces involve a lot more colors than she typically uses. Licalzi claims that this is because she wants to not only improve herself, but also experiment a bit and change things up.
“It’s perfect proof of that’s what you do in an MFA, you push it,” said Dan Christoffel, a Fine Arts Professor at LIU Post, in reference to her changing from her past paintings that were a bit duller to her current ones that have more color. “Dan and I, as her professors, are really encouraging her to get juicier,” said Neill Slaughter, a Fine Arts Professor at LIU Post.
Licalzi is undergoing her second year of her masters program at Post. However, she also attended Post as an undergraduate student, so in a total she has been here for six years. From the beginning, and towards the end of her time at Post, Licalzi feels like she definitely grew. “I feel like I finally have something I can hold on to, and I feel right about this style and this is going to be my thing. LIU helped me find that.”
Regarding her future, Licalzi is currently studying to be a professor and she plans to go back to school to receive a certification for high school teaching as well as her PhD in Art Education at Columbia University. “That’s what I plan on doing as well as being an artist and show and sell and just enjoy.”
Licalzi is a big fan of doing these presentations every week, “I was so happy with how this event turned out,” she said. “People were really saying that out of all of the shows so far this has been the most popular one and that it really touched people.”
Cuba said to expect plenty more successful shows like this one. There is already an artist or specific event reserved for each week until January 25, 2016. Next week, Amarilis Singh, who is currently getting a BFA in Art Education, will be displaying her art in the S.A.L. Gallery. There will be many more shows from other students as well as some guest speakers.
At the end of the year, from December 15 to January 25, there will be the show “Advanced Visions” where, according to Cuba, High School students come in and present their artwork for everyone to see.
Every Wednesday the S.A.L. Gallery holds an artist reception from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

It’s about time that I need to write a thesis. As a film major, you have several options for this task: film a short script, edit or shoot a couple of shorts, write a long essay dissecting a certain part of the film world, or in my case, write a feature length script. I’ve found that the hardest part of all of this is just settling on a damn story. There seems to be an endless abyss of possibilities, experiences, and influences to draw from that I am crippled in being decisive.
The hope is to write something that holds true to myself and also fits into the “American” experience. By that, I don’t mean my characters will eat hamburgers and play football all day. I mean that the themes of the film should resonate with the weird, multi-cultural, muddled experience of being an American – a nationality that isn’t fully its own, but an amalgam of different cultures mixed into one. I know it’s a little heady to try to consider these things and cram them into ninety pages, but I’ve got to, or else I’ll feel like I have nothing to say to the world.
So, I sit at my computer typing away and I consider how to make sense of all of this. I remember years ago when my dad first exposed my brother and me to classic films. Dominant among those were the quintessential Western films with Clint Eastwood, “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” – films that I probably shouldn’t have been watching at age eight, but who cares? I carefully consider how the Western genre
is rooted in American culture. And it hits me. I’ll write a Western! The genre is entrenched in American identity, several films taking place right before, during, or after the Civil War.
If any of you aren’t familiar with the genre, you’ll surely have heard of Quentin Tarantino and his neo-westerns like “Django Unchained” and his upcoming “Hateful Eight.” The genre is very much alive, as “Birdman” director Alejandro Inarritu is releasing “The Revenent” starring Leonardo DiCaprio this year, which is gearing up to be a potential Oscar contender. Yes, the genre is still relevant, and I feel that it is relevant to my upbringing as a filmmaker, slotting neatly into the landscape of being an American in the arts.
I have been vigorously ingesting anything to do with the genre – books, TV shows, movies, even magazines. Research is key, particularly for a period film piece. Later in the semester I will write an update about the script, which right now is the framework for a revenge story set in the American West, loosely inspired by the plots and themes of several William Shakespeare plays.
What I ask is that, if you are inclined and have read this column in full, you email me any personal recommendations for the Western genre at peter.barell@my.liu.edu. Anything you think may be interesting for me to look into during my research phase. Thanks in advance. Adios, partner!

Joe Gatto, star of TruTv’s “Impractical Jokers,” and LIU alumnus, received the Alumni Award during this year’s homecoming festivities.
Gatto graduated in ’98, nearly 20 years ago, and much has changed in that time. Walking into the Pratt Center for the pep rally showed Gatto just how much—from the facilities to the student body. “That was a big change, walking in there, like ‘Holy cow! This place grew up,’” Gatto said. “I felt very at home, and all the students I met had a sense of community, which was awesome.” While much has changed, Gatto said the people never do. “That’s the great thing about Post; it really was like a family.”
Gatto is a comedy idol now, but he was a normal student once, too. He was an Accounting major who graduated in three and a half years. “I was a nerd growing up, so in high school I did a lot of classes that transferred. I didn’t have to take English or math,” he said.
Like some students, Gatto had that one “legendary” professor. “I had a psychology teacher, he was the guy to get for psychology,” Gatto said. “He was a free thinker and didn’t believe in tests. Everybody wanted him because he was just crazy when you were in class with him. There were no wrong answers, and that’s the kind of professor everybody loved. He really connected with students.”
Despite what some people might think, Gatto wasn’t always known as the class clown. “In high school, I didn’t have that many friends at all, and I was bullied; just not popular,” he said. It was two of his three best friends who got him into comedy.
“Sal and Murr and I would have lunch together, and we would always tell jokes and laugh around, and Sal just found me funny.” The friends started doing improvisation in high school and encouraged him to try it out. “And I was like ‘No’, I didn’t have the confidence to do it,” Gatto said. “They made me come to the opening rehearsal, and I went and had a really good routine. People laughed a lot and came up to me after the show and were like ‘You’re really funny’.”
“I was normally just quiet and took school really seriously,” Gatto said. “So when I got to Post my sister was a senior when I was a freshman. When I went there I didn’t really know anybody, and my sister introduced me to people, and I was always her little brother. And then eventually I got really social, and just got funnier and more confident in my comedy.”
While in college, Gatto pulled a 180, and began branching out more. “I just started being my own person; by the time I graduated everybody knew me on campus and when my sister came [to graduation] she was known as my big sister,” he said. “I was involved in Greek Life, and I was an orientation sponsor, and I was the mascot at the football games, so you had to work to really avoid me.”
Gatto credits Post for molding him into the comedian he is today. “This is where I harnessed a lot of my embarrassment comedy,” he said. “I’m not really embarrassed at all, so I would just basically do anything to let people laugh and just not be so serious. I would go to the cafeteria in like a bra and underwear,” Gatto added. “It was all in good fun. And people always thought I was drunk—I’ve never been drunk in my life.”
In three words, Gatto described his time at Post as: defining, fun, and scary. Defining: “There was a lot of defining factors that came out of my time at Post, as far as my personality and my outlook on business in the world.” Fun: “I really had a great time and had a lot of fun with a lot of great friends.” Scary: “When I graduated I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I had the confidence coming out.”
What was it like for Gatto being back? “It really is nostalgic at this point. It’s really just a nice walk in the past, just to see it,” he said. “Everybody at Post seems so excited about their future. It’s like a really different vibe from everywhere else. That’s how it was when I went here too. I really like the whole spirit of being on campus!”
Today, Gatto has nothing but positive things to say about the way his career turned out, being on “Impractical Jokers.”
“I get paid to make my best friends laugh,” he said. “When you do good at work, people are laughing very hard, that’s the goal. It wasn’t easy to get here,” Gatto added, but said that, “It’s crazy that I get to do this with my life.”
For all current students, Gatto offers this bit of advice: “Enjoy it. College is so much more than getting a good GPA. You need to develop emotionally and socially in college; you learn a lot about yourself in your college years. It’s not just about the grades. It’s really about the whole experience. Make the most of it.”

Beyond the seemingly pumpkin everything that comes with fall, there is so much more this time of the year actually offers. There are many fall festivities and events that take place throughout the season.
Fall festivities:
1. Queens County Maze
The Queens County Farm Museum offers an activity that isn’t just for kids. If you like puzzles and mazes, then this is the place for you. Throughout the month of October the maze is open every weekend, and for a cheap admissions fee! It’s $9 for adults and only $5 for kids ages four to 11. There’s also a pumpkin patch that runs until Oct. 25, where you can go pick your own, or purchase one from their shop. The farm is located at 73-50 Little Neck Parkway, in Floral Park, N.Y., 11004.
2. Star Gazing
Every Tuesday in October you can go to The High Line from dusk until 11 p.m. There is no cost to enter, and there is also food. The Amateur Astronomers Association (AAA) provides high-powered telescopes so you can get the best view. One of the greatest things about being so close to the city is that you can take part in all the fun by just hopping on a train or taking a short drive into Manhattan. The High Line entrance is located on 14th Street, by the Standard Hotel.
Nature’s Beauty:
1. Central Park
For students that like to go into the city, Manhattan has one of the nicest parks around. Central Park inhabits 843 acres of paths, lakes, ponds, and beauty. Going to any park is one of the nicest places to watch the leaves change into the seasonal colors. “I really like to go on long [car] rides and look at the trees changing colors,” said Keliann Margiotta, senior Speech Pathology & Audiology major.
2. Fruit & Pumpkin Picking
“In the fall, I love to go pumpkin picking and apple picking with my family and friends,” said Taylor Day, a freshman Psychology major. If you agree, visit White Post Farms of Melville; it is one of the places on Long Island where you can do all the picking you want. The farm is located at 250 Old Country Road Melville, N.Y., 11747.
3. Drives & Walks:
The beauty of the leaves and trees truly gives a picturesque feel of fall. “I live along the Long Island Sound, so I love to go for long walks and step on the leaves and smell the scent of fall,” said Bekah Rinere, a graduate Adolescent Education and English major.  “It’s always nice to take a stroll down to the beach too.”
Luckily we have a setting outside of our classrooms that captures some of nature’s best scenery. “It’s fun to just walk around our campus and look at all the trees changing,” said Skylar Hornyak, a freshman Art Therapy major. “Our campus has lots of nice trails, like Chipmunk Trail, that are fun to walk down and play with the fallen leaves.”
Whether you prefer to take a walk around our campus, go to a nearby park and gaze at the stars, or go pumpkin picking, fall is a time everyone should enjoy.

Celebrating its 60th anniversary, Post held its annual Homecoming weekend. The annual pep rally was held on Friday, Oct. 9, which featured alumni Joe Gatto, from the class of 1998, and star of “Impractical Jokers,” followed by a live show from Seth Meyers at the Tilles Center.
Saturday was another day filled with events and activities. Sarabeth Levine, class of 1964, visited and held a brunch at McGrath House. Two other major events were the carnival in the parking lot next to Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium, and of course, the football game against Merrimack College, both of which required a ton of work and preparation.
Saturday had a big turnout, with many students, parents, friends, faculty, and alumni coming together and celebrating the day’s events. The day was capped off with a Pioneer win against Merrimack, giving the football team their fourth win of the year. “It was a huge game because of the devastating loss against them last year,” said senior Public Relations major, Brandon Cheney, who is the linebacker for the team.
“What I enjoy most about Homecoming is the atmosphere because everyone is in high spirits, and it’s the one time of the year everyone collectively gets together to celebrate,” said Mike Kallapozis, a senior Business Finance major. As president of Theta Chi, he and his fraternity brothers had a great turnout tailgating at the football game. “I grilled hamburgers and hot dogs all day while some of the guys were playing Kan Jam and enjoying the beautiful weather,” Kallapozis said.
Some of the other members of Theta Chi shared similar thoughts. “As a transfer student from the University of Arizona, this was my first Homecoming here at Post and [I] had a great time,” said Sean Alpert, a junior Psychology major, who is a new member of the club.
Others didn’t have many expectations for the event and just went with the flow, especially some of the freshmen. “The only thing I would change is allowing us to tailgate a little longer and not ask us to leave the parking lot after the game,” Kallapozis said.
Throughout the week, students had the opportunity to vote for the Homecoming king and queen. The winners were revealed at halftime during the football game. “This was my first Homecoming and my favorite part was when my sister Kelsey D’Andrea won Homecoming queen,” said Breanna Martinez, a junior English Writing major, and member of Alpha Xi Delta.
Homecoming king was senior Ketan Parmar, who is from Phi Sigma Kappa. Both Parmar and D’Andrea were recognized at halftime along with the other nominees.
LIU Post seemed to have yet another amazing Homecoming because everyone came together to help prepare and make sure people had a blast. Students demonstrated their school spirit by picking up their free Homecoming t-shirts in Hillwood Commons, and showed their Post Pride by wearing Green and Gold apparel throughout the week.

On Friday, Oct. 9, the Post Theatre Company had their opening night of “Venus,” written by playwright Susan Lori-Parks. The show was directed by Melissa Crespo, an outside director the PTC brought in, and Ben Brinton, a junior Theatre major, served as assistant director.
The show have received positive response, but also made some people upset because of its sexual content. This is believed to be the reason to why several promotional posters on campus have been torn down by an anonymous person.
The cast and crew of “Venus,” who have been rehearsing the show since the very first day of fall semester, were excited to show audiences how hard they’ve been working.
The show premiered at the night of Pep Rally. “Problems we fixed in rehearsals were applied on stage, but there are always things that can be improved,” Brinton said. According to Brinton, audiences reacted positively after seeing the performance. “Everyone loved it! And despite the fact that it was Homecoming weekend, we had a pretty good turnout,” he said.
Emily Banks, a junior Musical Theatre major who was in the show, had similar feelings about opening weekend. “It went well! We have more shows next weekend, so we’re really going to push the bar to the next level and do things bigger, better, and bolder,” she said.
Banks added that though there was almost a week between the two show weekends, they would have a rehearsal to keep the material fresh. “It was really interesting to have an audience’s opinion. We could tell they were unsure about how to react, but we knew that going in. We knew that people were going to feel uncomfortable because of the material in the show, [which] has a decent amount of sexual content. People are pushing boundaries, it’s hard to take it all in,” Banks said.
However, there has been speculation that “Venus” has affected some students, to the point that made them uncomfortable. There are rumors stating an anonymous student felt so uncomfortable that they have torn down several promotional fliers for the show.
According to both Brinton and Banks, a student, or possibly multiple people, have been going around to each building and taking the Venus posters off the wall because they found them “offensive.”
“We think we know who it was,” Brinton said. “Because an unnamed student commented on one of the cast member’s Facebook status’ expressing how upset and angry he was about the show and that Post Theatre Company was using the main character’s misfortune to make money and sell tickets.”
Due to this expression of disappointment, the “Venus” company believe the same person may have torn down their posters, although this is just a speculation and has not been confirmed by Public Safety.
“I think this person should come see the show before they make an opinion,” Banks said.

The Haven Sexual Assault course that was previously required for all students is now an “expected” online course as of Sept. 21, according to an email sent to all students by Long Island University. LIU partnered with EverFi, a website that helps students learn important life skills, such as prevention of sexual assault and alcohol abuse.
Students are expected to complete the “Haven: Understanding Sexual Assault” and “AlcoholEdu: For College” online courses on the EverFi website by Nov. 18; however, there is no penalty if students don’t complete the courses. When the first Haven sexual assault course came about last year, it was said that if students did not complete the exercise they would not be able to register for classes for the following semester.
To complete the online courses, students must log in to their My LIU account, using the same password and login information when logging on to the EverFi Portal link.
The online courses are substituting for the former required Haven course and are meant to inform students of their decisions regarding the effect of college alcohol abuse and sexual assault. The passing score for these exams is a 75 or higher.
Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students, said that the courses are being offered to keep students safe on campus. “LIU is dedicated to providing the best resources and up-to-date information to keep students, faculty and visitors safe on campus.”
Van Vlerah explained the switch from a required to an expected course completion. “The sexual assault course is a requirement of the Department of Education. We offer all LIU students the opportunity to participate in the course. Although the sexual assault course is not mandatory and not part of the curriculum, we expect every student to participate.”
The content of the course is not a major change. “Each year the course remains primarily the same, but NYS law does change slightly so it is in the best interest of the student to retake the class annually,” Van Vlerah said.

After a 2014 survey, the LIU Post administration learned that students wanted a wider variety of food options on campus. When students arrived this semester, they were greeted with four new places to eat around campus.
According to a press release from early September of this year, LIU Post students wanted “coffee and snacks in more locations and varieties across campus.” In response, the school added Bleecker Street Cafe, The Dollhouse, Twisted Taco, and The Pioneer Pantry.
Located to the right of the entrance of the library, the Bleecker Street Café immediately greets students as they walk in. The new and improved café is set up like a full sized Starbucks with baked goods and sandwiches on display, and a variety of snacks, coffee, tea, and soda also available for purchase. Students may either choose to sit at one of the six tables in the café, or take their food elsewhere. Although the café always seems to have customers, it does not disrupt the quiet, work atmosphere in the library.
On Riggs Lawn near the residents halls sits The Dollhouse, a quaint little cottage serving quick food like hot dogs, parfaits, and coffee. This café is conveniently located for students who live on campus, looking to grab a quick bite to eat on their way to class.
Many students have been buzzing about Twisted Taco, which is connected to the Subway in Hillwood Commons. This is the only food addition that does not serve quick, café style snacks. Instead, students can build their own Southwestern style meals.
Lastly, the Pioneer Pantry, located in Winnick, is also available to students, especially those living on-campus, who need to grab a snack on-the-go, or stock up their dorm rooms.
The responses from students about the new additions to campus have been mostly positive. Kate Gambino, a senior Broadcasting major, was very impressed with Twisted Taco.
“I think I get more for my money at Twisted Taco,” Gambino said. “I am full off of my meal and could actually split it with someone with how generous the portions are.”
Although the response has been positive, some students think there could be improvements. Natalia Schaefer, a freshman Business major, was disappointed by the food selection at The Dollhouse.
“I was surprised when I saw hot dogs on the menu,” Schaefer explained. “I thought there would be more paninis or baked goods like in other coffee shops.”
Commuter students are also finding it difficult to make their way over to the residential side of campus where The Dollhouse is located. Hannah Pohalski, a senior who is double majoring in Business and Health Sciences, agrees with many others that the new eateries are a great addition to the campus.
“I think it makes the campus more inviting, and it benefits students living on campus and students who commute,” Pohalski said. “Additions like these could have the potential of bringing more students to Post.”

On Friday, Nov. 6, The Office of Campus Life will be hosting a Move-A-Thon in the Pratt Recreation Center, from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
“The Move-A-Thon is a 10-hour, no sitting, no sleeping, constant movement marathon that raises money for the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation fighting pediatric cancer,” said Arianna Livreri, a Campus Life Coordinator. This is the first time Post will be holding this event.
“The Move-a-Thon will bring together hundreds of students, faculty, staff, and alumni to raise awareness and funds for the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation. An estimate of 300 students are expected to come support. The goal of the event will be to unite the community, engage students, build pride, and support a great cause,” Livreri said.
“There will be many things to do at the Move-A-Thon besides just moving and dancing; it will also feature entertainment, prizes, and food. The Student Dance Association, the Post Cheerleaders, and student Kevin Guardia and the Beat Boys will perform. There will also be trampolines, human foosball, and raffles.
Gabrielle Amico, a sophomore Dance major and member of the Student Dance Association, said that she’s excited to perform at this high-energy event. “I get to perform and do what I love for great cause, so it’s a win-win for everybody. It’s different than performing at Pep Rally or a show because I know it’s helping others,” Amico said.
The Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation was funded by Don Monti’s parents, Tita and Joseph, after their 16-year old son, Don, died of myeloblastic leukemia in 1972. His parents dedicated themselves to finding a cure for his cancer, and though a cure has yet to be found, much progress has been made.
To register for Move-A-Thon go to https://fs8.formsite.com/slld/ form136/index.html. This event is open to the public, as well.
