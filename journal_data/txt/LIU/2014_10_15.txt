This fall, there have been incessant complaints from students about the shortage of food at Winnick Dining Hall, as well as the low number of staff members working at Winnick, which, according to diners, is causing delays and difficulties when it comes to servicing students during meal times.
Students have reported that they have to wait in long lines with bad service, and that they aren’t provided healthy options, or even fresh food. “The only options there are [at Winnick] are hamburgers and pizza and the salad bar is usually stocked with lettuce that has been left out and is brown,” said Melissa Nosel, a junior English Library Science major.
Winnick’s hours have also caused some grumbling among students. Nosel says that Winnick doesn’t open until 7.30 a.m. However, like many students, Nosel has an 8 a.m. class. As a result, she is unable to get breakfast before her classes begin for the day.
“The one station that I love is the pasta station and it is closed half the time to keep open the pizza station because they don’t have enough staff to run all of the stations,” Nosel said. “There are six or seven stations, and most of the stations are closed because there is not enough staff to run them. The lines are out the door because they have one worker at each station trying to feed thousand[s of] students at [a] time, especially during common hour. I can’t count the amount of times that there were no utensils, no cereal, and the vending machines were broken.”
The lack of healthy options poses a problem for some students, especially those with medical conditions that make them unable to eat certain foods. Stacie Palacino, a senior Child Education major who underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder, has been forced to eliminate fats and gluten from her diet. Palacino claims that Winnick told her that they would accommodate her dietary needs, but there are still not a lot of healthy options and the salad bar is never stocked.
Ultimately, Palacino made the decision in Fall 2012 to become a commuter because of the lack of dietary options provided for her in the dining hall. “[Living on campus] just wasn’t working,” said Palacino. “I’m much happier now. I can make my food from home and I know that I’m eating healthy foods that I can eat, and not the greasy foods [that were provided for me at Winnick].”
Paul Carroll, Director of Operations of Aramark, the food service provider at LIU Post, states that there are no staff shortages at Winnick, and certainly no food shortages: “We currently have no [worker] shortages at Winnick Hall with the exception of some weekend coverage that is generally covered with student workers,” said Carroll. “We have 55 union members at Winnick Hall, and [many of them] are long-term union members who have served us well. We have no future plans of any change.”
Carroll also stated that the complaints of food shortages are unfounded. “We currently have the same amount of stations open as last semester,” Carroll said. “This includes pizza, pasta, street food, grill, home zone, dessert, salad bar, vegetarian-yogurt bar, deli, continental breakfast and cold food setup. There are no plans currently to change any food options, however we did introduce two new meal plans for commuter students.”
Resident students are used to using the magnetic stripe on the back of their student ID card in place of using cash to pay for food. LIU has instituted a brand new meal plan for commuter students that provide them the same food services as resident students. When a full-time commuter student uses their student ID card, they will automatically receive $50 to get them started. Commuter students will be able to choose from a 25 Block Plan, which provides 25 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; a 50 Block Plan, which provides 50 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; and the Commuter Dining Dollar Plan, which allows students to add more dollars to their plans at any time.
Despite this change, resident students believe that commuter students will only face the same problems that they do when it comes to the food selection and services.
“I’m cutting down my meal plan next semester,” said Nosel. “I have a meal plan for three meals a day, and yet I don’t use it most of the time because there is no food there a lot of the time and bad service.”
There are students who feel as though most of their dietary needs are being met with only little complaint or concern. “Overall, it could be worse,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. “If I avoid the chicken then I’m usually very happy.”
The Pioneer was unable to receive a comment from Administration; Abagail Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, referred Jackie Nealon, the Chief of Staff and Vice President of Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. Nealon chose not to comment on the matter, but referred to Aramark.

Users of the Pratt Recreation Center on campus have noticed that towels are no longer available for people who wish to swim or do other activities at the gym, such as yoga and spinning. The towels were officially removed on Sept. 15, and many people are asking “why?,” wondering whether the cause of this removal is due to people taking towels back to their dorms or other sanitary concerns.
However, the main cause of the missing towels is the fact that the university’s laundry capacity can no longer keep up with the athletic teams and the gym at the same time, according to Rick Hamilton, Senior Associate Director of Recreational Sports.
The football team alone has 99 players, and according to Hamilton, the expansion of the school’s athletics department has resulted in an increased demand for laundry. “Adding six to seven [extra] loads of laundry every day is just not possible anymore,” Hamilton said, referring to the amount of laundry generated from the gym on a daily basis.
When asked if the students, faculty, and staff using the gym during their spare time will ever see the towels again, Hamilton said that the school can’t provide them without adding additional employees and equipment. The towels used to be washed in the NCAA equipment room, but now the area is dedicated for use by the athletic teams.
This does not please some of the students. Dan Forsström, a sophomore Marketing major from Finland, does not see why the Pratt prioritizes the teams before the students. “It’s pretty basic for a gym to offer towels, so it is strange to me that they don’t offer it at Pratt anymore,” Forsström said. “Now I have to use one of my own when I’m at the gym and another one in the shower, which [is] necessary.”
Rob Krizek, a senior Criminal Justice major, thinks that this change will have a negative effect on the amount of laundry that students living on campus will have to do. “It’s a little bit of an inconvenience, because as a dorm resident I don’t have that many towels to use,” he said, referring to the fact that students live in a tight space with no room for a large amount of towels. Regarding Hamilton’s suggestion that towels in the gym would require additional staff, Krizek suggested that this could be a good job opportunity for work-study students looking for a place to work.
According to Hamilton, the Pratt is keen on keeping the gym as clean as possible. Students are no longer able to use the towels to clean up treadmills, bench presses, and yoga mats; now, there are paper towels and disinfectant spray to use for the same purpose. Also, the staff has begun going through the gym several times every hour to keep it clean.

Students who eat meals in the Arnold S. Winnick Student Center have noticed changes this semester. One of the most significant ones is that there are no longer any Styrofoam “to-go” trays available. All Styrofoam trays have been replaced with plastic, eco-friendly trays.
Paul Carroll, Aramark’s director of operations who runs the on-campus dining facilities, along with the campus Sustainability Committee—a group of administrators, students, and faculty moving towards creating an environmentally conscious campus—replaced the Styrofoam trays with plastic reusable ones to preserve the earth and its resources. These plastic trays may be taken out of the dining halls, washed, and reused. Student names are recorded when they ask to take out a plastic tray. If the student asks for another tray or hasn’t brought back a previous one they are fined $5 by Aramark, according to Carroll.
Student reaction to the elimination of the Styrofoam trays has not been wholly positive. Students have said that it’s a hassle to keep the new trays clean and regain access to another one if needed.
Others feel differently; Marcus Scott, a sophomore Physical Therapy major, said, “The change is effective. It saves the environment from waste and littering. It also encourages the students not to lose it due to a fine they’d have to pay.”
Patrick Bell, a junior Political Science major, likes the idea of transitioning from Styrofoam trays to plastic trays. “It’s a great investment, and the plastic trays are actually sturdier than the Styrofoam trays,” Bell said.
Unfortunately there has been a shortage, due to students not returning the plastic trays. “The whole idea of this project is for students to use to the plastic tray and return them so that they can be reused,” he stated. Carroll also said that drop off locations for the plastic trays are being developed to make returning the trays more convenient for students. The drop off locations will be near the residential halls and the Winnick Student Center. Carroll would not comment when asked how much Aramark is actually saving by the elimination of the Styrofoam trays, but he did say it is a significant amount of money.

Seven new sports were introduced at Post this fall. In earlier issues, The Pioneer profiled two of the new coaches: fencing coach Mike Corona (Oct. 1) and golf coach Tom Kane (Sept. 10). Two additional coaches are in charge of the remaining five new sports teams.
Joe Patrovich is the new head coach of the wrestling team, which was reinstated this semester after more than 25 years. Patrovich has been a coach in the Long Island wrestling community for two decades, and has coached hundreds of elite wrestlers, including 10 All-Americans.
Rick Rissetto, the Athletic Media Relations Assistant, thinks that Patrovich will become one of the core coaches in the Athletic Department and the university itself. “He was the first coach to have a full program set up among the new coaches, and the way he handles people both here and outside [the department] is admirable. I think he’ll become a mainstay on this campus,” Rissetto said. Patrovich has a full roster to work with, and according to Rissetto, the team will be very competitive. The season starts at home on Nov. 20 against Stony Brook University.
Robert Morris has coached the cross-country team at Post for eight years, and will now coach indoor and outdoor track and field for both men and women. Morris is a Long Island native and Post alumni. He graduated in 2004, after spending his time at Post as a three-time MVP and captain for the cross-country team.
Rissetto describes Morris as a man with a mind for coaching. Morris is currently the coach at Post with the most success, with 26 runners reaching All-Conference teams since 2009.

This semester, club representatives are no longer required to attend weekly Student Government Association meetings. The SGA is dedicated to helping students voice their concerns in order to improve campus life for both commuters and residents, and receive the appropriate training to become the best student leaders they can be. Meeting attendance in the past has been mandatory for every club on campus. So, what gives?
Michael Berthel, the director of campus life, says the plan is not to disperse SGA and close students off from the board, but to expand the organization and alter the structure of how certain tasks are carried out. After a survey was conducted at the end of the spring semester, SGA representatives concluded that the weekly meetings, which required mandatory attendance by student organizations and clubs, were not serving their purpose.
There are about 70 clubs and organizations on campus, including fraternities and sororities. Each club would go to weekly SGA meetings to receive campus information and updates, but most felt that they weren’t getting anything of substance out of the meetings. More felt they had little to no participation in these meetings. The solution was simple, according to Berthel: “If there are important matters, like forms due or club training, student organizations will attend specific meetings for those purposes as a requirement.”
Nicole Balnis, the President of SGA, stated, “We no longer have our general meetings. We will still be having our Town Hall meetings [no set dates], and the Dean of Students, Abby van Vlerah, will be having a table in Hillwood once a week [so that students can] come voice [their] opinions and concerns.” Going forward, SGA will only hold mandatory meetings when it makes sense.
The make-up of the executive board of SGA will change as well. “In the past, it’s been a few senators, a president, a vice president, a trea- surer [a parliamentarian, senators, and a few committee positions.] This year, student government offers more positions,” Berthel said.
The current SGA board, elected by past members of SGA and other voters, consists of: Nicole Balnis, President; Kim Blaskey, Vice President; Jenna Maggio, Senate Advisor; Stephanie Fabrizio, Secre- tary; Brianna Pisano, Treasurer; Jonathan Chambers, Parliamentarian; Kherefa Parsons, Kristen Manno, Michael Grossman, Samantha Sterling, Taimur Bhudda, and Jackie Jurado, Senators.
Student government will also expand committee positions for residents, commuters, undergraduates and graduates alike. A commit- tee position allows a student to handle a certain job, be it transportation, food, or campus activities, and hear student concerns related to their po- sition. They act as a representative for the students speaking to a proper authority, like dining services or administration, so that the concerns can be addressed. The new position of class president will also be added to SGA, allowing student representation from freshmen to the graduate level.
There will be new opportunities to run and vote for each SGA po- sition. SGA is interested in holding student elections each spring and fall semester to generate more participation in the process, and to allow students to get a feel for the people who will represent them. Those in- terested can hold their positions for a semester and are then welcome to run again. The idea is that the elections will generate more publicity, and thus students would be more willing to participate in student govern- ment meetings and events.
An important function of student government is hosting town hall meetings, which allows the entire campus community to come to- gether to speak to university officials about any concerns or requests to improve campus life. In the past, town hall meetings were held once or twice a semester, and were not very well advertised.
Berthel intends to have more town hall meetings per semester, so students feel as though they are being heard. Berthel said if students want something, they feel passionate about something, or want to ad- vocate a certain service on campus, they are welcome to come to the meetings or general SGA meetings, and voice those concerns. No town hall meeting has been held yet this semester according to Balnis, and the dates have yet to be set in stone.
Berthel also intends to streamline the process for starting a club, making it simpler and more hands on for interested students. In the past, a student interested in starting a club had to answer questions about their intentions to start a club at three SGA meetings in a row, fill out a variety of forms, and secure a location before they could even hold a club meeting. The lengthy process has now been expedited: students interested in starting a new club on campus will be able to talk to SGA representatives, and be led through the processes of becoming a student leader.
“We go to different club meetings and let them know if they need us,” said Samantha Sterling, a senator representing the transfer student community. “There is a month-long trial period, and the student reports back to [us to] show their progress,” Sterling added. “The SGA sends its senators to potential club meetings to get a feel for how the clubs are run. This way, the students are able to have an experience running meet- ings, advertising, holding events and fundraising; all components of a successful club.”
Berthel stated that these changes in SGA will not happen over- nigh, but will come in time. “I am very excited about all of SGAs chang- es,” Balnis said. “We are creating a new, better SGA that will hopefully make a better experience for everyone on campus. As President, I want everyone to know that I will always be available for anyone who wants to speak their voice. That is my job, to work for the students.”
SGA meets on Tuesdays at 5:30 p.m. in the Hillwood Commons Cinema. SGA representatives can answer any student concerns and questions. All students are welcome to attend, and are free to contact SGA at liupost.sga@gmail.com.

Everyone has a daily routine they commit themselves to in the morning before leaving their dorm or home, whether it’s a cup of coffee before a shower or reading the paper after rolling out of bed. For many people, the hardest part of the morning is finding something to wear. Coordinating the “best” outfit of the day can take a great deal of time and effort. For women, making sure your shoes match your bag and the color of your new fall sweater compliments the pattern in your shirt takes great diligence. Then there are those individuals who couldn’t care less whether their shirt matches their pants, and more about just get- ting through the day so that they can get back in their pajamas to catch an episode of Greys Anatomy. To alleviate all of this stress: should there be a dress code for students to abide by at school? Paul Quinn College located in Dallas, Texas has a strict dress code to ensure students are always “career ready.” From 8 a.m. to 5.30p.m., students at Paul Quinn College are dressed business causal. Students that take night classes are also subject to this rule. Articles of clothing such as hats, hoods, do-rags or skull caps are forbidden in campus buildings.
LIU Post students and faculty generally claim that students should be free to wear whatever they want to school, ensuring their comfort.
Khadija Greenidge, a junior Business Administration and Marketing major, is not favor of a dress code at Post. “College is a place of freedom, not confinement,” she said. Students are supposed to be individuals. Enforcing a dress code limits a student’s expression and creativity. “Besides, I don’t like wearing the same thing every day,” Greenidge added. Students should be able to express themselves however they see it best. The choice in wardrobe is a perfect example of such expression.
There are some students, though, who would not mind the enforcement of a dress code at Post. Amanda Kloos, a senior Music major and a desk attendant at the concierge as well as at both Post Hall and the Suites, said, “Uniforms should be enforced while classes are in session.” Uniforms suggest unity in a school and do not single anybody out. Dress code is representative of your position and status. It shows that you are always career ready, that any given moment you can be interviewed for a position. It makes you feel good. “Being a well-known school, it gives a bad name to the school when represented poorly by bad clothing.” A dress code shows prestige and honor for what it is you are a part of.
Kloos believes that dress codes help students concentrate in class. “It helps concentration in class, instead of focusing on somebody’s appearance,” she said. “There is no way I will be focused if a buff guy walks into class with a tank top on. I’ll be focused on the buff guy in the tank top rather than what the professor is saying.”
Professors also have opinions on a dress code at Post. Dante Moratto, a professor in the department of Media Arts, said, “I have no issue with the way Post students dress. Students should be aware and respectable of their surroundings. Students know to limit their dress code to a certain degree when attending school. There is a level of modesty expected from students and apparel when attending class.”
I feel that there is no need for a dress code at Post. Students should recognize that they attend a university of prestige and should dress accordingly. Students should dress as if they are going into their occupation every day. This prepares them for what is to come in their near future.

Ebola outbreaks in west Africa have been on the rise since September. The first travel-associated case of Ebola was diagnosed in the U.S. on Sept. 30. The question is: are we prepared to fight Ebola?
After the initial onslaught of Ebola, Vines about how we should protect ourselves from this epidemic are becoming viral (pun intended). Some make the situation light by wearing a bodysuit, gas mask, and lighting a flame in front of a coughing friend. But, these Viners makes us question: how far do we actually have to go to ensure Ebola doesn’t spread in America and, more specifically, at LIU?
Medical doctors have recently been removed from campus—so, we can only hope that NYIT is taking proper measurements to prevent the spread of Ebola cases for both schools. Secondly, there is no effective vaccine against the disease. What is there left for LIU to do? For starters, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests educational institutions temporarily refrain from sending their students to Ebola-inflicted regions of west Africa. Whether you are studying abroad or spending spring vacation in west Africa, you are putting yourself and the United States at risk. You might not even be around Ebola patients, however, one encounter with any medical attendant in these regions might just be your ticket to an Ebola malady.
What do we do if an LIU student was in west Africa over the past month? If so, a nurse or doctor must look for symptoms of Ebola in the LIU traveler. Seeing that we don’t have a doctor on campus, it would be difficult for LIU to diagnose a student. Nevertheless, LIU would probably send all students who traveled to west Africa down the road to NYIT, where, hopefully, the institution would put the LIU student in a private room to be further studied.
The point is, LIU is not prepared for Ebola. College campuses see an influx of students from all around the world—including resident students who travel abroad to all countries. There is a possibility that someone at LIU recently went to an outbreak country, but LIU wouldn’t know how to diagnose the person because we don’t have medical staff aware of all aspects of Ebola including how to deal with an Ebola patient, and we are not educating the students about it. It’s as if LIU is relying on NYIT to take care of any cases of Ebola between BOTH schools. A suggestion to LIU is to educate the students by sending email blasts about possible symptoms and how to report symptoms if you had traveled to regions where Ebola cases have been reported.
Additionally, LIU can post information (including medical assistance hotlines) in the dorms and around the buildings with recommendations for anyone who went to one of the countries. The last thing LIU can do is suspend all study abroad opportunities to outbreak countries. These are necessary precautions for any university to take, and I think it is the right step forward for LIU in the fight against Ebola.

“I’ve seen Chinese, Japanese, English, Welsh, Indian, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Spanish, Italian and a student from Australia. This shows the diversification of students at Post, allowing a multi-cultured vibe and atmosphere anywhere you go on campus.” Sound familiar? Well this was actually from my first column I wrote for The Pioneer and not only do these different nationalities bring a diversification of languages, but they also bring multiple cultures.
We international students aren’t just a pain in the bum, a nuisance with language barriers (which I spoke about last week), and people who dress funky. No! We actually bring different philosophies, crazy beliefs and courageous ideas, which Americans may not have experienced or known about. In fact, it’s not only Americans who may not have been exposed to these overseas ideologies or notions; it’s the international students as well. I have been amazed at the ways of living and everything that goes with a person who has lived in a place you’ve never been before. This is what I wanted to explore this week.
As I explained last week, discovering  different ‘lingos’ and words from different people of many origins has been fascinating so far, but this week I am going to go more into what cultural benefits have migrated with the internationals, and what has already been imbedded with the American culture. For example, my good friend Dusan Gargurevich, a senior soccer player from Quito, Ecuador, took me to a pizza restaurant in Glen Cove during my second week of being in the might county of Nassau. This meant that I hadn’t yet tried this Yankee adopted delicacy—pizza. I went in as a boy and returned a man, who loved every part of his 20 minutes in there… I have never been the same since. And, I have my Ecuadoran friend to thank for this.
Being exposed to these vast numbers of different cultures and beliefs at LIU, to me, is not a burden in the slightest. I am lucky enough to be part of an amazing and courageous group of lads that is the LIU Post men’s soccer team, with a huge number of different nationalities. I have been able to witness many different cultural experiences, which I could never have imagined unless I made that huge step over the ‘pond’. There are some interesting parts of playing on a team where there are two Welshman…Tom Bowen, a graduate student, and Jason Lampkin, a freshman student (who, by the way, I mentioned last week). Their banter is incredibly weak, and to me it can be embarrassing. No. I am just joking. If I didn’t have these guys, whom could I fall back to on a day-to-day basis?
The men’s soccer team, renowned for their stunning looks, fantastic soccer ability, and their Scandinavians. Since I have been here, the Norwegian, Swedish and, I guess, Icelandic (but if you asked the Scando’s they wouldn’t say Iceland is part of their region in Europe!) have been great at teaching me a few of their ways, some of their dialogue and their music, which at first I was reluctant to hear.
A few of the boys took me to a concert in the city not too long ago to see a DJ called Kygo. As you would guess, I wasn’t at the time terribly interested in going, but I went anyway, with an open mind. We got into the venue and there was a resident DJ playing. I thought, “Hey…this isn’t too bad.” As the night went on, they began to announce the arrival of Kygo… he started to play and I was ecstatic; the music was incredible, I completely loved it (and I must admit I did cut a few shapes!). Ever since that day, I haven’t stopped listening to it, and if I am going to be totally honest, I will tell my friends back in England about this guy and claim I found, “a great DJ, from Norway!!!”
Another delicacy these well-dressed, well-mannered and well-groomed Scandinavian gentlemen have introduced to me is the ‘Marabou, Mjolk Choklad,’ which to all English-speaking people is known as milk chocolate. Alfred Lindberg, a junior International Business major and my house mate, showed me this chocolate, and as soon as I tried it, I was instantly hooked. I have bought it every week I have been here, and if I run out of it, I completely panic! If you want to try this phenomenal Swedish heaven, you can get it at Ikea (p.s. I would definitely suggest it!)
So, the reason that I have shared these great stories of my experiences with different cultures is to show you guys how I have embraced every moment and every type of culture this school and this journey has to offer. Make sure you get to grips with how other international students, as well as how these wacky Americans, live. You will become a better, more well-rounded and multi-cultured person!

On Wednesday, Oct. 15, Michelle D’Errico, a senior Art Education major, will hold a reception in the Student Art League’s gallery for her exhibition, “Now You See.” The artist will hang up her controversial colored pencil drawings of physically and emotionally abused children, hoping her audience will become more aware of the growing domestic issue. “I’m trying to put people face to face with abuse so they’re forced to see something that has become a huge issue, instead of ignoring it,” D’Errico said.
D’Errico mentioned the fact that the United States has one of the worst child abuse records among industrialized nations, with more than four children dying every day, according to Childhelp’s national child abuse statistics from 2012. “Kids are so defenseless, and are often kept quiet by those who abuse them. They need somebody to speak up for them, so that’s what I’m trying to do,” D’Errico said.
During the reception, D’Errico will be collecting donations for the Women of Substance—an organization specializing in domestic violence and child abuse awareness and prevention. She hopes to inspire students, not daunt them, with her straightforward depictions. “I know that some of my drawings might make people uncomfortable because they’re literally drawings of children that have been abused, but I think sometimes that’s what it takes to make people do something.” She added, “Students might learn that they, too, can make a difference if they feel passionate about a social issue.”
The reception will be held from 5 p.m. – 8 p.m. Entrance is free.

“Camp X-Ray” is a controversial film about a young woman, Amy Cole (Kristen Stewart), and her quest to leave her small town lifestyle for something bigger. She joins the military in search of a greater purpose in life, but she then ends up as a military guard at the Camp X-Ray temporary detention facility in Guantanamo Bay. Cole finds herself surrounded by violent and harsh soldiers, as well supposed terrorists awaiting their fates. All of these prisoners have been at the prison for at least eight years.
The film opens on a scene of the Twin Towers burning from the tragic 9/11 terrorists attacks that permanently scarred the memories of the American people. The opening was strategic to the context of the film, as “Camp X-Ray” plays on both sides of the political spectrum—the U.S. government and the alleged “terrorists.” It is interesting that Cole’s first line in the film is in response to her superior officer, stating that the prisoners were not prisoners, but in fact “detainees” since they were not subject to the Geneva Convention, or the rights that it provides.
Cole undergoes a spiritual transformation when she meets one of the inmates named Ali (Payman Maadi). He is a detainee from Germany who, according to him, is not like the other guys—he is a good guy. Cole develops a strong bond with this prisoner, all the while gaining an insider’s perspective on the whole ethical situation of Guantanamo Bay.
Stewart does a fairly good job of portraying her character in “Camp X-Ray.” A deliberate attempt is made for her to be as androgynous as possible—she looks like the epitome of a tomboy. Her hair is worn in a bun, and she is seldom shown as feminine, except during a few scenes. In general, Stewart normally plays stoic roles, so she was cast perfectly here. Maadi was a great choice for the character Ali because of certain innate, likable qualities about him—even though he was a detainee and may have committed wrongdoings, viewers find themselves rooting for the good guy in Ali.
“Camp X-Ray” does a fabulous job in recreating Guantanamo Bay—it is really believable as a functioning prison, down to the outdoor showers and prison cells. A viewer can get lost in the movie, sometimes forgetting that is in fact a film. “Camp X-Ray” did stand out for me—I think that it had just a bit of everything: believability, occasional humor, and a decent back-story in Cole’s case. The film is successful in providing the viewer a real experience of what it would be like being a guard at Guantanamo Bay; I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in military-centered movies.
“Camp X-Ray” has some surprise twists and turns that you would not expect. The movie comes out in theaters and on video-on-demand on Oct. 17. Rating: A.

The Hutchins Gallery, located in the lower level of LIU Post’s B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, has several exhibitions planned for this year, ranging from works by the Art department students and faculty, to the art works of various outside artists. It is free for LIU students to visit and explore the world of art.
The current exhibitions, on display from Oct. 5 to the 30, are called “Myths of Man” and “New Contemporary Charcoal Painted Portraits” by Larry Aarons, a native New Yorker from the Bronx who works with graphite, pastels, and charcoals. Aarons has been honored with many industry awards, never abandoning his love for art. “Myths of Man,” his largest exhibition to date with over 40 pieces, shows a series of pastels that depict Greek, Roman, and African gods, as well as mythological characters.
“New Contemporary Charcoal Painted Portraits” will be a continuing evolution of “Myths of Man,” but with newer charcoal drawings. The contemporary portraits also feature a distinctive technique, which gives the effect of different skin tones looking the same at a close view.
Patricia Simpson, the administrative assistant and person in charge of the Hutchins Gallery, spoke enthusiastically about the gallery and all it has to offer. “Every year we keep [the gallery] open for [Art students’ thesis work], in November and December and in April and May. After that, it’s whoever calls or wants to come in. There is a small fee for outside artists [to portray their work, but] there are no fees for our students.”
Simpson further explained the process of selecting the artwork of an outside artist: “The library’s dean office is the one responsible for keeping track of who’s in or wants to come in [to show their work]. It usually passes through Valeda Dent (Dean, University Libraries), and [she] will then ask them to send some information on the organization, maybe some samples of the artwork, and she would say okay as long as it doesn’t interfere with the Art department.”
While the process for the outside artist is a little longer, Art department students can easily have their work displayed. “We look at their work, [and] if we feel it’s nice enough [we’ll feature it in the gallery.” Simpson continued, “We don’t want anything crazy or offensive. Usually we don’t have anything like that. Let’s say someone comes in for next June and [the gallery’s] open, more than likely they would get accepted. Each student’s work is usually in [after] about a week.”
The Hutchins Gallery is open from Tuesday to Saturday, 2 p.m. – 5 p.m., and offers free admission, unless holding special events.

The LIU Post men’s soccer team (8-3-1) returned to action on Wednesday, Oct. 8, when they took on the Wilmington University Wildcats from Newark, Del. The two sides played spectacular defense for the 90 minutes, allowing only seven and three shots on goal respectively. One goal was all that was needed to decide the winner.
After a scoreless 30 minutes of action, the Pioneers were awarded a free kick from just outside the box. The shot was deflected by a Wildcat defender and senior forward Eivind Austboe was in the right place at the right time. The leading scorer for the Pioneers added another goal to his stat line, giving the Pioneers a 1-0 lead in the process.
The Pioneer defense stood strong throughout the entire match, allowing 14 shots, but only three of which were on target. Junior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom kept the opponents out of the net and earned his fifth shutout of the season.
The Pioneers returned to Brookville, N.Y., on Saturday, Oct. 11, to play host to the Purple Knights from the University of Bridgeport (4- 5-0). The Green and Gold wasted little time getting going offensively, striking in the 15th minute. The teamwork from graduate midfielder Dale McDonald and junior midfielder Per Forgaard allowed for Austboe to get open in enemy territory and get the Pioneers on the board. The goal gave the Pioneers the early lead, one they didn’t relinquish.
Late in the second half, the Pioneers added to their lead with a goal in the 87th minute. With help from graduate midfielder Tom Bowen, junior forward Alfred Lindberg found the back of the net for his first goal of the season. The two-goal lead was more than enough for the Pioneers, as they went on to win by that score.
The Pioneer defense stood strong all afternoon, allowing a measly five shots for the entire match, three of which were on target. The visitors from Connecticut never attempted a corner kick and had a hard time getting going offensively. Malmstrom recorded back-to-back shutouts for the second time this season while the Pioneers now own a four-game winning streak, the team’s longest of the season so far.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his squad return to action on Saturday, Oct. 18, when they travel to Pennsylvania to do battle with the Rams from Philadelphia University. Kickoff is slated for 2.30 p.m.

Coming off their dominant performance against Cannoneers from Pratt Institute on Friday, Oct. 3, the Pioneer tennis team looked to continue its stellar play on Thursday, Oct. 9, when visiting Philadelphia. The Pioneers claimed two out of three doubles matches, as well as four out of six singles matches, en route to their 6-3 victory over the Tigers from Holy Family University.
Juniors Didi Fatchikova and Lucie Chrastecka won in straight sets, each still owning perfect records in singles competition this season. The two later paired up and defeated the Tigers 8-2 in their doubles match. Of all their matches this season, the pair has only lost once. The two are also playing their best when it counts the most, as they are undefeated in conference matches in both singles and doubles play.
Sophomore Laura Harwell cruised in her two-set victory, while fellow sophomore Heena Kewalramani battled junior Alina Nersesyan. The sophomore showed her toughness after dropping the first set, coming back to win the next two sets by a score of 6-4 and 12-10. The sophomore duo kept their momentum going in their doubles match, cruising to an 8-1 victory.
With the non-conference win, the Pioneers improve their overall record to 6-2 and have now won two straight. Five of the six Pioneer victories have come by three points or more, showing what kind of season they are having. In the East Coast Conference standings, they are now looking up at two teams, both of which are undefeated.
Head Coach Darrel Bielawski and his team are back in action on Friday, Oct. 17, when they face the Lions from Molloy College. The matches are set to begin at 3 p.m. at West Hempstead, N.Y.

Trailing 25-21 with under a minute remaining, red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino fired the game-winning two-yard touchdown pass to red-shirt sophomore wide receiver Shane Hubbard to seal the football team’s 28-25 come-from-behind victory against the Stonehill College Skyhawks on Saturday, Oct. 11, in Brookville, N.Y.
The game-winning drive began at the Pioneers’ 35-yard line. A crucial pass interference penalty against the visitors put the Green and Gold in excellent field position at the Stonehill 38-yard line with 2:03 left of the game. Laurino completed all four of his passes in that series, resulting in a two-yard lob hauled in by Hubbard for the game-winning score with 22 seconds left. The Boise native also took four keepers for 15 yards. Red-shirt sophomore running back Mike Williams picked up eight yards on a screen pass to set up LIU Post (4-2) at the 7-yard line.
Although the Pioneers trailed the entire first half, they scored a big momentum booster touchdown before halftime. Down by 10 late in the first half, freshman defensive lineman Kevin Petit-Frere strip-sacked sophomore quarterback Tom Sydeski right after the Pioneers committed their second turnover of the contest. Red-shirt senior defensive lineman Dan Belfiore recovered the loose ball at the Skyhawks 20-yard line.
Five plays later, Laurino hooked up with junior tight end Sean Binckes on a three-yard touchdown pass, making it a 10-7 game. Binckes had a star-studded day, catching 11 passes for a team-leading 103 yards. The Skyhawks added a field goal to their lead via junior kicker Steve Grzwacz on their first drive of the second half, making the score 13-7.
However, the Pioneers responded with a vengeance, scoring 14 unanswered points to grab a 21-13 lead with 11:16 remaining in the final frame. The first of the two scores came off a Laurino 20-yard strike to Hubbard on the hosts’ first possession of the half. Two drives later, Laurino staged a stellar 17-play, 85-yard offensive assault leading to his two-yard scramble into the end zone.
The Skyhawks refused to go down without a fight, as they picked up touchdowns on each of their next two possessions to regain the lead 25-21. A six-yard dash by junior tailback Deontae Ramey-Doe put the Skyhawks back on top with 2:50 remaining in regulation.
Laurino then pieced together his fourth game-winning drive of the season, and the Pioneers defense won it from there. With 16 seconds to go, Sydesky had the ball jarred loose by senior defensive lineman David Sumpter. Belfiore recovered his second fumble of the game to put the icing on the cake. The fifth-year senior completed 24-of-41 passes for 216 yards and three touchdowns. He added a game-high 90 yards rushing to his stellar outing. Williams had 15 carries for 56 yards while Hubbard hauled in four catches for 42 yards in addition to his two touchdown receptions.
On defense, red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti had a team-high 12 takes while red-shirt junior linebacker Brandon Cheney recorded 10 stops. Belfiore and senior defensive back Roger Hamilton collected six tackles apiece.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers return to action next Saturday, Oct. 18, when they host the Hawks from Saint Anselm College at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium for Homecoming. The Northeast-10 Conference clash between the second-place teams is slated to begin at 1 p.m.

After a plentiful weekend with two hectic games, Post Pride and Senior Day, the Green Machine continued its winning streak and is undefeated at home dating back the last two seasons.
On Thursday, Oct. 9, the guests from Wilmington University overwhelmed the Pioneers only minutes into the game, as sophomore goalkeeper Hrafnhildur Agnarsdottir mistimed a cross that got deflected in by Wilmington forward Lorah Wyrough. The early lead for the guests signaled the end of a four-game shutout streak for the Icelandic keeper.
Windy weather conditions tempted less people than usual to visit the new Pioneer Soccer Park, and it seemed as if the support would have been needed. Offensively, the team had a hard time creating any sort of goal-scoring opportunities; any individual attempt was blown away, and the guests were about to go to half time with their heads held high.
However, with 10 minutes left of the half, junior midfielder Morgan Miller and senior forward Lauren Bellone started to string some passes together, and successfully locked up the visitors defensive chain. Bellone, on the left wing, sent a cross that eventually landed before junior forward Susanne Vistnes’ feet. The Pioneers were back in the game as it was tied at one.
The goal gave the team new energy, as only minutes later the Miller-Bellone combination showed its efficiency again. Miller played a through-ball to Bellone, who won her battle against the last defender on the left hand side, and fed Vistnes in the box for her second goal and the 2-1 lead.
In the second half, Wilmington was forced to step forward when looking for the equalizer, which gave the Pioneer offense space for counter attacks. Vistnes had one that nailed the crossbar, and one free kick just outside the far post, but failed to find the back of the net. However she finally recorded the hat-trick with 10 minutes left, after yet another assist from Bellone.
Two minutes later, senior defender Morgan Kitton stormed forward on the left wing, beating her defender, and managed a finish in the far top corner to make it 4-1.
On Saturday, Oct. 11, the stands were again packed for the Post Pride game against the rivals from Bridgeport, a game to tribute the seniors whose time in Green and Gold is coming to an end.
The Purple Knights from Bridgeport had a lot to say in the first half of the game, and also found the net first. With just about four minutes left on the scoreboard, a corner was boxed away by Agnarsdottir, but right in the gap of the Purple Knights’ Lauren Bengel, who headed it back passed the keeper.
In the second half, the Pioneers came out stronger and found the net early on to get back in the game. Kitton was assisted by Vistnes to make it one apiece. Only 10 minutes later, Kitton gave back the gesture by feeding Vistnes who went on a roll with the defenders before battling in the 2-1-decider.
For the remaining part of the game, the Pioneer back line worked hard to deny the Purple Knights from getting another chance to score. Those few times they did not succeed, Agnarsdottir kept it clean, marking a season-high of five saves.
Head Coach Mark Dawson and his team will face Dowling next on Wednesday, Oct. 15. The game is set to start at 3.30 p.m.
