After scoring two goals and helping the Sharks shutout the Bryant University Bulldogs 2-0 on Monday, Oct. 28, men’s soccer freshman forward, Papa Ndoye was named NEC Co-Rookie of the Week for the second time this season. 
Ndoye is proud to be recognized in this regard, but also humbly admits that everything he does on the field is for the betterment of the team. “Soccer is a collective sport,” Ndoye said. “Every time I’m on the field, I try to do my best to help my team, so if I have the privilege to be noticed in that collective, it’s always a pleasure.”
The rookie continued his scoring streak on Friday, Nov. 1 against Robert Morris University by adding one goal to the board in the 3-0 victory. 
With a total of seven goals so far this season, the freshman plays an important role on the Shark’s offensive end. “If he [Ndoye] can start scoring in bunches, we’ll make a nice little run. We have a better chance,” Head Coach Michael Mordocco said.
With one game left in the season, the Sharks have clinched an NEC playoff spot, becoming the second Shark team to appear in the NEC championship tournament. The Sharks will play their first playoff game on Friday, Nov. 15, with the location and opponent to be announced. 
Ndoye is very excited about his team’s chances in the playoffs and the possibilities of them winning the tournament. “I will be really proud for the team because it’s our first season and making that performance will be just incredible.”
This is a year of firsts for the Rookie of the Week. It is Ndoye’s first NEC tournament appearance and his first time playing soccer in America. Ndoye is an African native from Mbour, Senegal. He said the transition to America and the differences from home are things he had to go through and experience to be “a proper soccer player.” He said that no matter where he goes, it’s imperative that he adopts the style of play, no matter the city, state or country.
Ndoye was introduced to Coach Mordocco by a friend from home who played with Mordocco in college at the University of Connecticut. Ndoye’s favorite thing about LIU is getting to play soccer every day. “Soccer is my passion,” he said.
Ndoye loves being a Shark as well. “It gives me more energy I can say, every time I hear the name ‘LIU Sharks,’ I feel strong and [powerful].” 
Ndoye and the men’s soccer team play their last regular season game against St. Francis Brooklyn at home on Sunday, Nov. 10 at 1 p.m.

With a 1-0 win over Bryant University on Sunday, Oct. 27, the field hockey team secured their spot in the Northeast Conference championship tournament and became the first team in program history to reach playoffs.   
Freshman forward Felicia King scored the game’s only goal, sending the Sharks to the postseason. After having two assists this year, King was excited to find the back of the net and score her first collegiate goal. “To be honest, it means a lot to me and the team as well that we won that game, and it was really important to me that I got my first goal,” she said. 
As a first-year Division I program, Head Coach Raenee Savin said she is happy with the way her team has competed and the way they handled the transition from Division II to Division I. “We began not knowing how we’d perform at the Division I level, but we’re now finding ourselves entering into postseason play in our first year,” she said.
Going into the tournament, Coach Savin says she is excited and expects the whole team to give everything they have. “Playoff time is when everyone needs to come up big,” she said. “Everyone needs to be on their best play on the postseason because every game can be your last.”
Junior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis is optimistic regarding the team’s chances in the playoffs, saying the team has been strong defensively. “It is difficult to score against us so we are very confident,” she said. 
Senior midfielder and captain Taylor Brodsky also has a lot of anticipation, knowing she has a chance to win a Division I title in her last season. Brodsky won two conference championship titles with the Pioneers in 2016 and 2017, and she looks forward to playing a championship tournament once again. 
“I am really excited and I didn’t expect our season to be as successful as it is, but I’m really proud of our team and excited to go to a conference championship again,” she said 
The field hockey NEC championship tournament will be played on Friday, Nov. 8 and on Sunday, Nov 10 at Wagner College in Staten Island.

“Maleficent Mistress of Evil” was released on Oct. 18, 2019. Maleficent is portrayed as the villain in the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty. However, Maleficent’s character takes a turn for the benevolent in this adventure where she figures out where she came from, stops a war and saves the Moors. 
In addition to that, Maleficent’s goddaughter Aurora, gets engaged to Prince Philip and she gains new family, including an evil mother in law, Queen Ingrith, who wants to start a war against the Moors. In the end, both Aurora and Maleficent learn about family and how adopted family is equally as important as family bound by blood. 
This film is filled with dark imagery and the depiction of Maleficent as evil. Yet again Disney surprises us and continues to show her as a heroine. 
The CGI (computer generated imagery) in this movie is absolutely breathtaking as Disney shows us lifelike landscape and makes the Tomb Bloom flowers appear to glow. Also, the CGI brings some of the smaller characters to life as well, such as how the quills on the small hedgehog fairy character move with lifelike realism. When the CGI combines with how the rest of the film was directed, it makes you feel like you were a fairy watching everything go down. It feels very organic as it further immerses viewers into the movie.
The storytelling is absolutely beautiful, while the dialogue is minimal. It shows the relationship between characters without having to flesh out a long back story. The dichotomy of words also makes this movie far more realistic, as opposed to a traditional Disney movie which usually has a large monologue explaining things. Without those monologues, it makes this movie a lot easier to follow and more memorable.
Angelina Jolie, who plays Maleficent in the film, makes an amazing performance with her naturalistic performance style. She adds to the character Maleficent by doing simple things. For example, Jolie, practices smiling when she meets her daughter’s potential mother-in-law, Queen Ingrith. It’s that moment where we see that Maleficent, despite her better judgement, wants to make her goddaughter happy. Jolie attempts to make Maleficent seem more relatable as Jolie picks a struggle most people can relate to: trying to impress family.
Michaela Fox, senior musical theatre major saw the film and had strong thoughts about it. “I remember the movie justifying Maleficent’s behavior. It successfully displayed the woman we all know as a classic villain as someone we could sympathize with,” she said. “I remember the movie bringing awareness to how we beautify or romanticize stories, especially throughout history for instance, and ignore the evil of the people we label as the ‘good guys’, even when it stands as the potential motivation of the evildoers.”

Three senior photography majors each have a collection of their photos lining the SAL gallery’s walls. Jessica Ciminelli, Crystal Gonzalez and Chris McMullan had a reception for their work on Wednesday, Oct. 30. 
Ciminelli’s collection “Out of Their Element” is a series of photos of sports and athletes, with a twist, “I photographed with different lightings, so it’s a little different from the usual field,” Ciminelli said. “I was an athlete myself in freshman year of college, so I feel the connection with athletes. I wanted to do something a little different than just shooting on the field, doing what they do.” 
When she is not taking classes, Ciminelli works as an assistant manager at Baseball Heaven in Yaphank, where she shot her photos.
Gonzalez’s collection “Blooming Fantasies” portrays colorful images of flowers, but the colors in the photos do not match the colors of the actual flowers. “I had done a process called solarization where you invert the colors,” Gonzales said. “The colors take people to a different dimension.” 
Like Ciminelli, Gonzalez works at Baseball Heaven as an editor and photographer. 
McMullan’s collection “The Way I See” took an approach that differed from Ciminelli and Gonzalez. McMullan did not set up his subjects, he simply photographed them. “It’s a series of images of my everyday life,” McMullan said. “You can make beautiful artwork no matter where you are. I wasn’t searching for anything.”    
Nikolas Kahl, an art education major and a friend of Gonzalez, attended the event. “To see it on the wall, it’s really awesome,” Kahl said.
Other visitors at the reception were there out of curiosity, like Gabby Carcamo, a photography major. “My professor told me about it,” Carcamo said. “I like the flowers.”
Allison Rufrano, a professor of photography, attended the reception as well. Rufrano had worked with Ciminelli, Gonzalez and McMullan. “I’m proud of all of them,” Rufrano said. “It’s a gift to work with these students, from their freshman year to this moment when they’re getting ready to graduate. I know they’ll go even further. They all worked really hard, and that’s what it takes.”

When attending a Broadway production, most audience members recall the stunning costumes, the impressive vocal range of the chorus and the Tony Award-winning acting in each performance. One of the most challenging and essential parts of musical theatre, however, comes from the choreographed dance numbers. Members of the Post Theatre Company will pay homage to the many choreographers who have had their work grace dozens of Broadway stages by putting on a dance cabaret recreating some of the most iconic dance numbers in Broadway history. The dance cabaret, Once More from the Top: A Tribute to Broadway Dance Legends, will feature seven famous pieces of choreography from shows including “Chorus Line,” “Oklahoma!,” ”West Side Story,” “Hamilton” and more. 
The cabaret is directed by Rachel Bertone, a new professor in musical theatre program who began in September 2019. Bertone, who taught musical theatre dance history for 10 years, came up with the idea for the cabaret with theatre professor David Hugo. “We will celebrate a few [choreographers] who have revolutionized the purpose of dance within the medium of musical theatre, and how their legacies continue to inspire the next generation,” she said.
The seven choreographers from past and present Broadway shows featured in the cabaret include: Agnes de Mille (“Oklahoma!”), Jerome Robbins (“West Side Story”), Bob Fosse (“Chicago”), Michael Bennett (“Chorus Line”), George Faison (“The Wiz”), Susan Stroman (“The Producers”) and Andy Blankenbuehler (“Hamilton”). There will be dozens of performances and videos of the choreographers explaining their styles. “The show is a very special thing and hopefully it will be [an] entertaining and educational night for the students and audience,” Bertone said. 
Twenty-one musical theatre students are involved in recreating the original choreography. Sarah Franklin, a senior musical theatre major, will perform “Music and Mirror” from “Chorus Line,” as a solo piece, among other numbers. “Chorus Line is all about the fight and drive that comes with the musical theatre world, and embodying that is difficult but incredibly rewarding,” Franklin said. The choreography is physically demanding, and did not come easily. “I cried a lot in the early stages of this process, but through the tears came more of a drive to push my body to its max,” she said. 
This is the first time PTC is producing a dance-heavy production, and for many students, this is the first time they have had to exert this much physical endurance and stamina in their performances. Sophomore musical theatre major, Ava Paul, is involved in several acts, including “Brigadoon,” “The Wiz,” “West Side Story” and others. “All of it is very challenging in their own ways,” Paul said. “Some are more athletic, some technical, or demand big energy.” 
“It is absolutely the most challenging and physically taxing choreography I have ever worked on,” said Michael Krebs, a junior musical theatre major who is performing several numbers from “On the Town,” “Hamilton,” “Chorus Line” and “Oklahoma!” The most exciting part, Krebs said, is knowing he is going to be challenged everyday. “This show really demonstrates the dance skill and technique I’ve accumulated over my few years here more than any other production I’ve been involved in. These are skills that are rarely seen on the PTC stage, as we’ve never really emphasized dance all too much,” he said. 
Bertone believes the cabaret is a great opportunity for students to be exposed to Broadway theatre dance. “It’s such a big dance show and they are doing some of the hardest choreo in the Broadway repertoire,” she said. The cabaret also showcases the students’ acting and singing skills. “They are seamlessly and cohesively putting all those skill sets together,” Bertone said. 
The students at PTC are some of the hardest working actors Bertone has ever worked with. They rehearse for 24 hours (six days) a week for whatever show they are a part of. For the cabaret, that is 24 hours of intense dance training in addition to the regular dance and physical acting classes they take. “I walk by the studio and see them working on something, either from my show or something else, and they are so passionate and hungry to learn,” Bertone said. 
The students enjoy working with Bertone too. “I felt so blessed to have her in my life,” Paul said. “I don’t think she realizes how much this process means to all of us. We get to learn pieces that have been up for years that not everyone gets to learn. It’s truly a dream.”
“Rachel Bertone is a rockstar,” Franklin said. “She is intense, but that is because she expects the best from us and she is so incredibly passionate about her work. She wants nothing more than to see us succeed.”
Once More from the Top: a Tribute to Broadway’s Dance Legends will run November 8 to 9 and 14 to 16 at 7:30 p.m., and November 10 and 17 at 3 p.m. on the Little Theater mainstage. General admission is $15, $12 for seniors, and $10 for students. Tickets can be purchased at www.tix55.com/ptc700, or at the Little Theater box office.

It may seem like a professor’s work is never done, but Dr. Scott Carlin, associate professor of geography, takes that premise to another level. In addition to teaching classes on campus, he also recently organized a conference with the United Nations to work towards creating a more sustainable future.
The conference took place in Salt Lake City, Utah from Aug. 26-28. The conference was hosted to discuss the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Created in 2015, the SDGs are a set of goals that would help solve many of the world’s problems if they are instituted. They include ending world hunger, ensuring that children receive a quality education and ending gender inequality.
The main focus of the conference was the 11th SDG: creating sustainable cities and communities. One method for creating a sustainable city is to ensure that accessibility is a priority when constructing buildings, according to Carlin. “If people have disabilities, like walking disabilities, a building should be made so people who are handicapped have proper access to buildings,” he said.
Carlin was one of the co-chairs of the Thematic Sessions planning committee. When organizing sessions, Carlin needed to make sure there was equal representation among the speakers. “We needed to have speakers that represented a large range of different countries, different ages, and different aspects of the problem,” he said.
Carlin is also attempting to get the UN to recognize a day dedicated to the education of global citizenship. Global citizenship is the idea that people should look past their country’s borders and be aware of how their actions affect the world. “We are arguing that [it’s] a really important way to get more attention focused on these global goals and bring them into the school system,” he said. Carlin also hopes to have students work towards solving problems regarding climate change, as well as address what work they can do in their own communities.
Carlin wants students on campus to know they are able to attend different events hosted by the United Nations. LIU will also be awarding two students UN badges, allowing them to access to UN events and buildings. Interested students should contact Carlin at Scott.Carlin@liu.edu for more information.

 Editor’s Note: Josephine Rerecich is the copyeditor for the Pioneer.
Students have mixed feelings about the university’s efforts in addressing their concerns of the mold growing in their residence buildings, specifically those living in Kings Hall and the South Residence Complex (SRC). 
Mold has been an issue in Kings Hall since the beginning of the fall semester. As previously reported by The Pioneer, two students, including freshman biology major Rabecca Baez, moved out of their residence building and into Nassau Hall because of their concerns about the mold. Her previous resident director Maegen Wallaker submitted a work order to facilities services to address the situation.
After the meeting between Baez and Wallaker, apparent changes were made in the laundry room which is one of the locations many students expressed concerns about. “The mold had been fixed by them removing [it] and then repainting the laundry room,” said Isabella Saljanin, a freshman nursing major who lives in Kings Hall.
Freshman forensic science major, Trisha Norwood, another Kings Hall resident, was aware of the changes in the laundry room as well; however, she’s wary of the possibility that the mold will return. “My RA told us that the mold issue has been fixed but even if it has, it’ll come back. The laundry room is so moist and some of the pipes are fixed with duct tape. There’s constant leaking. It didn’t surprise me mold was an issue after having to go in there weekly,” she said.
Other students living in Kings, like BrayLynn Willis, a freshman musical theatre major, weren’t aware of mold in the laundry room. “I haven’t noticed any mold but I also haven’t heard much about whether people’s concerns have been addressed,” she said.
Despite Wallaker’s order request, it took facilities weeks to address and fix the mold growing in the laundry room of Kings. The situation in the South Resident Complex (SRC) was handled in a much different manner.
Josephine Rerecich, a second year graduate student majoring in library and information science, resides in the 21-and-over section of SRC. On Oct. 24, one of the empty rooms in her suite was inspected for mold by one of the RAs on duty. “[The RA] said she saw no mold in there, and as an afterthought, I pointed out the damage on the living room ceiling,” Rerecich said.
For surfaces such as ceiling tiles which are typically in temperatures ranging between 40 and 100 degrees, and with moisture supplied by the conditioned air in the building or by leaks from roofs or mechanical systems, conditions are ripe for the growth of mold.
Initially, Rerecich thought the two tiles on her living room ceiling were simply water damaged. After she brought the issue to the RAs attention, she was informed that the tiles actually had a “bit of mold” on them. A day later, on Oct. 25, “two men came in to replace the ceiling tiles with the damage on it,” Rerecich said. 
Despite the similarities, the mold in the laundry room of Kings didn’t get resolved for weeks, whereas the mold in Rerecich’s situation got resolved within a day. It is unclear why the time it took to fix these situations differs and what the criteria is to prioritize one issue over the other.
The Pioneer attempted to reach Wallaker at the office of Campus Life for comment. A representative said that she no longer works for the university and declined the paper’s request to speak with someone else regarding the matter. Roy Fergus, director of facilities, was unable to be reached for comment.

Members of the Pioneer editorial board attended the National College Media convention hosted by the College Media Association and the Associated College Press from Thursday, Oct. 31 to Sunday, Nov. 3 in Washington D.C. 
A total of 1,600 attendees from both public and private college and university publications across the country, including advisors and student editors, had the opportunity to attend a variety of informative panels. 
They also had the chance to listen to several keynote speakers at the event, including Marty Baron, the executive editor of the Washington Post, Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio, Abby D. Phillip, political correspondent for CNN and Rick Hutzell, editor-in-chief of the Capital Gazette. 
Some of the most valuable panels we attended gave insight on how to improve your own publication. We learned tips ranging from teaching staff members and ourselves to edit our own work for the best quality and most accurate stories, to increasing readership through our newsletter (subscribe to LIUPioneerNewsletter@gmail.com). 
It was also a great opportunity to hear the opinions and experiences of other college editors going through similar motions as we are. We had a unique and enlightening “Editor Therapy” session, which allowed us to break down our tension and talk through problems collectively.              
One particularly helpful panel taught us how we can get inspiration for stories from just about anywhere even a phone book. We were tasked with coming up with three story ideas based on a random page from a phone book. This exercise gave a new perspective to newsgathering and inspired some new stories and themes for upcoming issues. 
Some panels we attended covered how to land a job in the media industry today. The panelists’ key advice was to build relationships and network with people within the field. Real workplace experience and passion for the profession are key to a successful career. 
Some best practices when entering the industry, whether it be for a local media organization, or one of the major organizations, is to say yes to every opportunity. Baron, from the Washington Post, said hiring managers look for journalists who are enthusiastic, energetic, creative and curious about the world.
The keynote speakers were from various branches of the industry, including local newspapers, large digital and print media, radio and television news. The theme that echoed from each speaker was that journalism is not a normal profession, and that we will witness things that are unnatural. “We have a front seat on life,” Hutzell said. Totenberg said journalism is the first draft of history. As journalists, we will witness life.
We gained new skills, strategies and tricks to develop as young journalists, but most importantly, we gained an understanding of the profession we have chosen. As journalists, we will put ourselves at risk sometimes. When everyone else runs from a scene, we will be running towards it. People will not always like us or what we write or say some people might even hate us. We will be put in uncomfortable situations. We will witness pain, fear and death. But we will also get to witness happiness, kindness and love. Despite it all, we persist.

Many of the basic understandings Americans have about the society they live in are rooted in dated practices that are not widely questioned or changed, even when those understandings negatively impact specific groups of people. In a meeting on Wednesday, Oct. 30, members of the predominantly African-American fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi sought to address topics students could find difficult to talk about publicly or without a safe space. 
Among the topics raised were double standards, racial inequality, and gender roles surrounding men and women. Both the president and vice president of the fraternity chapter prepared topics and scenarios for a crowd of more than a dozen attendees. Everyone who attended the event was black.
Attendees commented with their personal opinions on the matters discussed, from the perspectives of others in their respective gender. “I feel like everybody who has different perspectives will get another perspective on the topics, and you can see who is like-minded and who is not, and everyone can have a safe conversation about it,” senior graphic design major Jahrid Barker, president of LIU’s Kappa Alpha Psi chapter, said. 
“Only black people would come to this, but I wish there were more people that would come of different races, so we could get another side instead of just male and female,” freshman forensic science major Tyran Williams said.
Michael Bruny, senior business and sports management double major and vice president of the fraternity chapter, brought up commonly recognized double standards and gender stereotypes in today’s society. This included women living as housewives and men working to be the breadwinners of a household.
“If we’re going to get [gender roles] eliminated, there’s a positive and negative to everything. If you’re going to eliminate them for women, you should eliminate them for men, too. But that’s also going to be extremely negative, in my opinion,” SUNY Old Westbury student Daniel Warren said. Several scenarios were presented throughout the discussion. Some included relationship dynamics between heteronormative couples, such as why men are more frequently held accountable for dumping women. “My takeaway is that men and women both have issues with the other, and both of them have valid points. So both should be able to speak their piece,” Warren said.
Another of these scenarios was how society deems it acceptable for a woman’s cleavage to be displayed on a public advertisement, but shameful for a woman to breastfeed her infant in public. One female student commented, “It’s because women are so oversexualized that nature seems unnatural.”
Mike Lowery, who also attends SUNY Old Westbury, felt American society mirrored what nature has deemed appropriate in terms of childcare where gender roles are concerned. “I feel as if women are expected to [care for their children], biologically through nature,” he said. “The father goes and provides for the child and the mother. When the father steps up to do the role of a mother, he is praised by society for that reason. But I do also see the issue where women who take care of children by themselves don’t get that same recognition.” 
Attendees talked about matters of masculinity and femininity, such as whether men who express their emotions should be viewed as unmasculine or feminine. “I was raised to not show emotion because it looked less masculine, so I deal with a lot of stuff differently,” Terril Alexander, a graduate student studying criminal justice, said. “With emotions, I really tend to show none, even with losing loved ones.”
One question the members raised was whether the LGBTQ+ community is outpacing the black community in terms of movements for social equality. “The reason why we talk about race is because the LGBTQ+ community we see will get their agenda pushed forward before black people, and I pointed that out because LGBTQ+ people can still be white,” Warren said.
Talk of family matters also hinged on the topic of race. Several students at the discussion spoke of their Caribbean or Jamaican roots and households, while Williams talked about his experience growing up in Memphis Tenn. “That played into the talk today when we talked about how it’s seen as unmasculine to be gay, and how Caribbean people would disown them [family members],” Williams said. “That’s not really a thing where I’m from because most people just know that they’re black, they don’t know anything else. I thought that was really enlightening.”
“Race plays a factor [in creating a safe space] because if you see one black person talking about it, the next person will talk about it,” Barker said. “Race plays a role into what is said and how it’s said, but at the same time, it’s also the energy that the people who present [a discussion] bring to it.”
Regulating language and tone of voice are two things Barker considered important to creating a safe space. He previously gained experience in counseling from high school. “I worked side-by-side with my guidance counselor, so I got to see how she worked, and I helped her out with some situations,” he said.
Bruny also mediated the session. “My brother’s a counselor, he works for mental health counseling, and he’s a guidance counselor as well,” he said. “So I’ve sat in on some of his meetings and discussions just to get an idea of how things are run because these are touchy subjects.”
“It was good opening the questions, I like how everybody had their own opinions, and how everybody brought up personal experiences to get themselves more involved with the answers,” Alexander said. Barker hopes to continue this program so students can become more comfortable bringing up similarly sensitive topics in conversation.
The severity of matters including sexual assault allegations against men, specifically fraternity men, were also discussed at the event. Students largely agreed that the actions of one person do not define the characteristics of every member of the same group. “I feel like this will help people to [see] fraternities are not these bad guys who are committing sexual assaults, they’re actually trying to help and get people more aware,” Alexander said. 
Going forward, Barker said students can expect a Kappa Week further into the academic year with a panel discussion covering similar topics to those discussed at this event.

A series of renovations have been completed at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts as part of a five-year agenda set in place by a council of overseers. The renovations are part of a strategic plan to set the new direction of the theater.
The first project, which consisted of improvements to the concert hall, began in the summer of 2018. This upgrade will include an increase in the depth of the stage and a change to the theatre’s carpet and seats. These renovations are expected to bring in a larger audience and has the long term goal of attracting top stars to perform at Tilles.  
“As a result of our vision, we have a need to upgrade our facilities as they relate to artistic, educational and customer experiences. Our facilities plan is prepared in an effort to address changes in the types and scale of performances presented at Tilles Center now and for the near future,” The Tilles Center’s Executive Director, William Biddle said.
Recently completed in October 2019, was the upgraded patio area to Tilles’ Castagna Plaza which consisted of a new brickwork installation. This course of work was paid for by a New York State grant, according to Biddle. 
Upgrades to projection systems and the Krasnoff Theatre were completed in 2018. Near-term projects consist of the concert hall improvements, as well as upgrades to the Patron and Founder’s rooms. Changes which began in 2018 but are still ongoing are green room and dressing room renovations, as well as updated stage lighting. Steinway piano upgrades can also be noticed in the atrium, concert hall and Krasnoff Theatres. 
Future plans for the Tilles Center include enlarging the stage loading door, which is expected to be completed in spring 2020, and the replacement of the orchestra shell, projected for completion in fall 2020.
Upgrades like these take a lot of time and money. All of the funding for these projects will come from private donations and grants given by LIU. 
“We have raised $750,000 of private money and almost $200,000 in grants to help fund these projects,” Biddle said. The school plans to make this money back after all the renovations are done. Their hopes are to attract more students with additional performances and acts throughout the year. 
“I am very excited about the renovations as they will help advance our reputation regionally and nationally as we increase the type and quality of the performances that we present. Additionally, we are providing current technology and upgraded performance spaces for our students and the community,” Biddle added.
