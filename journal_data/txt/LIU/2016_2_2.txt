After the hoverboard started to appear in the streets and on celebrity Instagram sites in 2015, it quickly became the must-have gadget of the year. Recently, however, the self-balancing, motorized scooter has been the object of legal and safety concerns. LIU Post is now among an increasing number of colleges across the country prohibiting hoverboards on their campuses.
Notices posted in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library entrance, and elsewhere on campus, inform students that “LIU Post is prohibiting the usage, storage and charging of [hoverboards] on campus, this includes, residence halls, academic buildings or any other buildings, walkways and parking lots.”
According to a Huffington Post article last month by Collin Binkley, at least 20 universities have banned or restricted hoverboards during or after the winter break this winter. The online news source reported that the risk of falls and collisions is a concern, but that many colleges are also responding to warnings from federal authorities that some hoverboards have caught on fire. Dean of Students, Abagail Van Vlerah, confirmed that this is the case on campus.
“Because of recent news reports regarding hoverboard fires and because the safety and security of our students is our top priority, the university chose to ban hoverboards from campus,” Van Vlerah wrote in an email to The Pioneer.
An unconfirmed number of hoverboards were actually purchased by the university for students to rent through the campus concierge last semester. These have now been returned to the seller for full price, according to Van Vlerah.
Students have cooperated with the new policy, according to Van Vlerah, and no feedback has been received by the dean of student’s office or Campus Life.
In November, a Louisiana home was destroyed when a hoverboard exploded after it was left plugged in to charge, according to wgntv.com. During the past month, several incidents about charging hoverboards catching fire have been reported also in New York and New Jersey. The incidents are believed to have been caused by poorly made batteries.
Stony Brook University, which has also announced a campus ban, is warning students on its website about safety alerts from the National Fire Protection Association and the NYS Office of Fire Prevention in relation to hoverboards. Furthermore, the university reports that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is investigating the cause of fires and risks linked to fires in 17 states.
The hoverboard, which is an evolution of the infamous Segway “personal transportation device,” caused concern almost immediately after it entered the market. In November, NYPD officials prohibited hoverboards in New York City, simply because they are motor vehicles that cannot be registered. Unlawful hoverboarding on sidewalks, streets or parking lots could result in a fine of up to $200, according to the New York Daily News.
New York isn’t the only state to regulate the use of hoverboards. In California, a new law has gone into effect that requires hoverboard users to wear helmets and limit speeds to 35 mph. It also prohibits anyone under 16 from riding the devices.

The legalization of marijuana is one of the latest topics of conversation in America. While some states such as Colorado and Washington passed the legalization of the drug for leisure purposes, others are beginning to warm up to the idea of at least allowing the plant for medical use. New York, more specifically Long Island, opened two new medical marijuana dispensaries; one in Nassau County and the other in Riverhead, Suffolk County.
According to Marijuana Policy Project’s official website, the first eight medical marijuana dispensaries were opened in New York on Jan. 7, 2016. As far as rules and regulations go, the website states, “marijuana can only be recommended by registered doctors who have taken a costly 4.5 hour course on medical cannabis,” As of Friday, Jan.29, there were 306 physicians and 465 patients certified by the state, according to the Department Of Health.
Under the New York State Medical Marijuana Program, “anyone with a debilitating or life threatening-condition is eligible to use medical marijuana.” Such conditions include, cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, and Huntington’s disease.
According to The Long Island Press, the medicinal marijuana offered at the Riverhead facility costs between $100-$300. However, some patients may be eligible for subsidies of 15-20 percent depending on if they live below poverty level or are on Medicaid.

At the beginning of this spring semester, students discovered that the photocopy machine located on the main floor of the library, which previously charged 10 cents per copy, was now free. Copies can be made without depositing money.
Rosmary Kopczynski, an Administrative Assistant in the office of the Dean of Library, said that the reason behind the elimination of the charge was that “Dr. Cline felt it better aligned LIU Post with other universities.
Gabrielle Lewis, senior public relations major, said that this change is a positive one. “I don’t have a printer or copy machine at home, so it being free helps me out a lot, plus I can photocopy pages out of some books I need… some of my professors only use the books a few times a semester, there is no point [in] buying them.”
Mary Kate Boyd-Burns, a reference librarian at the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, often sees students taking pictures of textbook pages on their phones. Now, “with the copy machine being free, I do see many more students taking advantage of it. I think anything the school can offer to their students for free to help is great,” she said.
