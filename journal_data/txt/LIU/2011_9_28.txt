Hickox field isn’t the state-of-the-art athletic facility it once was, and the C.W Post alumni and administration are looking to change that.
The University has launched the Pioneer Spirit Campaign, an initiative to raise funds for a new-state-of-the-art stadium to replace the ageing Hickox Field. The new stadium will cost $4.5 million and will feature seating for 4,500 spectators, in addition to providing a brand new press and coaching box.
Demolition of the current stadium will begin in the spring of 2012, after the Pioneer Spirit Campaign secures a $1.5 million principal naming gift for the stadium and an additional $1.5 million in donations. Construction of the new stadium will be completed by the fall of the same year.
The current stadium was renovated in 2006, but Sal Naro, co-chair, of the C.W. Post Pioneer Spirit Campaign, sees it as a liability and embarrassment.
“It’s actually quite dangerous,” Naro said. “It’s been unkempt; it’s very uncomfortable, and it’s rickety and has all kinds of issues.”
Student broadcaster Matt Soldano has spent his entire C.W. Post career covering the Pioneers and traveling with the team. Having seen other school’s facilities, Soldano sees the need for a new stadium.
“I’m a supporter of building a new stadium and improving our facilities here at C.W. Post,” Soldano said. “The field itself is very nice, but, at the same time, the stands, the press box, all of that can be revamped to be on par with other teams we play. Traveling with the team the past two years, I’ve seen different press boxes. I’ve seen different stadiums, and they are more advanced than C.W. Post’s.”
Talk about building a new stadium has been ongoing for some time. According to Naro, it was Athletic Director Bryan Collins who spear-headed the effort for a new stadium.
“(Collins) spoke with me about it, and then I got Pete Gibson to work with me and co-lead the project,” Naro said.
A new stadium is seen as a good thing for not only the athletic department, but also for the whole student body. The stadium will be designed to be able to host C.W. Post commencement, homecoming, and family day. There has also been talk about hosting outdoor concerts at the new facility. Naro even hopes that advertising and commercials could be filmed at the new stadium once it’s built. During the 60’s and 70’s, Hickox Field was used for that exact purpose.
“There’s quite a lot of campus life that can be involved with the stadium,” Naro commented. “It’s certainly not just for football players or lacrosse players and women’s field hockey. It’s way beyond that.”
To date, the Pioneer Spirit Campaign has received over $1 million in pledges, leaving $3.5 million of the $4.5 million cost for the new stadium but the University will cover the remaining amount.
The fact that the University is spending money on a new stadium and not on improving other facets to the campus has some students weary.
“I don’t think the school should be spending money on a new stadium,” said Nick Vento, who was unaware the University even had plans to build a new stadium. “Instead, maybe use it for more parking areas, so its never a fight for a spot.”
Chelsea Lassig was also unaware that there were plans to build a new stadium. “I didn’t know they were planning to build a new stadium,” she said. “And, I don’t think the school should be spending money on this.”
Dr. Paul Forestell, provost of the C.W. Post Campus, believes the cost is necessary and asserts that the University has spent to improve other parts of the C.W. Post Campus.
“With more than 400 student-athletes, who excel not only on the field but in the classroom, we recognized the need to upgrade some of our athletic facilities,” Dr. Forestell said via email. “Over the past year, we have made significant enhancements to the campus, including residence hall renovations, a new gaming and T.V. lounge, new dining facilities, such as Starbucks and the P.O.D., and new labs in radiologic technology, genetic counseling and digital game design. Our goal is to provide and maintain quality academic, residential, recreational and student service facilities.”
Neither students have ever been to a sporting event at Hickox Field and don’t think a new facility would make them want to go.
“I’m not sure if I would be more eager to go just because of a new stadium,” Vento said. “There would have to be some other reason for me to want to go.”
Lassig added, “A new stadium wouldn’t make me attend more sporting events.”
Naro had a direct response to students like Vento and Lassig. “What I would say to them is, unfortunately, they’re probably in a world where they’re running from class to class, maybe running to a job,” He started off saying. “But, they are missing a large part of what a campus environment can be like by not participating in any type of campus events that could take place in the stadium.”

 On Wednesday, September 21st, the Long Island Women’s Institute at the C.W. Post Campus opened the doors of the Winnick House’s historic Great Hall to the Partnership to Advance Women Leaders (PAWL) in an effort to encourage college-age women to become active participants in society and examine the roles of women in all fields.
 Led by Linda Kevins, the president of PAWL and the vice president of the Women’s Bar Association of the State of New York, among numerous other distinguished titles, the panel of six women discussed their tips for success in business, in life, and, especially, in politics in hopes of rousing the female attendees in the room to “pursue and obtain leadership roles in representative numbers on decision-making bodies in all fields.” 
 This lecture was a part of PAWL’s “Ready, Set, Lead” program, designed to “empower women in the political process.” The program focuses primarily on the importance of getting involved in one’s community, making female voices heard on governmental bodies and networking to get ahead.
 “Women have equal ambition, sometimes more than their counterparts,” said Kevins. “It’s time to take action.” 
 Kevins automatically engaged the sparse audience of approximately 15 people by spewing out surprising statistics about women, the most jarring being that women are the majority of the population, make 80% of consumer household decisions, and 50% more women obtain a degree than men, yet they earn a mere 70% of earnings to men in doctoral-level fields, hold less than 18% of seats in the U.S. Congress, and no woman has ever held the seat of county executive in neither Nassau nor Suffolk County. 
 “Step out of your comfort zone. Carpe Diem!” encouraged Kevins in her thick New York accent, following this statement with an anecdote about how she used to be afraid to do things until she overheard her son’s swim coach telling the team to use their fears. It changed her perspective about life and forced her out of her comfort zone to pursue more. 
 “All of you are a great resource,” stated the second panelist, Arlene K. Haims, the chief operating officer at Haims Insurance Group. “I beseech all of you to stand up and make a difference,” she continued. 
 In order to make such a difference, each woman on the panel imparted her own words of wisdom to the audience, divulging useful tips to excel in any career. 
 Haims said, “Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself. Go up to people telling them what you need and want. They can help you get there.”
 Barbara Gervase, a senior partner and matrimonial attorney at Gervase & Vallone, P.C. and the immediate past president of the Nassau County Women’s Bar Association, highlighted the importance of networking, dubbing it essential to becoming a leader. She also encouraged the audience members to volunteer their time and talents in order to shine.
 Dr. Anne-Leslie Zaslav, another panelist, who also happens to be an adjunct instructor in C.W. Post’s master’s degree program in biology/genetics in addition to her positions as the head of cytogenetics and an associate professor of pathology at Stony Brook University Medical Center, said she used to be intimidated by speaking in public. To overcome her fear, she took acting lessons to force herself to speak in front of audiences. She stressed that everyone must communicate effectively and learn how to speak with others. 
 Karen Bodner, a matrimonial attorney at Stanley Hirsch and board member of both the Old Westbury Hebrew Congregation and the Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism Association, said,“The only way to effectuate change is to be the voice and activate it.” She urged everyone in the room to get involved at a local level. “You’ll see and learn how people in positions of power act and talk to one another,” she stated.
 Amy Hsu, a young, supervising attorney and vice co-chair of the Women in the Courts Committee, was, perhaps, the most relatable panelist in the room for female C.W. Post students. “Broadcast your accomplishments,” she said. “The more you talk about them, the more it will help your confidence.” 
 At the conclusion of the lecture, the panelists took time to walk around the room and introduce themselves to the students in the audience, handing them business cards and encouraging them to sign up for PAWL membership. 
 Audrey Thompson, a junior social work major, said the lecture was “great” and “very helpful,” and senior Dimitra Mpounas, a political science major and criminal justice minor, raved, “The presentation was, overall, very informative. I learned a lot of new statistics about women,” a goal that the women of PAWL hoped to achieve.

On Wednesday, September 21st, during common hour in the Hillwood Art Museum, our campus welcomed author Joseph Lunievicz. It was a free event that was open to the public and was sponsored by The C.W. Post Poetry Center, Merit Fellowship and the John P. McGrath Fund of Long Island University. There, Lunievicz read from his debut young adult novel, Open Wounds, as part of the Poetry Center’s fall series. 
 Lunievicz is no stranger to C.W.Post; he is an alumnus of the C.W.Post Honors Program and the English departmemt. His debut novel is a historical novel and also a boy’s coming of age story about an orphan growing up in New York, where he finds a fencing master to teach him how to survive. Lunievicz said he wrote this book simply for the fact he had to.”When the idea won’t go away, an author has to write it down,,” he said.
 Dr. Joan Digby, the director of the Honors program and an English professor, invited Lunievicz back to C.W.Post to read his novel and to talk with the students. “I invited him because he is an alumnus, and since he just published his novel, I thought it was wonderful for him to come here and for students who are prospective writers to come listen,” said Digby.
 After the reading, many students were very interested and intrigued by the novel. John Steel, a sophomore with a dual major in English and philosophy said,” It’s inspirational to know that a student from C.W. Post can become an author.” 
 Kirsten Corwin, a freshman music education major, thought it was good to not only get to hear Lunievicz speak but also bring what he was reading to life. “It was just interesting to hear the author read his novel and get his take on what he wrote about,” said Corwin.
 Marisa Lant, a freshman speech language pathology major, was also glad to get a better glimpse into his novel. “I really appreciated hearing it and seeing more into the text. I also liked how he emphasized certain points,” said Lant.
 Lunievicz’s reading of his debut novel was also the launching of The Poetry Center’s first ever short fiction contest. To enter, applicants must write a short fiction story, which must not be longer than two typed pages. It is open to both undergraduate and graduate students and involves a cash prize. The winner will have the opportunity to read his or her poetry at the Poetry Awards Night on April 10th.

Last Thursday during Common Hour in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall, around 450 guests of students, staff, and faculty gathered for our yearly Convocation. 
The interesting new twist this year was the fact that the whole convocation was streamed live this year for the first time on the internet, so even if you couldn’t attend, you were able to watch live over the computer. Playing on the side of the lecture hall was entertainment by our own, Long Island’s best college Pep band.
The Convocation started with a welcome and a short speech on the state of the campus, which was addressed by Provost Paul Forestell, who also hosted the event. Then University President, Dr. David Steinberg stated in his welcoming that, “This is a convocation; A welcoming. The definition of Convocation is: ‘A group of people convoked, especially the members of a college or university community who are assembled for a ceremony.’ The way we define ‘Convocation’ here at C.W. Post LIU is; a way of bringing classmates and professors together for a celebration of the new academic year.”
After all the welcomes, they premiered the new C.W. Post Promotional video and TV commercial on the big screen. Over this past summer, undergraduate and graduate students auditioned for the commercial and it was later filmed at a studio in Manhattan; the same studio in which Rachael Ray is filmed. Both videos surrounded by the idea of “I am looking for…” and proclaiming “We found it at C.W. Post!” After the premieres were shown, students sitting in the front row, who starred in the video, took a bow.
During the rest of Convocation, student leaders distributed T-Shirts into the crowd, along with hosting raffles, which prizes included C.W. Post sweatshirts and gift cards for iTunes and Barnes and Noble. The ever-populated Orientation Leaders also showed the audience their moves, while singing their extremely impressive and catchy, “2011 Post Chant,” which is made each year for Freshman Orientation. 
Their was also a short video shown to honor, Mary Lai-Long Island University’s Vice President for Finance and Treasurer.  This video showed footage of Mary Lai on a timeline, and showed everything she has done for this school. It was a way to inspire new freshman as well as anyone who attended. Today, at 91 years old, Mary Lai continues to share her words of wisdom. She said in her video, “If you work hard and put your mind and soul into everything you do, you will be successful.” 
The turnout for the 2011 C.W. Post Convocation was very impressive. It really showed our strives in bettering the school increasingly each year. Keep an eye out for our new C.W Post LIU Campus commercial, which will be shown on cable as well as non-cable channels very soon!

As many of you have probably noticed, C.W. Post has implemented a new printing policy in all of the computer labs around campus. In my 5th year at Post, I have to say that I was a little perturbed when I was asked to break a dollar to only print 1 page during the first week of school. However, I took my 9 dimes and figured I could use those dimes the next time I went to print something out.
I also reflected on the amount of good that this policy brings to the campus in terms of sustainability. In past years, I have noticed numerous times that students have taken advantage of the printers by printing out eBooks and PowerPoint presentations consisting of 50 slides or more. I can’t tell you how many times I have been in the computer lab sifting through papers that people left there in order to find the one page that I printed out. If you have been a Post student for more than one year, I am sure you have had a similar experience.
Although this policy virtually fixes the problem of paper waste, many students are angry that they are now being charged for those services, particularly after it has been free for so long. Senior Early Childhood Education major, Crystal Lopez, said “As a senior at Post, why is it that our incoming class had no sort of incentive, yet now we have to pay for our own paper?” Senior Music Education major, Mikhail Brown, says that “It doesn’t make sense that we’re being charged because in recent years it was free and we pay enough in tuition already.” Senior Public Relations major, Kiara Rondon also raised similar objections, saying “My thesis is over 30 pages and now its ridiculous that I have to pay to print my thesis out after I already pay over 40,000 dollars each year.”
Thinking that this might only be an issue for seniors, I interviewed how some freshman feel about the new policy and they also expressed similar views. Raheem Barnes, a freshman who is undeclared, said “We pay thousands of dollars for an education, but why should we have to pay for printing that should be free?” Fredy Cruz, a freshman accounting major, said that “If they’re concerned about wasting paper and ink then they should tell us how much we should print.”
In previous years, students were allowed to print up to 10 pages a day. However, this was rarely implemented due to the fact that there wasn’t always a staff member monitoring the computer lab. Now, the new software will make it to where the IT employee must approve your printing job. Freshman Accounting major, Katlyn Gernavage, a work-study employee of the Hillwood Computer Lounge, said “I understand the need for this program to approve the jobs because some people print stuff out on accident so it is a good program to cut down on waste, but I think anything under 10 pages should be free.” Katlyn also added that “Everybody has been pretty angry about it,” meaning the new policy.
According to Nancy Marksbury, the Deputy CIO, over 100,000 dollars was spent in paper and toner last academic year. Additionally, IT estimated that 30 percent of jobs printed never even left the lab. “What we found was an enormous amount of waste. Online books and websites were printed and left behind.” Nancy Marksbury also added that while “surveying other institutions on Long Island, we found that C.W. Post-and the IT labs in particular- were the only lab environments not charging for printing.”
Although that is true, I did some research as well into other Long Island schools and found varying results. Adelphi University allows students 500 free copies per semester. However, there will be a charge of 5 cents for each additional black and white copy and 15 cents for each additional color copy after those limits have been reached. Hofstra, on the other hand, has software called PridePrint that you install on your laptop and you must add money to your student account in order to print. Hofstra also charges 10 cents per black and white copy. Stonybrook probably has the fairest system in place regarding their printing policy. Each student gets a 2.00 daily balance, which equates to a daily quota of 40 pages. If you don’t use your 40 pages, however, they rollover to the next day. But this system resets itself on Saturday morning as well as Monday morning. So, they will only rollover for that week, and then it goes back to 40 pages again.
It should be noted that there will be a print amnesty period. Nancy Marksbury said, “No printing charges will be assessed during mid-terms and finals.” Therefore, students will catch some sort of break. Maksbury also added, “No charge will be assessed for printing documents from MyLIU such as class schedules, financial information, transcripts, and degree audits.” The IT lab also offers free services like faxing to anywhere in the continental US and scanning to email. So, the student body isn’t getting completely shafted in terms of having to pay for those extra services as well.
Another concern raised by Kiara Rondon was the lack of student input that went into the new policy. She said,  “The students make the school, so something like this should have been brought to SGA to get student input. They didn’t give us any type of message.” I didn’t think any sort of message was sent out either, but then I spoke with IT employee Monet Barley and she insisted that an email was sent out to all students regarding the policy. Sure enough she was right and she helped me find the email in my Trash Folder on my MyLIU account and even offered to print it out for me. I asked her if there would be a charge and she jokingly replied, “I might have to charge you a dime.” So, as the policy may not have been advertised very well, all of us did indeed get an email informing us of the changes. That email was sent out September 2nd, Subject “Welcome to the fall semester from IT”.
I believe Nick Ciborowski, a Junior Broadcasting major put it best. “I understand why they implemented this policy because people always take advantage of things that are free.” Unfortunately, many people did take advantage of the previous system and now we all have to pay for it with our dimes. So, a few tips for the computer labs. Don’t get mad at the work-study students. They can only help one person at a time. They did not implement this policy. So, do not take out your frustration on them. Carry 1 dollar bills on you because it will be hard to break a 20. And try and realize the good that will come out of this policy. I believe we will significantly reduce our environmental impact with this new policy. 
Perhaps, in the future, students and IT can work together on a system similar to those of Adelphi or Stonybrook, where a minimal amount of pages can be printed for free and then anything extra will be charged. Until then, save up those dimes and understand that we are literally paying now for the waste that others have done in the past.

For education majors, it is not uncommon to have discussions based on developing authentic assessment and innovative lesson plans in their education classes. Professors share rich knowledge of different ideas that their students can implement in their own classrooms one day to create lifelong learners. One issue that concerns both students and professors alike is the growing pressure for teachers to teach to standardized tests. Indeed we have all had our ample share of standardized tests since we were in elementary school, but as the number of tests increase, so does the value that state and federal governments place on the results. Senior Childhood Education major, Margaret Reddington, feels that “students lose site of the real reason why they’re learning” and that they are simply “learning what the state wants them to learn.” It is not surprising that many students and educators share the same view with Reddington as teaching to the test is simply an ineffective approach for maximum learning. 
The amount of tools and technology that are available to teachers to support learning in the classroom is constantly rising from interactive SMART boards to IPads. However, while the government puts more and more emphasis on testing, teachers are often discouraged from expanding on lessons or group projects due to time constraint in efforts to cram chapters of material that could be asked on a state test. Also, although effective teachers endorse student creativity, they are forced to teach students specific guidelines that they must meet for the mandated assessments. C.W. Post alumna, Lucy Portugal is currently an elementary school teacher in the Port Washington School District. When asked her opinion on the emphasis of teaching to the test she responded by saying, “Today in education, testing has become a high stakes issue.” Her advice for teachers or future educators is to “maintain creative and authentic teaching practices when considering testing requirements.” 
What makes teaching to the test even more controversial is how teachers are being evaluated based on their students’ test results. In recent years, the Obama administration established the Race to the Top program which essentially provides grants to schools that display excellence in test scores. However, one must ask should the schools that teach to the test really be the ones to be applauded, or should the schools that encourage constructivism in the classroom and independent thinking be the ones to be praised? 
Professor of Education, Dr. Bette Schneiderman provides an alternative way to assess student achievement. “Rather than teach to the test, picture teachers creating learning environments with meaningful learning outcomes clearly stated upfront. Then, picture students needing to evidence their own learning to show that they have accomplished their goals. Learners can become empowered in such environments, needing to find and process information, ponder and work on solutions to problems, and create responses documenting both what they learned and responses to issues of value.” Dr. Schneiderman’s solution to assessment is designed to show what students have learned in their class, but at the same time fosters student originality and creativeness. Assessment of students’ knowledge is imperative. From assessments, teachers can collect data that will inform future teaching practices. At the same time, it should not dictate a teacher’s practices in a classroom. It is a challenge that teachers are encountering and one that future educators will surely be faced with. Nevertheless, let us not forget the true role(s) of a teacher.

With a storyline ripped from the headlines, “Room” is a compelling read from start to finish. The novel, by Irish-Canadian author Emma Donoghue, was released one year ago but is still gaining huge acclaim. Room is the story of five-year-old Jack and his Ma. They live in Room, the only home Jack has ever known. As the novel progresses, the reader learns that Room is, in reality, a prison that confines Jack and Ma in its enclosed space, 24 hours a day. 
Donoghue’s character development is what makes this book such an engrossing read. Ma, taken captive and forced to raise the child of her captor, adapts to her life. She spends her days teaching Jack to count, read, exercise, and maintain a healthy diet. Like any other mother, she does not allow Jack to have too many sweets. She makes sure he brushes his teeth, and she limits his TV watching. The way she cares for Jack, you can almost forget that she is being held captive. 
Donoghue also creates Jack with such care that it is easy to forget he is a character in a novel and not a real five-year-old. She includes errors in speech that young children often make. She has Jack call the items in Room by their name; he creates friends in Bed, Wardrobe, Table and Rug. She goes so far as to make Jack the narrator of the novel, writing it completely in the language of a five-year-old. While this caused mixed reviews by some critics, it really gives the novel a depth it never would have with an adult narrator. 
Room is a novel that is not afraid to push the boundaries. With many controversial topics within it, at heart, the novel is truly about the bond between a mother and a son. It’s a novel you won’t be able to put down once you start and will really leave you thinking. What if your whole world was the size of your bedroom?

This book is a perfect college girl read. This book brings up a lot of questions that we’ve all faced at one point in our adult lives – questions about trust, loyalty, and, of course, love. Rachel is a goody-two-shoes, who happens to be best friends with her polar opposite, Darcy, who is a New York City publicist and socialite. The two have been best friends since grade school, where their friendship began on a foundation of schoolgirl jealousy and drama. Although they remained friends up until their adult lives, the relationship always remained kind of rocky. However, being in the limelight, Darcy always has Rachel to fall back on. When Rachel meets picture perfect Dex, she introduces him to Darcy, convincing herself he is way too perfect for her. Flash-forward a few years, and Darcy and Dex are engaged. After Rachel’s 30th birthday party, where she had one too many drinks and ends up in bed with Dex, her true feelings for him start to reveal themselves. This rendezvous is just the beginning of a series of events and questions that progress throughout the book. Should Rachel follow her heart and ruin the one true friendship she has always known? With unexpected twists throughout, this book keeps you turning the page and wanting more.
Two and a Half Men’s New Season
Byline:Paul Kalis
Two and a Half Men, the CBS show staring Jon Cryer (Allen Harper) and Angus T. Jones (Jake Harper), welcomes Ashton Kutcher (Walden Schmidt) as it enters its ninth season, following the departure of Charlie Sheen (Charlie Harper). Jon Cryer has said “all of us on the set keep referring to the first episode back as the “pilot” by mistake.”
I think it appropriate to review the show as if it really was starting over from the very beginning. Allen has had the worst luck with life. He has been divorced, and his brother, Charlie, died in a subway accident. On top of that, he is about to become homeless with a teenage son. A billionaire, Walden, walks up to his brother’s beach house after trying to commit suicide and soon offers to buy it after a friendship forms. CBS certainly pulled out all the stops for the premiere, including guest appearances from John Stamos, Jenna Elfman, Thomas Gibson as Dharma, and Greg Montgomery. However, the humor fell flat and was very disrespectful to the beloved and dead character. Chuck Lorre, the creator of Two and a Half Men, and CBS certainly took an ample amount of shots at Charlie at his funeral, listing the sexually transmitted diseases he had given ex-girlfriends. His fiancée and mother seemed to care even less.
Kutcher, in my mind, will be forever known as Kelso from “That 70’s Show.” He delivered his lines identically, and I could not take his character seriously. He was just pulling a Kelso. I was just waiting for him to yell, “burn!” It’s great that Two and a Half Men has had a new breath of life pumped into it, as it was salvaged from the cancellation heap. The 27.8 million viewers for the season premiere won’t retain. Typically, episodes bring in 12 million. Lorre has stated, “I would never buy that show” as a new pitch, and neither do I, which is why this show has been burned by Kelso with a D.

If there is one thing I can say about the movie The Help, it’s that it is “amazingly powerful”. The plot revolves around three women Aibileen, Minny and “Skeeter,” as she’s called, who all live in Mississippi during the 1960s. Aibileen and Minny are African American women who work as maids, while Skeeter is a young, white woman who aspires to be a writer. The three band together to write a book about their lives as maids, as well as the racial prejudices they face from the community and their employers. As the movie progresses, we see the horrid treatment the maids receive. The movie is a great mixture of drama, tragedy, and comedy. It’s the kind of film that inspires those who watch it to treat everyone equally no matter what background or skin color he or she has. My favorite scene, though I don’t want give too much away, was the evil, yet amazing prank Minny pulled on her employer. It was so funny; I couldn’t stop laughing. My favorite character was Aibileen because of her strong character and spirit; she is the kind of person who, no matter how scary something is, will go out and face the danger head on. The movie is emotional and funny. It also perfectly captures the way life was in the 60’s – from outfits to cars and home décor that was popular in Mississippi during that time period. It’s a MUST see movie! I recommend it to anyone. Also, as a side note, the movie is based on the novel The Help, by Kathryn Stockett. Definitely pick it up when you get the chance.

The first few weeks of the semester have passed and at this point, it’s safe to say we’ve made our first impressions. We’re waking
up fifteen minutes before we need to leave for class, rather than at 5:30 am to shower and get ready. Some of us may have even forgotten about those resolutions we made at the beginning of the semester already.  While first impressions are the most important and memorable, our behaviors can carry on throughout the semester, and how we act in class effects our grades. Usually, we think our professors don’t notice when we do something wrong, however, they do.
After asking several professors what their number one pet peeve was during class, they all had the same answer. Texting. It’s a rule
in every syllabus that students must not text during class, and unless you have an extreme interest in your lap, you’re not fooling anyone. Most of us like to put our phones in our pockets, on our laps, or even right out in the open on our desks.  Texting can wait until after class, but if there is some sort of emergency, or if you’re the kind of person who likes to take notes on your phone, be sure to ask your professor prior to the class. Otherwise, be sure to put your phone, and any other handheld device for that matter, away. And for the record, if your professor sees you doing this, they tend to take a mental note.
Number two: don’t fall asleep. Some people are lucky enough to be morning people. But to most of those less fortunate, it kills.
Showing up to class on time, or just showing up at all, are automatic brownie points on our final grades, but if you’re going to fall asleep, well, there go your points. You might as well just not show up to class at all. Try setting short-term goals for yourself like going
to sleep an hour earlier than you usually do each night. Yes, this is college. Most of us are full-time students and work a million jobs,
but if that’s the case, try setting aside some of your free time to take care of business. If you have a paper that’s not due until next
week, get a jump-start on it, rather than cramming it in at three in the morning the night before it’s due. You’ll feel more relaxed and
less tired knowing that you can cross that off your to-do list.
If you’re a coffee drinker and you have some time before class, bring the coffee with you. Just don’t show up late with it in your hand, it looks bad. Also, try to make sure you always have something in your stomach, even if it’s something as light as a granola bar or a banana, because eating something after we wake up naturally energizes us.  Speaking of food, most professors are pretty lenient about bringing food to class. When we’re on the run, we usually don’t have time to stop, sit down, and eat our lunch. So feel free to bring a sandwich or a snack to class, just please be cautious of what you eat.  Sure, a lot of people enjoy tuna, but it’s not necessarily everybody’s favorite smell. Try to avoid bringing food with strong odors like tuna, and almost anything from a fast food joint. It’s going to get pretty cold in just a few short months and all the windows in our class are going to be shut, and the heat will be radiating, making it your food smell much worse than necessary. Also try to avoid bringing peanut butter and jelly or anything with nuts in it, due to allergies. There are some people who cannot even be within the vicinity of peanuts without having a reaction.
Another familiar reaction one might get from their classmates is death stares. Why, you ask? Always be conscious when you are chewing gum that you’re not, for lack of a better term, clacking it, or when you’re using a clickable pen, don’t continuously click it. It
distracts other students from doing their work and your professors from lecturing. It particularly gets under people’s skin when they’re trying to take a test. Cancelling out these tiny habits will overall make you a better student and help you focus. Even if you’re not paying attention, make it look like you are. “One thing I can’t stand from students is a blank face. It makes me feel like they can’t
comprehend anything I’m saying,” says Professor Wendy Ryden of the English Department. Our minds tend to wander off several times throughout the day, which is okay. We’re human, but we also have to realize that we’re students and we go to class for a purpose.

As the temperatures begin to drop, it is time for fall fashion to pop across our campus..  Fall fashion is a happy medium between dressing weather-appropriate and dressing fashionably.  Students, put away your short shorts, tank tops, and flip flops, to make way for comfortable cardigans, chucky scarves, and cozy boots.  It seems as though on our campus, comfort and trends mesh together to make a unique blend of autumnal style.  This fall season proves to be no different, as a wide array of trends sweep across campus like leaves on a crisp October day.
Faux Leather, and Leather Jackets: From camel-colored, to black, and everywhere in between, these jackets are a fashionable alternative that is sure to amplify (improve?) any outfit.  Faux leather jackets have the ability to give a comfortable, plain outfit a put together-without- even- trying feel.  Simply throw on a brown Faux-Leather Moto Jacket from Old Navy ($49.94) or a Michael Kors leather jacket in the color gunmetal from Macy’s ($495.00) and you cannot go wrong.  “Faux leather jackets are my must-have fashion trend this season because they are comfortable and convenient while still being stylish.  I do not have hours in the morning to decide on an outfit so a leather jacket is the perfect way to go,” said senior Radiology Technology major Denise F. 
Chunky Knit, Oversized Sweaters:are always an extremely weather-appropriate option for this time of year. Sweaters are the perfect way to stay warm, and look chic at the same time.  Opt for a grey cowl neck sweater from Gap ($39.99) or a charcoal-colored JAMISON cable sweater from Bloomingdale’s ($215.00) to complete this look.  “My favorite outfit is a big sweater, leggings, and riding boots.  It is comfortable, effortless, and cute on a chilly fall day,” Public Relations major Meredith Minksy exclaimed.
Brightly Colored Denim:Available in hues such as mint green and magenta, colored denim provides a pop of color to any outfit.  Use this trend as a way to introduce some life and vibrancy into fall weather or match the colors of the changing leaves.  Broadcasting major Sarah Farsijany said, “These jeans are fun, funky, and easy to wear.”  Pop into your local Forever 21 and check out magenta skinny ankle jeans ($24.90) or bright purple J Brand 811 mid-rise skinny leg denim ($176.00) to incorporate this hip trend into your new fall wardrobe.
Boots: Whether you choose to don a pair of your trusty Uggs, or take a walk on the wild side with a pair of motorcycle boots, this trend is very versatile, yet classic at the same time.  Slip into a fresh pair of boots to complete an outfit, or even add some edge to your look.  Rock a pair of black Mossimo boots from Target ($34.99) or knee-high western style Frye Boots ($328.00) to represent your inner rebel.
Every season, new and exciting trends resonate through our consciousness.  As always, it is important to adapt these trends to work for you.  They have to work with your personal style, your budget, and your personality.  There is no right or wrong when it comes to fashion and style.  Like Coco Chanel once said, “Fashion fades, only style remains.”

Through the first three games of the season, the C.W. Post football team had scored just 27 points. The team surpassed that total by tossing 40 points on the board Saturday, September 24th, in its first win of the season.  The Pioneers continued their dominance over the Red Raiders in the 40-22 victory, not losing to them since the 2008 season.
The offense was a big problem during the first three games of the year, but C.W. Post racked up 554 yards of offense against Shippensburg University.  Jeff Mack was the offensive star after limited playing time in the first three games of the season. Mack rushed for 111 yards and three touchdowns.  Steven Laurino bounced back after a tough game last week to throw for 185 on 13-23 passing.
Post jumped out to an early 10-0 lead by points from Marc Montana and Mack’s first rushing touchdown of the day. The Red Raiders responded quickly, though, getting a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter to go into the half with a 14-10 lead.
After half-time, the Pioneers defense turned it up a notch, not allowing a single point to be scored in the third quarter. The Post defense was all over Red Raiders quarterback Zach Zulli throughout the game, sacking him seven times and forcing three turnovers.  In the meantime, the offense was clicking again, giving them lead after Jeff Mack rushed into the end zone for his second touchdown of the day.
In the fourth quarter, Shippensburg reduced the gap, as wide receiver Taimur Harris caught a four-yard pass to give the Red Raiders the lead back, but it was short-lived, as Mack quickly scored his third touchdown of the day, giving the Pioneers a lead they would never give up. For extra measure, Sean Persh returned a punt for a touchdown to make the game out of reach and guarantee the Pioneers their first win of the season.
Ronnie Modik racked up 14 tackles and had two forced fumbles in the victory, earning himself the PSAC East Defensive Player of the Week award. Kadeem Huggins had two sacks, and Andrew Jackson intercepted one pass.
The Pioneers will look to build off this week’s win when they take on West Chester University of Pennsylvania on Hickox Field on Saturday, October 1st. Coverage on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org begins at 12:30 p.m. with kickoff slated for 1 p.m.

Hometown: Bayport, NY
How long have you been playing for the C.W. Post tennis team?
This will be my third year.
What was your first impression of Post?
My first impression of Post was that it was a beautiful campus that seemed athletic-based, and a lot of the other schools that I visited did not seem as into their sports as Post is.
How do you feel about Post now?
I am happy about the decision I made about coming here.  I have made some really great friends through athletics, and I would not have picked any other school to go to.  The athletic department is very supportive of all of the other teams. It’s like a family.
What lesson(s) will you take from Post?
Sometimes, you may be faced with challenges, but you have to find a way to make it better and make it work so that your team will benefit in the long run.
What is the worst memory you have with the team?
My worst memory I have with the team is when I tore my ligament in warm-ups for the playoff match, and I could not play.
What do you want to do after you graduate from Post?
After I graduate from Post, I would like to work for an NFL team or a professional team, being involved with player personnel, or a physical education teacher and coach.
How do you balance being a student-athlete and a resident assistant?
It is very hard, at times, because they both take up a lot of my time, but you need to have time-management, and you have to make a day planner for yourself every day.  I like being busy, so it does not bother me, but it can be stressful to make it to everything that I have to be at. But, I have met a lot of great people and made a lot of new friends.
What will you miss the most from Post?
I will miss all of my teammates and being able to see them every day and all of the other athletes that I have become very close with.  I will just miss getting up and playing a sport every day.
Morgan Milleisen participates in both doubles and singles on the C.W. Post women’s tennis team, where she has gone 4-3 in doubles and 2-4 in singles this season.  Milleisen has earned All-Conference Second Team Honors as well as being nominated as the captain of the Women’s Tennis team.  The Pioneers have an overall record of 0-3 for the season thus far.  They have been voted to finish fourth in the East Coast Conference according to the preseason poll.  The Pioneers will be back in action for their last season match against Queens College on September 29th.

With nine regular season games remaining, the C.W. Post women’s field hockey team is looking forward to a winning season, with a current record of five wins and two losses. The team has two wins and one loss in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference, and, ironically enough, the same record for home games.
Saturday’s 5-1 win over Kutztown University gives the team the boost it needs before heading to Millersville University on Tuesday, September 27th, after a tough 1-4 loss at home to West Chester University on Wednesday, September 21st. Another morale boost came from an unlikely place; on September 20th, the C.W. Post women’s field hockey team was ranked ninth in the National Field Hockey Coaches Association Division II National Coaches Poll, otherwise known as the NFHCA coaches’ poll. The team was previously unranked.
Currently leading the team in goals is sophomore Carlee Dragon, with 11, while senior Helene Bruckner and graduate student Bethany Semlear combine for another 11. Dragon, coming back from a season where she was named ECAC Rookie of the Year, had 10 goals and two assists during the 2010 season. With one more goal and assist already than she had last season, and with nine games left to play, it is certain Dragon is looking for another season filled with awards. The team has tallied up 24 goals in the first seven games, while holding its opponents to just fourteen.
Three days after heading to Millersville, the team will embark on a three-game home stand, beginning with Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania on Friday, September 30th, and ending with Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, the team currently ranked number one in the nation, on October 5th.

Rosh Hashanah is an important holiday in the Jewish faith. However, because classes are still in session during the holiday, many students and faculty members find themselves stuck between their commitments to their religion and their commitments to their classes. 
Julie Feinman, the director of Hillel in religious life, said, “As a Jew, do I wish we didn’t have school on the high holidays? Yes, I do. But, I understand the reasons behind us staying open.” According to Feinman, the Provost and the faculty have decided to create a secular calendar. In other words, classes won’t be cancelled for any religious holiday, not just for the Jewish holidays, in particular. 
Student members of Hillel also voiced their opinions about the issue. Their overall consensus was that they understand why the school is doing this, but they would, at least, like to have the option to go home and celebrate with their families. One student, Nori Abramson, a senior art history major, said, “It’s not fair for those who have to choose between their faith and their classes.”
 The other side to the argument lies in the fact that if one particular religious faith receives holidays off from class, it would not be fair to those of other religious faiths, who do not get time off. 
According to Beth Carson of the C.W. Post registrar, the academic calendar is constructed to not only adhere to the University’s non-sectarian status but to also comply with the government’s auditing and reporting requirements. That basically means that all Long Island University campuses, including Brentwood, Brooklyn, Riverhead, and C.W. Post, start each semester on the same day and end on the same day. A non-sectarian campus means that the school will not give any time off for any religious holiday. 
 However, Columbus Day and Thanksgiving are considered to be national holidays, so classes will not meet during those holidays during the fall semester. Carson also expressed that, despite class schedules now conflicting with religious holidays, students and faculty may request time off to observe a religious holiday, and “staff [members] have the option of ‘floating’ holidays for religious observance.” 
Despite student and faculty views that this unfair, there are things being done to alleviate the situation. Free holiday services are available during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in the evenings and afternoons in the Hillwood Commons. Hillel is collecting Kosher non-perishable food for the Kosher Food Pantry until October 5th. The collection box is the blue box located in the lobby of the Interfaith Chapel.

As the academic year begins, students at Post may come to find themselves graduating later than expected. Something like switching your major or falling behind academically can be the reason why students find themselves tacking on an extra semester or so. 
 E-mails sent to Post Administration asking for valuable information regarding this issue met with a lot of deflection, and finally ended up in the inbox of Post’s Director of Public Relations, Rita Langdon.
 “Each student progresses toward graduation at his or her own pace,” said Langdon. While this may be true, some students find themselves progressing towards graduation later than some. Adrianna Alvarez, sophomore journalism major found out last spring that she was going to be graduating late. Looking back she said,” I would have taken more classes. I would have done more of what I wanted.”
 According to Langdon, “Students who face academic challenges or who choose to change majors multiple times may find themselves needing an extra semester, or in some cases a fifth year.” 
 Senior Journalism major, Kathleen Joyce said,” I didn’t graduate on time because I changed my major in my sophomore year.” She added, “I was mad at first that I had to stay another semester, but it’s my fault since I changed my major.”
 When Alvarez found out she wasn’t graduating on time, she said she was really upset, because she figured she’d be finished in four years, “Now it doesn’t bother me, I have met a lot of students who will be graduating late” she added. 
 While students may feel alone in this situation or even saddened by it, they should realize that there are other students who are going through the same situation. Alvarez offered some advice to students who are graduating late, “There are always ways to catch up like summer and winter classes. But failing classes will put you behind, so keep that in mind.”
 Langdon said, “Some students take advantage of winter and summer sessions to accelerate their studies and graduate early.” 
 Joyce offered words of advice as well, “Go to your classes, be on time, and be on top of everything. It’s so important to know what classes you need to take and what you need to do for the classes. If you are set on graduating on time, plan it. Take the extra classes in the winter/summer if you have to.”
 Students should find a major they love and stay on top of their studies. However, if graduating late is a risk, or even a possibility, students should have open communication with their academic advisors. “Counselors in the Office of Academic and Career Planning work with individual students to create an academic plan that is specific to their needs and goals.” Langdon said. When the day comes to register for classes, register, don’t take your time, or your expected graduation date could be jeopardized.

I broke up with my boyfriend of almost five years, just about two years ago. Since then, I’ve been on the lookout for a halfway decent guy. It always starts out the same; they’re caring, sweet, and charming to a point of irrationality. So they get you going for a week or two and you start to like them. That’s what called the “talking” stage?
This is a new aspect of a relationship. In the days of our parents you were dating and then you were boyfriend and girlfriend. Today, there seems to be multiple erroneous steps on the way to a relationship that our generation has created.
After their sweet and charming stage also known as the “honeymoon phase”, they start to show their true colors; who they really are. That’s the time that us girls should make our most critical judgments about them. Having been single for the past year and a half, I’ve come up with some problems that I find with not just one but, most guys in their early twenties.
The name of the game is chivalry gentlemen; and none or vast majority of you don’t seem to believe in it anymore. Instead of knocking on the door or ringing doorbells, we get a text saying, ”I’m outside,”…Oh thank you, how charming. And God forbid you opened a door for us. I know how menial that sounds but a little goes a long way.
If you ask me to go out to dinner with you I don’t mean the drive through at Wendy’s or a pizza that we take back to your dorm and eat on the couch. If we’re going out, I expect to go sit at an actual table in a real restaurant. I’m not saying it has to be a five star restaurant in Manhattan but if there’s a dollar menu it doesn’t qualify as a date.
Another thing, have any of you gentlemen ever heard of a florist? If you take a girl out a few times and actually like her, there’s no better surprise than a random bouquet of flowers. Even if it’s just a single flower, it’s something to let us know you’re thinking about us. Furthermore, a text or message on our Facebook wall does not suffice.
I truthfully do not understand the common dating practices that our generation has adapted to. I would still like to think there’s one special someone that will make me feel like I’m the only girl walking the planet. Not like I’m the best looking girl to stumble across his Facebook or Twitter account that day.
All you of guys wonder why us girls are relatively bitter and cynical about dating and end up not wanting to be anything more than friends with you, here’s the bottom line: treat us like the young ladies that we are. If you treat us like something that’s common, like you could have ten other girls who are just like us, we’ll move on to the next one.

Three weeks into the academic calendar, and C.W. Post’s B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is once again seeing familiar numbers filter through its doors.
“From 10 a.m. until closing, there is constant foot traffic in and out of the library,” says Martha Cooney, the assistant dean for user services.
This comes as no surprise.considering in 2003, a full-on renovation equipped the library with a myriad of contemporary functions that students have come to rely on. Gone are the days when all that a campus library had to offer were several million volumes of text, a square mile of microform storage, and a helpful staff (though they still have these things).
Available on the library’s website are dozens of online databases, which give students access to accredited information around the clock. 
Online alone, there are 1.2 million volumes, with remote access to 25,000 e-books, and over 200 library databases (Library Pamphlet). Services such as ebrary, a database with thousands of books in digital format, allow a user to create an electronic bookshelf full of downloadable text. 
The B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library houses 2,615,194 volumes of text and is involved in an Interlibrary Loan Service (ILLiad), which allows students to access the full catalogs of most major libraries around the country.
The library also has a sizable collection of prints, microform and periodicals, which have, for the most part, become digitized, and are available for download. Items from the database that are not available online can also be obtained through the ILLiad service.
Over the past two decades, the library’s integration with technology has completely changed the way students access information.
“The Library has changed, but in a wonderful way,” says Cooney. “The content we can provide to students is so much better than it was 20 years ago. The library has no boundaries.”
Since the renovation, the library is now home to 24 computer workstations, network and wireless connections, a quiet study room, an instructional room, a copy center, a circulation desk, a help desk, stacks with private carrels, and many additional study tables. 
In addition to the libraries new features, new initiatives have been established to help students acclimate to more modern methods of research.
One such initiative, titled “Ways to Ask A Librarian for Help,” described on informational, details five ways to contact the library’s staff:
IM A Librarian: A service that involves using one of five instant messaging services to chat with reference librarians on duty. 
Chat: A dedicated chat platform, accessible through the library’s website. 
Research by Appointment: a private consultation with a reference librarian. Reference librarians are also available by e-mail and bytelephone.
Inquiries include navigating the Library’s catalog, developing topics for a research paper, and identifying appropriate Internet resources.
The use of online resources by students has been overwhelming, with the library’s online databases receiving thousands of hits so far this year. Caitlyn Wrigley, a graduate student in library sciences, feels that the library and its staff are invaluable resources for students.
“The library’s many digital resources are exceptional, and the librarians are always there to help. It’s something that everyone should take advantage of because they have everything you could possibly need to succeed as a student.”
Though the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library has undergone an aesthetic transformation in recent years, still unchanged is the staff of librarians, who are relentless in their pursuit to provide students with a wealth of relevant information.

Most drivers can agree that there really isn’t much to do while you’re driving, since you’re supposed to pay attention to the road, which of course you should! But what about those times when you’re stuck in bumper- to- bumper traffic, with nowhere to go? Here we’ll discuss a few time- killing tips to keep you concentrating on the road, as well as having some fun.
The worst is always in the morning when you’re traveling to class, and the traffic starts, and the anxiety starts to fire up. Yes, you might be late to class, but calm down! Throw on your favorite tunes from your iPod, phone, CD, or just the plain radio. Sometimes listening to a good song can really calm the nerves; just don’t be that person who puts the music up so loud that ten other cars behind you can hear your soundtrack. According to Smartmotorist.com, a large number of accidents are caused by those who play music so loud they can’t hear other noises around them such as emergency vehicles, and horns.
Another thing you can listen to while you’re bored in traffic, is a recorded book.. Celebrities are usually the voices on the tapes, which makes it a bit more bearable. I personally like to read, but if George Clooney is talking, I’m listening. These tapes can be found at your favorite bookstore or online, and even free at the library.
Another unique, but great tip is cleaning your car as you drive. Keep the car in gear of course, and use wipes such as Armor All wipes or Clorox wipes to wipe the dust off your dashboard, cup-holder, and leather seats. I love this tip and I’m crazy about my car, so the wipes are always kept in a compartment next to my cup-holder.
The obvious tip is to call a friend in the car, but only safely. Use your blue-tooth if you have it, since most new cars come equipped with it. Venting to a friend about the traffic makes things go by better. Just don’t wake them up in the morning, I usually call my mother since she’s the only person awake at that time. Thanks Mom!
And last but not least, “the falling asleep, I gotta get out of the car tip.” I made this one up, due to my getting restless after a long drive. Every time I drive to school, I always make one stop and that’s usually to get coffee or breakfast. I’ll stop by Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, or 7/11 depending on my route. This way I can get a treat, and I get to take a small walk and stretch my legs. After my stop, I always feel so much better for driving. It’s like a small energy boost, without the caffeine.
So the next time you get in your car and drive for what seems like forever, use one of these tips. Sometimes a drive itself is relaxing because it’s the only time you have to yourself. So use this time wisely, and have fun with it. Send me your ideas at: cwpstpnr@gmail.com because I’m always getting bored in my car.

            With two wins in the last week, the record is now counting 8-0, which is the best season opener in the history of C.W Post men´s soccer. The Pioneers are now ranked by NSCAA among the top 10 in the nation.
After a hat-trick signed by freshman forward Eivind Austboe, accompanied by one goal by sophomore forward Cemil Turan, Post defeated Philadelphia University 4-1, Tuesday.
Post fell behind 0-1 early in the second half, when the Philadelphia Rams were granted a penalty after a foul in the box. The Pioneers picked up the pace at their home field, and made it an even score as sophomore midfielder Watkin served Austbo with a cross, which he placed in the lower left corner. Only three minutes later, Post was up by one after Turan picked up a pass from Austbo, and knocked a 10-yard shot in the net. Post wasn´t finished yet. Austbo put another two goals; one assisted with a long pass from sophomore captain Eirik Bjornoe, and another assisted with a quick-pass by Turan.
“A tragic first half, but I am really happy with scoring three goals,” said Austbo after the game, adding: “We should have won by a lot more.”
Saturday, Post was up against Bridgeport University, in the conference opener for the Pioneers. Facing pressure of a historical record, Post was eager to prove their skills. Sophomore forward Cemil Turan ensured Post with the victory after scoring in the second half. With an assist from junior midfielder Andreas Olsen, Turan gave Post a 1-0 lead that led to another win for the Pioneers. Sophomore goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen kept the goal clean, as the Pioneers broke the record of the best season opener in the history of C.W Post men´s soccer.
“Great team-work, this was really a team-victory,” said sophomore captain Eirik Bjornoe after the game. “Things are going our way at the time, and we just have to continue working really hard to keep this up.”
            The Pioneers next game is away against Dowling University, on October 1st.

The C.W. Post women’s tennis team dropped its conference match to N.Y.I.T. on Wednesday, September 21st, by a score of 1-8.  The loss brought the team’s overall record to 0-3 on the season and 0-2 in conference play.
The Pioneers, who were tabbed fourth in East Coast Conference preseason polls, started their season off at home against the Dowling College Golden Lions on September 10th.  C.W. Post put up a good fight, but the Golden Lions proved to be too much, squeaking out the 7-2 victory over the Pioneers. Short a player, the Pioneers started the series down by two after being forced to default a pair of matches, putting them in a position no team likes to see itself in.
In their next match, the Pioneers faced the nationally-ranked Queens College Knights on September 13th. Despite its  best efforts, the team struggled and failed to take any sets against the dominant Knights, who walked away with the 9-0 win. Seniors Lejla Heco and Morgan Milleisen teamed up to face Queens pair Anna Rodinova and Francesca Fanchin in a competitive doubles match, but the Pioneers’ drive was not enough, as they lost 2-8.
On Wednesday, September 21st, C.W. Post was able to escape the shutout in the very last doubles match of the day. Graduate student Kristen Hettler and junior Erin Lawley took the match with a score of 8-6, giving the Pioneers a little momentum going into the future.
C.W. Post will take the courts again on Monday, September 26th, when the Pioneers attempt to avenge their loss to N.Y.I.T. at home at 3:30 p.m.
