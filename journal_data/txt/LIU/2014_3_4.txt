Dr. Marianne Patinelli-Dubay, the Environmental Philosophy Program coordinator at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, visited the LIU campus to host a lecture about the wonders of the breathtaking parks in the Adirondacks, on Feb. 25. Patinelli-Dubay was invited by Dr. Arthur Lothstein, professor of Philosophy to speak to his class about the beauty found in nature.
Patinelli-Dubay educated students in operated facilities located in the Adirondack Park about many different topics, such as Adirondack Land-Use Ethics, Eco-Phenomenology, Philosophy of Science, Social and Environmental Justice and American Forest seminars.

“My work lies at the philosophical intersections of nature, culture, science and ethics in Adirondack Park, NY. I work with primary through college-aged students, the general public, prisoners, government and non-government agency officials, and employees in the region,” Patinell-Dubay stated on the college’s website, www.esf.edu.
She began her lecture with two poems, Gary Snyder’s “Call of the Wild” from the Turtle Beach collection, and Carl Sandburg’s “Wilderness.” After the poems, she presented maps on a PowerPoint to show us the location and vast size of the Adirondack Park. “Start big and go small,” said Patinelli-Dubay, as the maps first showed all of the United States, then continued to zoom into a topography map of the northern New York State area, where the park is located.
She then spoke about the park’s history and how the Adirondacks came to be through the Conservation movement. The Conversation movement originated in the 19th century and was a political, environmental, and social movement where people sought to protect natural resources and habitats for the future.
In 1892, the Adirondack Park was created by the state of New York after concerns arose for the water and timber resources in the region. She then shared some information about the Adirondacks.
The Adirondacks is “the largest park in the continental United States,” according to Patinelli-Dubay. It consists of six million acres of land. This is enough land to cover the national parks of Yellowstone, Yosemite, Glacier and the Great Smokey Mountains combined, along with the Catskill Mountains. It’s also the “least fragmented, most intact habitat in the eastern United States.” The Adirondacks, despite being a wilderness and biosphere, contains residents. In fact, there are “130,000 year round residents, one million seasonal residents and ten million annual visitors,” she said. “The park is supposed to function to include people as a part of the wilderness.”
Patinelli-Dubay encouraged questions from students after her presentation. The questions ranged from philosophy-based, such as how can there be a “tamed wilderness,” to general inquires, like, “how do you keep the animals contained?” Patinelli-Dubay stated that you must tame a wilderness “by degrees” and cannot tame a large wilderness all at once. As for the animals, she playfully stated, “If you go into a wilderness area, its all on you.” She then clarified by explaining that one has to be smart in the wilderness, and she never has had any personal experiences with animals that weren’t “lovely.”
The Adirondack Park is both a national historical landmark and a publically protected area. It has “no fees to enter, no gates that close at night, just wilderness and the promise of adventure,” as stated on the official Adirondack’s tourism website, visitadirondacks.com.
The park welcomes visitors to camp and explore the beauty of its land. Many travel to the Adirondacks to cross-country ski, hike on the 2,000 miles of trails, snowmobile, and participate in extreme winter experiences, such as mountaineering and ice climbing Agharta Wall, Alcatraz, Ampersand Mountain and countless other areas.
There are also a plethora of mountain biking trails for beginners to advanced bikers. For those who aren’t interested in sports, the Adirondacks contains music festivals, museums, and heritage sights that take place in the 103 towns and villages that thrive within the park.
There are also craft fairs, restaurants and bistros, the Adirondack Coast Wine Trail, and countless other attractions to enjoy.

Mark Simon spoke to students about his company Centerbrook, an architecture firm, during one of the segments of the Outside the Box Lecture Series at LIU Post on Feb. 27 in Hillwood Lecture Hall during common hour. His lecture focused on what he called “The Ten (or so) Commandments of our business.”

These included: Be competent at everything; if clients succeed, we succeed; collaborate and share the credit; listen; set your clients’ expectations; presentation counts; cost counts; bad news travels; problems are opportunities; enjoy the process more than the results; do right, have fun; and keep your sense of humor. Simon went on to explain how these “commandments” are fundamental in running a successful architecture firm.
Simon is one of three founding partners of Centerbrook, and an American Institute of Architecture Firm award winner. He graduated from Yale University’s architecture program in 1972, and pioneered the concept of “green architecture,” using clean cooling and heating energy from the ground. He designed many well-known buildings such as the Lego Imagination Center at Disney World, Nauticus National Maritime Center in Virginia, and the Yale Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center.
Simon and his firm designed everything from classrooms at universities to specialty projects, such as the Lego Center. “It was important to figure out the size of the classrooms, how many people would sit inside of the classrooms, and whether we would tier the classroom at all if we did tier it, how high the tiers would go. I remember a number of people going around with little tape measures measuring tiers of each classroom,” Simon said.
Simon went on to say that the tiers were done to allow the teacher to be able to fully look at and interact with each individual student, establishing a closer connection. His attention to detail and realizing the ultimate goal of the project shows how Mark Simon is an architectural genius. Simon believes in working with the clients — not for them. He talked about how he goes with his clients to consult decisions and makes sure that his clients are completely aware of what goes on.
“I really enjoyed the lecture. At first, I just went to check it out, but I found that I really enjoyed listening to him speak. It was impressive hearing about all of the buildings he designed and all his firm’s awards.
I would definitely check out another Thoughtbox Lecture,” said Christopher Scally, a sophomore majoring in Information Systems.
LIU Post Thoughtbox Lecture Series provides students both at LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn with opportunities to speak to successful business owners. The Outside the Box lecture series will be held at both LIU Post as well as LIU Brooklyn. Following lectures include Hilary Topper on March 25, Eric Ho on April 1, and Jeff Leventhal on April 16.

The debate about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights has been widely featured in recent news. On Wednesday, Feb. 26, Arizona Governor, Jan Brewer, vetoed a proposed state law that would have given business owners the right to refuse service to anyone whose lifestyle conflicts with those who have sincere religious convictions. Was Governor Brewer’s decision the right one?
Every legitimate group of people has the right to special considerations in the makings of laws. In this case, that includes both religious groups and LGBTs. Laws are not just there to stop criminals. Laws are also needed to protect and conserve groups of people and minorities that haven’t enjoyed much freedom in the past.
People may argue that the law is in accordance with the United States Constitution when looking at the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…” Freedom of religion is a treasured and valued part of the supreme law, and it should be. However, using it as grounds for discrimination was not the intent of the founding fathers.
The problem with the Arizona bill was that one group suffers if the other group is allowed that freedom. That is not acceptable. In the making of laws, the laws shall be equal to all with no exceptions. If the law discriminates, the law is in conflict with an article in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the United States adheres to, and has, since the declaration’s creation in 1948.
Article Seven of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: “All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.”
The relevant part for this piece is, “All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.” If the proposed Arizona law stated that an LGBT person could not get served at the local diner because the owner can refuse him or her service on the grounds of religious convictions sanctioned by law, then that is discrimination. That law would not equally protect everyone, which is a violation of article seven.
One of the most important things is to treat everyone equally under the law. That is why it was a good decision that Governor Brewer vetoed the bill.
People must be able to live their lives fully without having to face any discrimination. People must also be able to believe in what they want, and the law should protect them as well, but the law should not favor one group of people over the other.
It is strange (to say it politely) that we, as a society, still have problems accepting people for who they are. It should be a given at this point. People are worth just as much if they are religious or if they are part of the LGBT community, or if they are both or neither.
Equality, people, that’s the good stuff.

It’s a Friday night and you’re drowning in tremendous amounts of homework. Although you’d like to start all the work sitting on your desk, you’ve also been presented with a pretty great offer to spend a night on the town with friends; so, what exactly do you do? As college students, we are given the inescapable power to choose what is best for ourselves because mom and dad are not around to tell us what not to do. Our options are to stay at home and be the studious adult we know we could be, or ditch the homework for a few nights of fun, because it’ll always be there on Sunday morning, right?
It seems as though some of us can never get it right, and balancing an active social life with schoolwork is an act that only a magician can pull off. We spend our time sulking under mountains of homework the night before it’s due, trying to get it right, while admiring those who seem to have their lives well-put together. Quite honestly, we need their tips, or maybe need to spend a day living their lives, if possible. Although the latter is not possible, some students at LIU Post, who know just how to manage their school work and social lives effectively, have shared their tips for those of us, who may be less fortunate in their attempts to balance everything evenly.
“I have a lot of spare time in my school schedule, so I try to do as much as I can,” said Lu Liu, a junior Broadcasting major. “I go to the gym with friends during the weekdays, complete my homework on the weekends, and if I have enough time afterwards, I like to go out and take photos or videos of anything.”
For some students, it is easier to get work done on the weekends. The weekends provide students with plenty of down time and there is no feeling of urgency when getting work completed. Simply taking a break from homework to go to the gym, grab a bite to eat, or maybe some coffee, are just some of the simple ways in which students can slip in some social time with friends before getting back to work.
“I have classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, and work most nights at Rite-aid,” said Eric Eck, a senior Broadcasting major. “I use the late nights when I get home from work to do my homework. No work gets done on Saturdays; that is the time I strictly use to hang out with my girlfriend.”
Students who have jobs seem to have it twice as hard, as they have to also manage to make a schedule around their work hours. Sometimes working and going to school may complicate your weekday schedule, but restricting your weekends to friends, family, or a significant other, is the best way to have a fluid social life without worrying if it will get in the way of your schooling or work.
Whether you are doing all your homework before the weekend, doing homework on your days off from class, or hanging with friends in between schoolwork and a full or part time job, there is no specific way to balance social life and the duties of schoolwork. It is important to find what works best throughout the weekdays and weekends, and stick to the consistent rhythm. There is no perfect way to balance these two things in life, just find what works best for you.

Maria Emdal Otterlei’s alarm goes off at 5:15 a.m., she forces herself out of bed, tiptoes around in order not to wake her roommates up, before heading out into the cold.

It is Thursday in sleepy Hicksville, but Otterlei is heading to the train that will take her to a significantly more eventful place – the city that never really sleeps at all.
30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City is Otterlei’s final destination. The address, more commonly known as “30 Rock,” holds the head office of NBC, and Otterlei’s internship since last semester.
Every Tuesday and Thursday, she interns at the local channel NBC 4. Her day starts at 7:30 a.m., and despite the early mornings, she explains that it is “absolutely worth it.” No wonder why: one of her responsibilities is to welcome, and take care of, celebrities and guests of the show.
Otterlei, who is originally from Alesund, Norway, came to New York in 2011. When she is not at her internship, taking care of celebrities, and getting professional experiences that most people could only dream of, she is finishing her senior year at LIU Post.
On this particular February day, she is about to welcome “Walking Dead” star Norman Reedus. As he arrives in the Visitors Center, she greets him, gives him a pass into the building, and takes him to the correct floor. Subsequently, she ushers him into the green room, and supplies him with food and coffee. When it’s airtime, she makes sure his microphone is on and follows him to the TV studio.
Working close to celebrities has been an unexpectedly friendly experience. “I had pictured some of the celebs [to be] arrogant, but most of them are very down to earth and kind,” she said.
Along with two interns from other New York universities, Otterlei manages a great part of the show’s social media, including Pinterest, Instagram, and Google+ accounts. And the possible competition does not bother her. “I have been an intern for two semesters now, so I’m more experienced than the other interns. I feel more confident and efficient this semester.”
Before getting the internship, Otterlei took the non-credit EEE course at LIU Post, which is designed to help students with resume writing, career research, and job interviewing. In addition, she had previous broadcasting experience from working at a newspaper and radio station back in Norway.
Despite her preparations and previous experience, Otterlei struggled to get an internship. That changed when a friend was offered the internship at NBC, declined it, and recommended Otterlei instead. “I went on a couple of interviews without getting anything, which was necessary because I learned from my mistakes. And that paid off when I finally got the interview with NBC Universal,” she said.
However, the exciting internship does have its downsides. “Commuting between Hicksville and the city takes a lot of energy. Sometimes I work over time, and don’t get home until 8 or 9 p.m.,” Otterlei said. “Considering when I have to go up in the morning, that’s a very long day.”
And the hard lifestyle calls for certain prioritizations. “I sleep in and do homework on the weekends, because the rest of my week is very hectic. One day, I was so busy that I forgot to eat for 11 hours,” she added.
Despite the hectic life style, Otterlei is happy to do it. “I had never in my most spectacular dreams pictured that this could ever happen. The internship has made me more optimistic,” she stated.
“I was always very shy and didn’t admit even to myself that I want to become a reporter. But if you don’t tell anyone, no one is able to help you reach your goal,” Otterlei advises students.
She also claims that people should learn from their mistakes. “Do not give up after one bad interview. Be yourself, but in a professional way, and soak up all the experience you can get,” she said.
Otterlei will be working at NBC until May 2014, and she hopes to get an entry-level job at the TV network afterwards. “However, the media industry in NYC is very hard and competitive,” she said.
As another day of exciting experiences, new celebrities and hard work comes to an end, Otterlei starts her long way home to Hicksville. Most likely she is tired, but perhaps also excited to get home and tell her roommates about her day with that guy from “Walking Dead.”

But who can blame them? The thought of having to buy their own places and cars, provide for themselves and their (eventual) significant other, paying taxes, bills, rent and whatever else that comes through the mailbox; these are daunting thoughts. So although the panic may have already hit home for some, the purpose of this article is to show that internships, while one sign that students are growing up, can be pretty cool.
As a matter of fact, many of LIU Post’s students have been fortunate enough to receive internships that are both relative to
their major, and engaging. Opportunities ranging from working for prestigious law firms, to filming with national networks such as NBC, have contributed to the motivation of college students, while encouraging them to pursue a career in the field in which they were interning. Evidently, cool internships are accessible to all, but who has had the coolest experience?
Kieran Mercer, former soccer player and international alumni, is one of the few Post students who succeeded to intern at the United Nations Organization in New York. Having received an undergraduate degree in Law at the University of Exeter in England, and then gaining a graduate degree at Post in Political Science, Mercer merged his interests in law and politics, and subsequently experienced advisory work and duties at one of the world’s largest international organizations.
“The most surprising aspect of interning at a UN Mission is the almost unlimited access you’re given to the UN on your first day,” Mercer said. “The Delegate Pass gives you access to any open meeting inside the UN, including the Security Council. In addition to being treated like any other delegate, the scope and quality of the debates that can be witnessed are fascinating and often inspiring.”
Mercer commented on how fortunate he is to have had such an opportunity. “The speakers that the UN attracts are often the leading minds in their relevant fields. These very capable people, in conjunction with diplomats from each country, are attempting to answer the world’s most complex challenges. Having the opportunity to listen to these individuals and ask them questions once the meeting has concluded is, in my opinion, unique.”
Mercer’s period of interning at the UN has further sparked his interest in politics, and thus has confirmed his decision in pursuing a career in the field. “I was very cynical about the world of politics before I interned. I believed the common stereotype – most politicians are power hungry and dishonest. I thought young politicians often entered politics with good intentions, but ultimately caved to the pressures, and lost sight of the good work they intended to do. My internship challenged that assumption and proved it wrong,” he said.
“I’ve met and listened to many politicians who have devoted themselves to working for the common good. Many of these have been very humble, and have not sought thanks or notoriety for the work they do. This experience encouraged me to try to emulate such people in the work I do.”
Mercer isn’t the only one experiencing a cool internship. Tamara Garriock, senior Sociology major, has started interning at the non-profit organization of Women’s Fund of Long Island, and like Mercer, she admits that her opportunity has encouraged her to work at a similar organization, once she is done with graduate school. “[Working at the organization] has affirmed my decision to go for my masters of Public Administration/Policy once I graduate from Post, and potentially end up working in a non-profit organization, or for the Canadian government.”
Similarly, Malin Hedberg, senior Business Administration major, agrees. “My internship at Keyhole Financial Services in Glen Cove has given me the opportunity to see and take part in the daily operations at a small financial services company. To work for a financial services firm in New York is a great opportunity for me, because it means that I get to see more of what is out there before I graduate, and it will hopefully give me a better idea of what I want to do later in life. It has inspired me, and I have become more interested in a career in finance.”
So even though the concept of interning during the spring semester, and even over the summer can appear overwhelming and stressful, just remember many internships can be cool, as well as useful – and a great way to jumpstart life in the real world.

Norman Steinberg, a professor in Television Production at LIU Brooklyn, visited LIU Post to talk about his two-year 48-credit M.F.A. in TV Writing and producing for television TV Writers StudioSM in Humanities Hall room 130, on Tuesday, Feb.25, during common hour.

Steinberg shared details about the program, his achievements, and a look at what it is like to be in the television writing and production industry. “The 20-25 students chosen to join the TV Writers Studio will find out what it’s like to be on the day-to-day writing staff of a TV series, where they will experience the joy of collaborating on a pilot script,
and the agony of eating awful Chinese take-out at two in the morning,” Steinberg said.
“[The program] is not about theory. It’s about the nuts and bolts of writing – of becoming an active writer in the industry,” said Steinberg, a veteran screenwriter, director, producer, and show runner.
Each year, a carefully selected 20-25 graduate student writers from across the globe, most from the US, become part of the demanding two-year program. The goal of TV Writers Studio is to educate and develop highly skilled, experienced professionals, with strong portfolios, who will be uniquely prepared to begin careers in the television and new media industries as writers, producers, and entrepreneurs.
Since television production demands that its writers function as a unit, the program concentrates on developing the skills of working collaboratively in creating a one-hour pilot script for a TV series. All classes are held at Steiner Studios in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the largest U.S. film and television production studio complex outside of Hollywood. Students learn to work in an environment that requires them to share and support their ideas. They quickly come to see the benefits of the natural give-and-take that occurs as they create.
The collaborative experience is balanced with the development of the student’s individual writing skills in the conceptualization and writing of his/her individual pilot script, as well as episodes for the jointly written, one-hour pilot script.
Steinberg’s own work has been recognized with various awards. He penned screenplays for numerous films including “Blazing Saddles,” “My Favorite Year,” and “Johnny Dangerously.” In the television arena, he has worn many hats, leaving his mark on programs such as “Cosby,” “When Things Were Rotten,” “Doctor, Doctor,” Showtime’s “Paradise,” and the 2011 CineMax series, “Chemistry.”
“There is a lot to gain out of this program, like learning to be a writer in the industry and honing your craft, but for me the best part has been all of the industry guest speakers Norman Steinberg, my professor and the director of the program, has brought in,” said Gina Massaro, a student in Steinberg’s program, who received her B.F.A. in Film from LIU Post in 2012.
Massaro’s favorite guest speaker was Gary Goldman (“The Land Before Time”), an animator, director, and producer who worked on some of her favorite films growing up. “Without Norman and this program, we would not have access to these people,” she added.
“If you think you want to be a writer, there’s no better place for you than television. It’s a writer’s medium, and there’s really no program in the country that works like the TV Writers Studio. Each week, you come into class and work in a writer’s room: you beat out stories, write outlines and scripts, argue, laugh, and rewrite, rewrite, rewrite,” Massaro said. “I found Norman to be very enthusiastic and optimistic about the opportunities his program and screenwriting can offer in regards to the film industry.
Although he was optimistic, he was also very realistic about how the industry is, and how difficult it is to make a career, but he was inspiring and encouraging. As a film major, your future is very hazy because there is no defined way in how to approach getting a job, but hearing someone speak about the industry as a possibility and not as a far-fetched goal was refreshing,” said Jessica Reyes, a junior Film major.
Steinberg recalled a bit of advice from his mentor and collaborator Mel Brooks (“Space Balls”) that one must share their experience and “pass it on.”At LIU Brooklyn, the man is doing just that, teaching graduate students in the hope that they become better writers and so they, too, can succeed.

Renée Fleming, an American soprano singer known as “the people’s diva,” performed at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday, March 1 at 8 p.m., in a concert benefiting the art center’s endowment. The program featured works ranging from Mozart to Rodgers & Hammerstein to new material featured on Fleming’s recent album, “Guilty Pleasures.”

“You know what, I think I was here once before, but I am not positive,” Fleming told The Pioneer. “Maybe I dreamt it; maybe it was a hope that has now come true. It’s so convenient, and fabulous, and what an amazing audience. I also really loved the hall, acoustically I am very comfortable in the hall and that’s important.”
Following the show, Fleming attended a meet-and-greet reception at the Tilles Atrium with VIP members of the audience, where she had a chance to listen to LIU Post Music students perform. For
10 minutes, the students were unaware that “the people’s diva” was watching. After, she had a chance to speak with the students regarding their studies.
“There is a tremendous amount of interest in singing right now, more in the world today than there has ever been, because of the proliferation of reality television shows and sitcoms,” Fleming said. “Everybody wants to sing, so I think it’s really about thinking. First of all, you have to learn the craft, which takes a tremendous amount of practice. It’s an old tradition based on a quite stringent set of requirements, not just the voice and technique, but languages and movement on stage.”
Fleming noted that individuality is a key to success as an artist. “I think it is also important now to be individual – to figure out who you are that would set you apart from everyone else,” she continued. “But truly, the best people rise to the top. There is no substitute for talent and hard work.”
Fleming performed at the Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial in 2009, for the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace in 2012, and on CBS’s Late Show with David Letterman in 2013. Last month, Fleming became the first classical singer in history to perform the National Anthem at the Super Bowl XLVIII. The broadcast on Feb. 2, seen by a record-breaking 111.5 million viewers in the United States, became the most-watched TV show in U.S. history.
“It was really an incredible experience,” Fleming said. “There was a tremendous amount of anxiety leading up to it because it’s one of those things that if you make even the smallest mistake it would be in your obituary. It stays with you for life. I also felt like I was representing other classical musicians, and I wanted to make sure that everybody felt comfortable with the performance. Then finally, it’s how strongly people feel about the anthem. They care about it; it means something to them. I had uncles and relatives who all said this is the way it should go, and who gave you their opinion. I thought, my God, what a responsibility.”
On July 10, 2013, President Barack Obama awarded Fleming with the 2012 National Medal of Arts in the White House’s East Room. This honor is considered the highest award presented to artists by the government. A winner of the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo, Fleming has hosted a variety of television programs including the Metropolitan Opera’s Live in HD series for movie theaters and TV, and “Live from Lincoln Center” on PBS.

Students, faculty, and staff gathered in the Hillwood Commons lecture hall on Feb.25 at 7 p.m. to attend a free advance private screening of Samuel Goldwyn Films’ “Better Living Through Chemistry.” The film, which stars Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde, Michelle Monaghan, Jane Fonda, and Ray Liotta, will be in theaters on March 14.

“Better Living Through Chemistry” is the darkly comedic story of Douglas Varney (Rockwell): an unhappily married, uptight chemist who takes over the business of his domineering father-in-law. Varney soon begins abusing his drug stock after he meets a new customer – the alluring bad influence that is Elizabeth Roberts (Wilde). Varney’s otherwise uneventful life, highlighted by providing prescriptions to his customers, and trying to be a positive influence for his 12-year-old son, spirals out of control. He meets regularly with Roberts to party, and his passive world becomes full of adventure. Varney’s ego inflates, as he develops an addiction to pills and to his affair with Roberts.
Attendees composed predominantly of Film, Theater, and Media Arts Department majors, and they were able to ask questions directly to the co-directors and writers David Posamentier and Geoff Moore, who sat for a Q&A moderated by Norman Steinberg, professor at LIU Brooklyn’s TV Writer Studio.
Steinberg was lively and investigative, gearing the discussion toward informing students of the realities, difficulties, and joys of the creative industry, especially as television and film writers. Posamentier and Moore kept the discussion casual, and thanked the University for holding the screening. “Pay attention, filmmakers,” said Steinberg, “Because this could be you. What you see here are two filmmakers and their first film.”
Posamentier and Moore discussed casting changes and iffy financing. In 2010, “Better Living Through Chemistry” was looking to be a financial golden-child to producers, who maintained interest with the casting of Jeremy Renner. At the time, Renner was making waves with his work on “The Hurt Locker,” which earned him several Best Actor nominations.
Sadly, Renner had to leave the project due to his newly scheduled blockbusters like “The Bourne Legacy,” and “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.” With Renner’s departure, Jennifer Garner (“Dallas Buyers Club”), who was set to play the character of Elizabeth, also left. Thankfully, Rockwell, who had worked with Wilde on “Cowboys vs Aliens,” expressed interest. The rest of the cast filled out soon after. Posamentier and Moore have worked together as writing partners for years, and their story is one showing the often arduous path into the industry, like the Greek myth of Sisyphus: a man who was forced to carry a boulder up a hill every day, for it to fall down before next morning.
“In the midst of putting this [film] together, we probably had four or five other jobs as writers,” said Moore. “We’ve been writing for 10 years, and we still continue to write. That’s 10 years of actually working. Plus, a lot of time beforehand, before we had an agent, before [anybody] was willing to pay us.”
Posamentier noted that they have been fortunate enough to have access in the Writers Guild of America, a screenwriting union, and been able to make a living editing scripts and selling TV Pilots, many of which are not produced. “The failing percentage is so off the charts that if you get two of every 10 projects through, that’s a huge success,” he said. “Even one of 10 is a huge success. So, you have to get really, really accustomed to failure. Early on, it’s a tough pill to swallow, but you get used to it.” “Better Living Through Chemistry” marks their first directional collaboration.
Halfway into the screening, there was a malfunction with the Blu-Ray disk player, and viewers had to wait 15 minutes while staff scrambled to fix the problem. Water bottles and snacks were distributed to ease the waiting. The film began lagging, to the point where it skipped back to the first scene. The filmmakers briefly stepped on stage to begin the Q&A, before the problem was fixed.
After the screening, a reception was held by the University in the SAL Gallery. Students, faculty, and the filmmakers continued their discussion as they ate catered food and observed student artworks. A portrait painting featured in the film of Wilde, her on-screen husband (played by Ray Liotta) and their two intimidating German Shepard dogs adorned the wall, and was donated to the school by the filmmakers to be auctioned off for student scholarships.
LIU President Kimberly Cline attended the event, and was eager to point out the benefit of having opportunities such as film screenings on campus. “I think we have a great tradition. Our School of Visual and Performing Arts is renowned around the area,” said Cline. “We are beginning to be known as a destination for the arts, and that is a good thing. [It] means that for students, you will have more events to attend.”

As hip-hop listener for over 10 years, I have become fascinated with the genre. The trends, the fashion, the subjects, the culture, and the changing focus of the emcees has kept me engaged in the genre for years, and will continue to do so into my adult life. I have always loved the genre for its lack of many instruments other than a turntable – or more recently, a computer and DJ production program. The fact that all you need is lyricism over electronic drums, hi-hats, crashes, and a sample makes the music very accessible for the creator, and that alone has kept me coming back.

Although hip-hop started in 1977 in New York City, 37 years later the objective is still the same for Lil Herb: A young, 17-year-old burgeoning rapper from Chicago’s Eastside. On February 17, Lil Herb dropped his debut mixtape, “Welcome to Fazoland.” The mixtape is a dark themed view into the life of a kid from, what the FBI now calls, the murder capital of the United States, and growing up in 21st century Chicago gang culture. This millennial culture has since made its imprint on hip-hop history by creating “Drill Muzik,” a sub-genre of “Trap Music,” which is essentially a sub-genre of “gangster rap.”
The 20-year-old themes of gangsta rap still hold true for Drill: You express how you see the world, which is for many of these young individuals, a life of circumstantial violence and crime. Lil Herb certainly does create Drill music, a style of hip-hop that is distinct by its nihilistic flow delivery, dark-synths, skittering machine-gun like hi- hats, thundering 808s (slang for bass) and dead-souled party vibe. At its greatest points, the style is hard, cold, and never shows signs of remorse.
This could be interpreted quite literally; many of the genres most popular figures, like Chief Keef, Lil Durk, and Lil Reese,
have all been accused of or have committed acts of violence, even if they themselves aren’t directly involved. They are all well-documented gang members, and their peers have not received million dollar deals, so they are still on the south side committing crimes, which in turn affects the spotlight of their now celebrity friends.
However, Lil Herb is different in two areas: his gang affiliation and his unrelenting poetic skill, a skill that mirrors his east coast forefathers rather than his Drill contemporaries. When you hear Lil Herb, you immediately hear the sounds of New York City rappers from the 90s, like Jadakiss, Styles P, Camron, and Jay-Z, all which express hip-hop in the truest poetic manner. You listen to these rappers as if they were anthropological street speakers, for they have perfected their poetic craft, illustrating their lives and stories through rhythmic speech. Lil Herb can rap better than his Chicago peers, and that’s what is making his mix tape receive rave reviews from numerous music critics.
Lil Herb’s mix tape starts with samples of his verses from previous singles, prior to his 2014 debut, expressing to the listener that, yes, this may be his debut, but Herb is by no means a rookie. He’s been in the studio since 2011. Due to this new YouTube music culture, an artist does not necessarily need a label, MTV, or an album to push out videos or songs – an artist now has a platform to release singles on the Internet. The intro also illustrates his rapid-fire flow that hits you like a punch to the face: the type of flow that turned the lives of street kids into film adaptations, like 2009’s “Notorious.”
The standout song, “At The Light,” is a grim and tough track, produced by fellow Chicago native DJ L. A telling moment in the song is when Herb describes a traffic light as not only a safe way to facilitate the movement of cars, but a place where his enemies could easily catch him off guard and kill him. “Gotta look to my left and my right, I’ll be damned I get left (as in left for dead) at the light, summer time, I remember them nights.” When Herb talks of violence, it’s usually as a result of pain for a deceased friend and his back is against the wall. “Me and Kobe off ACT with the sprite, he just left us and they took his life, wish the lord would just let him fight, but don’t trip man it’s gon be aight, Cuz I got lil dudes tryna earn stripes, I could write them a check for your life, they might walk up and check you tonight.”
In the reflective track “Mamma I’m Sorry,” Herb reminisces on his past actions, the effect it has on his mother, and his plans for the future. “Definition of a woman, when our problems was taken over you brought us from under, as a youngin’ you always told me I won’t need for nothin’, I just never settled for less cause I can’t see you strugglin’, that’s why I got it on my own and I stayed away from home cause I ain’t want my sister growin’ up, watching me doing wrong.” Herb doesn’t stop there, he has plans for his mother’s well-being, “All I wanna do is move you and my grandma out the state put y’all in some nice estate, name on ya license plate so I grind like it’s my time, even if I die today.”
The entire mixtape is filled with lyricism over dark and cold beats. Herb comes off as a desperate rapper who’s out of options — that’s because he really is. His lyricism will be the source of his success, to better his undesired living and social conditions of his South Side Chicago neighborhood.

The Student Art League (SAL) is a club with over 30 members devoted to fostering the artistic community on campus. Members take part in arts events and gallery openings, as well as helping other clubs and organizations on campus with creative services. Essential to the club is its open-armed admission of all students interested in growing their creative sweet tooth, while expressing school spirit.
“I try to encourage and support the students in their goals for the club,” said Winn Rea, the faculty adviser and a professor in the Art Department. Working in tandem with co-presidents Daniele Savarese, a junior Art Education major, and Alexandra Vicidomini, a sophomore Art Therapy major, Rea and the club have set their ambitions high, branching into entrepreneurial ventures like a gallery shop to solidify the legitimacy of a club which, until recently, had shaky attendance.
“I was introduced to the idea of the Student Art League in the first semester of my freshman year. It was a club previously here on campus that had fallen through, and Professor Rea presented the idea of reinventing and restarting the club here on campus,” noted Vicidomini. This reinvention occurred more than a year ago.
Vicidomini and Savarese, who was a sophomore at the time, both ran for president, but compromised to split the position in an attempt to more fairly represent the freshmen and sophomore classes within the club.
Savarese had an immediate interest in the group when she set foot on campus. “I was first introduced to the SAL when I visited Post on Admitted Students Day, and immediately knew this was something I’d love to be a part of,” she said. “[Professor Rea] was the one who persistently encouraged me to run for a board member position – I’m really glad she did. Since I’ve [joined] SAL, I’ve made great friends and have had a lot of fun at our events.”
Now, with a more secure foundation, the club is looking to organize new and more ambitious ventures. “The most exciting project is the development of [an] art gallery store that will allow people from throughout the university – not just art students – to sell their creative wares on consignment,” Rea said. The professor noted that taking advantage of entrepreneurial opportunities on campus allows a student to get the most out of their college experience.
The Gallery Shop is currently in development, with cases and fixtures being installed to house merchandise. For the store, the SAL is looking for hand made objects such as mugs, bows, vases, and scarves. In addition, they are looking for original designs to be printed on limited edition mugs, stickers, t-shirts, posters, and iPhone cases. Work is to be displayed and sold for 30 days at a time.
“[The Gallery] is open to students, teachers and staff, and we’re planning to have weekly attractions, such as artists making their work on the spot to be sold,” said Vicidomini.
On Monday, Feb. 24, the SAL co-hosted a carnival event with CSA in which the club ran a Spin Art Table at their station. It was an activity for students to participate in during their common hour.
On March 24, the club will teach students Turkish water marbling, a method of surface design that produces marble-like patterns, during common hour. The club will also “be painting the sliding doors in Hillwood for Admitted Students Day, and painting ramps for the Medal of Honor Challenge later this semester,” added Vicidomini.
Another event is the traditional paint splatter booth during Homecoming. “We raise money by selling paint filled balloons for people to throw at our members. It’s so much fun and everyone seems to enjoy it,” said Savarese.
Contact danielle.savarese@my.liu.edu and alexandra. vicidomini@my.liu.edu for further information. The SAL meets Wednesdays in Hillwood Room 218 during common hour. Students looking to potentially sell their work in the Gallery shop can contact liustudentartleague@gmail.com.

Have your friends always told you that you were funny? Do people laugh at your jokes? Say Anything Improv Club is a student-run comedy club on campus that has been around for a few years. Currently the club is made up of 37 members, and membership is as simple as coming to meetings. The club is always open to new people and is very welcoming.
The group holds hour-long meetings on Monday nights at 8:30 PM in the Little Theater. At the Say Anything Improv Club, students tell their stories through short- and long- form improvisation, with a focus on creative expression and team building. The club is trying to put together a television show and is searching for new members to help with sketches as writers and actors.
“Say Anything is for everyone,” said Doug Robinson, sophomore Theater major and President of the club. “Whether you’ve done improv for years, or it’s your first time getting on stage. At the end of the day, everything you do is improv, so why not have more fun with it?” Robinson added.
“[Robinson] hosts the meetings where we perform long and short form improv,” said Marisa Kofmehl, a sophomore Public Relations major and Public Relations Chair for Say Anything. “Short form is what is seen on [television shows like] ‘Whose Line is it Anyway?;’ Long form is what would be seen at the Upright Citizen’s Brigade in New York City,” Kofmehl said.
“With the help of students, it will be possible to write and perform longer comedy sketches. The group is looking for interested students who would like to write comedy sketches that range from 30 seconds to five minutes, and for students just looking to join,” continued Kofmehl. “By joining Say Anything, you are entering a gateway to better public speaking skills and on-stage talent.”
Last spring on the main stage of the Little Theatre, Say Anything held a “Whose Line is it Anyway?” event, where skits, such as Scenes From a Hat, Props, and many others as seen on the show, were performed. During meetings, various improv games are held in a very professional setting.
“Say Anything is a great opportunity to get into the comedy world and express yourself. Having this club at Post creates an atmosphere friendly to all, and can help form a good on-stage personality, as well as having fun and goofing around with your peers,” said Brendan Figueras, a sophomore Theater Production major.

Coming straight from a Conference Championship win, the women’s swim team entered the ECAC Championships with only half a roster, facing some tough opponents at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, M.D., during the weekend of Feb. 28 to March 2.
“We have seven girls going down to Navy this weekend, with the meets being another chance for us to swim fast and race different teams,” said senior Chelcee Hew.
The Pioneers started off well on Friday, Feb. 28, by reaching the A finals twice, both times in team events. In the 200-yard freestyle relay, four Pioneers teamed up and made their way through to the finals where they marked a time of 1:40:31, and hit the wall as team number six. Continuously, in the doubled-up medley relay, the green and gold swam home in seventh place by finishing at a time of 4:06:55.
Day two in the pool ended in a new pair of top-eight finishes, once again recorded in team relays. First, the senior relay squad, along with sophomore Kat Kabaza, took on the 800-yard medley and finished sixth, after a time of 7:55:75. The Pioneers clocked in eighth-place in the 200-yard medley relay, giving the team some extra fresh points to add on to their total count.
During the wrap-up of the Championships on Sunday, March 2, the Pioneers did not record any new A finals, but held on to a ninth-spot in the overall meet. The total score was counted to 98 points for Post, which was considered a good championship, according to two of the Pioneer contestants. “Our team goal was to have fun and enjoy our last meet together, and individually, I just wanted to have fun and race well in my last meet of my swimming career,” Hew said. Fellow teammate sophomore Kirsty Elliot agreed, saying, “Our aim for the meet was to enjoy ourselves and get a chance to go up against some big schools.”
While some of the girls have made their last performance as Pioneers, the other half of the squad will be heading to Nationals in a week. The four-day meet will take place in Geneva, Ohio, where the green machine is looking to swim home the trophy for the second time in a row.

Despite holding onto a slim 4-3 lead at the intermission, the No. 1 ranked Pioneers opened up the second half on a tear as they capped off a 9-1 run to secure their first victory of the 2014 season Saturday at Hickox Field, in Brookville, N.Y. with 14-7 over Bloomsburg.
The Pioneers got off to a hot start with two goals within the first seven minutes, courtesy of senior midfielder Katie Rotan. They continued to play with fire as sophomore attacker Emily Delaney tacked on an unassisted goal at the 12:32 mark in the first half. Post was playing with a lot of fire, and had an early 8-2 advantage in shots. As the first half came to a close, the Pioneers needed to regroup as they began to lose some momentum after Bloomsburg narrowed the early deficit with two goals from junior attacker Julie Falk, and an unassisted goal by junior attacker Patrice Coleman at the 27:19 mark. At the half, Post dominated in shots 13-8, but Bloomsburg had gained some confidence by scoring three of the last four tallies in the period.
The Lady Pioneers remained aggressive on the field and began to take complete control, despite the freezing conditions. They capitalized on every scoring opportunity en route to a 9-1 spark to blow up the game in the early stages of the second half. Senior attacker/ midfielder Samantha Losco nicked three quick goals. In addition to Losco›s dominant performance, senior attacker Jackie Sileo and senior midfielder Katie Rotan accounted for two goals apiece during the run.
Losco (4 G, 1 A) and Sileo (3 G, 2 A) each had five points leading the scoring for the Pioneers. Sileo completed her hat trick at the 26:10 mark of the second half. Rotan also had a very impressive game accumulating four goals and four draw controls. Freshman defender/midfielder Cara Douglas also chipped in with her first collegiate goal at the 21:34 mark of the second half. The Pioneers’ defense played a huge factor, led by senior defender Melissa Rohr, who demonstrated excellent leadership skills with great communication along with senior goalkeeper Katie Hannan, who had 12 saves in the pen. Rohr gathered four ground balls to lead the squad.
The top-ranked Pioneers had the edge in shots (29-22) and ground balls (15-8). Bloomsburg controlled the draw clash (14-9). The Pioneers were also very efficient on clears (17-19) and made (1-2) free position shots. The Huskies (0-1), led by former LIU Post All-American Mallory Poole, were unable to hang around after the green and gold immediately flew away with the lead in the second half.
Meghan McNamara, Pioneers head coach, achieved her 100th-career victory with Saturday’s win. McNamara coached an outstanding game and is now only four wins shy of Karen MacCrate, who coached the LIU Post women›s Lacrosse team from its inauguration season in 2000 through the 2007 season.
McNamara and the top-ranked Pioneers will collide with No 4. Le Moyne, Wednesday March 5th, at Hickox Field. The opening draw is slated for 3 p.m.

The men’s lacrosse team hosted the first ECC game of the season on the Hickox field, which is currently under construction, and drew the longest straw after an even start against Mercy College at Brookville, N.Y. on Saturday, March 1.
The field was partly protected from the cold morning breeze by the thick walls of snow that had grown high after last month’s many snowstorms.
The team came from a win in their first game of the season, and wanted to start their ECC’s on the same track. “For this season we have the same goal as every year, which is to still be playing Memorial Day weekend and take home the trophy,” said sophomore Anthony DeLuca, referring to the National Championships coming up later this spring.
Despite a bad start, the green machine managed to come back in the game, and held a 3-3 result after the first quarter. The second quarter remained even, due to great reactions from the Pioneer goalkeeper T.J.
DiCarlo, who stood for seven consecutive saves only within 15 minutes, which stopped the guests from taking advantage of their dominance.
Instead, the Pioneers knocked off the show in the third quarter by finding the net five times in a row. Thereafter, Post held their leading mark. The final score was recorded to 14-7, in which sophomore attacker Matty Beccaris became the Pioneers’ winning point-maker with his five goals and three assists.
After the game, DeLuca emphasized the importance of not taking on any opponents too easily. “We need to approach every game the same way, and we can never look past any team because of the high level of competition throughout Division II,” he said.
Next up for Head Coach John Jez and his team will be another home game: Saturday’s ECC-clash against University of the District of Columbia, on March 8. The game is scheduled for 11 a.m.
