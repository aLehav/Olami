With new colors and a newly combined team, the bowling team is back on the lanes with their goal set on winning the Northeast Conference trophy.
The team has a total of 13 bowlers, six from the Post campus, four from the Brook-lyn campus, and three newly recruited freshmen. Leading the team is Head Coach Kayla Jones, who previously coached the Blackbirds for seven seasons. She lead the Blackbirds to their first ever conference championship in 2016 and broke the program record for wins the following year with 75 won games. 
Coach Jones said she didn’t know what to expect when she first heard of the announcement of the merger of the Post and Brooklyn campuses and that there was a fear of the unknown. “Change is scary, and of course, this was a major change,” she said.
Despite the uncertainty, Coach Jones said her team handled the transition well, both on and off the lanes. “The girls get along very well off the lanes and I believe each day on the lanes we get better at communication, cohesion, and helping each other be the best we can for the team,” she said.  
Coach Jones also said the unification made the team stronger and generated depth. “It’s a comfortable feeling knowing we can change someone in and out,” she said. “Having a lot of talent is a good thing because each player brings something differ-ent to the table and that is what makes us a stronger team.”
The Sharks have an overall record of 21 wins and 12 losses, being 7-3 in conference. Coach Jones said the conference the team plays in is very tough, with six teams ranked among the top 25 in the nation. “It’s strong competition every weekend, every match,” she said. 
Junior bowler Emily Cavanaugh was a top competitor on the Pioneers’ bowling team the previous two seasons and she hopes to show that the new team can perform this season. 
“As a team we hope to prove people wrong; that we can overcome the obstacle of the merge and come together as a strong, winning NEC team,” she said.  
The team’s biggest event this season was the Northeast Conference meet in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Nov. 9 and Sunday, Nov. 10. The team left the meet with five wins and one loss, which earned them first place in the league. 
Senior bowler Tyler Karpinecz played for the Blackbirds last year and experienced her team falling short in the NEC Conference Championship, something she wants to prevent from happening again. She sees this year’s team’s recent success at the NEC meet as a positive indicator. 
“Going 5-1 and being placed first right after the first NEC meet is something that will only motivate us to keep that spot,” she said. “The Sharks are hungry this season and there’s nothing stopping us.” 
The Shark’s next competition is the UMES Hawk Classicon on Friday, Nov. 22 to Sunday, Nov. 24 in Millsboro, Delaware.

The Pratt Fitness and Recreation Center offers a multitude of fitness classes for students to partake in throughout the week. The classes are open to all undergrad or graduate students and those with a membership. Classes are held in the multi-purpose room of the Pratt building, with the exception of the spin class, which is held in BlueFit, the spin room in Hillwood Commons. 
Classes offered include: spin, total body workout, yoga, recovery yoga, circuit training, TRX, Zumba, and conditioning. The classes are held Monday through Friday. Each of the instructors are certified trainers and are unaffiliated with the university, typically brought in from local gyms to teach a class. 
Junior James Steindl has taken multiple yoga classes through the Pratt Center. “Afterward you feel so great and that’s why I continue to go every week,” Steindl said. “I leave yoga feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and recreated.”
Another fitness option offered at is personal training. The purpose of this feature is to teach people how to work out and utilize exercise programs. Members can sign up in the office located at Pratt by giving their availability throughout the following weeks. Based on their schedule, the members are matched with a trainer and they meet for an assessment. In the assessment, the members help the trainer understand their fitness goals and give the trainer insight about where they currently are physically. Then, the members will meet with the trainer regularly over a two or three-week period to create and understand a program. After that the members will continue their program on their own after learning how to achieve their goal and what to do in the gym. 
Martin Guillet, associate director for recreational sports fitness and intramurals, talked about the purpose of the personal trainer program. “It’s not like valets, where you go and pay to have that personal time. We’re trying to teach people how to exercise for themselves.”
The fitness classes and personal training program at Pratt are available to all members. Current students are automatically considered members as it comes with university fees. The membership is also available to LIU faculty, staff and alumni for a cost. The cost for faculty and staff is $165 per year. The prices for alumni vary depending on the amount of years since they graduated. “They [the university] makes it cheaper for younger alumni members because they don’t know if they have a job yet,” Guillet said. For graduates of the year prior, the annual rate is $100. The membership fee then climbs to $270, and after five years, the annual fee is $400. 
The Pratt Fitness Center always looks to create more opportunities for students. “We are always trying to expand services and classes, so if people have ideas and things, they can just share with us,” Guillet said.

For most student athletes, being in a sport is a full time job. The daily routine of waking up, eating, attending classes, practicing, doing homework, taking time to relax and sleep can become a blur. But there are ways to manage it all. 
Some student athletes have issues with time management and developing a solid work ethic, but for senior speech-pathology major Isla Powell, a member of the women’s lacrosse team, organization is key. Powell set up a healthy diet, excels in her classes through class participation and attendance, and manages her work well. “I’ve gotten into the habit of doing my schoolwork as soon as it is assigned instead of procrastinating,” she said. 
Junior criminal justice major Abigail Timmins, one of the rugby team captains, had a different experience. For Timmins, it’s hard to find a proper balance. “It is something I have been trying to figure out for the past three years,” she said. “With class schedules chang-ing every semester and a sport with two sea-sons it’s hard to manage it all perfectly.” 
Challenges for student-athletes in Division I sports extend beyond the classroom. Their sport affects many aspects of their life, especially when it comes to being social. Freshman broadcasting major and football player Spanky Dixon said he molds his life around athletics. “Most of my decisions always involve me in thinking and including the pros and cons of how it will affect me for practice or games.” Dixon said that little things, such as staying uplate to watch a movie with friends, can affect his athletic performance, and are decisions he has to make all the time. 
Powell agreed that sports are a major part of her life, and said they have a positive impact on how she shapes it. “I’m not sure where I would be or what type of student I would be without the knowledge and experience I’ve gained through sports,” she said. 
The tug of war between sports and social life is a recurring issue many student athletes face everyday. This constant battle can put a lot of pressure on their mental health. “Playing a sport definitely adds to the mental strain of be-ing a college student. However, it’s a valuable asset to learn on the balancing and prioritizing of events for out of college,” Timmins said. 
On the other hand, sophomore cross country runner Anita Mikowski said that running helps her with her mental health. “When I run I am able to block out all my other problems and think about just running,” she said. “It’s like running is my therapy and without it I would be very lost.”
Though athletes go through trying times like losing games, suffering injuries or challenges with balancing life, many say they wouldn’t change their experience. “Playing my sport has given me the opportunity to meet many new people and develop life long friendships. It has also given me the opportunity to play at the collegiate level while also receiving an education,” Timmins said. 
Dixon also said there is a bright side of being a student athlete. “Football can create bonds and friendships that overweigh every-thing wrong that’s going on in your life, and provide you an outlet to release all the built up tension,” he said. Growing up in a single parent home with his mother working multiple jobs to provide for him and his brother, Dixon said football gave him a second family. “I will never forget the relationships I formed from football and continue to form today,” he said. “I will forever be thankful.”     
When faced with adversity, the student athletes say they thrive. “My sport made me more comfortable around new people and made me a more outspoken person who works well with others,” Powell said. “This will help me tremendously in the future.”

Between balancing school, work, friends and family, it is safe to say that your mental state endures more than it needs to. As young adults, it is crucial to find a medium where you can balance your entire life on one plate, without putting too much stress on your mental health. 
Strong mental health and a healthy con-scious leads to a happy and healthy life. Without the positivity of a healthy mind you can see the effects of depression and anxiety start to set in.
Your daily diet can be a direct correlation to someone’s overall mental health. Foods that are high in protein and nutrients give your body the energy it needs to have a successful day. Foods that are high in fats, sodium and carbohydrates don’t give your body the nutri-ents it needs. Foods of this kind can lead to obesity, heart ailments and even a decline in mental health in the long run.
Students agree that eating healthy is essential for a productive lifestyle. “When I don’t watch what I eat, I am exhausted and don’t live my life to the fullest,” junior economics major, Lauren Levine, said. 
“Eating healthy allows me to feel better on the inside and out.” Eating healthy foods can lead to a stronger mental state, while the consumption of unhealthy foods can lead to weaker mental health. These days, some people are concerned about how they appear in front of other people. If you tend to not eat healthy on a daily basis, this may affect how you feel you present yourself to others. 
The smallest change can be made one snack at a time. Try to have some fruit once a day, or switch out your fries and ketchup for celery and peanut butter. Soon enough, you’ll start to feel improvements in your mood and mental health.

Take a look around campus and students will probably notice them – in the hands of their peers, on desks and piles of them in the garbage cans. They will see the white cup with the green mermaid staring back at them, and smell the beans roasting in the early morning. It’s the lifeblood of college students: coffee.
College students and coffee have long standing relationship. Coffee is there for students when they need to stay awake and focused during class. When faced with heavy workloads and limited time, coffee is always there to keep students energized.
Students on campus describe coffee as a necessity for their studies. “I would say it definitely helped a little bit academic wise because I started to need it in order to fuel myself to get through class,” Marc Guglielmo, a sophomore accounting major, said. “If I didn’t have [coffee] during class I can definitely see myself dozing off and not paying attention.”
Lauren Levine, a junior economics major, thinks of coffee not only as an academic tool, but also as an asset to her safety as well. Levine is a commuter, and drives upwards of 45 minutes to campus each day. Drinking coffee ensures that she won’t fall asleep behind the wheel. 
An energy boost isn’t the only benefit that can be derived from coffee drinking. According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, several studies have found that moderate coffee consumption can help prevent health issues such as cancer, type two diabetes, gall-stones and more. 
Drinking coffee in moderation has several health benefits, but drinking too much of it has its drawbacks. Caffeine dependence can lead to negative effects once the energy from the drink wears off. Guglielmo says that he sometimes gets “energy crashes” where he doesn’t feel motivated to do anything once the effects of caffeine wear off. Other times, he can get headaches if he doesn’t drink at least one cup of coffee a day.
Despite its popularity, coffee isn’t the only drink to offer a quick pick-me-up. Grace Solomita, a masters student in the school counseling program, dislikes the smell and taste of coffee. So instead, she takes naps and exercises often maintain her energy.
Like most things, coffee can be good in moderation, but can have negative effects when taken in obsessive amounts. College students have a lot of responsibilities and obligations they need to fulfill, and a cup of coffee can come a long way in making sure they get done. It is important to remember the impact it can have on your health.

On Monday, Dec. 2, the Center for Healthy Living will be hosting its annual Pet Therapy program. Students will have the opportunity to destress by playing with dogs on the second floor of Hillwood Commons during common hour.
Pet therapy can help reduce stress, anxiety and depression, as well as improve self-esteem and social skills, according to the Center for Healthy Living. With finals quickly approaching pet therapy can be a much needed escape from the usual college workload.
The Center of Healthy Living has been working together with Bidawee, an organization that runs several animal adoption centers in New York, to bring therapy dogs to campus for the past five years. 
The annual event has always been held during finals week for the fall semester. Due to the overwhelmingly positive response from students, the Center for Healthy Living hopes to host the event again during the spring semester.
Cindy Woldar, the associate director for the Center of Healthy Living, says that they are “always trying to come up with new ways to provide support for our students,” which lead to the creation of this event.

The student body was greeted by something unique: music, on Tuesday, Nov. 5. Starting at 1:15 p.m., chimes resonated from the bell tower on the roof of Pell Hall. Though the sounds may seem peculiar to some new faces on campus, the bell chimes were a part of the Post campus for years, and had only recently stopped sounding. 
The bells now ring every 15 minutes; hourly chimes are the staple of many major universities across the nation, including Cornell University and the University of Chicago. These chimes, and the bell towers which house them, become a point of pride for some schools. 
Patrick Aievoli, a graphic design professor, said the clarion bells add a “wonderful academic feel to the campus,” and that keeping them going adds a legacy to the campus and student life. This sentiment is also shared by students. 
Austin Webber, a visiting student from Oklahoma University taking LIU math courses, said, “I like the bells because they remind you of historical universities and what created the education system in the United States. It creates a time structure and a sense of order,” he said.
When asked why the bells returned in the middle of the fall semester, Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, said the bells operated on electrical power, which was broken but is now restored. 
“I have asked my team to monitor the operation of it and correct any issues if they arise,” Fergus said.
When moving from class to class across campus, students will now be able to track the time from the chimes. 
At the top of the hour, the tower will play a four part musical tune; at quarter after, one part of the tune plays; at half past, two parts; and at a quarter ‘til, three parts play. The hour is marked by a series of gongs, with the num-ber of gongs corresponding with the hour from one to 12. At noon, students can hear a new musical tune – the LIU Post Alma Mater.

For the first time, the Post Theatre Company will present a hybrid staged reading and performance as part of the 2019-20 season with “Fahrenheit 451,” presented by the graduate student company.
This hybrid performance is unique in its casting; it will cast underclassmen in addition to graduate students. This aspect of the performance was inspired by Ray Bradbury’s book being the common read for the class of 2023. “For the people in the freshman class, this a just a staged reading, and for the people in the graduate class, it is a full production,” director Melanie Armer said. The entire cast consists of 14 students, five of which are graduate students.
Bradbury transformed his fictional novel into a stage play script in 1979, and the performance will follow this version of the plot. “Fahrenheit 451” follows the story of Guy Montag in his search through a post-apocalyptic landscape of America. Montag works his way through understanding the ramifications of his profession as a “fireman,” where in this world the firemen start fires and do not put them out. Their job is to remove all books from citizen’s reach by burning them in order to eradicate literature from the country’s culture. The title of the piece is reflective of the temperature at which book paper ignites: 451 degrees Fahrenheit.
“Ray Bradbury wrote the story in 1953, in all of this he’s predicting a future that would be something like now, maybe a few years from now,” Armer said. The book covers a theme of how technology plays into the loss of humanity. Concerning the play, “He [Bradbury] talks about people wearing earbuds and not paying attention to the world because the world is just whizzing past,” Armer said. “It made sense to me to leave the language of that technology the same so we can actually hear that this is a prediction, which gives us the room to compare it to what’s happening right now.”
Jennifer Chaney, a sophomore acting major, is cast as a leading role in the show. “I’m an undergrad in a grad production,” she said. “Now I’m here working with a bunch of people I normally would not get the opportunity to.” Chaney submitted a virtual audition in response to an urgent casting email sent out to company members by Heather Drastal, PTC’s general manager, on behalf of Armer.
Chaney plays the roles of Holden, a fireman, and Helen. Holden is unfamiliar with the concept of being able to read freely because when he came into the world, books were illegal, according to Chaney. “Helen is also in the oblivious world of living through the television set and unaware that there is knowledge out there,” she said. 
Armer wants to make sure that Ray Bradbury’s message is clearly spoken through the text and through the production. “One of the ways we are excited about doing that is because it is a combined production, we’re looking at the text in two different ways,” Armer said. “One is in a learned and rehearsed process and the other is in a staged reading process which incorporates the books themselves.”    There will be seven performances of “Fahrenheit 451” from Nov. 21-24 with shows at 3 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 22-24, and 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 21. The production will be staged in the Little theatre. Tickets are available at www.tix55.com/ptc700, admission is free.

Soopum Sohn, an associate professor of film, released his movie “Sequestrada” at Vil-lage East Cinema on Friday Nov. 15. 
“Sequestrada” takes place on an Amazonian reserve where the government is building a dam that will displace indigenous people. The film follows three stories: Kamodjara, a daughter of a tribe member who gets separated from her father and is kidnapped by traffickers; Thomas, an American investor of the dam who helps Kamadjara get back to her family; and Roberto, a bureaucrat in the indigenous agency who goes to the Amazon to help protest the dam. All three characters are connected through this environmental tragedy. 
To accurately portray Indigenous lifestyles, Sohn and his team visited the Amazon four times and worked on the film over the course of four years. They hired many indigenous actors to play roles that portrayed their own lives. Because of the personal significance of the film, many of the scenes throughout it were improvised and unscripted. 
It was important to both Sohn and Sabrina Mccormick, who co-directed the film, to maintain a sense of reality of what life in Brazil was like for these people. They did so through small examples, such as showing local modes of transportation and wildlife that live in the Amazon. One example shown in the film was the tragic reality of sex trafficking in Brazil, which they said was an essential addition. 
“In energy boom towns, there is often a lot of trafficking… there is a variety of social problems, one of them often being the rise of prostitution, sex trafficking [and] child trafficking, and that’s also true in this town,” Mccormick said. It is such a common issue that some of the scripted scenes involving sex-trafficking were based on some of the indigenous actors’ own experiences. 
The film is based on the Belo Monte Dam which was built in 2011 and made operational in 2016. The dam was built on the Amazon’s Zingu River and displaced tens of thousands of indigenous people and forced them to give up their fishing livelihoods. 
The dam destroyed large areas of the Amazon rainforest and caused the extinction of several rare species of animals and plants. The movie is set on the backdrop of this dam, and by doing so touches on the issues of climate change and the displacement of indigenous people. 
“What the science shows is that the areas of the Amazon that are best protected are those where indigenous people have rights to protect them, and it’s not just in this case of the Bel Monte dam but many other cases of large scale development where indigenous people are fighting literally to the death,’’ Mccormick said. Climate change goes hand in hand with the rights of indigenous people, according to Mccormick, so it was imperative for them to connect both issues in the film. 
“Sequestrada” is Portuguese for kid-napped, one of the film’s major themes. “One kidnap[ping] triggers following kidnap[pings],” Sohn said. “The first kidnapped victim is [the] Amazon rainforest.” The physical kidnapping of Kamodjara parallels the environmental kidnapping of the rainforest, creating a comprehensible parallel for viewers. This issue is important to Sohn. “Climate change is a threat of our existence and destroying [the] Amazon rainforest is the mistake,” Sohn said. “The world needs to know this.” 
Students still have a chance to see Sohn’s film at the Village East Cinema in lower Manhattan on Thursday, November 21. There will be a Q & A with the directors after the 7 p.m. showing. Tickets are $15 and can be purchased online at citycinemas.com.

Over the past few months, Long Island was hit with news that might be a little hard to swallow, literally. Nassau County was identified as one of the leading counties throughout New York state with the highest level of contamination in its drinking water. 
Long Island receives its water from an underground local water supply, while New York City and the rest of the state receive their water from upstate New York, where the water is protected and preserved by land surrounding the reservoirs. 
“Long Island has some of the highest detections in the nation of chemicals like 1,4-dioxane, a solvent used to keep machinery greased that is also a byproduct of certain personal-care products. The chemical 1,4-dioxane is a likely carcinogen,” Matthew Chayes wrote in a Newsday article from June 5. 
University director of facilities services, Roy Fergus, said the university gets their water supply locally from Jericho Water District in the town of Oyster Bay. Fergus said there were no reports of contaminated water with the campus supply. “By federal, state and local regulations, Jericho Water is required to provide the campus with a safe water supply,” he said.
As per a fall 2019 report issued by Jericho Water District, they’re preparing for the New York State Health Department’s adoption of new, stricter standards for 1,4-dioxane. Of the district’s 25 public water supply wells, four are currently over the maximum contamination level (MCL) with another three that are over half of the MCL. 
Jericho Water District requested that the state’s health department adopt a revised protocol, allowing water districts a 4-year phase in period to construct and implement treatment equipment once it has been approved. If the proposal is turned down, the district will be forced to immediately implement mandatory restrictions on non-essential water use. 
The newsletter emphasized that too many wells out of service at one time will affect the district’s ability to provide potable water for essential use. 
Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into legislation on Nov. 4 that equips public water suppliers with a needed tool to hold corporate polluters accountable for contaminating drinking water. The Jericho Water District is suing Dow Chemical, a manufacturer of 1,4-dioxane, along with other manufacturers, to hold them accountable for paying for the necessary equipment to remove the dangerous chemical. 
When comparing the water quality between New York City and Long Island, it’s been proven that New York City has the cleanest tap water in the state; and Long Island, which is located right next door has the dirtiest, most toxic tap water in all of New York. 
Native Long Island resident, Ryan McAnally, who’s been living in New York City for over a year now, said that his landlord has been telling him for over a year now to drink the tap water. “It really is the best tap water and it’s a quick and easy way to save money,” he said. 
LIU has campuses within several New York counties, with Brookville and Brooklyn being home to two of them. Logan Kelly, a junior nursing major, resided on Long Island her entire life before moving to Brooklyn for school. 
“I haven’t really taken water quality into consideration until now. Once I heard about all the different contaminants in the water of Long Island, I started drinking more bottled water and when I am in my dorm in Brooklyn, I use the tap because it’s just a known thing to drink New York City tap water. It’s clean,” Kelly said.

Brooklyn and Post campuses merged their athletic departments in the fall 2019 semester, bringing with it the new shark mascot and school colors. To bring these programs to-gether, a change in branding was needed, and #FinsUp became the new slogan for OneLIU. 
The catchy phrase has caught on fast, particularly during sporting events and across social media platforms. Perry Williams, director of sports management, is optimistic about the new branding set in place. “It’s cool. A new era means a new dimension,” he said. 
Williams thinks the new hashtag trend is a great way to bring about the new and improved LIU name. “Bringing the culture, excitement, and passion is good to have because old school is gone. This is a new school, new Division I, new logo, new mascot; it’s personally good to have. Go Sharks,” he said.
Some may be critical of the new slogan and hashtag because #FinsUp gets lost in a giant sea of the Miami Dolphins who also make use of the hashtag. Any social media posts that include this searchable term are very hard to find. 
Griffin Ward, a senior broadcasting major, thinks that “if the school really wanted to focus on marketing and brand recognition, they would pick something else.” 
Sam Uebel, a junior broadcasting major, has similar thoughts on the popular slogan. She agreed that if the school wanted a successful marketing strategy, they should have better consulted with marketing and graphic design experts “before implementing a new brand design.”      
Casey Schermick, director of athletic media relations, explained the origins of #FinsUp and how it came into existence. “A few ideas were proposed by athletic administration and the choices were narrowed down based on the length of the tag, and how well it was perceived to be accepted by our students and fans,” he said. “The approval went through both athletic and university administration.” 
Schermick said those involved in the decision making knew about the Dolphins’ use of #FinsUp when they approved it in the spring. “We knew that there would obviously be a mix of content if you search the hashtag, but we felt that the connectivity that our student-athletes would have with it would outweigh this conflict,” he said. 
The purpose of a hashtag is to draw attention, to organize and promote a brand. It’s a way for current and prospective students to find, follow and contribute to conversations about the university. This new way of searching for a trend or topic is a free and easy way to get a brand recognized. According to Schermick, “#Finsup” is popular among student athletes and coaches, and he believes it has become a motto for the department. 
Another conflict that may have affected the school’s new branding was California State University at Long Beach’s decision to also choose the shark as its mascot. LIU anticipated being the only Division I program with the name; this changed when Long Beach made the announcement last May. 
“The timing of Long Beach State’s announcement was definitely unfortunate, though it did not influence the decision on the mascot or the hashtag,” Schermick said. 
Overall, students and faculty alike have taken pride in the branding for OneLIU. Use of #FinsUp has grown among social media users attending or working at the school, and the slogan has caught on fast at athletic events. 
The marketing aspect could see some improvements, as using the same slogan as the Miami Dolphins could cause LIU to take a hit in their social media presence, but if the slogan benefits outweigh the costs, then #FinsUp and “Go Sharks.”

The topic of eating disorders is one many tend to avoid. The stigma more commonly echoes down high school hallways in the ears of adolescents. Rarely does it ever find its way into conversations regarding adults and their physical health, which can be problematic for adults seeking treatment and recovery. Having an open conversation about eating disorders can lead to more opportunities for these adults to get help. Kylie Brown, a junior theatre major, wants to kick start this conversation through performance, and has already begun through her one act play “The Space We Take Up.”
Inspired by a podcast which shared stories of adults facing thestrains of their conditions, Brown began writing “The Space We Take Up” in June 2017 after graduating high school. “I was listening to [the podcast] while I was driving, and I had to pull over because I was crying because they were so sad and I never heard anything like that,” she said. Though a sensitive subject, Brown wanted their voices to be heard and decided to share their stories. 
The No Frills Theatre Collective took up Brown’s one act after it was entered in their theatre  festival in August, and produced a stage reading on Saturday, Nov. 16 and Sunday, Nov. 17 at the Pit Loft theater in Manhattan. LIU Post alumna Sarah Taylor was the producer of the show, and was immediately hooked when it was first presented to her. 
Taylor met Brown in January this year during Post Theatre Company’s new play festival, where her play, “This Can’t Happen Here,” was performed. Taylor, who adjudicates theatre festivals, has read and seen many plays that are not up to par, but was instantly impressed with Brown’s work. “For someone at this age to be writing on such a touchy subject, and with such a mature writing style, I was like, ‘Whoa, where did this come from?’ I was not writing like that at her age,” Taylor said. 
“The Space We Take Up” features four main characters each facing their own eating disorders in separate storylines. The context in each scene points to conditions of textbook eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia, but never outright labels the characters’ respective conditions. Brown said this was intentional. “I didn’t ever want to use those terms in the script because those eating disorders have very strict guidelines for diagnosis and that’s what keeps a lot of people from getting treatment especially adults,” she said. “I wanted to keep that open because I didn’t want to alienate anyone.”
The four main characters, Brian (played by Justin Demers), Haley (played by Canning Robb), Sarah (played by Julia Baker) and Trent (played by Nick Imperato) take the audience through their daily lives and the struggles they face, both big and small. 
Brian, a corporate worker, overindulges in food; once he starts eating, he falls into a binge. Brian is self-conscious of his weight, and because of this, he alienates himself from his family and friends by skipping out on family dinners, parties and even holidays. He rarely spends time alone at home and drowns himself in his work to distract himself from the urge to eat. Though very disciplined, his grip sometimes slips and he is overcome with shame and disgust with himself. One of his binges leads to an accident and he is hospitalized.
Haley is a 30-year-old woman with the body of a 13-year-old girl because she does not eat. Her condition drastically affects her health and ability to work. While seeing several doctors and dietitians, Haley also deals with the stress of work and struggling to pay for rent and medical expenses. When it all becomes too much, she is forced to move back with her parents so she can focus on recovery. Haley feels as though she is a burden to her mother, who takes days off of work to care for her and drive her to appointments. Haley is haunted by the fact that girls she knew from high school are “real women,”  living their best lives while she is trapped in a child’s body. Even as she is faced with the reality that her body is deteriorating, she continues to skip out on scheduled meals when she can. 
Sarah is addicted to exercise and spends countless hours in the gym everyday. Her mind is so focused on counting calories and staying in shape that she is out of touch with the rest of the world. This is most evident when it comes to the sphere of the dating realm and she is approached by a man in the gym. He invites her to a 10k race, which she readily accepts, but when he tries to get to know her more over coffee or lunch, she backs out. Her romantic growth is severely hindered by her inexperience and her fear of not exercising and reverting back to a “chubbier” high school version of herself. Conflicting voices in her head repeatedly sabotage her chances of pursuing a relationship, and she makes excuses and throws herself back into exercise. 
Trent was the chubby kid in school. When his friends started making fun of his weight, he wanted to make a change, which he did by starving himself. It became so extreme that one day, while driving, he blacked out and crashed his father’s car. To pay for the damages, Trent picked up a part-time job at a grocery store, which eventually became full-time after he dropped out of high school. He fights against his hunger to the point that it affects his behavior and he tunes out his mother. He eventually moves to the city, isolating himself from anyone who knew him when he was “normal,” where no one can tell that he needs help. His story remains unresolved at the end of the play, as many similar cases do. 
“The Space We Take Up” has a careful balance of emotional storytelling, comedic relief and research into treatments for adults with these conditions. Brown drew a lot of the research from her own experiences with recovery when writing Haley’s character. “It was just a matter of sorting out just what implications would be most devastating for someone in her situation,” she said.
The one act was performed as a stage reading, with a minimal set of four chairs, and stylized lighting design to signify the different storylines. Directed by LIU Post alumna, Anna Betteridge, the reading also included movement that blended seamlessly with the script; the movements were direct, purposeful and didn’t take attention away from the words. Brown was delighted with the outcome of the production, which only called for four rehearsals in a span of one month.
This reading is the first step towards publication. According to Brown, a certain amount of readings and productions of the work are required before it can be published. Other than a few structural changes that could be made, Taylor believes the play has potential. “The length is perfect, four characters is perfect, [and] the fact that it is specific yet vague enough that’s why it hits home so well,” she said. 
Brown’s passion for the piece reads true in the script. “You can tell,” Taylor said. “And I loved it. Seldom do I read something and enjoy it the first time, or any time.” Going forward, Taylor would like to put on a full production of “The Space We Take Up,” as it fits the standard of No Frills Collective productions. “It doesn’t call for anything crazy. The playwright loves this, this is her child and we want to coddle it,” she said. 
As Brown finishes her junior year, she plans to hone her craft. “I’ll be writing a lot, writing in general. Not just playwriting, but all different kinds of writing,” she said. Students interested in reading and seeing more from Brown can check out her blog site at thetakeonadventure.com and follow her on Instagram @_kylie_brown. Students can also keep up with events at No Frills by following them on Instagram @nofrillstheatrecollective and Twitter @nofrillstheatre.

There are a variety of problems students face while living in a residence hall, and some of those problems are smaller than others. For Jules Rivera, senior acting major, and Pearl Emerson, junior musical theatre major, the presence of two small mice in their dorm room resulted in a much larger issue.
Rivera and Emerson live in Riggs Hall, and during the week of Oct. 20-26, the two noticed a leak in their room’s ceiling. They assumed it was caused by the air conditioning unit and thought nothing of it; on Oct. 31, they noticed another leak in a different spot. “We called facilities. They took out all the ceiling tiles in that specific corner. We were worried we were going to have to move,” Rivera said. 
The worker assured them that they wouldn’t have to move as long as they were fine with the tiles missing for a couple of days while they inspected the leak’s cause. After five days, two workers returned to the room to inspect the ceiling but didn’t replace the tiles.
“They left a leak in the room. The water was all over the floor. Pearl and I had to use our own personal towels to clean it up. They [facilities] brought in a trash can to catch the water and said that they would send somebody to come and clean it up. They didn’t send anybody,” Rivera said.  
When Rivera returned to her room around 1:15 a.m. on Thursday, Nov. 7, it was filled with commotion and several visiters, including Eliza Lopes, a friend of Emerson’s who attends Ithaca College. The uproar in the room was over a small mouse that fell from the hole in the ceiling. “The mouse appeared from under the fridge,” Lopes said. 
“Everyone was freaking out. They said that a mouse came down from the hole, fell on top of the closet, fell from the top of the closet all the way down, and it was scurrying somewhere in the room,” Rivera said. “At 2 a.m., another mouse came down and was on top of the closet. There [were] two.” By that time, the other visitors had left the room.
Immediately after seeing the second mouse, Rivera called public safety. “One found its way onto my desk and ran all the way across my desk, back and forth on top of the TV. All of a sudden [the mouse] disappeared behind my dirty laundry underneath my bed,” Rivera said. 
When the public safety officer arrived, he used a flashlight to search the room and asked the two roommates if the mice typically come out in light. Rivera and Emerson couldn’t answer the question, but assured him that the mice were present in the room.
Afterwards, the roommates contacted the RA on duty, Kaitlyn Fiskin, and she helped relocate the three roommates to an emergency room down the hall. Rivera slept in the room for three nights while Emerson and Lopes spent two nights in the room. 
Facilities neglected to reach out to the roommates the following day, so Rivera called Campus Life and asked what they would do to fix it. Staff members contacted facilities to replace the ceiling tiles, though the mice were still roaming their room with no way out. “My mom called and complained and I got through to Jeanie [Jean Anne Smith] because of it. She’s awesome, she was so helpful,” Rivera said.
“If something falls through the cracks and it’s brought to my attention, I call, and I ask for them [facilities] to please take a look into it immediately, which is what I did for them,” Jean Anne Smith, associate dean of students,” said.
Beth Funfgeld, service response manager at facilities services, also spoke with Rivera’s mother. “I gave her the steps that we took to rectify the problem. I love to talk to the parents to let them know [their kids] are safe and sound, and I will take care of them,” Funfgeld said.
Due to a phone call from Funfgeld, Professional Exterminating assisted in setting baiting stations for the mice in various areas throughout the room. The baiting stations were laid with rodenticides that would dehydrate the mice upon consumption, which would cause the mice to leave the room in search of water. The exterminator returned to the room twice to confirm the mice were eating the bait, and they were, according to Funfgeld.
A few days later, the roommates returned to their room to find the stations were not being monitored or cleaned. “There [were] pellets all over my desk and I had to wipe them off myself with Lysol wipes. Pearl had to clean up the room completely,” Rivera said.
Funfgeld was uncertain if the exterminating company’s policy is to keep the stations set as a precautionary measure, or if they typically remove them after a certain amount of time. Emerson is confident that if they sent in a work order to facilities, the baiting stations would be removed immediately. 
On Nov. 11, Rivera and Emerson sent emails to Matthew Blanar, director of events and operations, Ashley John, director of student engagement and Jesse Meany, resident director and coordinator, detailing her dis-comfort with her situation, her concern for her personal items and unprofessional manner in which she perceived the issue was being handled. “It’s a risk to our personal health; it came down from the ceiling; we don’t know what kind of bacteria it’s carrying, what kind of diseases or anything like that, what it peed on,” Rivera said. She believes this situation could have been avoided if facilities service workers responded in a more timely manner.
“When I emailed Ashley John, she immediately got somebody to clean up all the feces, which was great and there’s no more of that,” Emerson said. In addition to cleaning all the feces, the facilities worker did a thorough job of cleaning the room, from wiping down the wardrobe to mopping the floor. 
“What happens is there’s sometimes some miscommunications between trades,” Smith said. “We understand that there is not one specific system in place where we can close that loop [between departments].” Smith is working closely with facilities services in regards to the reporting of work orders and building inspections, and ensuring continuous communication between students and the appropriate departments. 
Emerson agrees the issue lies within the lack of communication among various departments and with students. “When the work was actu-ally done, it was fixed, but it took forever,” they said. “I was never left a note when facilities or maintenance or whoever showed up. I didn’t know what they did, if they came in or not, what they needed, if they were going to come back, anything.”
Resources are now made more available for students. “The TMA online work order sys-tem is found on the [university] website, and since the kids are so tech savvy, you can put a ticket in as you’re walking to the dorm if you see a light out or paint peeling somewhere,” Funfgeld said. “Once your work order is com-plete, you get a notification that says this job was complete, and it gives you the date and the time.”
As of Monday, Nov. 18, the ceiling in Ri-vera and Emerson’s room was repaired and no longer leaks when it rains. Two baiting stations remain in the room, but neither student has seen any dead mice. A metal under-door excluder was installed to keep more mice from entering the room.
