Actor Alec Baldwin is being charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter for his role in the death of Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on Oct. 21, 2021. 
During an unscheduled rehearsal on the set of the movie “Rust,” Hutchins instructed Baldwin to aim the prop gun he was holding at the camera. While Baldwin was doing so, the gun independently, according to him, fired, killing Hutchins and injuring Film Director Joel Souza.  
Before any of this occurred, the gun was checked by the props assistant and Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. She examined the gun, which held what she believed to be fake bullets that contained no live ammunition. She was also charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter.
After examining the gun, Gutierrez-Reed handed it over to Assistant Director and Production Safety Coordinator David Hall. She claims that she intended to check the gun again, as safety protocols call for, however, Hall never called her back to check it before they began their unscheduled rehearsal. Hall pleaded guilty to negligence in order to not face trial.
Sophomore nursing major Nozila Djavvarova expressed her thoughts on what she views as the unjust nature of the charges. 
“I don’t think [the charges] are fair because he didn’t know and he was under the assumption that it wasn’t loaded,” Djavvarova said.
Other students find themselves to be conflicted due to the complexity of the case.
“I think it’s a complicated case,” sophomore data analytics and finance major Christian Gonzalez said. “There was no way of him knowing that he would kill someone, even if he did pull the trigger, he had no idea there were actually bullets in there. He thought that everyone had done their job right.” 
Involuntary manslaughter is defined as an unintentional killing that results either from recklessness or criminal negligence, and Gonzalez believes that no one is above the law. 
“I guess yes. He would be guilty because it was involuntary,” he stated.  
Hutchins’ family filed a lawsuit against Baldwin, which has since been settled, for unsafely handling a weapon. 
Freshman accounting major Marcello Passante does not necessarily agree with the lawsuit.
“I mean yes, [they were right in filing] because he did commit it, but I can’t really see how valid it could be because he was set up. Nothing is supposed to come out of a prop gun when you shoot it,” he said.
Djavvarova puts herself in the shoes of Hutchins’ family, but also has similar opinions to Passante.
“It was right on their part. I think if I was the family I would also do that as well, but I do think that it’s wrong he’s in trouble because he didn’t know that [the gun] was loaded and thought it was a prop, so I feel like it wasn’t justifiable,” she said.   
However, students did agree with the charges placed on Gutierrez-Reed.
“She said the bullets were blanks and they weren’t blanks so yes, I also believe that she is guilty,” Gonzalez said, but not without mentioning Hall’s negligence for not calling Gutierrez-Reed back to examine the prop.
Passante shares similar opinions, but also theorizes a bit. 
“It could have been swapped out potentially. If she did check it and didn’t thoroughly examine it then 100 percent she deserves it, but it really depends on what actually happened,” he expressed. 
One of the questions that has yet to be answered is how did real ammunition get on a film set. 
“I feel like they should look into it more before they charge,” Gonzalez commented about this unanswered question. “Someone needs to go to jail, but not someone who did it by accident.” 
Passante feels that whoever let live ammunition on set should be charged. 
“If that didn’t happen, then nothing else would have happened,” he explained.
There are some big holes in this case and further investigation may be necessary. 
The charges brought against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed hold a potential prison sentence of between 18 months and five years.

Netflix’s hit show  “Ginny and Georgia” is a coming of age teen drama that is just bursting with laughs, cries and plot twists. Netflix finally came out with a second season that was long-awaited by fans in Jan. 2023. The first season came out in early 2021. At the end of season one, the main character Ginny and her little brother Austin were seen fleeing from their new home in Wellsbury after finding out just how dangerous their mother—Georgia—was capable of being. Fans of the show were eager to find out what could possibly happen next. This series has rave reviews, some of which come from students here at Post.
Junior veterinary technician major Kaitlyn Cucolo was absolutely enthralled with season two of the show and watched all 10 episodes in five days. 
“I was super excited for season two,” Cucolo said. “I’ve been waiting for almost two years for it to come back, and when it did, I had to start it immediately.” 
This show teaches many valuable lessons to young teens and dives into topics not normally seen in a show that is portrayed as a comedy. It touches on self harm, depression, anxiety, abuse and even murder. 
“Between Ginny’s self harm, Georgia’s secret past and all of the drama between MANG, Ginny’s friend group, it is definitely something to watch,” Cucolo said.
Plot twists are a huge component of this series, which is part of what makes it so addicting to watch. Viewers never know what could happen next. In the first season, viewers never see Austin’s father, Gil, who is in jail for embezzlement. This season, they finally meet him and he is nowhere near the father figure Austin has been searching for.
Fans of the show were shocked by this revelation.
“The biggest plot twist for me was when Austin’s dad came back and was threatening Georgia. He is insane and seeing the flashback episodes of him abusing her and controlling her was horrible,” Cucolo said. 
Junior fashion merchandising major Kayla Acevedo was also shocked by some of the plot twists in this season.
“I think the biggest plot twist was the part when Georgia essentially kills Cynthia’s husband. I was completely in shock because I never expected her to do that,” she said.
While some episodes deal with heavier topics, the writers try to keep the rest of the content lighthearted.
“My favorite part of the season was probably seeing Ginny so vulnerable with her dad. I feel like we don’t see daughters being vulnerable with their dads enough, so I thought that was beautiful,” Cucolo said.
Acevedo shared her appreciation for the depiction of Ginny and her mother’s relationship.
“My favorite part was when they had the bachelorette party for Georgia in the cafe,” Acevedo said. 
This scene was especially charming because Ginny was showing her appreciation for her mother Georgia, even though they’re going through tough times as a family. 
Fans’ love for the show begs the question of whether there will be a third season.Some are certain there will be. 
“I think the show definitely progressed and will be a good segue into the third season. There is still a lot to explore but I think we were able to find out a lot more important information. I believe Ginny and Georgia will be renewed for a third season because many people are interested in the show and it ended on a cliffhanger. That makes people want to see more,” Acevedo said.
Some fans are just hopeful they’ll get to see more of these characters they’ve grown to love and want to see them at their best.
“Fingers crossed this show is renewed. I would like to see Ginny and Marcus back together, Ginny moving in with her dad full-time and Austin staying with Georgia’s new husband Paul. I would also like to hear Georgia’s inner thoughts on what happened at her and Paul’s wedding,” Cucolo said.
Fans of the show strongly recommend watching “Ginny and Georgia”.
“I would recommend this show to others by saying that it is very heartfelt, binge worthy and it keeps you on your toes,” Cucolo said.
“It’s a coming of age show with a dark twist. I would and have recommended ‘Ginny and Georgia’ to many people,” Acevedo said.
Both seasons of Ginny and Georgia can now be streamed on Netflix.

Interest in blockchain, the technology that underlies the cryptocurrency industry, has grown significantly in the last few years, and what was once considered a concept directed towards the finance industry is now being used extensively around the world.
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that enables the recording of transactions and tracking of assets in a business network. The development of blockchain has become an important tool to provide users with a high-tech method of validating data that cannot be edited or changed. Those who validate the transaction – “proof of work” – are rewarded with a token, for example a bitcoin.  
A class for business, finance, accounting and marketing students, taught by professor Manoj Dalvi, in fall 2022 explored the use of blockchain as a ledger by creating an NFT. Students in Dalvi’s class became immersed in researching and applying concepts of this technology to learn how the future of technology and business will change.
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that have an authentic certificate. They use the blockchain network for verification of ownership. Examples of NFTs include art, music and games.
“An NFT, put simply, is a digital asset that can’t be copied,” senior finance major Luke Gifford said. “For example, if you upload an image and make it into an NFT, you can sell that image to one person and that one person can say they are the only owner. And if someone were to take a screenshot of that image, they have a screenshot, but not the ownership of the artwork.” 
NFTs were first created around 2013 when people began trading digital assets other than Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. In 2022, the NFT market generated approximately $24.7 billion worth of organic trading volume. 
“With the introduction of NFTs and cryptocurrency, blockchain creates a virtual database and collective proof of ownership that provides. It will eliminate a lot of the issues and logistics of, let’s say having a paper deed to a house or something of that regard,” senior finance major Jesse Wells said. “Let’s say your driver’s license gets lost. It’s a lot of steps to get that back. However, if you put it on Blockchain, you can show that you own it and that it’s yours without having to go through those extra verification methods … I think that’s why this will be a big part of our future.” 
Dalvi had his class collaborate with professor Patrick Aievoli’s digital industries class to create the design and storyboard of the NFT. Professor Rich De Rosso created the video and animation with his design program for the NFT, which is formatted like a GIF.
“Ironically, I had just done my LIU podcast on NFTs and Crypto about six months before Dalvi came to me with this request,” Aievoli said. “NFTs are basically a digital provenance for artwork. Where in the analog world provenance is a sheet of paper that details the ownership of a piece of art, now NFTs and Blockchain are that path to digital validity.”
Aievoli’s class focuses on experiential learning, for example, creating digital content for non-profits like Habitat for Humanity and the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and so taking on creating a design that will become an NFT further diversified the portfolios of the students in the class.
Dalvi noted that blockchain is being used increasingly worldwide. 
“For example, title to agricultural land in India is being put on blockchain; and smart contracts are being used to direct government assistance to farmers when there is a drought,” Dalvi said. “If you buy salad, or you buy a bunch of bananas, you will know exactly what farm it has come from because of blockchain.”
Part of why NFTs have become so relevant is the movement for more control over online experiences and increased security through blockchain technology. As the technology develops and society popularizes using blockchain, it may become common practice to list documents, artifacts and more online. As blockchain technology becomes more accessible, it can have an even bigger influence in different areas of the economy for many years.
“Financial assets are changing and people are trying to stay on top of and in front of the wave to get traction of these concepts,” senior finance major Jack Adams commented. “NFTs were something that was very new, but we started to see people that were essentially nobodies making serious money. There’s an individual known as Beeple who has sold a compilation of his artwork for $69 million because someone wanted it and paid that much for it. So once that bombshell hit the news, people started saying “well, I want to do that.” And people started to understand it … I think people making money on it is driving the social aspects of it … It’s something that students in our business program should really get a grasp on. We should understand it and be ahead of the curve.”
Dalvi’s class spent the semester working on creating their NFT and researching how to list it online to sell. The students that worked on creating the NFT praised the experience because of the practicality and importance of what they learned.
“The process was quite simple in practice, it took a lot of logistics to get through,” Adams said. “There were three major steps. After getting approval of any photos that we would take on campus and approval of photos we could use from the marketing department, we handed off what our plans and ideas to the graphic design department and Pat Aievoli had his students make up a design for us. As this was happening, our class researched what it would be like to list this NFT on a marketplace for sale. We started with gathering data and information on which marketplaces were best and what they differ in and which kind of currency we wanted to accept for payment. When the NFT was produced, we listed it on a marketplace called “Rarible.” It’s similar to making an eBay ad. There’s a picture, there’s a description, there’s a title, and it’s for sale.”
For Dalvi, the interdisciplinary approach to this project is the most important aspect because his students were able to diversify and strengthen their knowledge of blockchain and other technologies that are becoming increasingly relevant. By being exposed to NFTs, Dalvi’s class learned about so many cross sections, including Web 3.0, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
“There can be courses [outside of finance], like history and fashion merchandising, that can be constructed to explain how the latest technology can be used in that particular field,” Dalvi said. “For example, if an author wants to write a book, instead of going to a publisher to get it published, the author can just put it up as an NFT and say only 100 people can read it. The entire system is changing as we move to Web 3.0, a peer to peer system, and students should be aware of the opportunities it will create for them as blockchain and smart contracts are widely adopted and accepted.”
Blockchain is a major disruptor, disrupting not only the financial services industry, but other industries all over the world. Blockchain is enhancing the value chain. As this technology transforms society on a global scale, it is essential for individuals to learn how to integrate this new system into their fields of work and life, as the future progresses towards digitalization for every discipline.

The Social Work Student Association (SWSA) is an organization on campus that helps students by providing information for volunteer and community service opportunities. The SWSA also assists students with navigating the challenges that come with being a social work major. 
The club takes part in a variety of volunteer activities. These events range from toy drives, toiletry drives, providing mental health resources and more. 
“The work towards being a social worker is a lot of information to learn so my goal and purpose is to be that support for all of these students by educating them, providing them with resources, giving them tips and tricks and connections, how to do things and where to go and who to talk to,” president of SWSA  Arly Cisneros said.
SWSA aims to be a network for students that want to volunteer.
“The club takes pride in providing resources to our club members about volunteer opportunities and service events,” vice president of SWSA Lauren Barrett said. “We want to connect the club members with outside resources and give back to those in need.” 
The club had been inactive in previous years, so Cisneros sought to revive it in 2022 with support from faculty advisor Dr. Gifford and Promise student clubs and organizations coordinator Stephanie Lowe.
“The most memorable thing that has the biggest impact was being able to get this club started again and being recognized by the school and having helped agencies,” Cisneros said. 
Although the SWSA is primarily focused on students majoring in social work, many events are also open to the general public.
The SWSA will hold its second Narcan training meeting on Zoom on Monday, Jan. 30, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.
When a similar event was held the previous year, the SWSA helped approximately 200 individuals get certified in the distribution of Narcan, a nasal spray used to counteract or lessen the effects of opioids. 
“We had so many people that wanted to do it for this semester that we opened up to the public – everyone on Long Island, not just LIU students and staff,” Cisneros said. 
“Narcan training is important because it could potentially save a life. I feel with every going on regarding overdose and drug use lately, it is something that can come in handy at any given moment. I think it’s important for people to get certified even if they are not involved in social work because the more of us that are certified, the more lives we could potentially save,” Barrett said. 
After training, participants will be given a two year certification card and a Narcan kit. 
The SWSA club will hold more social work related events throughout the semester. The club meets weekly on Tuesday nights, starting Feb. 7, at 7 p.m. on Zoom.
To join SWSA or learn more about their upcoming events, follow them on Instagram @liu_swsa or their Facebook page LIU Post Social Work Department.

Eleven Asian American seniors were killed, and nine were injured as a result of a shooting at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, Calif. The shooting took place on Saturday, Jan 21. at a Lunar New Year’s Eve celebration. 
At around 10:22 p.m. on Saturday, the shooter opened fire inside of Star Ballroom Dance Studio, less than a block from where a Lunar New Year festival was held. There were 100,00 attendees at the park for the festival, but the shooter did not come for them. 
While the shooting was initially thought to be an act of xenophobia, it has been revealed that the gunman himself was Asian. He was an unstable 72 year-old man named Huu Can Tran who most likely opened fire thinking of his ex-wife. He later killed himself with his own self-made gun at a SWAT scene. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was called earlier on to find and identify the subject. 
About a half an hour after the attack, the shooter went into another ballroom studio, Lai Lai Ballroom and Studio in nearby Alhambra. He went with the intent to kill more people, but was disarmed by police. 
On Sunday at about 10:20 a.m., police saw a white cargo van in Torrance, a city south of Monterey Park, and heard a single gunshot. They found Tran inside, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
Tran was a very troubled man, and that could’ve led to violence. He had no close friends or family, and was a landlord. A former tenant shared that Tran “always complained that instructors were speaking evil about him or trying to do something bad about him. I’m not quite sure if those things were true, but he always complained. He thought those instructors (at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio) were not friendly to him, and tried to sort of expel him from the group.”
However, his clearest memory of Tran was waking up 15 years ago to the sounds of Tran and a woman he knew only by sight arguing in the street. “You could see the plates flying,the plates were crashing into the street, and he was yelling at her.” 
It’s safe to say Tran was a cautionary individual, and violent. Every weekend, Tran could be seen coming out of his house dressed in his finest clothing. He was always going out to dance,” the tenant said. “Otherwise, we didn’t see him much.” 
His ex-wife of 40 years danced too and they would bump into each other sometimes. Tran contacted the Hemet, Calif. Police Dept. this month, alleging his family tried to poison him 10 to 20 years ago. The allegation was never investigated, police said, because Tran never presented any proof to back up his claims. Tran made his own rifle, granting him the power to destroy life as an at-risk individual. Authorities said they also discovered “hundreds of rounds” of ammunition, to feed a magazine-fed assault-style pistol. This shooting was the nation’s fifth mass killing so far in 2023.There’s the snowballing effect of copycat shootings, which inspires young men to follow in other shooters’ footsteps. 
“Before, if you wanted to find other people to celebrate mass shootings with, that was pretty difficult. But now, you can find entire online communities,” Jonathan Metzl said.
Other students feel similarly to Metzi.
“Gun control needs to be regulated. There was even a case of a dog that killed his own owner. There was a rifle in the backseat with the safety off of the rifle, the dog stepped on it and that was the end of it… we should follow in the example of so many other countries with stricter gun laws,” sophomore nursing major Olivia said.
Since the  COVID-19 pandemic began, people of Asian descent have been targets of hate crimes. Former President Donald Trump came under scrutiny when he used the term “Chinese virus.” 
Some specific incidents by civilians include: A truck driver throwing and spilling a fast food drink on the back of an unassuming Asian woman. In another, an individual told an Asian-American man waiting for a bus “You’re infected China boy, you need to get off the train” and then attempted to pull the man out of his seat. A 22-year-old white man killed eight people including six Asian-American women in a spa in Atlanta, Ga. last year. Michelle Alyssa Go was pushed to death in front of a subway train in New York. Christina Yuna Lee was followed and killed in her home. GuiYing Ma died after being bludgeoned by a rock, and there was a brutal beating of an unnamed 67-year-old Filipino grandmother. 
83 percent of Asian American parents are concerned that their children may be bullied because of their race or ethnicity. 
Yi Yan, a junior and musical theatre major from Hong Kong shared that “It’s terrifying to me because I’m not used to the gunshots, in my country we can’t use guns, so it’s scary that it’s so near me right now (shootings in America) and it is especially terrifying because it’s in the Asian community, and it’s been said to be safe to be in the community with your own people around you. I’m scared because the safe place is no longer safe.” 
Starr, a student at Post, said “It’s very concerning how there are so many mass shootings, like you have to now worry about where you’re going, is it safe….and the stereotype of chinese people bringing COVID is completely unfounded.” 
Monterey Park council member Thomas Wong, who represents the district where the shooting took place, said his community was shocked, saddened and “on edge.”
“Instead of celebrating and bringing family together to look forward to a hopeful and prosperous new year, we’re starting it off with a senseless tragedy,” Wong told NPR. 
A massive memorial is expanding outside the dance studio, the community is really coming together to mourn, pay the dead proper respects and take care of the bereft families of the victims. At a memorial held on Monday each dead dancer had an arch erected to honor their memory These dancers were parents and grandparents., dancers and dreamers. Their names will live on. 
My Nhan, 65, Ming Wei Ma, 72, Diana Tom, 70, Hongying Jian, 62, Xiujuan Yu, 57 , Yu Lun Kao, 72 Valentino Marcos Alvero, 68, Wen Tau Yu, 64, Muoi Dai Ung, 67, Ming Wei Ma, 72 and Ming Wei Ma, the beloved owner of the studio, were all killed. In a 2016 news story about the dance hall, Ma told the Pasadena Star-News that he wanted to create a space for multiple cultures to come together and dance. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), FBI and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office are still looking into things.
