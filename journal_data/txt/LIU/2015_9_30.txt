Plans are being finalized for the celebration of LIU Post’s 60th anniversary this fall.
Special events are planned throughout homecoming weekend, from October 8 to 11, according to Kelly Walles, LIU’s Associate Director of Public Relations and Social Media. She added that smaller events will be planned to celebrate the anniversary throughout the year, although she did not provide specifics.
Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, stated that apart from Homecoming, Campus Life has no knowledge of any other plans to celebrate the 60th anniversary.
LIU Post, which was named for breakfast cereal manufacturer Charles William Post due to his innovation and courageous attitude that set the standard for all students and faculty at Post, was established in 1954 with its first class entering the next year. The property was purchased by LIU Post from Charles’ daughter, Majorie Merriweather Post in 1951.
In the first few years of the university’s history, students attended class in other buildings present on campus, due to limited funds at the time.
The Homecoming anniversary celebration will include a performance by Kristin Chenoweth at the Tilles Center on Oct. 10, a lecture by Political Science Professor Michael Soupios on Oct. 9, and a Pep Rally on Oct. 9, just to name a few.
At the Pep Rally, Joe Gatto, who is a member of the comedy troupe “The Tenderloins” and one of the hosts of the reality show, “Impactical Jokers,” will receive the Distinguished Alumnus Award.
Director of Alumni Relations, Ryan Reilly, stated that the Distinguished Alumni Award “recognizes a highly distinguished alumnus of alumna who, over the course of a decade or more, has exemplified outstanding, significant professional achievement.”
Walles stated that at the Pep Rally, a fireworks show will also be held. This show is the first one of its kind at Post and will be hosted by the company Fireworks by Grucci.
Literacy Grad student Nicole Cunningham is pleased about the preparations to celebrate the university’s anniversary. “There’s a lot of tradition and history on our campus and the 60th Anniversary is a great time to celebrate it,” Cunningham said.
“I think it’s great that Post wants to recognize the 60th anniversary and create a buzz about it around campus and the community. I think it excites the current students and also allows alumni to reconnect,” said Post alumnus Matt Soldano, class of 2010, who hosted a sports radio show for WCWP while at Post and now works for NeuLion.
“It’s an honor to be celebrating the 60th anniversary of LIU Post as its President,” Dr. Cline, LIU Post’s president, said. “We have an entire weekend planned filled with a full array of events and exciting appearances making this the largest Homecoming celebration in the University’s history. Students, alumni, and the community will get to connect and interact with one another while showing their Pioneer pride. It’s an opportunity to be a part of LIU history.”
Ryan Attard Reilly, LIU Post’s Director of Alumni Relations, Abagail Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, and Rita Langdon, the Director of Admissions, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the celebration of the 60th anniversary.

The former site of the Student Art League (S.A.L.) Gallery across from Starbucks in Hillwood Commons is now the home of the new Pioneer Nation store, which sells Green and Gold merchandise similar
to what you’d find in the campus bookstore. The S.A.L., which is the gallery for student art shows and displays, was moved to the first floor of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, according to Joseph Schaefer, Chief of Administration and Student Affairs.
“The ultimate reasoning for moving the S.A.L. gallery to the library was the fact that the library has longer hours (with security), and will enable the University to keep the gallery open [longer], increasing access and visibility to student work,” said Schaefer. “In addition, the opening of the Bleecker Street Café within the library will bring increased traffic and added guests into the gallery space,” he added.
“The new space is more visible to the public. The open windows certainly help to attract more interest,” said Chrisann Ambery, a third year MFA printmaking major. “I had my opening there last Wednesday, and we had many visitors outside of the art department stop in to see what what was happening. I recieved a lot of positive feedback from these visitors.”
Ambery did suggest new improvements that should be made to the space. “The gallery, however, needs professional lighting. The current lighting situation detracts from the artwork,” she said.
Stacie Zucker, a senior Digital Art and Design major, had mixed feelings about the move. “I was disappointed at first. Myself, as well as a lot of other artists on campus, [were looking] forward to having [our] future student shows in the old gallery. It was a prime location – our work would have been able to be seen by a larger portion of the student body in Hillwood as opposed to other, ‘out of the way’ locations on campus.”
But then she had a change of heart: “I did trek to the library to check out the new gallery location. I have to say, I was pleased. The gallery is right on ground level, [and] you can’t miss it next to the new cafe. And it’s quite spacious; there’s plenty of room to hang artwork.”
Hannah Fitch, senior Arts Management major and secretary for the Art and Art History Club, felt the move did more harm than good for Post’s MFA students.
“I know a lot of artists are unhappy with the change because no one told them [about it], and they were caught off guard,” Fitch said. “In one instance, an MFA student who was supposed to exhibit in the Hillwood Gallery wasn’t notified [about the move] until two weeks before her show, which meant that the work she had completed was made distinctly for the Hillwood space.”
“She [didn’t] have enough pieces to fit in the larger space in the library, and the walls are higher, so it [didn’t] look as good. It look[ed] as if she wasn’t prepared, when in fact it was the University who didn’t tell her the space had changed,” she added.
Both Zucker and Fitch believe the change will be an adjustment for the Pioneer community as a whole. “It is unfortunate that not many people outside of the art community will know to go to the library for future gallery shows, but I think it’s just something [we] need to get used to,” Zucker said. “I think it would be good to follow-up in a couple months after the dust has settled and see how things are going after a few exhibitions,” Fitch added.

Start-UP NY is a state run program that originated in 2011, which provides a tax-free zone for businesses that move to a university. LIU applied for the program, and was accepted in August 2014. After Post became a designated school, business began to apply to come here. Later in 2014, LIU accepted SavvyRoo as our first START-UP.
SavvyRoo was originally just a social media platform that displayed news visually through graphs and charts. SavvyRoo also allows for users to interact by compiling their own data and sharing it for anyone on the website. According to Kathleen Reynolds, a partner at SavvyRoo, students would use the data they compiled either as part of their research paper or either as a part of their resume.
SavvyRoo plans to offer Post students internships. They have already recruited an intern from Post to help with the production of videos that are used in SavyRoo U. Reynolds was at student employment day this fall, and is currently looking for a social media intern.
In addition to their presence on campus, SavvyRoo has created SavvyRooU, which is designed for student to make an e-portfolio of a data presentation. All of the collected data is in the field of the student, so it can be used as a tool on a potential job interview.
The program is free for students who sign up with a university e-mail. Currently SavvyRoo U is just a beta being tested at 13 universities in New York and other states, including Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana. Although their presence spreads across the country, Post will be SavvyRoo’s first physical office where they will have constant access to students.
“We [SavvyRoo] are driven by technology, everything we do is original content,” Reynolds said.
Michael S. Glickman, LIU’s Chief of Strategic Partnerships & Vice President for University Advancement, believes that SavvyRoo is perfect fit for Post. Glickman said “(SavvyRoo) aligns quite well with LIU’s mission of sharing knowledge and resources with our surrounding communities.”
SavvyRoo is also in talks with faculty for ways to incorporate their services into the classroom. According to Reynolds, it would be ideal for classes because students can share the research or findings on the specific topic of the course very quickly with the class and the professor.
According to Glickman, Post is not done adding business to the campus, “LIU is actively seeking high-tech companies to further expand the START-UP NY program and bring dynamic, exciting entrepreneurs onto the Post campus.”

On the second floor of Humanities Hall, several garbage cans are often placed right outside of the women’s bathroom to catch water dripping from a leaky ceiling. Most students assumed the leak was connected to a hole in the ceiling when it rains. That is actually not the case, according to Joseph Schaefer, Chief of Administration and Student Affairs.
“The water that is seen dripping periodically from above the ceiling in the Humanities building is from two air handler units that are located in the attic space,” Schaefer said.
These units produce heat and air conditioning for the building. The units leak because when it is hot, like it has been for the last few weeks, condensation occurs and falls through the ceiling.
Post has recently hired contractors to reinsulate the pipes, and to make other improvements around the campus, Schaefer said. Although there is not one main project, Post is constantly trying to make updates to the campus.

A new minor, Gender and Society, is being offered by the sociology department, and is available this semester.
The new minor consists of 11 sociology classes, two of which double as anthropology classes. Each has a focus on men, women, feminism, culture, or youth. Each of these classes are available to take individually, or as part of the new minor. At least five of these classes, 15 credits, are required for the minor.
“This department has a wonderful collection of gender scholars, and the students will really benefit if they have any interest at all,” said Sociology professor Robert Caputi. Caputi teaches “Images of Race and Gender in Film and TV” during the summer and “Introduction to Sociology” during the fall and spring semesters. According to Caputi, Dr. Brian Sweeney, Dr. Jennifer Rogers-Brown, and the sociology department head, Dr. Eric Lichten, teach many of these classes in the minor.
“Studying these structured forms of social inequalities prepares students with knowledge about our society so that this knowledge can be usefully applied in public and private sector careers, and in their graduate studies,” said Dr. Eric Lichten, who is the sociology department head. “Understanding the structural causes and processes of these forms of social inequality gives the student the information needed to work as informed participants in resolving the social issues of our time.”
Nicholas Ramer, Dean of Liberal Arts and Sciences at LIU Post, said, “Gender identity and the spectrum have made their way into our cultural mindset,” regarding the importance of the minor. Ramer be lieves that our generation is more involved with the change of gender in society, and believes that any students who carry interest will gravitate towards the minor.
LIU’s Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane said to add a new minor is simple; it requires faculty commitment and their belief in the program. A new minor does not have to get approval from the state because it’s not creating new classes and a new program, but rather taking a collection of already available classes that all have something in common and making a program out of it.
Kane hopes that students will take advantage of the new minor and realize all it has to offer them. “I would hope that it gets students to think about gender and what it means and the complexity of it. That would be for their betterment,” he said.
“Gender is a very complex issue and it’s one that is often treated at a distance because either it’s too controversial, or it’s too personal, or it’s too frightening to consider, and they don’t quite understand it,” Kane said on the importance of the minor. “Anything that we can do to demystify it and open it up to scholarly discussion or informed discussion, I think that serves our students.”
The minor is available for any student with an interest or a passion in sociology. “Hopefully it’ll attract people of all majors; it’s very enjoyable and very useful,” Caputi said. Kane hopes that students will express their opinion on the new academic option: “it’s always important to hear from the students,” he said.

A new undergraduate degree in Fashion Merchandising has launched this fall. In the 129-credit degree program, students will complete a variety of classes that deal with a wide variety of the aspects in the fashion industry, while gaining out-of-classroom experience as well.
LIU Post first introduced a minor in Fashion Merchandising last spring, and it is the first university on Long Island to offer a four-year degree in Fashion Merchandising, according to adjunct professor Cherie Serota, who teaches the Introduction to the Fashion Industry and Business of Fashion Merchandising.
Professor Abby Dress, Director of the Public Relations program and the current director of the Fashion Merchandising program, said that the New York State Department of Education’s approval of the new program was much quicker than usual, accepting it only a few weeks after its submission rather than the typical three to six months.
Serota said that her classes have already doubled in size compared to last year’s classes when just a minor was offered.
LIU Post is utilizing its location to New York City and Americana Manhasset, the high-end shopping center, to help students gain valuable, out-of-classroom experience. For example, Serota said she likes to try to take her students to the city “at least once a semester to visit the hot exhibitions at the time,” so they can apply what they are learning in class to the real world of fashion.
Last semester Serota’s class visited Donegar Group, a fashion forecasting company in New York City, the Fashion Institute of Technology Museum, where they observed works by Yves Saint Laurent, and the Killer Heels Exhibit in Brooklyn that displayed high heels throughout history.
This semester, Serota plans to take her students to the Fashion Institute of Technology to look at different clothing through the centuries. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to hear, to see, to learn everything about the industry,” Serota said.
Monica Peralta, a junior who works at The Student Body on campus, immediately switched her major from Public Relations to Fashion Merchandising as soon as she got the opportunity. “There are so many career paths I can pursue, like entrepreneurship in fashion, social media consultant for a fashion company, or even a stylist,” Peralta said.
Peralta said her each of her professors has many years of experience in the fashion industry, so “they teach from real life experience and have connections that help all of their students.”
Serota was at Saks Fifth Avenue, working her way up from the retail-training program to eventually become the fashion director. She also worked at Henri Bendel as a special events director, and she built her own multi-million dollar women’s fashion company from the ground up.
Peralta said that she is excited to go to each class because they are all so different, ranging from math to business to the basic introduction course.
Although only three Fashion Merchandising classes are currently offered this semester, Dr. Barbara Fowles, Chair of the Media Arts Department, said “new courses will be rolled out each semester until there is a complete course of study for the major.

The President’s Circle, previously known as the Ambassadors Program, is a collective group of students who have strong and positive feelings about being at LIU Post. These ambassadors are students who want to promote the aspects of the campus to any and all prospective students, parents, and the community.
“I decided to apply to be an ambassador because I genuinely like this university,” said Manley Francios, a senior Forensic Science major. “And I wanted to share with others why this university was the right reason for them.”
Suzanne Gluck, Associate Director of the Office of Admissions, oversees the program. Gluck said that the program is not exclusive, and that any student who is interested and has acclimated to the campus can apply to be an ambassador.
The program allows students to step out of their comfort zone, and to be a leader, according to Gluck. She said that the main characteristic she looks for is a student who is “motivated, positive, and really wants to give a perspective student an amazing experience when they come to campus.” Gluck continued that she looks for a student who is capable of “definitely being a positive, strong role model.”
The program has changed from last year. For instance, there are now three tiers that students can apply for: student ambassador, ambassador captain, and senior ambassador. Each tier has a different set of roles, requirements, and benefits.
The amount of required work hours and admissions projects that each ambassador has to complete has also changed this year, according to Gluck. Each ambassador has to guide at least one tour per week, and complete two-to-eight hours of office work, depending on their tier.
Another change the program has seen is in the benefits the ambassadors receive. Early registration for classes, early check in (if residing on campus), and a stipend ranging from $500 to $1000, depending on which tier a student is assigned to, are some of the benefits ambassadors can expect.
“The ambassador program was previously considered an on-campus job. We were paid by the hour,” said Jessica Rashbaum, a senior Digital Arts and Design major, and a former student ambassador. But she said that, “Because it’s a stipend, workers are [now] less likely to help out and take extra shifts if needed. I absolutely loved being an ambassador, and was so sad to see it end.”
“The benefit of being an ambassador is seeing multiple freshmen at Admitted Student Day and they come running to you to tell you that your tour was the reason they decided to come to LIU Post,” Francios said. “It gives you a sense of accomplishment knowing that your tour may have been the reason why someone decided to come to LIU Post.”
Gluck said that it is a learning experience. “If they’re going to do it, I need to know how to do it too,” she said. Gluck often shadows tours to observe the ambassadors. From giving tours and hosting admissions events, to learning how to drive the golf cart, Gluck said she wants to know it all.
“I recommend that anyone that would like to share their experience and tell others how wonderful of a campus we are, then I think you should apply to be an ambassador. I also think that you must have a love for your campus in order to sell someone else,” Francios said.
To learn more about the President’s Circle, or to apply, students can contact Suzanne Gluck at Suzanne.Gluck@liu.edu, or call 516-299- 2003.

First Year Service Experience (FYSE) is a collection of first-year student volunteers and resident assistants who get together before the school year starts to help out those in need. The program, created by Campus Life, visits different areas of New York City to volunteer in places such as, soup kitchens and food shelters.
“It is really important to provide students with opportunities to be engaged in the community,” said Michael Berthel, the Director of Campus Life.
Joseph Vernace, the Assistant Director of Campus Life, helps oversee the FYSE program. Vernace describes FYSE as “an immense, hands-on community service opportunity offered to first-year students.” Jenna Gadille, a freshman Musical Theatre major, had nothing but a positive experience with FYSE. “The experience itself was a great kick-off to the school year,” Gadille said. “I got involved with FYSE because LIU sent out an email advertising it, and me, being one really into leadership and volunteering, I jumped right in.”
“We want new students to have access to volunteer activities and understand the importance of service,” Berthel said, regarding the importance of freshman volunteering. “Many students are coming to LIU with experience doing service in High School and are looking for avenues to continue their service here.”
Campus Life supports the FYSE program, along with promoting Relay for Life, and other service trips available to all students. According to Berthel, there are many opportunities at LIU for students to volunteer, beyond FYSE. “We hope the programs inspire the students involved, and the community as a whole,” he said.
Gadille described the events that took place the second day of FYSE. “The next day we were allowed to sleep in a bit and net up in the ‘fishbowl’ to decorate bags and cards for an orphanage and packed them with goodies,” she said. “We then split up again and drove separately to a special needs home on the Island. That was really nice and special to me.”
This trip focused on spending time and doing crafts with adults with mental illnesses like Down Syndrome, Asperger’s, and Autism. “I had an amazing feeling while doing all of these events,” said Maria Virdone, a freshman Nutrition major.
“We love the program, and we enjoy seeing our students help others in the community,” Berthel said. “FYSE participants represent the very best of LIU!”
FYSE is a way to help freshman students get acclimated to the campus and meet people with similar interests before other students move onto campus and the semester starts. “Looking back on it now,” Virdone said, “I wouldn’t have done anything differently. I got closer with many people and had an experience of a lifetime.”
According to Vernace, students involved with FYSE previous years enjoyed the program so much that they tend to come back to FYSE and participate as leaders.

Either you consider fall fashion to be the latest trends, such as the ones that were displayed at New York Fashion Week from Sept. 10–17, or you think of it as the fashion you wear to accommodate the fall weather. It might be time to rearrange your closet.
The latest trends for fall 2015 seen at New York Fashion Week included puffer coats, chunky knits, turtlenecks, faux-fur accessories and flared jeans. These are just a few of the items that will kick out the summer dresses, shorts and t-shirts.
Fall fashion can also mean rearranging your closet and pulling forward coats and sweaters that have been collecting dust over the summer. No matter which of the two you consider to be fall fashion, whether it’s throwing on a puffer coat, or putting on any jacket to adjust to the colder weather, the fall season is upon us.
Kreesla Stovey, a senior English major, is excited to rearrange her wardrobe. “I love dressing for fall,” Stovey said. “I like to celebrate our four seasons, and a big part of it is cozying up in a sweater. The only thing I don’t like about fall fashion is that people tend to put on their boots already, which I consider a winter fashion detail. I like dressing up for school; it’s a fun way to express yourself.”
Aimee Leon, a senior English major and Philosophy minor, also expressed her excitement for dressing for the fall. “I love changing out of my summer clothes, and I find it difficult to self-express in the heat when all I want is to wear a bathing suit,” Leon said. “The cooler weather allows more leeway and options. This fall, I’ll wear ripped jeans and shirts. I like to throw on some red lipstick to look a little more put together for school.”
“I love wearing loose fitted things such as a baggy, off-the-shoulder sweater, which is my go-to during fall; I don’t like feeling shackled in my clothes,” Leon said. “At the end of the day, it’s about moderation— not too much and not too little; but what you consider too much or too little is totally subjective. It doesn’t matter if you come to school wearing sweats all day or a body dress and ten inch heels. Confidence is the best accessory.”
However, just how boldly can you dress at LIU Post? Director of Campus Life, Michael Berthel, clarified the school’s dress code. “There is no university policy on a dress code, but if a faculty member finds something discriminating or as such, they would address it,” Berthel said. However, he added that Campus Life encourages students to show their school pride on Tuesdays. “Students are encouraged to follow LIU Post’s ‘Be seen in green, be bold in gold’ on Tuesdays,” Berthel said. “But that is the extent of what we promote students to wear.”
Since there is no school uniform or dress code on campus, students can experiment and express themselves through their clothing, and fully enjoy the trends this fall.

Finding a spot during the morning rush at LIU Post truthfully is the metaphorical equivalent to a game of Russian roulette. One day, you’ll win; your prize is that coveted spot right outside of Hillwood. The next day, you don’t win, but survive. You can take the spot in the auxiliary lot adjacent to the Pratt Center. Yeah, it’s about a ten-minute walk to your class, but you’re running late and you’ll take it, because if you don’t, you are late to class, and lose.
If there are no spots anywhere to be found, you’re faced with either parking on the other side of campus, or creating your own spot, risking a ten dollar ticket given to you by the public safety officer, who doesn’t care that you were late, only about where you parked. Oh, and he probably enjoyed writing you that ticket, too.
The new regime here at Post has, dare I say, made “improvements” to the campus. For example, the flowers! The new beautification process Post underwent this year has brought many new things to campus, like bees…lots of them. How about improvements in terms of parking on campus? Negative, there are none.
Understandable, yes, given that it’s been only two years since President Cline’s arrival, but this is a problem Post has been facing for years.
“I couldn’t take the hour drive to Post, just barely making it to campus on time was one thing,” said Stephanie Athanasopolous, a junior Photography major. “But then finding a spot [on campus] seriously added twenty minutes to the daily adventure called my morning commute. I [now] either have to wake up an hour earlier, or I just stay over at my friend’s dorm.”
“It’s my first year here, and literally I don’t know how you guys do it,” said Jason Mari, a junior Business major. “Parking is such a process.”
The parking situation at Post, from my perspective, has truly gotten out of hand. Post offers room and board, but the university is mostly recognized as a commuter school. For commuters, like myself, who drive from as far as Queens, Brooklyn, and eastern Long Island, LIU fails to provide us with adequate parking and it is insulting. I start my commute from Queens to Post at 8:15 a.m., and the L.I.E. is stressful enough; finding parking on campus shouldn’t have to be just as stressful.
Perhaps the most disheartening thing about this whole situation is the fact that Post doesn’t have a good track record to begin with when it comes to providing sufficient parking for its students.
Over the summer, the LIU Post administration implemented numerous budget cuts. Our campus doesn’t even have an ambulance anymore, and I’m starting to think it’s because they had no place to park it.
I get it; we all get it. College is about taking responsibility, maturing, and growing into your own. However, if the student body is facing a problem, such as parking, how can we better ourselves if we can’t even make it to class on time? I fear that if Post doesn’t solve its parking problem in the near future, another university — that doesn’t hurt my wallet or gas tank as much — might.

360 B.C., in the magnificent setting of ancient Greece, the glorious city of Athens, Plato records a conversation between Socrates and Crito. In this genius piece, we find out the love and “zeal” that these philosophical pioneers have for academia and knowledge is something that I believe has become over shadowed by our generation’s closed-mindedness.
Philosophy translates in Greek, “for the love of wisdom.” Have many of us now fallen out of the idea of learning as something just to be great, or for the excitement and sake of learning?
It brings up the question, why do we come to college and take a major that intrigues us, only to neglect it? Coming to college is such an exciting time in all of our lives. The freedom, the parties, the fun and friends; still we all must remember we need to get a good degree, too!
From the time of Socrates, to Einstein, to Thomas Edison, these notions of achievement and academic development were a thing of true beauty. It was something that they were completely ready to die for. Now, I am not saying that all of us here at Post need to have the “martyrdom” attitude with every class, because cleaning up the blood after midterms would just be too expensive!
However, having this concept of being passionate for a subject or cause is needed, especially in our generation. Evil used to be branded as the lack of knowledge. Does this mean that a high percentage of the 21st century students are “evil?” I hope not. However, are we not putting ourselves at a complete disadvantage by not thriving to learn more and more every day?
I am a prime example of a student who felt that I didn’t have to put too much effort into my studies, and that I could just coast through in second gear, and then occasionally bump up to third gear every now and then. But as I have grown older and more open-minded, I have spoken to fascinating people, such as my teammates, brothers and professors, who have motivated me to climb out of the oblivious hole that so many of us have fallen into.
I always thought I would have soccer to fall back on, but the reality is that most things in life are not concrete. The more goals you give yourself to achieve by learning different subjects, getting good grades, and showing passionate control over things, is going to help you thrive and graduate college, and not think, “Well…what now?”
It seems to take a few alcoholic beverages for many of us to jump out of a shell and convey that we know so much about everything. What if we actually did know, and have learned about so many well-rounded things, that our brain has just soaked it all up and is eager to spit them out in any environment or situation? (And not just in a drunken slur?) Wouldn’t that be so rewarding for ourselves?
My brother is what I would call pretty “geeky” and this isn’t a bad thing. In fact, I could be unsure about a political event, a scientific experiment, or any field of academia, and he could give me a detailed and understandable answer. I am in the ore of people that cannot do that, which is why I feel the need to better myself scholastically, and intellectually, so that maybe I could be the guy that people ask questions to.
That being said, maybe we can all go the extra length to learn the content of our classes and not just pass? Maybe we could be that friend that people have grave respect for, not because of the amount of girls or boys you attract or how good you are at a sport, but because of your vast knowledge! So, what’s the moral of the story? Study up and learn!

In high school, I played soccer. By play, I mean sat on the bench talking about philosophy, homework and staring at cloud formations with the other players who were kept on the team as a mercy gesture. Sometimes, I’d get subbed in (I was a “defender”) around the 80th minute, if we were up a few goals. Emphasis on the “sometimes.” And those frantic minutes I was on the pitch were filled with danger and misplay.
I mean to say that my experience with sports has been limited – almost exclusively confined to random recreation and playing sports video-games. That isn’t to say I haven’t had intense spats of general interest in sports. There was one stage, in 7th grade, in which I became hopelessly obsessed with baseball and the Yankees, collecting cards and religiously playing the MLB games on my PlayStation. I even got a baseball signed by Yogi Berra (R.I.P.) at a collector store. And now, I find myself enthralled with soccer again.
Soccer has always been an elusive paramour to my family, something we played (or tried to) but rarely watched on TV. My dad introduced me and my brother to the sport, having been a star goalie for C.W. Post (ahem, LIU Post) back in the 80’s. In 2006, I rooted for Italy in the World Cup, noting Francesco Totti as a favorite player. And now, one of those Italian players Andrea Pirlo is a star on a new, inaugural season New York City team for Major League Soccer.
Way back in 2000, as was tradition, youth players were given trading cards with their own picture, position, age, etc. We were asked to say who our favorite player was – not knowing anyone, I said Mia Hamm. That was the year after the Women’s National Team won the World Cup. And that was the last time they won it until this summer in a scorching 5-2 match with Japan. The day after the cup, I overheard a hell of a lot of conversations about it. A man on the train ranted to me how they are the best of the best.
I have to say, enthusiasm for the sport has been more potent and visible than I’ve ever seen. The success of the Women’s National team, and the excitement of the men’s cup the summer before, has won me over as an avid follower of the sport. As I write this, I am wearing my NYCFC shirt. This new team boasts stars like Spaniard David Villa, Brit Frank Lampard, the aforementioned Italian Pirlo, USMNT star Mix Diskerud and up and coming fan favorites like Kwadwo Poku (unleash the POKU!) and goalie Josh Saunders.
I have never been more dedicated to a sports team like this. My family has begun to watch NYC games with the same vigor as American football fans – we make food, drinks and make a day of it. I’ve gone to three matches in this inaugural season, and I know quite a few fellow Post students who are into it too. I understand now, sports are damn entertaining, but they’re also something we grow up with, hold on to, and value excellence in similarly to art.
So, I pick up my copy of FIFA 16 for PS4 last week and plunge into a quick match. This time, I have the option (for the first time ever in the series) of playing as the USWNT and other women’s teams around the world. Alex Morgan stands equal to Lionel Messi on the video game cover – no doubt this respect has been earned by the hard work of our female players at the World Cup during the summer.
I can’t help but think about how the sport has grown, how I picked Mia Hamm as my favorite player years ago, and now, fifteen years later, millions of people around the world might pick up a copy of this game, play as a women’s team and pick a player from there.

The Steinberg Museum in Hillwood Commons started its season with an exhibition made in-house. The exhibition consists of a handful of faculty members and their respective works. Diverse works and media, including oil paintings, drawing, sculpting and even digital political commentary. Responsible for some of the more pleasing-to-the-eye paintings is professor Neill Slaughter.
Slaughter is back at the University after a year long sabbatical, where he spent a lot of time honing skills and producing art. His style is an eye catching mix between contemporary and almost renaissance way of capturing landscapes. “I want you to know that all the paintings including the watercolors, like the oils were painted en plein air (on location) in Maine where I went to paint before during and after my year long sabbatical,” he said.
The exhibition is important for both students and faculty.
“The reason I think it is important to have a faculty exhibit is twofold, for students to see the diversity of the faculty members and for the other faculty of the university to see what we in the art department are doing when we are not teaching,” Slaughter said.
“I will take students to see the exhibit as well because it is important for student to real paintings and not just reproductions in books or power point presentations.”
Slaughter’s belief is that one can only learn so much about doing art with reading and talking.
“I took a group of students to the MET Museum last Friday to see the John Singer Sargent exhibit as well as other exhibits and will take another group on Oct. 2 because to fully appreciate the brushwork as well as the correct color, it simply has to be seen in real life,” he said.
The exhibition is open to the public now, and will be up through Oct. 24. There will be a reception where the artists will mingle on Oct. 8, from 5 to 8 p.m. Snacks will be served.

Seung Lee, Art Professor and Director of Fine Arts and Graduate Studies at LIU Post, will be on sabbatical for this school year. The professor, who has been working at Post for 26 years now, felt that as he traveled to different countries, it was getting harder and harder to supply his paintings to museums and/or art galleries around the world. “I decided to take a year off to organize and spend more time producing my own work and to do some more research,” Lee said.
Professor Lee has always been fascinated with traveling; therefore, he plans to do a lot of it during this time off. In fact, he already has planned out some of the countries he will be visiting, “In November I will be participating in an MFA Program Conference in Florence, Italy,” Lee said. “Following that, in December I will be travelling to China to give a lecture at Shenzhen University. Next year, in March, I will be participating in the Hong Kong Art Fair.”
As not only an artist, but also as a teacher, Lee believes that it’s very important to travel. Because of this, he plans on incorporating what he learns during his travels into the classroom once he comes back. “Recently I’ve been travelling a lot to China, because as you can notice on our campus, there is a lot of Chinese exchange students,” Lee said. “It is very important for me to know their culture so I can help them with their art, because I want to make sure I give them the right information for them to go back to China and become good talented artists. It’s kind of my responsibility in a way.”
During this sabbatical, Professor Lee has set a lot of goals for himself, but his main goal is to create a lot of new artwork. “Hopefully I will be able to show a lot of new work that I will be creating during my sabbatical,” Lee said. “You need a lot of time to produce new work so what I used to do was in a way recycle my work to different galleries and museums. This time will give me a chance to create new work, so I am very excited.”
This past summer Professor Lee took part on a faculty lead study abroad, leading a trip to South Korea, with 12 students, to teach an art course. Candice Licalzi, who graduated from Post with BFA and is now currently in her second year of her MFA at Post, was one of the students that went on the trip. “His trip to Korea was the first trip I’ve ever been on with professor Lee and the experience was like no other study abroad program I’ve ever been on before,” said Licalzi. “We as a group were very fortunate to show our artwork overseas at four different universities, which is something that many artists take years to achieve but that is just scratching the surface.”
Lee believes that it’s really important to “learn about different cultures as young artists, not only to express themselves, but to understand things internationally and globally.” Lee explains the market has grown out of New York. “Before it used to be that if you made it in New York you made it everywhere but that’s not the case anymore, they really need to understand global market.”
Susan Kelly, who graduated with a degree in Fine Arts and is currently in the MFA program, highly recommends any student to take a class with Professor Lee. “Even if it’s just one painting or drawing class, you should take it,” she said. “He’s a genuine person- he’ll treat you like a person, not just a student. He’ll actually care about you.”
Many students will miss Professor Lee while he is on his sabbatical. Licalzi, who has known the professor for five years, claims that because of his helpfulness and kind spirit during her young high school years, she decided to study fine arts at LIU Post. “Just the fact that when he announced he was taking sabbatical- many students got upset with him,” said Kelly. “They were upset that he wouldn’t be around for them for an entire year, that he wouldn’t be teaching them- and wouldn’t be able to attend their senior art shows. That should show how much he means to the students.”
Although he’ll be missed, Licalzi has very positive thoughts on Lee’s sabbatical. “I believe it’s every art educators right to have the time to create and distribute their work,” said Licalzi. “I still keep in contact with Seung constantly and he sends me photos of art fairs or exhibitions he’s participating in that posses works similar to my style and helps encourage the progression of my work.”
Sofie Hoff, who graduated in January 2015 with a BFA in Mixed Studio Art and is currently doing her M.A. in clinical art therapy and mental health counseling at Post, believes that it’s important for Professors to take a sabbatical. “I do believe it enriches their teaching when they are serious about their own work,” she said. “I think everyone could benefit from taking some time off every now and then to recharge and
to gather some new insights and inspiration, but I think it is especially important as an artists in order to stay grounded and relevant.”
Professor Lee’s advice to young artist is to be very open and flexible. “It’s a very exciting time we are in, because there are endless possibilities,” Lee said. “In one sense it’s very exciting but in another sense it’s very confusing” he added with a chuckle.
During Lee’s sabbatical, Professor of Fine Arts, Neill Slaughter, will be covering his director position and a new part-time faculty member, Professor Wagner, will cover most of Lee’s classes.

After the fairly uneven season eight that saw Peter Capaldi make his debut as the Twelfth Doctor, season nine of Doctor Who promises to excite the senses with “The Magician’s Apprentice.” Season nine premiered on Sept. 19 and found the time Lord facing off against one of his greatest enemies, Davros, creator of the Daleks.
As the episode opened, we were thrown into a war between two unknown factions. Suddenly, the Doctor appears in an attempt to save a boy stranded in a minefield. As he promised the child salvation, the Doctor realized he was talking to a young Davros, creator of the Daleks, a sinister alien race.
This situation presented a great moral decision for the Doctor. By saving Davros, he knowingly brings about the creation of the Daleks, who will cause chaos throughout the galaxy. The outcome of this decision has such an effect on the Doctor that he travels to the Middle Ages to bring about his death.
Clara Oswald, the Doctor’s companion, is back in present day earth deeply in need of the Doctor’s help as planes have suddenly frozen in the sky around the world. Before long Clara and UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce) discover that the perpetrator is fellow Time Lord Missy.
Missy is the newest incarnation of the Master, one of the Doctor’s oldest friends and enemies, who was seemingly killed at the end of last season and returned for unknown reasons. When planes are suddenly suspended in midair, Clara and UNIT discover that Missy is behind this latest horrific act. It is only when Clara confronts Missy that we see two powerful and resourceful women carry the first half of the episode. Missy reveals to Clara that the Doctor bestowed on her his “confession dial,” a sign that he plans to die. Before long, they join forces and find the Doctor in 12th century England.
Though brief, the interaction between Missy and Clara was a great dynamic. They were together for a good portion of the episode, sharing some witty dialogue particularly before meeting the Doctor. Their interaction was also a major departure from the show’s formula of companion versus villain. After a heated discussion regarding the Doctor and his whereabouts, Missy and Clara agree to work together to find the Doctor. Missy releases the suspended planes and together they travel to the Middle Ages to rescue the Doctor.
There were also some great nods to past seasons of the rebooted version of Doctor Who and Classic Who. One particular moment occurred during a conversation between the Doctor and Davros where archived footage is shown of past encounters between the two.
Upon Clara and Missy’s arrival to 12th century England, the three are subsequently captured and brought to the planet of Skaro, home world of Davros. The episode ends with a cliffhanger, which raises the bar for the rest of the season and begs to be watched to discover how it’s solved.
New episodes of Doctor Who will air Saturday nights at 9 p.m. on BBC America.

Ryan Gioe, a sophomore Engineering major from Huntington Station, N.Y., is a runner for the LIU Post Cross Country and Track & Field teams. Gioe is coming off a stellar first year with the Pioneers, performing very well in both the East Coast Conference Championships and the East Region Championships.
Q: Is there any significant difference between cross country and track?
A: Cross Country is ran more in the trails where there’s higher elevation. Track is more controlled and ran on an even surface.
Q: How can you build on your success from last year as a freshman?
A: Staying healthy is key. I also need to keep up my mileage. Core and lifting is important because it has helped me grow and succeed more. Knowing when to push myself and when to slow down is also beneficial to my game.
Q: What are your biggest goals this year?
A: First, I’d say coming first in our conference. Then, I want to make the first team All-Conference and then possibly try to make the All-Region team.
Q: Does your team have what it takes to win at the ECC Championships?
A: I definitely think so. Once we work on our higher mileage and have quicker workouts, we’ll be in very good shape moving forward. Roberts Wesleyan University is our biggest competition, so we need to prepare for them.
Q: When did you first start running track and cross country?
A: I started track in seventh grade and cross country in eighth grade. Overall, I’ve been running for about seven years.
Q: What influenced your decision to choose LIU Post over other schools?
A: Post has a very good Pre-Engineering program, which was a huge eye-opener. Also, the opportunity to run in college, and the atmosphere here is great.
Q: What is your favorite part about running?
A: Just letting everything go and how time slows down. My favorite part is morning runs.
Q: How do you prepare yourself for meets and invitationals?
A: I warm up for about 45 minutes by stretching and listening to music. I also run about one or two miles and take my mind off the race.
Q: Who do you most admire?
A: The people I most admire are middle and long distance runner, Steve Prefontaine, my older brother, and my mother because they all give 100 percent effort in everything they do.
Q: What goes through your mind prior to a race?
A: I like to joke around a little and stay relaxed. I tell myself to enjoy the race.
Q: What do you do in your free time?
A: I usually study for school and help out in recruitment for my fraternity, Theta Chi. I also enjoy listening to music.

Facing a one-goal deficit and 15 minutes to go in regulation, the men’s soccer team somehow found a way to climb out of the hole and tie the game. After one full extra period, the Pioneers eventually pulled out the dramatic 2-1 win against the University of District of Columbia in double overtime on Wednesday, Sept. 23.
The equalizing goal in the 85th minute came from senior forward Per Forgaard, which forced the overtime. The scoreless over-time put the extra onus on both teams to score and get the victory in a game so tightly contested. In that second overtime, sophomore forward Jason Lampkin corralled his own rebound and beat the keeper to give the Pioneers the thrilling 2-1 win.
The Pioneers went back to work on Saturday, Sept. 26, when they visited Queens College in Flushing, N.Y. The team won the hard fought battle 2-0 thanks to two late goals. Senior keeper, Kevin LaBarbera, who was seeing his first action of the season, kept Queens off the scoreboard through the first half, even though they had four shots.
In a match that had over-time written all over it, junior forward Johann Kristjansson had other ideas. Kristjansson scored the first goal of the game in the 82nd minute after beating the Queens keeper to a loose ball and tapping in the goal. Later in the match, freshman forward Charlie Ledula added another goal just for good measure to give LIU the two- goal advantage.
The Pioneers outshot Queens 13-7 and LaBarbera secured his first win and shutout of the 2015 season. Andreas Lindberg and his team are back at it on Wednesda, Sept. 30, when they welcome Philadelphia University to Brookville, N.Y. Opening kick is scheduled for 3 p.m.

After leading comfortably 37-20, with less than three minutes remaining, the LIU Post football team suffered its first loss of the season in dramatic fashion to NE-10 rival, Stonehill College, 40-37, on Saturday, Sept. 26, in Brookville, N.Y.
The Pioneers (3-1) dominated throughout the first three-and-a-half quarters, until the Skyhawks (4-0) scored 20 unanswered points in the final 2:13 of the contest. The visitors completed the miracle come-from-behind-win with a 41-yard Hail Mary touchdown as the game-clock expired.
One of the upsides for the Pioneers was red-shirt freshman running back, Malik Pierre. Pierre had a monster game, rushing for 238 yards and three touchdowns on 33 carries. Throughout the game, Pierre consistently picked up huge chunks of yardage. Pierre’s longest run of the game was a 64- yard scamper down to the Stonehill 1-yard line. On the following play, he finished the job with a 1-yard score, giving LIU a 17-6 lead midway through the third quarter.
Junior quarterback Jeff Kidd and the Pioneers offense staged two impressive touchdown drives to gain a commanding 30-6 advantage with 1:17 left in the third period. Kidd fired two touchdown passes; one to red-shirt junior wide-out Shane Hubbard and the other to senior tight end, Sean Binckes.
From that point on, things went downhill for the hosts. The Skyhawks answered back immediately with a touchdown, making it a 30-13 game heading into the fourth quarter. Miscues on offense for the Green and Gold resulted in a momentum swing as Stonehill quietly came within ten points at the 9:50 mark of the final period. LIU would tack on another touchdown, but the visitors kept the wheels moving as they soared down the field for a quick touchdown with just 1:02 to go.
After an unfortunate turn of events, the Pioneers found themselves reeling as Stonehill’s prayers were answered, scoring two touchdowns in the final ten ticks of the contest. Post was stunned as the visitors got the last laugh. Freshman Skyhawk quarterback, Matt Foltz, hoisted a bomb that was corralled in by junior receiver, Corey White, on the final play of the game.
Kidd and the offense struggled as he only completed 11-of-25 for 128 yards throwing two touchdowns and one interception. He was also sacked three times. Hubbard led the pack with 55 receiving yards on three receptions and one score.
Defensively, junior defensive back Clarence Sears stood out with seven tackles, one interception and one pass break-up. Red-shirt sophomore defensive lineman Anthony DeNunzio totaled four tackles, two sacks, and forced a fumble. Sophomore defensive lineman, Kevin Petit-Frere, also chipped in with five stops, 1.5 sacks and a pass deflection.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers look to rebound from a tough loss as they travel to Springfield, MA to take on their Northeast-10 arch rival, American International College on Saturday, Oct. 3. Kickoff is scheduled for noon.

Coming off a one-goal loss against Assumption College earlier in the week, the field hockey team welcomed Stonehill College to Pioneer Country on Sunday, Sept. 27.
The Pioneers suffered the same result though, a one-goal loss, as they dropped their second straight. Stonehill scored one goal on the afternoon, but that was enough to claim the victory in enemy territory. The lone goal came in the 15th minute curtesy of senior forward Erika Kelly.
The Pioneers will try and bounce back today when they travel to New Hampshire to play Saint Anselm College. Face-off is set for 5:30 p.m.

Coming off a dominating win against Wilmington University on Wednesday, Sept. 23, the women’s soccer team traveled to duel with Queens College on Saturday, Sept. 26, and they ended up coming out with a 1-1 draw.
The Pioneers got on the board with an important goal in the LIU Post history books as senior forward Susanne Vistnes beat the keeper to give Post the one up less than ten minutes into the game. The goal was the 60th in Vistnes’ collegiate career, establishing a new record as the top goal scorer in LIU history, surpassing Tara Vokes who played from 1999-2002.
Queens College later tied the match in the second half and spoiled the afternoon for the Green and Gold. The match headed to overtime and in the extra period, neither team drew blood and the 1-1 score held up until the final whistle. The Pioneers return to the field on Thursday, Oct. 1, when they welcome Nyack College to Brookville, N.Y. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m.

The Pioneers served up a weekend set of games on Thursday, Sept. 24, against Molloy College and managed to upend their opponents 3-1.
After trailing early in the first set, the Pioneers ended up taking that set 25-21 and didn’t look back. In their 3-1 match victory, freshman outside hitter, Rachel Londot, totaled 17 digs and 14 kills while senior setter, Monica Amador, and sophomore outside hitter, Danielle Valenza, each posted 10 kills of their own.
In their next match against Stonehill College two days later, the Pioneers kept up their winning ways as they outlasted their opponents in five sets. The Pioneers showed resilience, rallying when down, and even after allowing Stonehill to tie the match in the second and fourth set.
The pivotal part of the game came in the fifth set when junior middle hitter, Taryn McCullouch, put down four of her ten kills during a game-changing 8-0 run, which gave LIU all the momentum.
