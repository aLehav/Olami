 This summer, Co-Editor-in-Chief  Ashley Bowden is working as an Editorial Intern at the Chicago Agent  Magazine, a publication for real estate professionals that’s printed by  Agent Publishing. Bowden also writes for the conpany’s online magazines  for Houston, Boston, Atlanta and Miami. 
“It’s  been very interesting learning about the real estate industry and  having to do things like turn census statistics and housing reports into  stories, and I enjoyed interviewing a real estate broker and reporting a  feature on him that was printed in the June 24 issue of the Chicago  magazine. I’ve been adjusting to a different writing style and working  on projects I didn’t know could be so rewarding. It’s been a summer  well-spent.”Check out some of Bowden’s work here!
