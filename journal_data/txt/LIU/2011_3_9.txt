Are you thinking about something to do this summer? Wondering where you’ll be and with whom? Have you already figured out how you will satisfy your plan of study’s core requirements? Well, C.W. Post will be offering a total of 10 new courses on Sustainability from May 16 through August 26. These courses include “Wall Street Solutions to Sustainability,” “The American Classroom & Sustainability in Curriculum and Policies,” “Introduction to Basic News Writing for the Environment,” “The Human Artistic Experience in the Natural World,” “Special Topic in Ecology/Evolution: Our Changing Earth,” “Field Studies in Earth Science,”“Eco-Art: Creative Environmental Sustainability,” “Ancient Egypt: The Ultimate Sustainable Nation,” “The Business of Clean Technology,” and “The Sustainability Challenge and the Global Firm.” These courses are offered to “change the way we think about our planet” and are the only courses offered at a special discount rate of 1/3 of the tuition. If you thought that was not enough, high school juniors and seniors will also be eligible to enroll in the environmental course for $440 and three undergraduate credits.
Although an estimate of the number of students who will sign up for the courses could not be provided because registration for summer classes does not begin until March 21, you may be wondering what the pros and cons are of taking one of these courses over the summer? But, first, what are the intentions of these classes, and will they be effective in changing students’ perceptions about “our planet”?
Across the board, C.W. Post has implemented various environmentally-friendly measures, such as recycling pails in different buildings to make students aware of their roles in “our planet.” These measures are somewhat effective in helping students become more aware about the potential hazards that will arise if recycling is not enforced.
Questions and concerns may arise about these specialized courses on Sustainability. For example, is this another way to address this issue? And if so, will it work? I think that no matter what extensive measures are employed by C.W. Post or the general community, it is a person’s free choice and decision to think about “our planet.” It is his or her free choice that will take precedence in terms of how a student will react to sustaining “our planet.”
On the other hand, how far will these courses reach the C.W. Post community, and are they only targeted toward certain students? I am sure many students will profit from taking these courses, but it might not affect all students, particularly the ones who cannot enroll in the classes. Other students from C.W. Post had some thoughts of their own about these new courses. Jillian Saltarella, a psychology major, said that C.W. Post may have taken the “go green thing a little too far.” Jenna Provenzano, another psychology major, agreed with Jillian stating that it’s “great to be green;” however, these new courses seem as though they’re “just shoving go green down my throat.”
C.W. Post is continuously bringing exciting new courses to the curriculum so that it can provide learning opportunities to C.W. Post students that will last for a long period of time.  Therefore, can you really criticize C.W. Post’s growing effort to make a student’s academic career more inclusive?

On Sunday, March 6th, the C.W. Post men’s basketball team knocked off the number one-ranked Bridgeport Purple Knights 68-64 to win the East Coast Conference Championship and advance to the NCAA Division II Tournament. The entire tournament was being played in Bridgeport, so the Purple Knights had the home court advantage going in their favor. Nevertheless, this did not rattle the Pioneers as they jumped out to an early 10-0 lead to open the game. As the game progressed, it was a back and forth battle down to the wire. Within the final ten minutes of play, neither team led by more than four points. It was a classic game as both sides were within striking distance of each other for most of the game.
However, the only reason the Pioneers even had the opportunity to play in the championship game was because they managed to defeat the third-ranked Queens College Knights the day before 73-67. This game was an intense battle that needed overtime to decide the victor. The Pioneers dominated the first half, leading by as much as 15 points. During this half, the Pioneers collectively shot 56 percent from the floor and played great defense, limiting the Purple Knights to 2-13 shooting from beyond the arc.
The second half was a different story. The Pioneers once-large lead slimmed down until it was eventually relinquished with 1:20 seconds left play as the Knights went ahead 61-60. The Pioneers barely managed to squeak into overtime, the score tied at 61 going into the extra period.
Senior forward Aaron Hall, an ECC First Team selection had half of the Pioneers 12 points in the overtime session, leading to the 73-67 win that solidified their spot in the ECC Championship game. Hall scored 12 points and secured a game-high 11 rebounds to record another double-double. Junior guard Stefan Bonneau, named ECC Player of the Year, scored 21 points to go along with 5 rebounds in the win. Selected to the All Rookie Team, forward Vaughn Allen had 11 points to complement Hall and Bonneau. In addition, sophomore guard Jonathan Kohler, currently out due to injury, made the ECC Second Team by averaging 13 points and 6 rebounds per contest.
The following day, the second-ranked Pioneers (21-9) went head-to-head against the top-seeded Bridgeport Purple Knights (19-9). At the end of the first half, the score was deadlocked at 36 apiece. The Pioneers were stellar from downtown as they went 6-12 to keep the Purple Knights defenders wary of the outside shot. Billy Butler and Bonneau had three three-pointers apiece at the conclusion of the first half.
The second half played out similarly to the first in that neither team jumped out too much of a lead. The biggest gap achieved by either team throughout the duration of the second half was five points by the Purple Knights. With five minutes left to play, the championship was tied up at 57. During the final five minutes, four different Pioneers scored to defeat the rival Bridgeport Purple Knights 68-64. Senior guard Gilbert Montalvo made a clutch bucket down the stretch to give Post a lead it would never give back. Sophomore guard Tobin Carberry sealed the game by sinking four free-throws in the final seconds of play. Four players for the Pioneers finished in double-figure points, led by Allen with 16 points and 10 rebounds to give him a double-double.
The Pioneers, currently the eighth seed in the NCAA Division II Tournament, next play on Saturday, March 12th, against the number one seeded Bentley University Falcons (22-7).

For many athletes, finding the time to eat during the day is a huge challenge. Coaches run long practices in all sports and, after practices are over, large amounts of homework prevent student athletes from having a meal for dinner. Many students would have to run to Winnick, grab a to-go tray, and rush back to their rooms to get their work done. Some would go to Hillwood and grab a quick Subway sandwich but won’t have time to enjoy it. Many times, athletes have class right after practice and must grab a quick energy bar from the Little Shop of Commons in Hillwood and make that their dinner. It’s a struggle, but athletes have dealt with it.
Recently however, it has come to the attention of members of the Student Athletic Advisory Committee, that students have voiced their concerns about not being able to eat a meal for dinner. SAAC is a student organization that helps to make the college experience better for student athletes, while also doing community service.
The Pratt Center has a concession stand that is always open for football and basketball games, but not on a regular basis. SAAC thought that this would be a great way for student athletes to eat a decent meal before going back to class after practice, and do so without rushing. SAAC member Sarah Kiser, who is also a senior pitcher on the C.W. Post softball team, explained that opening the concession stand regularly was a priority. “As you know, athletes are constantly in the Pratt, and we’re pretty much always running from practice to class and back. A lot of student athletes began complaining about the lack of time to eat, especially with coaches making use of common hour practices.” Kiser explained that since the concession stand was already used during the course of the year, it would not be hard to open it on a regular basis. “Since there was already a concession stand with food storage equipment in it from football and basketball games, we thought it would be very easy to get it open on regular days as well.”
With the idea now out there, the members of SAAC needed to talk to someone to make this happen. “We basically just had to talk to Aramark and faculty members of the Pratt to see if it was possible. Once we got the go ahead, Aramark pretty much handled everything else, which made life easier,” Kiser explained. “Coach Meg (Girls lax) really helped us with everything this year, and she’s a big reason the café is open now.”
Now that the concession stand could be open regularly, the question was what to offer for students to eat. “SAAC members are partly responsible for what is being served there now” Kiser said. “We took the aspects we like from each café around campus, and wanted to put it all into one. If it’s successful this year, we are hoping to get a juice/smoothie bar type thing there next year.” At the Pratt Center café, students can get salads, sandwiches, and other healthy choices. According to Kiser, the stand seems to be doing very well, and SAAC hopes that the success of the stand continues for a long time.

Since joining the women’s basketball team in the fall of 2009, Janea Aiken has made a name for herself at C.W. Post.  A transfer from S.U.N.Y. Albany, she was named the East Coast Conference Player of the Year in 2010 and 2011, the Eastern College Athletic Conference Player of the Year, a five-time ECC Player of the Week, and has recorded over 1,000 career points.  She and the 2011 ECC Champion Pioneers will head to their first NCAA Tournament in 10 years later this month.
 
Name: Janea Aiken
 
Major: Accounting
Hometown: St. Albans
How long have you been playing at Post?
I have been playing at Post for 2 years.
What did you first think about Post?
When I first came to Post I thought it was a nice campus and that I could really enjoy myself being closer to home.
How do you feel about Post now?
I love the school and the location. I love being close to home and my family.
Lesson(s) you will take from Post?
I think a lesson I can take from Post is to be disciplined especially in the real world. I think that’s a lesson I can carry forward with me throughout my life.
Best memory with the team/of Post?
My best memory would be last year, when we won 20 games as a team for the first time in a long time and we also broke a couple of other records as well. I thought that was pretty cool.
What do you want to do after Post?
After I graduate from Post I want to try and find a job somewhere in the accounting field.
What will you miss from Post?
I think the thing I will miss most from Post will be just the college life, not really having to worry about being an adult just yet…not that I’m not looking forward to it.  It’s just that you don’t have that many worries as a college student.
How did you feel after scoring your 1,000th career point?
After scoring my 1000th point I felt like I had achieved a lot but not what I ultimately wanted to achieve…hopefully we win it all this year so that could be my best memory from Post.

The Lady Pioneers entered the ECC tournament as the fourth seed, but have played the Cinderella story, knocking off Queens College on Wednesday, March 2nd, at the Pratt Center. They then traveled to Bridgeport to knock off Saint Thomas Aquinas and Bridgeport to make it into the NCAA tournament.
It began when they beat Queens College on Wednesday, 67-61. The Pioneers had beaten the Knights each time they faced them in the regular season and the trend continued at the Pratt. Janea Aiken and Felicia Joyner accounted for 43 points combined, while Alyssa Lombardi totaled 14 rebounds.
With the victory over Queens, the Lady Pioneers traveled to Bridgeport, Connecticut to face top-seeded Saint Thomas Aquinas, a team that C.W. Post had struggled against during the regular season, losing each time the two teams met. The Lady Pioneers jumped out to an early 10-0 lead and never looked back, dominating on offense thanks to Aiken’s career high 35 points. The Pioneers played stellar defense, allowing the Spartans to shoot just 36 percent from the floor in the 78-67 victory. Joyner also had 22 points in the victory and broke the 1,000 point mark for her career.  Lombardi led the team in rebounds again with 11, including the final one as the buzzer sounded to end the game.
Playing in their first ECC Championship game since 2007, and with the chance to head to the NCAA tournament, Post needed to get past Bridgeport, another team that gave the Pioneers troubles throughout the regular season, taking two of the three games in which the two teams faced each other.
Neither team could gain a major lead for much of the first half until the Purple Knights went on a 7-0 run to lead 25-18. C.W. Post battled back and tied the game with a lay-up by Aiken. The Pioneers continued to build a lead through the rest of the first half, entering halftime 40-33. Post held the lead for most of the second half, but the Purple Knights would not go down without a fight, tying the game at 58 with just over five minutes to play. Bridgeport managed to build a small lead that they held till the final 11 seconds, when Aiken converted a huge layup to give the Lady Pioneers a 67-66 lead. Bridgeport fouled Aiken as a last hope effort, but Aiken sank both to ice the game. The score stood 69-66; the Lady Pioneers were ECC champions and had gained a berth into the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001.
After the game, Aiken was named Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. Joyner and Anthia Smith were named to the ECC All-Tournament team.   From here the Lady Pioneers will begin the NCAA tournament.  At this time it is unsure which team the Pioneers will face and when their first game will be.

This past weekend, the C.W. Post baseball team dropped five games at the Baseball Heaven Complex in Yaphank, New York. The baseball team came back from North Carolina two weeks ago having dropped four games before coming back north for this week’s set of games. The Pioneers were scheduled to play at home this weekend, but due to poor field conditions, the Pioneers hosted games at the turf Baseball Heaven Complex instead.
On Friday, March 4th, the Pioneers hosted Southern New Hampshire University in a double-header. Starting pitcher Bo Budkevics went four and a third and struck out seven batters while surrendering only two runs on four hits and walking three. The damage came in the fifth inning, when the Pioneers surrendered six runs. Offensively, sophomore Casey McKay had three of the Pioneers’ four hits, leading the way. The Pioneers lost the game 9-0 and headed into the second game against the Penmen with junior pitcher Glen Hudson taking the ball.
Hudson put in a strong outing, holding SNHU to five scoreless innings, including a one out bases loaded jam in which he struck out the next two batters, ending the inning. The Pioneers took a 1-0 lead into the fifth inning before SNHU started their half of the inning, reaching on a Post error. The error followed a sacrifice bunt and a wild pitch, putting the tying run on third with one out. A base hit through the right side would get the run and SNHU didn’t look back. The Pioneers could not put together a scoring inning after the fifth and lost the game 4-1.
Saturday and Sunday’s games did not get any easier, as the Pioneers were scheduled to host the seventh-ranked team in the nation, Franklin Pierce University. Saturday, the Pioneers sent sophomore pitcher Rafael Martinez to try and get the first win of the season in game one of a double header. Martinez had a strong start to the game, only allowing one hit in the first two innings, until surrendering three runs on four singles. Offensively, juniors Matt Simone and Steve Smith each had a pair of hits for the Pioneers. Smith went on to drive in the only run in the 1-10 loss to the Ravens. In the second game, junior Paul Bischoff threw five solid innings for the Pioneers, allowing only one run. Into the fifth however, the Pioneers collapsed defensively again, making two errors, followed by three more errors in the sixth. Offensively for the Pioneers, Smith had three hits, and sophomore catcher Anthony Corona had a pair of hits. The Pioneers would lose by a final of 7-2, bringing their season record to 0-8 in non-conference play. The Pioneers are scheduled to play Caldwell College on Wednesday, March 9th, at 3 p.m. and also host Dominican College on Friday, March 11th, at 3 p.m.

As much as we all might think we know each other there’s still a lot that we don’t know. We’re all always holding a little something back. There’s nothing wrong with that for obvious personal reasons. But when you’re active in this world sexually, at any age there’s now a higher degree of responsibility. For some reason or another on college campuses there’s really a lighthearted attitude towards the topic of unprotected sex. Sure everyone knows or has heard how much better it feels, and I guess that’s fine and dandy, but I also think it’s scary how shortsighted these people can be.
In 2006 a study was taken by The National Chlamydia Screening Programme, which examined new cases of Chlamydia. The tests showed that infections peeked from ages 16-19 in women and ages 20-24 in men. This is only one example of how being irresponsible can hurt you. Of the people they tested at that time, 1-10 were infected at that point. I only say these things to put things into perspective and not to scare you. Just know that you’re getting older and the risks are real; to the point that pregnancy is the least of your worries.
I graduate this coming May, and I’m in my fifth year here at Post. I have seen many come and go and I have known of many cases in which someone was being deceived and someone literally got “burned” for it. These risks simply aren’t to be taken lightly. You’re at a time in your life when you really should be working on school and still having enjoying yourself socially. However, you need not be bogged down with the heavy thoughts associated with having unprotected sex.
“Unprotected meaningless sex will undoubtedly lead to a meaningful disease,” is how senior David Alexander felt on the issue. Senior Tristan Trowers concurred in saying, “Although unprotected sex is a great feeling, there is no better feeling than knowing you don’t have anything.” You have to understand that you have a much higher chance of catching something on campus than you do living at home, as being on campus there is a vastly smaller community. When you are home you technically have a much larger population open to you rather than being in a close community in which things can be passed around a lot faster.
“I don’t think it should be done because you can’t trust that anyone on campus is only having sex with you. If you made a “family tree” of people that had sex with each other on this campus you’d see that everyone is connected!” said senior Shanel Smith. I’d have to concur, I tend to think along the lines of how responsible someone handles themselves  sexually, but like I have said before everyone doesn’t always tell you everything, that’s where your decision making comes in. Sophomore Chantelle Mclean said that unprotected sex was seen as “forbidden fruit” and many people know it isn’t the best decision but do it regardless. She went on to say that if people knew of more cases of STD’s or STI’s on campus, maybe people wouldn’t be so quick to go in “raw.”
I’m not looking to be anyone’s father in any of this, but I’d hate for any of your lives to be compromised by things you can simply avoid. “Unprotected sex on a college campus or anywhere for that matter is a very large risk to take just for the sake of something that feels better. When you weigh the risks and possible consequences it’s just not a very smart decision to make,” said junior Curtis Dabel. I’m the last person in the world to tell you not to have sex, we’re sexual people and that’s a part of life, but can you really feel sorry for the person who didn’t wear the seatbelt in the front seat? Do your homework early on this issue and prevent the stress. You all are in college and aside from the headache of school you need to be having new, fun and SAFE experiences. You deserve that much.

Dorming and Commuting Benefits
Jewell B. Mason
Not feeling the “college life” because you don’t dorm?  Notice all the gorgeous flyers about interesting programs that seem too late to stay out for?  It must be tough to gain a lot of Post Pride when you arrive and depart from campus right after classes.  This sort of schedule is the epitome of what my high school days were like.  College is about inside the classroom as well as outside.   Besides the new highly controversial common hour starting at half past noon, clubs and organizations hold the majority of their programs during the evening.  If my last class ends in the afternoon, I wouldn’t aimlessly walk around campus until eight o’clock at night; nor would I expect anyone else too.  Luckily between classes and after swiping my I.D. card twice a day at the Winnick, I’m able to go to my room and kick back.  But if I didn’t dorm; where would I go?  Hillwood has a computer lab, a lounge, and the second floor filled with couches for commuters to rest, eat, and study.  But what if that’s just not enough?  Walk around the parking lots behind Hillwood during common hour.  You’ll see plenty of commuters either pulling out to go eat lunch at Wendy’s and Red Mango or resting in their car with the seat all the way reclined and the radio on full blast.  Either of these options does not promote campus unity or a sense of Post pride.
Yes, there is a clear understanding dorming will create an even deeper hole in your pockets, roughly twelve thousand dollars, but there are benefits to it.  Stating the positive aspects and drawbacks to the dorm life here at C.W. Post would be ideal.  Moreover, this information could easily be found throughout the brochures lying around the admissions office.  I cannot relate as closely as I’d like to commuters because during my two years at Post, I’ve always dormed, and I’ve been a proud resident of Nassau Hall.  I could explain why I believe dorming over commuting is a better choice if you have the option to do so, but why not ask a commuter turned resident who can really relate?
Freshman Jazsmine McDonald, a member of Post Concert Dance Company, currently is a resident here on campus this spring semester.  She was a commuter for just one semester, fall of 2010, and would choose dorming all over again next fall.  “It’s the best of both worlds…worth it in my opinion,” Jazsmine claims.  Jazsmine is originally from out of state but commuted by car last fall from East New York, Brooklyn.  She added “it’s easier to dorm because you do not waste time stuck in traffic, waking up extra early just to commute so you sleep less”. As a dance major having more time to rest was a key element in her decision to dorm.   I can’t see myself waking up any earlier for my 9:30, so she had me at “you have to wake up earlier”.  Dorming doesn’t mean you have to stay on campus at all times either.  One of the negative aspects of dorming Jazsmine pointed out is not seeing family and friends as much as you like if you weren’t staying on campus.  When I asked if she felt more a part of the C.W. Post community now that she is a resident, Jazsmine said yes without any hesitation.  “Dorming allows you to become more involved with student life here on campus, it also helps with the whole college experience”, she hinted, “it’s just something you can get used to”.  Jazsmine feels for all the commuters possibly looking to become a resident just like she did.  She says, “becoming a resident helps with one’s independence.  You’re going to be on your own anyways; it’s a precursor to your future”.
A healthy campus community is a key factor in keeping the college alive and exciting.  How can we have a thriving community when less and less students leave right after classes are finished?  Dorming is not the most important aspect of college life but it definitely helps gain the most out of it.  If commuters have any interest at all in dorming they should contact Residence Life located in the back of Post Hall.  Whether you’re interested in the suite life on campus or a strict quiet housing such as Suffolk Hall, each dorm is different in its own right; just ask the residents.  Commuters, if getting more involved on campus is your goal but lack of time is an obstacle, dorming on campus would be a benefit.

Juniors and Seniors of C.W. Post are encouraged to sign up for C.W. Post’s job bank and career information system called JobNet. JobNet uses keyword searches on internships, work-study, on-campus budget, part-time and full-time jobs.  Resumes are posted on the website, so when contacting the employer, they will be able to see your resume posted. The system is very efficient, but how many students really use it to their advantages?
According to Jason Cascone, the director of career development, there were approximately 17,000 logins to JobNet during 2010. 3,000 users of the approximate 7,500 users registered on JobNet made these logins. The users are a mix of students and alumni of C.W. Post. The site currently has 185 full-time jobs posted and 175 cooperative education/internship positions. Alice Baumer, the associate director of cooperative education says, “my biggest frustration is that we have more co-op jobs available than students who choose to take advantage of the cooperative education program.”
Cascone says, “There is evidence from the alumni office that shows that alumni employers use JobNet to source their candidates. But JobNet is not all about finding employers; it also has a resource library for students, in which they can find examples of excellent resume writing, cover letter writing, interviewing tips, help for applying to graduate school, and work study information. Academic and career planning is available to assist students with any questions on their resumes and interview preparation.”
Cascone says , “most users do not know that JobNet has a Job Agent function that can allow a seeker to do a search and set up a Job Agent to e-mail them when jobs meeting the same criteria are activated in JobNet.” With that, students can search for what jobs or internships they desire, and the Job Agent function will help the students find the best positions available for them.
Freshman journalism major Natalie Villanueva used JobNet to find a job on campus. “I used JobNet for a campus job and was able to get a job in the media arts department, perfect for my major.” Junior Anne Winberry says, “I don’t need to use JobNet. I already have a job, so I really don’t feel the need to use JobNet.” Personally, I have been able to use JobNet to just help me become aware of what jobs are out there for me.
To register for C.W. Post’s JobNet, go to pep.liu.edu/liu/student, click to register, then fill out some specific information and then you’re in the system. It’s free to all C.W. Post students. Once in, you can log in at any point to set up interviews with various employers, talk to the career advisors at C.W. Post for any further information, and you will receive announcements about various job fairs around the area. The next career event will take place at C.W. Post on April 13. The site is beneficial to those who want an internship and/or a job, and you won’t have to put in  half of the effort to find the employers and events. All you’ll have to do is log on to the website, and it’s all there for you.

Attending every home game during basketball and football season, the C.W. Post cheerleaders show their Post pride. They are responsible for hyping the crowd up before big games such as homecoming or the ECC basketball playoff games. The beginning of the 2010-2011 season started off looking great for these girls. Starting with 26 members on the team and attending Universal Cheerleaders Association camp in southern Connecticut, the goal of competition never felt closer. The hopeful team performed at pep rally, and amazed Post fans with their skillfully choreographed routine. “The complements seemed never ending, and it felt good knowing all our hard work showed through our routine,” said captain Tatiana Lampa.
The season started at what seemed like an all time high for the Post cheerleaders. Throughout the season the team raised money for the pediatric brain cancer walk, along with participating in the annual Breast Cancer Walk and Polar-Bear Plunge. Head coach Melissa Torres worked with the team to “stick” advanced stunts, and progress in tumbling. Assistant coach Jacqueline Cruz attended the home games to support the team.
With four competitions on the team’s upcoming schedule, they had their goals and assets straight, after years of preparation, they were finally in sight of competing. What seemed like the peak of the season slowly turned into a downfall when team members started losing sight of the team’s goal. Due to loss of dedication, girls began to quit the team. It was a bumpy road for the rest of the season, losing teammate after teammate. By February there were only 12 members left. Lampa and fellow captain Brittany Greene led the remaining team through the rough time with a positive attitude.
Although the season is coming to an end and the sight of competition is out of the picture, next year the team is planning on continuing to pursue their goals. They look forward to handpicking teammates that are dedicated, high-spirited, and have positive attitudes. The Post Cheerleading team was hoping for a “rags-to-riches” story to tell everyone about, while this year they may have fallen short, they will never lose sight of their goals.

When you get home from a long day of classes, does it usually result in the question, “What did you learn today?” The typical response students would give is “nothing.” While your family thought you did learn something and probably assumed you just didn’t feel like talking about it, little do they know, you may be telling the truth.
Student performance and success in and outside of the classrooms depends on what they put in…right? People have been channeling a national anxiety for students to earn a degree, and hopefully take their next steps in the “big” world by obtaining a well-paid job, or carrying on with their studies in an attempt to gain more knowledge through graduate school. Let’s face it; finding jobs now-a days and the pressure it puts on students has become overbearing. Well, what would happened if you knew it was the professor’s teaching habits that were causing students to do poorly in the classroom and not reach their full potential.
Over the years, tenure has become a very controversial issue. New Jersey passed the first tenure laws in 1909, specifically to protect teachers from losing their jobs over subjects such as race, sex and political views. However, tenure seems to pose two sides and both have reasons to protect academic freedom. A positive aspect of tenure is the right of an academic professor to not have his or her position terminated without just cause. The majority of universities and colleges in the United States have adopted the tenure systems, which have associate senior job titles, such as Professor or an Associate Professor. Although tenure was originated to guarantee academic freedom by protecting professors from being fired, its primary purpose is to allow ideas and opinions to be freely expressed to students in the classroom, as well as to the public. Professors have independence to investigate problems they have a burning passion for.
Of course, there are always two sides to everything. Tenure is becoming more of an underlying problem that has drawn national attention. Many governors are attempting to remove ineffective teachers and want to eliminate tenure for numerous reasons. One reason given is that the performance of students should be evaluated and the end result should completely reflect off of the professors’ responsibilities to provide a fully rich education. Chances of passing anti-tenure bills have increased, due to the crushing state budget deficits. With that said, President Barack Obama administration’s “Race to the Top” grant contest last year had eleven states pass laws, which would link student success to teacher evaluations. Obama is taking drastic measures on this topic as he “measured and rewarded effective teaching” in his State of the Union address.
The tenure procedure has been always challenging. For example, Governor Brian Sandobal of Nevada said, “It’s practically impossible to remove an underperforming teacher under the system we have now.” Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also working competitively to “end last in, first out protection for teachers.”
Why are people taking drastic measures to eliminate tenure? Many agree if professors are not doing a good job and causing their students to suffer intellectually, they should not be protected. Professors who do have it want to see that they are there for the right reasons and taking their duties seriously and being professional.
Professors with tenure may become lethargic and unproductive. This is seen as a risk to many universities and colleges because professors may prove to be unworthy just because the thought of lifetime employment rests quietly in the back of their minds. Tenure has become a very difficult process that everyone wants. However, it must be done with careful consideration and an intensive review of the candidates’ records to decide if they qualify.
Professor Barbara Fowles, who has been a full time professor for over 20 years, is Chair of the Media Arts Department, and has had tenure for quite awhile now. Fowles said, “I don’t think my views are extreme or odd enough that would cause an issue. Therefore, I don’t think about it.” Fowles explained that untenured teachers might give off a different response, but she sees tenure as an obligation to keep her teaching up to a high level because it is a matter of trust for the university to award someone. Fowles has taught a wide variety of classes in the Media Arts Department, but focuses her teaching on a Media Ethics class, as well as an Honors course in Media. Fowles added, sadly, tenured professors, not by the majority by any means, can become lazy about keeping up with their field of study, spending time with students, and preparing their classes carefully. I feel quite strongly that this is unethical and it is definitely the dark side of tenure.” Fowles understands getting tenure is not an easy process. As she says, “One has to jump through quite a number of hoops to get there.”
Marissa Santomaso, junior public relations major, has experienced bad luck in the classroom with a tenure professor. Santomaso said, “In the past, I had to drop one of my classes that was mandatory to be taken as a requirement in my major because the professor was not teaching the material in an effective way so students could understand what was going on. It wasn’t fair to me.”
Tenure will remain a complicated and sensitive subject. However, we need to look closely at this issue and decide, “Is it fair for students to be enrolled in a class with a professor who takes it less seriously than they do?” Most people can readily agree no is the answer. It should be taken into consideration that students are a paying great deal of money for their tuition and are hungry for an enjoyable, satisfying, and thorough education in return.

I bet everyone was pumped last week when iHop announced its Free Pancake Day on March 1st, but how about the free pancakes at C.W. Post that same night? What a coincidence?! At 9 pm, Alpha Xi Delta Sorority held their very own “Xi Hop” charity event to benefit Autism Speaks. “We didn’t even realize it was free pancake day, so our gimmick should be that people shouldn’t drive all the way to Ihop, Just walk to Hillwood!” said Gina Fernandez, a sophomore Public Relations major and Vice President of Programs for Alpha Xi Delta.
In 2009, the sisters of Alpha Xi Delta adopted Autism Speaks as their National Philanthropy. Autism Speaks is an organization that researches cures and treatments for Autism, as well as raise public awareness of Autism, and its effects on those who have it, their families, and on society. The event was advertised in Newsday as well as in an article on the Autism Speaks website. “Xi Hop was an awesome event because it was an opportunity to get more of the campus involved with Greek Life while raising money for a great cause,” said Alexa Lacagnina, a member of Alpha Xi Delta Sorority.
Held in the East-West Café of Hillwood, the room was all decorated in balloons. About 100 people, including the Provost, came to attend a night of free pancakes and juice donated from Aramark. Pancakes weren’t the only thing on the menu that night; there were around 25 different raffles giving away prizes from Barnes and Nobles gift cards, Xbox games, lotions, hair care products, shower items, to Ace Hardware gift cards. All prizes were donated, and over $1,000 was raised. All proceeds will go to Autism Speaks. “I think the turnout was great. We were thrilled to have so much donated, and we thank everyone who came to support us,” said Michelle Achilli, a junior health care administration major, also Vice President of Chapter Life.

During common hour on Tuesday, March 1st, in the Hillwood Study Lounge, the Poetry Center of C.W. Post hosted a reading by Professor Emeritus Dan Levin. A crowd of approximately 50 students, professors, and members of the C.W. Post community were in attendance. Some sat at the circular tables and others stood leaning against the wall in an effort to hear the voice of a man whose life experiences include serving in the U.S. Marine Corps in World War II, working as a State Department reporter at the United Nations, and teaching creative writing and world literature at our very own Long Island University.
Alternately, Dr. Levin, Dr. Joan Digby from the honors department, and Dr. Richard Walsh read from Dr. Levin’s upcoming collection of poetry, “Waiting for B Train and Other Poems.” The poems ranged in theme, encompassing Dr. Levin’s reflections on his immigration from Russia to Brooklyn during the Great Depression, his time spent as a sergeant-combat correspondent in Iwo Jima, and his lyrical impressions of the sublime, which he resurrected among the chaos of World War II’s brutality and barbarity. Dr. Levin contextualized most of the poems for his audience, reminiscing about the sounds of Buskwick and the smell of the sea from the ledge of a command ship.
Towards the end of the reading, students Amanda-Beth Campbell and Michelle Mainente lent their voices to Dr. Levin’s words, reading poems that addressed both the anonymity of combat in the 1940s and the surge of hope that sprung from the election of President Barrack Obama in 2008. Blessed with the opportunity to listen to such a saga, those in attendance left with a newfound appreciation for the enduring spirit of creativity, which pervades every hostile global climate, from Iwo Jima to Benghazi.

This past Wednesday, March 2nd, C.W. Post’s 2nd annual, “Post Idol” kicked off in Hillwood’s Cinema, offering students a showcase of this year’s contestants.
Victoria Jacques, a senior marketing major and music chair of ACP, is co-coordinating the event and was excited for the competition. “This year we have 5 rounds.  Last year we only had three,” Jacques said of Post Idol, “This year what we’re doing differently is we have a theme for each week. So next week is Top 40, and then we have a rock an roll, and jazz theme.”
Sean Jackson, a junior criminal justice major, member of the Sigma Delta Phi Epsilon Fraternity Inc and co-coordinator, thought that the opportunity for fans to see the performers in a showcase was a good way to start things off. “The fact that the crowd got to see who’s doing it will make them excited to come back for next week,” explained Jackson.
This year’s performers subscribe to a wide variety of genres and song choices.  This week’s acapella showcase ranged from Beyonce all the way to White Snake. With so many different directions being expressed, judging might become pretty difficult.
“I thought everyone was amazing,” said Nadia Hernandez, an administrative assistant in the International Student Services office, and judge of this week’s portion of the competition. Hernandez also added that she believes the competition is going to be a difficult one due to all the talented voices participating.
The next installment of the competition will be Wednesday March 9, at 9PM in the Hillwood Cinema.

Dr. Robert Manheimer is retiring after being Dean of the Department of Education for 11 years.
Dean Robert Manheimer has been an educator for most of his life.  He has taught elementary school, high school, and college.  Dr. Manheimer has held positions of high school principle, assistant principle, assistant superintendent, superintendent, and now Dean of Education.
“I was interested in education since I was seven years old,” says Dean Manheimer.  He was a science teacher at a high school in Brooklyn and taught biology and chemistry. “I loved it!”
At Post, Dr. Manheimer occupied other positions before becoming Dean.  He was a professor in the Department of Leadership and Administration for four years and also an adjunct professor in the Department of Education.
As Dean of the Department of Education, he carries certain responsibilities. Dean Manheimer is responsible for the functioning of the school of education. He supervises the personnel, and supervises the works of the professors.  He also oversees a total of seven department including: Curriculum and Instruction, Literacy and Special Education, Counseling and Mental Health, Physical Education and Dance, Communication Speech and Hearing Aid, Computer Technology, and Leadership and Administration.
Dean Robert Manheimer enjoys seeing students succeed and continuing in their field; he describes it as being the “greatest satisfaction.”  He says, “I recommend any student who wants to become a teacher, to continue because it’s a wonderful, lifetime career.”
Dean Manheimer says that he enjoys any aspect of learning and enjoys creating any opportunities for students. He said with enthusiasm, “I enjoy anything of education!”  When asked what he will take with him when he finishes this year as dean, he replied: “My thoughts about how wonderful people are at C.W. Post and how serious minded they are about education.”
He concludes with a surprise of continuing what he likes best…teaching. “I won’t retire!  I might go back to being a faculty member and continue at C.W. Post Campus,” he mentions.

There are residents on the C.W. Post campus who don’t take classes or work out at the Pratt Recreation Center. There are many sightings of cats on campus. They have been taking up residence all over campus, and both students and professors have been helping to shelter these animals.
According to Rita Langdon, the director of public relations, the administration is working closely with the local animal shelter to have the cats spayed and neutered. “They make an effort to place the animals in loving homes,” Langdon said. Some students are not so enthused. “I don’t really mind it, but it is kind of weird,” said Jacqueline Klingler, a junior special education major. “I don’t really understand why there are [cats] living on campus.”
Dr. Joan Digby, the director of the honors program, also started the C.W. Post Campus Cat Guardians. This program helps to keep the cats living on campus healthy and fed. A team of 15 people feeds and cares for the cats, all of which have names. “Post is unique in having a cat community that is protected by administration, faculty, students and public safety,” said Dr. Digby. “Our community has remained stable for more than 10 years because we observe the letter and spirit of the law.”
This campus group works closely with the Animal Lovers League of Glen Cove as cats find their way onto campus. They wander in from towns all around Long Island and Cat Guardians is there to take them in. All the “guardians” know where the cats migrate to and live on campus, and Buildings and Grounds provides the cats with their “homes” or shelters on campus.
Recently, an orange cat, by the name of “Butterscotch,” found its way onto campus after one of the many blizzards and was adopted by two honors alumni.
The Pioneer wonders do these cats pose a health risk or are they a unique part of our community? Let us know what you think!
For more information about Cat Guardians, please contact Dr. Joan Digby at (516) 299-2840.

According to the CW Post website, “The common hour is held Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 12:30 to 1:50 pm during the Fall and Spring semesters. No classes are scheduled during these times. Common hour provides an opportunity for students to partake in extracurricular activities, meet with their academic and career counselor, conduct university business, meet with professors, hold club meetings and attend campus events. Common hour allows the entire campus community to connect more conveniently on a social and academic level outside the classroom.” Most can agree there is always something going on during common hour. Maybe it’s a career or job fair, club meetings, or just having coffee with a friend who you only see once a week.  Then there’s the commuters, some of us work and have other priorities that keep us away from school. So does the common hour cut into our time that much?
Kia Sidoroua, junior art history major, says that for her the common hour is “too long, but I usually have lunch and prepare for my next classes. It’s fine with me, I usually never get bored.” Sheree Elder, senior arts management major says, “I actually liked common hour this semester. At first I didn’t see the point of it and it messed up my class schedule, but now it’s not so bad. I’ve gotten used to not having classes during common hour.”
Some don’t feel the same senior Jeff Weisbein formed a Facebook page protesting the common hour. On the page it says, “ If you don’t know what common hour is it’s essentially a break in the day for everyone. That means there will be no classes held during that time, so if you are a commuter, it really sucks. Not only are you stuck at Post with no where to go, but to make matters worse there really isn’t enough time to go out and get something to eat. If you have been at Post for at least a semester I’m sure you are aware how packed Hillwood is at that time already. Now imagine it with everyone out of class. Horrible, I know.”
Depending on your opinion of the common hour it doesn’t seem to matter, the common hour is here to stay for now. There are a few glitches to fix at the moment, but that will have to wait for the fall. For any student at CW Post, the common hour is something to get used to.  Maybe it will benefit you or it will just waste you time, but for now we will have to make the common hour for ourselves.

I really enjoyed reading the news article “Post’s New Hangout,” because it was nice to learn more about the new and improved TV room.  Being a commuter student I enjoyed spending time in the Commuter’s Lounge with my friends before class started, and was disappointed when it became a lounge geared for gaming.  Not having the Commuter’s Lounge made it hard to hold CSA meetings and have a place that was just for commuters to “hang out” since we don’t have dorm rooms to go back too. Being a member of the Commuter Student Association, I hope that more CSA meetings will be held in the new TV room, and that lives up to the standards that the old Commuter Lounge had in the past.
Kristin Leverone- senior
 
After reading this past week’s paper, my favorite article had to be the news piece, “What’s a Grab N Go?”  Being a commuter student and not having the option of eating at the Winnick, I really appreciate it that Hillwood has certain foods such as chicken fingers, burgers, chicken sandwiches and fries already made and stored in labeled containers. It is definitely a great improvement since last semester because students who want food from the grill don’t have to wait on a huge line. I think Post is going a good job trying to improve some of the negatives associated with Common Hour, and making getting lunch quick and easy is a step in the right direction.
 
Matt Murray- sophomore
 
 
My favorite article from this past week’s edition had to definitely be the features piece “Recycling on Campus.”  I agree that the campus is making more of a conscience effort to recycle and prevent unnecessary garbage, but I feel that other things should be done.  More recyclable bins should absolutely be placed around campus to give students more of an opportunity to recycle, but other things could include having more contests which focus on recycling. I remember last semester when there was a fun competition between clubs to collect the most wrappers, and the winner won prize. Little things like adding more contests, which are geared towards getting dorm students and clubs involved can help make recycling more fun.

It’s that time of the year again. Midterms are here, and students are beginning to experience exam stress. Have no fear, we will provide you with helpful ways to not only prepare for exams, but also to recognize if stress is affecting you and how to cope with it using stress management.
First step to achieving a good grade is preparing yourself for the big exam. It is important that you keep your notes organized throughout the semester to make your study time easier and more productive. On average students will have three or more tests during midterm week. Try to not procrastinate and put off studying for the night before. Make a balanced “time-table” in which you can include the days and times your available to study for each test. Assign break periods in between your studying to exercise and eat. Breaks have actually been proven to not only make your studying more efficient but they allow the brain to take in more information. Don’t miss your everyday meals or lose sleep due to studying. Your brain functions better on a full stomach and a good nights rest.
Stress has a huge effect on how your body works. Stress weakens the blood cells which help fight off infections. So pulling an “all-nighter” the night before an exam adds stress to your body heightening your risk of colds and illness. Drinking caffeine to keep yourself energized or awake while studying may backfire when you “crash” and feel tired during the exam. So although it may seem like a good idea to grab a Starbucks Double Shot of Espresso, try to avoid it at all costs.
When sophomore Aileen Gillick was asked how she prepares for an upcoming exam she stated “I usually like to be alone when I study. I try to go to the library where I can focus better. I also find flash cards helpful to study from.”
Students are easily overwhelmed with the overload of work and exams during midterms week. Stress puts a damper on students, so how do you know if stress is affecting you? The signs are very clear. Common symptoms of stress include headaches and disrupted sleep patterns. Less obvious symptoms include feeling tired at all hours of the day and even signs of a bad temper.
The good thing to know is no matter how stressed out you feel, you are not the only one experiencing it. Most students are finding it just as difficult to concentrate and most of all relax. There are certain ways to cope with stress and manage it in the proper way. A process called “The Relaxation Routine,” from by www.mind.org.uk may be the answer to stress relief during midterm week. Using three easy to follow steps, the relaxation routine soothes your stress away. First close your eyes and breathe slow and deep. Then locate areas of tension in your body and try to focus on each area, one by one relaxing those muscles. To help, think of your tension areas becoming weightless and almost disappearing. After twenty minutes take deep breaths and stretch.
Soon enough, Midterm week will pass and stress levels will be lightened on students. Good luck to all C.W. Post students taking exams this week. Remember to cope and manage stress using the methods and routine provided. For more information, see www.mind.org.ok.
