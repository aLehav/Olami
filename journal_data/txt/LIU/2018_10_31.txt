For the past several weeks, the ceiling on the second floor of Humanities Hall has been leaking, causing puddles to form on the floor in the hallway. Tile pieces from the ceiling have been taken down and garbage pails stand in the middle of the hall to prevent students, professors and visitors from slipping.
There are six missing ceiling tile pieces with other surrounding pieces covered in what looks like to be dried water patches. On the floor, three large garbage cans have no apparent water build up on the bottom of them.
On Thursday, Oct. 11, Alex Espinosa, a junior digital game design major, was walking in the hallway and slipped where the water had accumulated under the leak, necessitating a trip to St. Joseph Hospital in Bethpage by ambulance.
“The wet floor sign was far away from where I was walking so I thought I was okay to walk, until I fell,” Espinosa said. “I fell on my knee and it hurt so bad.”
At the hospital, Espinosa was given an x-ray and it was determined that he didn’t break anything. “They were worried about cartilage damage, so they gave me a cast that I had to wear for about four days,” he said. “I was in the hospital for about two to three hours.”
Espinosa plans to purchase new, slip resistant shoes to avoid a problem like this again. “I need to wear shoes that aren’t as easy to slip with,” he said. “I need to be more aware of my surroundings.”
Facilities services did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the leak.

Many people living in America have expressed fear due to the rise of hate groups and violence to the LGBT+ community.
Twenty years after Matthew Shepard was murdered in Laramie, Wyoming for being gay, Bishop Gene Robinson interred Shepard’s ashes at the Washington National Cathedral on Oct. 26. The Rainbow
Alliance club on campus decided to educate the student body on the atrocious murder that took place by showing the film, “The Laramie Project,” in the Hillwood Cinema on Monday, Oct. 22.

“We chose to show this film because, along with many things, October is LGBT+ history month. Our history is often over- shadowed and overlooked, and as an organization we decided to think of ways
we could use this month to educate people of the history of the community,” Nicole Ludwig, a sophomore psychology major and president of the Rainbow Alliance, said.
Shepard was a 21-year-old student studying political science at the University of Wyoming. On Oct. 6, 1998, he was robbed, beaten and tied to a fence, where he was left to die after the attack. He was pronounced dead six days later. Shepard left a bar with two men who told him they would give him a ride home. The same two men were initially going to be charged with robbery, until their actions of beating Shepard and leaving him to die were discovered to be motivated by hate. They were later convicted with kidnapping and murder.
“The Laramie Project” is “a powerful and emotional film that covers the perspectives of so many individuals after the incident, and it really gives people insight as to how people really feel about LGBT+ people,” Ludwig said.
A common saying in the documentary is “live and let live.” This phrase is thrown out by people who were interviewed in the documentary in regards to having an issue with gay people. In today’s social climate, this phrase and understanding has become more prevalent. Its okay for you to be who you are, just as long as you’re not making anyone “uncomfortable.”
“As long as you don’t hit on a straight man, you’re good in his book. The concept that all gay men want to turn straight men out and all that other stuff needs to be thrown out,” Marrantz Aubain, a senior psychology major said. “I think its repulsive when I hear people tell others they’re cool because they aren’t like the rest, especially when referring to the person’s masculinity or femininity,” he continued.
The Rainbow Alliance club strives to highlight and educate the student body about LGBT+ issues, especially during LGBT+ history month. “As discouraging as it may feel, do not let these events be the thing that makes you not come out to your friends and family or to stay silent when you wanted to speak up on these issues,” Ludwig said. “In reality, this sort of thing is not any- thing new, and while that can be interpreted in a negative way, it can also be a source of strength.”
Ludwig emphasized that everyone’s voice is important, and needs to be heard “especially during these hard times.” “Be annoying and stubborn and fight for the changes you want and need. Don’t let a bunch of fools in power make you feel less than human. And never, ever deny yourself your own right to be happy – even if it feels like everyone else is trying to,” she continued. “Always aim for your own safety and comfort. It isn’t selfish. It’s how you get through these things.”

The health information management department in the School of Health Professions and Nursing is making a big change. During the fall 2018 semester, the department is introducing the use of the data analytics program SAS (statistical analytics system). The shift will be lead by professor Rachel Cloward, the director of health information management.

SAS is a software developed for advanced analytics and data management used by many different fields, including health information. With this software, the department will be able to record and look up information that can help any health facility. Some information includes treatments for injuries or possible cures for diseases.
The software is free and has the ability to make a large impact in the field. Health information management students can also download this software and contribute to the system. Cloward is prepared to teach SAS to her students.
“We have created these giant databases of health data. There are people that are
going through the data to see if there is any- thing we can learn,” Cloward said. “Like how people were treated for certain diseases or what hospitals have the best way to treat people with heart failure is by using data analytics.”
Cloward is an assistant professor of health sciences and teaches online health
information management courses. After receiving her degree in biology, she decided against going to medical school and instead took graduate classes at LIU Brooklyn to receive her master’s degree in business administration and in science. She is also a registered health information administrator. After graduate school, Cloward spent most of her time as an information technician (IT), and combined her love of science and technology when she became the director of health information management at LIU Post.
She is working to set up online courses for students to learn SAS. The students will learn how to discern the different graphs and charts within the database and determine, among other things, how to improve treatments and outcomes with certain diseases.
The software can also show students how to improve reimbursement for a hospital. Cloward stated that “You have to code a certain way and treat patients a certain way. The more efficient you are and the better outcomes you get for your patients, the more imbursement you will get from the government,” she said. The government reimburses more than 50 percent of healthcare in the United States, according to Cloward.
Cloward is excited for the change into SAS. She believes that this database will help create many jobs not only in the health information management field, but also in the field of IT.
“This will not only affect this community, but instead, affect the nation,” Cloward said.

Dr. Efleda Tolentino, the director of the early childhood education program in the College of Education, Information and Technology since 2008, aims to teach and inspire the next generation of teachers.
“I believe that children are our future,” Tolentino said. “It’s important, therefore, to provide them with the knowledge, as well as the skills that they need in order to thrive in the world that we prepare for them.”
Tolentino aims to create a conversation between teachers and students that fosters education and acceptance. “In order for children to learn meaningfully, they need to engage in exploratory dialogue with each other,” she said. “This entails the teacher creating an environment [in] which students feel free to share their thinking and explore topics, as well as strands of inquiry within that environment.”
Early childhood education incorporates children from kindergarten to second grade. By teaching children during their formative years, Tolentino believes teachers are able to provide them with the knowledge and skills they will need later in their lives.
In 2012, Tolentino started a pen pal program that gives her students the opportunity to write to public school teachers. They use Jonathan Kozol’s book, “Letters to a Young Teacher” as a basis to start a dialogue about teaching in public schools. The program has been successful in helping students, as well as teachers; establish a connection over the shared interest of education.
“In the span of ten weeks my students and their pen pals get to know each other on a personal level, as well as on a professional level,” Tolentino said. “So what happens is that students become more aware of the persona behind the teacher, they realize that each teacher is their own person, and that every teacher has their own philosophy, their own values, their own beliefs.”
The pen pal program has helped students feel a sense of community. They can empathize with people who share their goals. It also helps teachers who are already in the field gain a new perspective, which can positively impact their students.
Tolentino believes that professors not only have a responsibility to teach students, but to have them engage with the community. “Service is part of a higher institutional mission and is inextricably linked with our teaching and scholarship,” she said. “When we work in partnership with local schools and communities, we emerge with awareness that can lead to curricular reform and reshaping the educational agenda.”
Tolentino believes faculty members are the link between university students and their community. “Our mission as educators is to seek out opportunities within the community that will prepare students to become responsive teachers and community members.”

In the middle of the fall 2018 semester, the theatre program is in full swing. For senior theatre major Claire Main, this means some of her last steps on the PTC stage.
The Washington native, who is approaching the end of her time at Post, reflected on how PTC has shaped her career. Although she had not heard of LIU Post, her mother’s research led to the school instantly becoming Main’s top college choice.
“Senior year of high school we came to New York, and we toured five different colleges, and Post was immediately my top choice,” Main said. “I got to sit in on a freshman acting class and just the way the professor, Dave Hugo, talked to his students and how his students talked back about their work . . . I [thought] I can really see myself here.”
Main could not wait to “dive in” to her acting career at Post, as even in the “taster session” she realized how little she knew. “When I came here I really didn’t know much about the training they offered,” she said. The strength of the department was the only thing keeping her at the school. “If it wasn’t for this program, I probably would’ve left the school,” she said. The faculty and students in her program have kept her at Post.
Main had great success in the department. She has been cast in shows each semester since the fall of her sophomore year (the first year she was eligible to be cast). She just finished a role in “Ubu Roi.”
The first show Main was cast in was “The Killer,” by Eugene Ionesco. “I was an ensemble member and got to play three different characters; an old man and two different old women,” Main said. “So that was incredible because I got to watch the seniors take on these really big roles, but I also got be a part of the world that supports them.”
In fall 2017, Main was cast as Dromio in Shakespeare’s “A Comedy of Errors.” “I have never done Shakespeare before,” she said. “[The director] was a really great teacher who got her Ph.D in Shakespeare, so she helped a lot with the language,” Main said. “I can totally see myself taking on Shakespeare in my future.”
Main’s favorite production as a member of PTC was “Glengarry Glen Ross,” a play by David Mamet. “All the characters are male, but we did an all female production,” Main said. She played Shelley Levene. “That was one of my biggest roles I’ve ever played here. The language in the play was so difficult but it was so high energy and high stakes, and it was so fun to be among that group of women.”
Main’s ambition this semester to is to inspire those around her as the seniors did when she was a sophomore. “I remember as a sophomore looking up to the seniors like, ‘wow, how great these people are,’ and I wanted to be a really similar person to this year’s sophomores in the cast,” she said.
The form of theatre Main is most invested in is the art of Suzuki and abstract physical theatre. “It was just physical approach to acting which I tapped into and learned so much about,” Main said, describing how she uses her body to jump into a character and tell a story. “Not just a psychological approach to acting but a physical one,” she explained. “I am a very physically inclined person, so being able find greater specificity in my body and utilize that to my advantage was really incredible.”
Main is thankful to the professors and PTC family. “I know it’s as cheesy as it sounds; they really are like family, but that’s what it is and that’s what I’ve found,” she said.
What’s the next step for Main? She sees herself staying in New York momentarily, but also exploring her options nationally. “If I were to move home to Seattle now, I would probably move in with my parents and get stuck a little,” Main shared. “So I want to push myself and continue being out here (New York) and see what I can do.”
Main also wants to explore film, and being from the west coast, there are many opportunities. “It’s an open map at this point; I’m going to see where things take me. But I am so excited to go after all these opportunities.

The Jazz Ensemble and the Women’s Choir are packing their instruments and musicality for a performance tour this upcoming summer. From July 22 to July 30, approximately 35 students will visit six different cities in northern Spain and southern France where they will perform and experience different cultures. They are scheduled to perform at the San Sebastian Jazz Festival and the Fêtes de Bayonne Festival.
Every summer, a group of students from the music department go on a performance tour. The purpose of the trip is for students and faculty members to go to a different country with unfamiliar culture and experience it while performing and sharing their own musical culture.
Junior Brandon Allen, a music education major and member of the jazz ensemble, will join the trip. He described how the trip gives them a great opportunity to combine music with education of new cultures. “In every different country, you have a different kind of music and culture, so for us to learn about the culture while playing music is a great experience for everyone,” Allen said.
The San Sebastian Jazz Festival in San Sebastian, Spain had approximately 150,000 attendees in the last few years. Junior Allie Michaelis, jazz ensemble member and music education major, explained the students’ excitement for being part of something of this scale. They want to give a good impression of themselves, the school and American jazz culture.
“To showcase our talent from the states and to represent our school and this department is something that is very exciting,” Michaelis said. “We want to be the best we can to show what we are here for and what we do back home.”
The instrumental groups will perform standard big band tunes and some original compositions made by students. The Long Island Sound Vocal Jazz Ensemble will perform arrangements from “Great American Songbook” and the women’s choir will perform jazz standards specifically arranged for female voices.
Lisa Meyer, the music department’s production and recruitment coordinator, stated how valuable the tour is for the students’ future careers. Many of the students are music education majors and if they would like to take their future students on a similar trip they know what do and what places they should try to visit. “That’s a part of the whole experience, to get this experience so they can use it later in their teaching careers,” she said.
The opportunity to participate in the tour is irreplaceable, Meyer said. “To travel with your friends and fellow musicians, to perform together and to do all the sightseeing – it’s a very special and unique experience that they never will have again,” she said.
Junior vocalist Christina Desimone, a music education major, is grateful for the chance to travel and perform as a college student. “It’s not an experience that you think you will have before going to college and then all of a sudden you are being giving these opportunities that the department has to offer,” Desimone said.
The department joined with World Projects Help to plan the trip. The students pay for the trip’s expenses, but they fundraise and collect donations to lower the costs for each student. Some of the proceeds of their concerts throughout the year are also used to finance the trip.
Aside from the experience the students will earn from the trip, Michaelis thinks the opportunity to travel with music and bring it to others is beautiful. Music is where many of them feel that they belong. “Music is our home, it’s who we are,” she said.
The jazz ensemble and the women’s choir will perform some of the pieces they bring to Europe at other concerts throughout the year. Their next concert is on Nov. 17 at 8 p.m. in the Krasnoff Theater.

 To be a scarecrow, I am wearing my black jeans, black knee high boots, and a flannel shirt. I braided my hair and wore a tan-colored hat. To accessorize, I tied a piece of straw around my neck. I completed the look with scarecrow makeup, accentuating my blush and using eyeliner to draw a scarecrow mouth and nose.
 
This mouse costume combines a few staple closet pieces. Wearing my black top, I paired it with black jeans, knee high black boots, and a fun belt. To make ears, I put my hair into two space buns on top of my head. To complete the look, I drew a nose and whiskers onto my face with eyeliner.
 
 
 
 
For a school girl costume, all you need is a black top, a plaid skirt, knee socks, and loafers or any other close-toed shoe. To accessorize, I added a men’s tie, fake glasses, and a small black backpack. I completed the look with a high ponytail.

“To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist—that is all.”
– Oscar Wilde, The Soul of Man Under Socialism
It has been ingrained in us that we must grow up, get a real job, get married and have a family – all the while continuing to work. This leads us to fall into the same cycle of doing what we are told, rather than what we believe is good for us. Following such a restricted path of growth prevents you from living at all. One merely becomes a robot slugging through her repetitive day to day life. Once she has the realization of what she missed out on by settling into this dull routine, it is often too late.

Wilde believed that his life was a means of self- expression, which I tend to believe is true for everyone. The way one chooses to live, by the paths he takes, the rules he follows and the thoughts he considers all reflect on who he is as a person. Having the courage to decline the pressures of what society assumes is the correct path of living is admirable.
Existing in this world will bring you much more pleasure by choosing the things that make you happy. Perhaps you’ll even begin to live. Set goals and dreams for yourself and stop at nothing to achieve them. Regardless of whether you make it to that end point, you still worked hard towards something that you wanted rather than having worked aimlessly just to simply exist.

“The Poe Estate” by Polly Shulman is the third book in her trilogy about the New York Circulating Material Repository, a library that has collections of fictional artifacts from classic literature. The previous two books in the trilogy, entitled “The Grimm Legacy” and “The Wells Bequest”, focused on fairy tales and science fiction respectively. While “The Poe Estate” focuses on items from classic gothic stories.

“The Poe Estate” tells the story of Sukie O’Dare, whose older sister, Kitty, has recently passed away from a family disease. Kitty’s ghost has haunted Sukie for some time, and since moving into her elderly cousin Hepzibah Throne’s rundown mansion, Sukie has encountered other, much older, ghosts.
While helping her parents at a flea market, Sukie is introduced to Elizabeth Rew and Andre Merritt, employees from the New York Circulating Material Repository. Sukie is quickly introduced to the Repository, with fictional artifacts such as witches’ brooms, a library of books from within stories, and even houses straight from gothic literature. Along the way, Sukie must solve a mystery involving her ancestors and hidden treasure, and has to find the courage to let Kitty’s ghost go.
Although “The Poe Estate” is based on the gothic genre, its’ plot occasionally seems more based off of mysteries. And because it is the third book in a trilogy, there are a few references to the previous two books that may go over new reader’s heads.
“The Poe Estate” is a great book for fans of classic gothic literature to read. There are plenty of references to authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft to look out for, and a solid plot that makes this book great on its’ own.

In the video game “Smite,” we are introduced to a truly terrifying monster, far worse than any nightmare, named Scylla. Few people believe that true evil exists; scholars believe that evil is nothing more than an opposing moral view point. They are wrong; evil does exist, and she waits just beneath the ocean waves. They call her Scylla, “Horror of the Deep,” for no ship that dares to sail through her waters goes unscathed and those poor few who cling to life tell tales of enormous tentacles tipped with slobbering hound heads, tearing ships to pieces with pitiless precision.

It is her laughter, they say, that is most horrible; childlike, reveling in blood soaked murder, as men are dragged into the abyss. Poets have tried to romanticize her and to provide some humanity to her monstrosity. They write that she was once a beautiful naiad (water nymph) that was cursed by a jealous priestess and transformed.
They are wrong, however, for she was born this way, born from the spilled blood of god, filled with jealousy and hate that fell into the sea. Yet, she did not remain in the sea; evil has come ashore, dragged by dog headed tentacles. Now Scylla wanders the streets, plucking us from our homes, filling the night with terrifying laughter. Scylla has come, and not even the gods can help us.
In “Smite,” Scylla is depicted as a little girl with dog headed tentacles coming from beneath her. In her mythology, however, she is depicted as either an older and beautiful woman with her dog headed tentacles coming from her back or as a massive sea living hydra. “Smite” has taken some creative liberties with her depiction.
As for the rest of her mythology, “Smite” is spot on. In the lore, poets tell that she was a nymph who was cursed by a jealous priestess.
In her mythology, Scylla really was indeed a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but jealous Amphitrite turned her into a monster by poisoning the water of the spring where Scylla would bathe. The lore also states that ships that sail through her waters never come out unscathed.
Scylla lives on one of the sides of the “Strait of Messina” between Sicily and the Italian mainland, with her counterpart Charybdis residing on the other. While Scylla is a giant sea monster, Charybdis takes the form of a giant whirlpool and sailing too close to either side would spell death to the sailors foolish enough to make the journey. In the mythology, avoiding Scylla would mean sailing too close to Charybdis and vice versa; it’s actually where the term picking between two evils comes from.
The video game does a great job recreating Scylla. Whether it’s in the game, mythology or in real life, one thing is for sure, Scylla is always waiting, ready for her next victim.

Each fall, the Pratt Recreation Center hosts both the men’s and women’s basketball teams for Midnight Madness, a night of exhibition as players showcase their skills in anticipation for the start of the 2018-2019 season.
On Thursday, Oct. 25, students made their way to the Pratt Recreation Center to attend the event. Along with the chance to preview the programs and cheer on the players, students can also compete in contests for a shot at winning various prizes. However, since the controversial announcement of OneLIU, the “Madness” had trouble staying in bounds and trickled off the court.
The tradition continued as doors opened at 10 p.m. Access to the event was free to students with LIU ID cards. The evening kicked off with a performance from the dance team. Afterwards the basketball teams were introduced, with pairs of teammates performing small dance routines to their chosen walk out songs.
The women’s side of the court proved strong in numbers, as each player came dancing out fully dressed, while the men’s side only had six players suited up. The remaining players were seated on the sidelines, wearing their regular clothes in protest to the evening’s festivities. While the men’s program has yet to formally address the issue, the crowd seemed fully aware of the dissent and privy to the circulating talk around campus of several players forfeiting the season to remain eligible next year.
While the loud music and bright lights attempted to distract the audience from the controversy of the OneLIU merger, the night was noticeably affected by it, as evident by the visible disunity among the men’s team. The players who protested also declined to participate in the contests throughout the night, leaving both the 3-point shooting contest and free throw contest bare.
Every year, the event welcomes back basketball alumni who get to join in celebration of the current teams while reminiscing on their own times playing as a Pioneer.
Alumnus Aary Bibbins (‘18) reflected, “I hope that there is more spirit than ever and think people will embrace it because it seems as if people have come together in a sense.” He cautioned his take by saying, “I could be wrong, but hopefully.”
Winners of the shooting contests and raffles got to take home some of the night’s big prizes. The $10,000 worth of prizes included a Nintendo Switch, PS4 Pro, 55″ Flat Screen TVs, a MacBook Air, Airpods, Beat Solo 3 and more.
Following the “Madness,” both teams gear up for the start of the regular seasons. The women’s
season commenced on Saturday, Oct. 27 against Coppin State University in a close loss of 84-80.
The men’s basketball season officially kicks off on Saturday, Nov. 10 as they head down to Baltimore, Md.
to face Post University. Before then, the team will have to confront its own internal struggles between the program and its players. While rumors of players transferring and sitting out for the season continue to remain unconfirmed, the division is palpable around campus and on display Thursday night.

There’s an eye opening National Geographic documentary titled “Stress – the Portrait of a Killer” that everyone, especially college students who are juggling challenge after challenge, should watch. This documentary delves into subjects such as how stress affects the body’s ability to repair damaged cells, and how one’s position at work or school can affect their overall stress level.

The program points out that stress is proven to unravel chromosomes and shrink the brain by damaging and
killing cells. There’s one particular study explained in the film where scientists conducted experiments on African baboons and figured out how they physiologically respond to stress in a hierarchical society where certain monkeys were obviously dominant and others obviously inferior. Baboons that held a higher status – meaning those who were bigger, louder, and who gave orders to others – actually expressed less signs of stress and had lower levels of circulating stress hormones. Dominant monkeys had less body fat, more lean mass and less cardiovascular episodes, making their bodies overall healthier.
On the flip side, those who were submissive to ‘superiors’ were smaller in size, more fatty and less energetic, most likely due to their higher circulating levels of the stress hormones; cortisol and adrenaline.
This study is interesting because it can be linked to our modern society, jobs, relationship and lives. The takeaway, however, should not be that we should all go and assert our dominance over others, but that we should strive to treat each others as equals so that our society as a whole can escape the debilitating effects of stress. This in turn would lead to a more efficient and less problemsome community.
The documentary also connected higher stress levels to lower cognitive abilities, particularly in the memory category. Lab mice who were more stressed ended up developing a smaller hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning, further supporting the scientific evidence that stress is a debilitating condition.
The film mentioned that if a woman is pregnant during a highly stressful time, like during a famine, her fetus would be affected as well. Studies showed that babies that came from mothers who underwent chronic stress during pregnancy had a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, higher baseline cholesterol levels, and were more acutely sensitive to stress.
This data shows that stress can not only be a lifelong disease, but in certain cases it can have a ‘hereditary’ factor to it. Stress shortens telomeres (the things that protect our chromosomes from unravelling and DNA from mutating) and hinders the body’s ability to repair damaged cells, further intensifying the stress cycle.
Long story short, it’s in all of our best interests to do the best we can and make decisions that serve to decrease stress levels and to aid in the lowering of stress for loved ones. Life is short, and it’s important that we find what we love to do and do it, find who we love to be with and be with them and to submerge ourselves in situations that support happiness.

The cast and crew of Post Theater Company’s upcoming production “Iphigenia and Other Daughters,” have been hard at work preparing for the show. Opening night is Nov. 9 at 7:30 p.m. in the Little Theater Mainstage.
Megan Sickels, a sophomore theater major, plays Iphigenia, the daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, royals in Greek mythology. As their first born daughter, Iphigenia was sacrificed to the goddess Artemis. Afterwards, Greek soldiers set sail for the city of Troy. “[The Trojan War] basically happened because they killed this poor innocent little girl,” Sickels said.
Sickels relates to her character in her sense of goodness, “She is the best example of good for goodness sake, she wants to do the right thing because it is the right thing, not because she wants any reward from it.” she said. “I hope to think I’m like that.”
Julia Rivera, sophomore acting major, plays Clytemnestra. “She’s essentially the mother in the show, she was a queen in Greece for about 10 years, had four children, [and] one of them was sacrificed by her husband before the Trojan War,” Rivera said. “The beginning of the play covers this sacrifice, while the middle shows her relationship with her [other] two daughters.”
Rivera portrays Clytemnestra as having strength through her femininity, and she personally connects with this aspect of her character. “She would be a CEO of a majorly successful company,” Rivera said. “She ran [Greece] for 10 years with three children which is very, very impressive.”
Speaking on the production as a whole, Sickels expressed the importance of the work the whole cast and crew have put in. “It was so exciting to get the cast list and see all the wonderful people I am working with because they are all so talented,” she said. “It was a little terrifying because you want to do everybody else justice.”
“The production has been a really wonderful process, at the beginning when we were still doing table work, we went through the whole script with a fine-tooth comb,” Rivera said. “We covered every single detail, we made sure that we were on the same track,” she said.
Dina Vovsi is the director of the production. “Dina has been fantastic, she has made sure that we have all had a very strong voice throughout the production which is really awesome,” Rivera said.
“From day one I have been impressed with the talent the students and whole design team has,” Vovsi said. “[During] table work week, we really dove in and brought a lot to the table, starting with an amazing groundwork, and seeing that impact has been incredible.”
“I love the concept of violence and the way it plays on innocent people who have nothing to do with it,” Sickles said. “War just sort of tears this family apart. A lot of people don’t realize it is something that goes on still in this world.”
Vovsi mentioned how the violence portrayed in the play leads to a need for action. “It grounds us in the idea that these are very real people,” she said. “[People] feel a lack of control and feel they must take action.” How- ever, she incorporated a sense of humor into her direction.  “With so much violence, you have to find where the lightness is,” Vovsi said.
“Dina has been doing a really good job of integrating humor into it and making light of certain situations which is nice, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Rivera said
The story of the play is one of intrigue, according to Rivera. Audience members might find any of the characters relatable, “There are certain characters you can find yourself in, whether it’s Iphigenia or Clytemnestra,” Rivera said.
Vovsi explained the message she hopes the play will convey. “The relationship to war and the effects on soldiers and everyone around them, what does it do to all the people involved?” she said. “Part II is set at the end of World War I, the first war that led to a thorough investigation of “shell shock” and PTSD, which the actor playing Orestes really dove into researching.”
“Iphigenia and Other Daughters” will show from Nov. 9-10, and 15-17 at 7:30 p.m., and on Nov.11 and 18 at 3 p.m., General admission is $15, $12 for seniors and $10 for students. Tickets can be purchased online at tix55.com/ptc700.

Editors Note: The writer is a member of BSU.
During the fall 2017 semester, BSU (Black Student Union) implemented a new event “BSU After Dark.” After numerous requests from members of the club in regards to getting more time for their meetings, the president at the time, Motunrayo Olusa decided to host “BSU After Dark” once a month, as a special event. With permission from Campus Life, the club was able to host its first “BSU After Dark” that semester in the basement of the Winnick Student Center.

“Our general meeting time, Wednesday’s during common hour, never used to feel like enough time to discuss all the topics that are brought up by members outside of what we already had planned, so I thought BSU After Dark would be a good chance to pick up where we left off with the regular meetings,” Olusa said.
Although the plan to keep these meetings going once a month didn’t fall through, the executive board members didn’t allow the event to just be forgotten by the student body. The current president, Catrina Dasque, a junior adolescence education major, decided to keep the concept going this year for the same reasons as Olusa.
On Thursday Oct. 25, BSU members and members of the student body met in the basement of the Chapel to discuss issues that were put into a teapot. At the beginning of all of their weekly meetings, a teapot is placed at the front of the room and left there for anyone to anonymously put a topic, question or just general thoughts into the cup.
Replacing the original suggestion box with a teapot helped the concept for this year’s meetings because they meet to “spill the tea,” a phrase popularly known for spilling the truth. Everyone is encouraged to anonymously put anything into the teapot prior to the date set for their next BSU After Dark.
“Without BSU After Dark, a lot of topics that need more time and attention than the time we have during general meetings wouldn’t be brought to the table,” Keolani Williams, a senior forensic science major and member of the club, said. “I’m glad that were able to have these meetings because it allows us to really sit and thoroughly discuss issues.”
Before the “tea was spilled,” the BSU advisor, Nilda Nelson, had an e-board member, Mecca Shomari, read the mission statement of the club in order to remind members and casual visitors of the club’s standards and that any form of disrespect is not tolerated. “We have to remember where we are and that this is supposed to be a safe zone and that’s what this will be,” Nelson said.
More than 20 students gathered in the basement of the chapel in order to share their opinions on issues like politics, intersectionality and even shed light on some of their personal experience within the
topics. With topics ranging from intersectionality, which addresses that people have multiple identities that affect each other rather than being separate, to personal frustrations within their own community,
the attendees listened and spoke for over two hours.
“I’m glad the topic of intersectionality came up because I believe too many people are ignorant when it comes to understanding this concept,” Williams said. “The divide between many of us has to do with people not understanding intersectionality.”
“There was a topic about being black and gay and feeling divided between both communities,” Coivan Makia, a senior business administration major, said. “I believe society makes it harder for family and friends to accept their loved ones for being anything other than what they perceive to be the norm, with a little bit of research and the I believe we could somehow move forward.”
BSU meets every Tuesday during common hour in Hillwood Commons room 221.

George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, spoke at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. in a conversation with former congressman Steve Israel, head of the LIU Global Institute.
The two, who first met while Bush was president and Israel was working in congress, discussed a variety of topics, ranging from the president’s time in office to his new passion for painting.
The nearly full audience at the event consisted mostly of older people, with some students interspersed throughout the crowd.
One of the topics Bush discussed was a defining moment in his presidency: September 11, 2001.
“I don’t think that America should be a nation of revenge, but a nation of justice,” he said of the country’s response to the 9/11 attacks. “The country was very united then. We were a nation that was not going to be defeated by an enemy that was ruthless and barbaric.”
On immigration reform, Bush said that there should be tamper-proof ID cards given to immigrants that would allow them to work in the country. He stressed that immigration should be “a path to citizen- ship based upon someone’s contribution to the society in which they live.”
Bush also discussed his relationship with his father, George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States. “[My father] would call me in dark moments and say, “Son, I’m incredibly proud of you and I love you,” Bush said.
He discussed his major influence, Abraham Lincoln, and Lincoln’s unchanging principle that “all men are created equal under God.” Bush said that Lincoln’s non-punitive peace with the south after the Civil War was inspirational to him.
Bush talked about the past ten years since his presidency including his book writing, charitable works, and painting. Painting began as a pastime which turned into a large part of his life. Despite being a self-described “art agnostic” for most of his life, Bush tried out painting, and quickly realized he enjoyed artistic pursuits. “You don’t know what you can do in life until you give it a shot,” he said.
From his love of painting came his book “Portraits of Courage,” a compilation of his paintings of and interviews with American veterans.
Bush did not comment on the actions of president Donald Trump or former president Barack Obama, as he said that while he was in office, he disliked when past presidents would comment on his work.
At the end of the conversation, Bush gave his most important piece of advice to the audience, which was met with much applause.
“Civic attitude starts at the grassroots level. Be responsible for your own behavior,” Bush said. “[Civic attitude] begins with the citizens themselves.”
