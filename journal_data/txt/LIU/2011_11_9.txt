 Starting on September 17th, the Occupy Wall Street movement took New York City by storm.  As the weeks went by, other cities, towns, and schools around the country started to take notice.  People from around the United States began to support and copy the movement.  The media has taken notice, making Occupy Wall Street one of the hottest stories of the year. On Wednesday, November 2nd, students and faculty started their own solidarity movement on our campus called Occupy C.W. Post.
The purpose of the campus protest is to bring the Occupy Wall Street protest closer to home and to protest the way the school is run, including the tuition increases and how the money is being spent.
The November 2nd protest started with setting up the whole event on the Great Lawn by making signs out of cardboard.  Students and faculty were encouraged to make signs. Throughout the day, students and teachers made speeches for the crowd.  During the Common Hour, a march was assembled to go around the campus. The day continued with more faculty and student speakers, ending with a vigil for Scott Olsen, a former Marine who was shot in the head with a projectile object thrown by the police while participating in the Occupy Oakland protest on October 25th.
Students who were gathered at the event were mesmerized by the protests taking place. Junior criminal justice major Melinda Fuentes said,” It’s about time! The first awareness was with the faculty strike. If we keep going, the Provost will take notice of what the students here want.”
Sophomore chemistry major Jackie Wiswall said, “I totally agree; our tuition has been raised for no reason. We’re building a new football field, and we’re expected to pay for it? After college, I’m not guaranteed a job anyway, so I’m annoyed.”
Corey Sobel, a sociology graduate student, said he came down in support of some of his friends. “I hope people in charge realize [that] students are frustrated by the way the campus does not address issues; hopefully, things will change,” he said.
Corinna Grunn, a sophomore theater major, was involved with organizing the event. When asked by the Pioneer what she hoped the protest would accomplish, she said, “We want to get a budget breakdown and see exactly where our tuition money goes.”
Wendy Ryden, an English professor, took her class to see the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City. They were some of the students who made speeches at last week’s campus event.  Ryden wore a shirt in support of the protesters, which said “Got Thought” on the front and on the back said “Take Action”.  When asked about her feelings towards the protest she said, “I’m excited that people at Post are interested enough to want to connect with global issues.”
Jennifer Rogers, a sociology professor and a speaker at the event said, “It’s powerful to see students, faculty, and staff united. We are the 99% ; we’re the ones taking pay cuts and tax rises. We need to analyze our roles as citizens and members of a community to enact change.”
Sociology professor Eric Lichten also spoke at the event and plans to write a book about the Occupy Wall Street movement. Lichten said, “What Occupy Wall Street represents is the cry of the few to take back America – to make America the land that it could be, by changing its future, by challenging the concentrations of wealth and income in the hands of the few.  Occupy Wall Street is the reappearance of class consciousness among the public who call, with the dignity of their commitment, for social justice, for meeting the human needs of humanity, before it’s too late. These people represent the call to explore new ways to live together, as a community, instead of in a war of each against the other America for whom? America, it must be for you and me.”
Some students walked by the protest on the Great Lawn without a blinking eye.  Some saw the event but didn’t know what it was for. Alexa Lacajnina, a junior early childhood education major, asked, “They’re protesting to lower the tuition?” When asked her thoughts on the assembly, she said, “I don’t think it’s going to do much, but it might start to do something.”.
For those who want to find out more about the Occupy Wall Street movement, any news site, such as the New York Times or CNN, can provide up to date information. The movement also has a Facebook page, www.facebook.com/OccupyWallSt and a website, http://occupywallst.org/   Any student interested in the Occupy Post group can visit its Facebook page,www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-C-W-PostLIU/180906245325041  or talk to Professor Eric Lichten of the Sociology Department.  Each day, these protestors are making progress by inspiring others to take their lead.  A group of students and faculty at C.W. Post took notice, will you?

As of January 2012, all Long Island University campuses will be rebranded.  C.W. Post will be known as L.I.U.- Post, and the other campuses will experience similar changes. However, new information suggests that the “C.W.” may not be dropped after all.
“We are not going to lose the ‘C.W.,’” said Alum and Board of Trustees member Michael Emmerman (’67).  According to Emmerman, who was briefed on the rebranding process and saw the final product about two weeks ago, the rebranding material will say L.I.U.- Post.  However, Emmerman said, “I believe that on our printed material it will still say C.W. Post.”
Rita Langdon, the Associate Provost and Director of Public Relations, said the following in an email: “The higher education community, prospective students and the public will come to know the campus as L.I.U. – Post, which will be reflected in marketing materials, logo items and signage.” She added, “The campus will continue to be registered with New York State as Long Island University, C.W. Post Campus.”
What appears to be undisputed is that feelings about the name change are mixed, especially among alumni.  Assistant Professor of Foreign Language Richard Auletta said, “Several generations of students and alumni have known our campus simply as “C.W. Post,” which is pretty much how the surrounding community sees us.”
Auletta, a former fraternity member and alum of Post who has been in contact with over a hundred of his fraternity brothers, said they only know the school as C.W. Post.  He added that,  “any name change, certainly one which truncates the name C.W. Post, would alienate the students of yesteryear even more.”
On the other hand, alum and trustee Stan Barshay (’60) said, “I love the name change. Many graduates of Post have used L.I.U. on their resumes or when they’re talking about the school they graduated from.  L.I.U. is better known throughout the country and speaks of a large and more successful university.”
“To completely rename C.W. Post as ‘L.I.U. – Post’ might confuse some people, especially prospective students.  Most people know the school as C.W. Post of Long Island University.  I just hope the name change doesn’t confuse students,” said Kayla Krause, 2010 alum and former co-editor-in-chief of the Pioneer.  However, she said, “I think the community could benefit from a fresh change.”
Dr. James Owston, the dean of online and individual learning at Mountain State University who has written his dissertation, “Survival of the Fittest? The Rebranding of the West Virginia Higher Education,” about university name change, said, “I think most students are oblivious to name change initiatives.  There is less brand loyalty these days, and in a lifetime of traditional students many things have been rebranded.  I don’t think most students worry about it. You are more likely to offend alumni than currents students, who are focused on getting their degrees and getting a job.”
Dr. Owston said schools in the United States have been rebranding throughout their histories, adding, “this is not a new trend, as you will find that many institutions have been rebranded several times.”
According to Dr. Owston, some schools that have rebranded themselves are: the College of New Jersey, which was known as Trenton State College, Truman State University, which was once Northeast Missouri State University, and Mountain State University, formerly the College of West Virginia.
For now, our community will have to wait and see if Long Island University will need to rebrand itself more than once and if the rebranding initiative will truly be beneficial.  Trustee Emmerman said, “I believe this will be very beneficial to all the L.I.U. stakeholders, students, faculty and administration.”
“Only time will tell if this business tactic will gain more incoming freshman and keep enrolled students,” said Samantha Bishal, 2011 alum and former co-editor-in-chief of the Pioneer.
Dr. Owston agreed that rebranding can be beneficial, “but it is not isolated to the name.  It is what you do with name.  It has to be perceived as genuine.  It has to make sense. It has to be supported by stakeholders. If not, it will probably fail.”

As students piled into the eight resident halls on the C.W. Post Campus by the droves this fall, there was a new man behind the scenes: Carlyle Hicks, the new director of residence life.
On October 3rd, 2011, Hicks became the director of residence life, a job previously held by Jennifer Fuoco, who was the acting director of residence life. Hicks has 15 years of experience in higher education and has direct experience working in Residence Life and Housing. “Prior to my arrival at C.W. Post, I was the Director of Residence Life at Dominican College in Rockland County, New York,” he said about his work experience.
Hicks said he took the job as the Director of Residence Life because he enjoys interacting with students, and no two days are ever the same. “Right now, I’m excited about the opportunity to be a part of the C.W. Post Campus and to explore the potential of the residence life program,” Hicks said in an email interview with the Pioneer.
According to Hicks, his duties include overseeing the daily operation of the Residence Life program, ensuring student safety, working with the Facilities Department so that the buildings are maintained, developing community and making sure students are comfortable in their living environment.  He added, “It is also my responsibility to promote the mission of the Office of Residence Life as well as overseeing the goals and mission of the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University.”  According to our school website, there are about 1,940 students living on campus, four central office staff members, six residence hall directors and more than 75 resident assistants.
Hicks wants to observe the student life before he can make plans to improve it. “Right now, my plan is to gather all the information that I can [and] then, put together a strategic plan to address the most pressing needs,” he said.
One thing Hicks wants to change is student participation in resident hall activities.  Hicks said, “I know that students have difficult schedules; they work, and they have various extra-curricular commitments.  However, I want students to get the full benefit of the many programs which are coordinated by the professional staff and the resident assistants.”
“It’s always challenging when you are the new person. People need to find their comfort levels when meeting someone new, and the same is expected with the residents,” Hicks said about his hardest challenge, which will be getting to know the residents.
 
The future is bright for all the students in the resident halls.  Hicks is looking forward to creating “learning-living communities within the residence halls, increase the sense of community, and improve the quality of life of the residents.”  He also added, “I think that the students are wonderful and that all my colleagues share the same goal, which is to help provide the students with the tools necessary to succeed beyond C.W. Post.”

 On November 2nd, Dr. Muhammad Muslih, a political science professor specializing in the Middle East, gave a lecture on President Obama and the Arab Spring.  The Arab Spring is a chain of democratic protests that have been occurring in the Arab world in order to overthrow the leaders who are in power.
Dr. Muslih started off the lecture explaining about the Arab Spring and the different countries that have revolted against their leaders.  Starting in Tunisia in December of 2010, the uprisings spread to places such as Egypt, Yemen, Syria, and Libya. These were the main areas of the world that Dr. Muslih focused on.
From there, he continued to talk about each specific region separately.  He also described what he viewed as former President Bush’s goals in the Middle East and then compared them to those of President Obama.  His opinion was that President Bush was determined to promote democracy in the Arab World.   President Bush, according to Dr. Muslih, seemed to make the United States play a more powerful role when dealing with the Middle East, but President Obama came to the White House with a specific agenda: to raise the United State’s profile in Asia and diminish the United State’s role in the Arab World.
Alize Margulis, a sophomore majoring in International Studies said, “I thought the lecture was interesting.  I liked how Dr. Muslih started with the advantages and disadvantages of the Bush Administration, moved on to the Obama Administration, and then talked about what their goals in international relations and policies are within the United States.”
Whereas President Bush’s intentions in the Arab World may have been more involved, Dr. Muslih stated, “Obama’s approach toward the Arab Spring is not comprehensive; it is a case study.”  It is unkown exactly what President Obama will do in the future if there is another uprising since he has acted differently in every sitatuation.  With the pace at which revolts have been occuring in the Arab World, the next wave of protests probably isn’t too far away.  Sophmore political science major Dakota Braun also liked the lecture saying, “I thought it was very insightful.  It put into perspective the Obama Administration policies in the Middle East.”

Have you ever wondered what the most “popular” areas of study are for graduate students at our school?  C.W. Post offers a variety of master’s degree programs in the College of Education and Information Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Management, School of Visual Arts and Performing Arts, as well as in the School of Health Professions and Nursing.  According to the Director of Graduate Admissions Carol Zerah, statistics show that “the College of Education and Information Sciences enrolls the greatest number of graduate students: over 1500.”  However, just because a particular program possesses a high enrollment does not necessarily mean that the program is “popular.” A prospective graduate student has to especially select a program of interest to him or her based on his or her need to achieve personal strength and enrichment.
In an effort to explain why there is a disparity in the enrollments for various master’s degree programs offered at C.W. Post, Zerah said that “enrollment numbers are not necessarily indictors of ‘popularity’.  Some programs are intentionally small because they are relatively new.  Or, the enrollment numbers are intentionally limited due to program requirements – student to faculty ratios – and clinical placements.”  For example, Zerah stated that “though the M.S. in Genetic Counseling is a small program (less than 20 students), the program is only in its second year. The program is, however, quite popular with applicants, and we receive many more applications than we are able to admit. The program is competitive, and, therefore, the enrollment numbers are not high. But, that does not mean that the program is not popular.”
Zerah further stated that “graduate enrollment numbers vary for many reasons [because] students apply to programs which interest them, and they apply to programs which will enhance their credentials to bring them toward the achievement of their career goals.”  Although being enrolled or seeking to apply to a “popular” master’s program seems appealing, Zerah said that “it can be rewarding to be enrolled in a large program as well as a small, more refined program. It would be an individual preference.”
Are you currently an undergraduate seeking to broaden your horizons? It is never too early to think about graduate school.  Zerah informed the Pioneer that “graduate admissions counselors are also always available to meet with Post students. Our admissions counselors are available to assist you to apply to graduate programs here at Post and to determine if you are eligible for any of the Graduate Scholarships available to students. If you’re graduating in December, Zerah said you could apply and receive “admissions decision to begin [your] graduate studies in the spring 2012 semester.” And, if you are still unsure, “Student Success Workshops offered by the Academic and Career Planning Office [can be helpful, as] these sessions offer tips for finding and choosing the right school and program.  The counselor will offer assistance in successfully navigating the graduate admissions process.” In essence, there are a variety of master’s programs available on campus. Should you wish to learn more about the various graduate programs, numerous graduate open houses are held throughout the year, where questions about all of the academic disciplines can be answered.

Did you know that most first impressions are formed within the first seven seconds of meeting a person? According to www.collegefashion.net, 55 percent of a first impression is based on non-verbal cues. Nonverbal cues include body language, gestures, posture, eye contact, and even appearance. Therefore, how you dress for an interview is incredibly important.
I am not saying that your appearance is more important than your qualifications, but how you dress is the first chance that you have to impress your future employer. Your outfit has the ability to provide the interviewer with a sense of who you are and what you will bring to the position before even asking you a single question. This is why dressing the part and dressing in a professional manner is half the battle. “It is important to dress appropriately for an interview because you want people to respect you for who you are as a professional and not for how much skin you show. You want to be able to earn employment based on your abilities,” says Graduate student Maria Jose Vaca.
As cliché as it sounds, you should dress for the job you want, and not the job you have. So instead of wearing your comfortable, signature sweats, you should dress up to match the climate and dress code of the company with which you are interviewing. Every company is different, which means that they might have a strict dress code, a more lenient one, or a combination of the two. If possible, you should do some research ahead of time to learn the company’s history and atmosphere,  in order to pick out the perfect outfit to showcase your personality, while highlighting your prowess and aptitude in your given field.
For a more formal interview and workplace setting, women should wear a neutral colored pants-suit or skirt-and-blazer combination. Your blouse should be something simple, with a conservative neckline. Closed-toe shoes with a heel less than three inches are highly recommended as well. Jewelry should complement the outfit while remaining minimal and non-distracting. Keep your makeup, hair, and nails simple and natural. Remember, you want to catch the interviewer’s attention, but not detract from your qualifications and your interest in the job or internship.
Men should wear a suit or nice trousers and a sports jacket for a formal interview. Their button-down dress shirt should be traditional in print and design. Ties should go with the outfit, but should not be ostentatious. Loafers or other dress shoes are suggested. Hair should be neat and face should be clean-shaven. Wearing a watch is highly recommended as well because it shows the interviewer that you are professional, responsible, and punctual. Both genders should make sure to conceal piercings and tattoos as best they can. Although many companies have become more relaxed about them, there are still corporations that would rather you cover them up. You should smell nice and fresh without using overpowering perfumes or colognes.
Lastly, all outfits should be freshly cleaned and ironed. “The dress code for today’s work environment is a little more relaxed so people should not dread getting ready for an interview. As far as making a good first impression, you can never go wrong with apparel from stores like H&M. A good rule of thumb is that if your outfit would make your grandmother scream, do not wear it!” said Junior International Relations major, Ashley DeShields.
Due to the extremely competitive job market today, dressing to impress is even more imperative. When in doubt, do research online about what to wear to an interview. Dressing for an interview is all about selling yourself from the moment you walk into the room, to the moment you leave. Looking professional is a factor that many interviewers rely on to help them decide whether or not you would be a good fit for their company, so follow these guidelines to distinct yourself from the rest of the applicants.

C.W. Post’s 2nd annual Diwali Celebration offered opportunities for students from all backgrounds to participate in a world renowned Indian celebration where traditions meet modernity.  The festivities went off with a bang at 7pm on Thursday, November 3rd, hosted by the Indo-American Club, and co-sponsored by ISS and ISU.
Diwali, known as the festival of lights and awareness of one’s inner light, is also thought by many as a celebration of the victory of good over evil. For the attendees at the party on C.W. Post campus, the victory most certainly was the successful gathering of a diverse array of world citizens. American, Chinese, Norwegian, and Indian students ate customary dishes, danced wildly, and participated in traditional Hindu religious practices, all the while bringing together a fusion of cultural displays.
The giving of Puja, a habitual practice of blessing, began the ceremony and was given to all willing participants. Adorned with offerings and idols of the gods, Ganesh and Lakshmi, the tiny temple stood behind Nisha Yadau who sang the prayers and waved a plate of flowers which held a clay oil-burning “diya” lamp. Each attendee came up one by one to participate in this fundamental service.
Following the blessing ceremony was a captivating dance routine by Meena Darak, Shreya Desai, Ikjyot Kaur, and Sanjana Kapur which, when viewed head on, the three girls became one in the representation of the many armed Goddess Kali. The art program continued, as Jessica Gerrara, an Indian-American student, picked up her guitar to perform a cover of “Sunday Morning,” by Maroon Five. Jessica’s tribute served as a representative of when cultures collide. An audience member came up during the performance to help her tune her guitar, which came as an illustration of the mood of sharing and collaboration innate in the evening’s spirit.
After refueling with savory and sweet dishes including Chole Masala, Bajar Kahalwa and Chinese noodles, the evening progressed with the improvisations of student music mixers and impromptu dance instructors. Menna took the lead by showing off her Bollywood moves which were mirrored by the rest of the dance circle. While the majority of students who filled the floor were Indian, others without any prior experience with these techniques came away as kings and queens of the dance hall. Old-school movie scores and current hip-hop mixes by Indian artists rang through the party’s many rooms. Songs such as “Ainyve Ainyve”, Gori Nal Ishq Mitha”, and “Tera Mast de Mast Te Do Nain” kept the crowd busy until way over the party’s scheduled conclusion.
The Indo-American Club, which serves as a social liaison between American and South Asian arts, culture, and academic programs, has been a presence at Long Island University of two years. During a bittersweet passing of the torch, Meena Darak, founder, and president of the club until the end of this semester, announced that the new President will be Rohan Kapur, a sophomore at C.W. Post from Delhi. After accepting his new position, he spoke of continuing this tradition on campus for years to come. “Diwali is one of the most important festivals in India and since we are Indian we want to show our fellow students our culture.”

For all college students looking to work for a large company, or who have dreams of making big bucks, there is one thing they always make sure they do: they become interns. Internships have now become a social or cultural mandate for a majority of the student population across the country, according to collegeview.com. Family members, teachers, friends, and anyone who cares about students, will often advise them to get internships if they have not already started to look for them, from their late sophomore year of college. The trend is that students should have completed at least one, or be in the middle of an internship, by their senior year. When they graduate, they will head out into the job market with an internship that not only looks good on a resume, but will have provided in-depth experiences, ideas, and skills applicable to common business practices.
 
Professor Amy Freedman, the chair of the Political Science Department, and Professor Oscar De Rojas have set up a program that helps political science and international studies majors find internships at the United Nations, either with NGOs or with UN organizations. Freedman explains her stand-point on internships as “The hope is having an internship that builds a student’s resume and builds work credentials. The value of an internship is it also gives students a wide range of knowledge that they wouldn’t be exposed to otherwise. The internships students get at the UN open the doors to all kinds of agencies. Also the utilities are twofold: one is concrete skills, dress, and social cues such as speech and behavior, and computer skills; the less obvious benefit is the knowledge that is gained.”
 
In the past, businesses often didn’t know how much students could handle and didn’t give them much to do other than “busy work.” “However this has changed in recent years, and student interns are doing more than Xeroxing and coffee runs; they are writing briefs, and organizing events. These are tasks that many internships may have and the idea is developing writing skills for a job, not a grade.” says Professor Freedman. The skills people learn while interning are also transferable regardless of what type of internship one has. In many cases, interning helps people grow as a person, not just as a student. The affect an internship has on a student varies and it also pertains to what the person is studying.
 
Kathleen Joyce, a Senior Journalism major, who began an internship at Newsday in September said, “I’ve learned a lot of things. I work for the online editions of Newsday and I learned how organized and how massive the Newsday office is. The amount of work these writers and editors put into their work is admirable. Learning the programs that are used to write the stories/update the webpage was hard at first, but it got easier and easier. Now I have a real love for journalism, and although I did before, I have more of an interest now. I also became so much more responsible. I’m not being paid for the internship, so I had to cut back on my spending, but I think it will be worth it in the end.”
 
William Lindberg, a Graduate student and Political Science Major said, “I was a summer intern for the Caribbean Community at the UN.  Professor Oscar De Rojas helped me find Noel Sinclair. The internship was a great experience and I strongly felt that I improved my research and writing skills. Furthermore, just by being at the UN and learning how its bodies work will be valuable for a potential future UN career. It also connects you to other organizations that one may find
very interesting. There are so many different branches linked to the UN that there is something for everyone with any interest or focus.”
 
Another Post student, Anne Winberry, who is a senior Journalism major said this of her experience: “Long Island Radio Group consists of KJoy, B 103, and 94 X. I was their intern for four months and while I was there, I learned how to edit internet clips for their website. I also learned how to put commercials into their system to be broadcasted.  I learned how to get things done much faster, it was a very fast paced environment! I worked for the morning show and things needed to be done immediately.  It definitely helped me grow as a person because I learned how to communicate in an office environment.   I had to be more outgoing; I couldn’t be shy. Also I learned to really take initiative.”
 
All three students agree that their internship experience has helped prepare them for what they want to do for a career. Internships often act as the building blocks for a person’s career, and provide them with specific skills that may be necessary in their job field. Journalists who ultimately want to write for a newspaper need to use special programs to write their articles so they can be laid out for a printed paper, or uploaded to an online source. When asked if she felt she was being prepared for her career, Joyce said, “I think I definitely am. I learned what a newsroom looks like, how these writers/editors/employees interact, how fast they get a story and write it, and the whole wide world of journalism that exists out there. Anything can be made into a story; you just need to find that value that makes it interesting. I absolutely want to write for a newspaper in my career, any newspaper, Newsday especially. The people are nice, the work is over-the-top but I like challenges, and everyday there’s always a new story to work on, so it gets more and more interesting.”
 
Many students wonder how many internships they should do during their college career, or where to do them. Everyone has a different answer because there are different perspectives, and again it depends on the field a student is going into. Professor Freedman kindly gave her perspective on the idea: “I don’t think there is a magic number, but if students have a summer or part-time job, it will count as well. If a student is interested in International Relations or Development, an overseas internship will help. For Development, it is very important to get in the field and do hands-on work, students need the time on the ground.”
 
Internships can not only help students develop the skills they need for their career but may also help them decide on what they really want to do with their lives. Growing up or sitting in a class-room, you may have an idea of doing something, but no tangible experience as to what it is really like. Professor Freedman might not have studied Political Science if she didn’t do an internship. She says, “When I was young I wanted to be in the Music Industry. I spent some time working for Spin Magazine and RCA. While I was there, I realized I really didn’t like it. Internships can help students know what they don’t like too.” Students may find they like planning events for organizations, rather than working for an organization. Today there is an entire industry built around event planning. It might be a direction change for many, but who knows, they may be happier in the end doing something they love.
 
All in all, internships are important in so many aspects and they may help shape one’s future. They are great experiences and few people have regrets about doing them.  In today’s competitive global market for jobs, internships have become the thing that give people an edge over their competition. Students should give one a try; the benefits out-weigh the costs, and the knowledge gained is very useful, and not confined to a class-room.

  Texting, tweeting, and talking in a classroom are behaviors that are considered to be rude. Eating, crunching, and snacking are rude too, right? Although food is a necessity, the question we must ask ourselves is, “Is it disrespectful to eat in class while your professor is lecturing?”
There are two types of students who do this. One group brings Subway sandwiches, sushi, and mom’s leftover dinner from last night to class, causing the classroom to have an unpleasant smell. They are the students who open up their food in class and the packaging makes an irritating crinkling noise, and can disrupt the class. Then you have the students who’d rather snack on a granola bar or bagel, or some other foods that draw less attention.
We may look at this and wonder, “Do students have proper college classroom etiquette?”  This all comes down to exercising our personal freedom. In this case, it is eating, but it seems that some college students don’t know where to draw the line. Some students who are not sure what their professor allows, may automatically assume it is okay. It is ironic because we are taught “proper manners” at a dinner table, including placing a napkin on our laps, and eating with our mouths closed, but we may forget those manners when it comes to a classroom.  With that said, some college students expect their professors to tolerate them drinking a cup of coffee in a morning class, or bringing food to a night class because they have no other time to eat. In reality, this is not proper behavior. In fact, some professors consider this to be unacceptable and in poor taste, literally.
Some professors allow students to eat in class, while others do not.  For example, Christopher Dodrill, Professor of Electronic Media, said “I do not mind if a student brings a cup of coffee to class.  I don’t like students bringing in a shopping bag full of food.”  Dr. Steve Hollander, Professor of Health Education said “I don’t mind students eating in class as long as they don’t make a mess, but because I teach health classes, I prefer that their choices are healthy. I sometimes make comments if they are having sugared drinks and foods high in fats and simple carbs. Foods like Subway sandwiches do not bother me.  If I make a comment, it’s about the quality of the food.”
Marissa Santomaso, Senior Public Relations major said, “ I feel quiet snacks are appropriate. Students should not bring smelly foods like tuna, or foods that are crunchy, because they are such a distraction to everyone else that is trying to concentrate in the class. However, I think that students should not eat food in classroom in general.” Emily Anker, Senior and Business Management major added, “I do bring food to class, but I will only bring foods like granola bars or mini muffins, because they are not smelly or loud. Last week, a girl was eating a bag of chips and the plastic kept making the most annoying sound. This is something that is not only distracting, but I feel disgusting to do in front of a professor.”
Clearly, eating in class reflects your attitudes and behaviors. Apparently, some students have more manners than others. Here are some pointers of what NOT to eat in classroom.
1.If you know your going to bring food that is wrapped in tinfoil or a loud bag of chips, please, do us all    a favor and open it before walking into class.
2.Try to avoid foods that give off a weird stench. Students typically don’t want to guess what you’re        eating when your food is filling the air with a strange aroma. We would rather concentrate on our      notes.
3. If you are not sure if your professor allows you to eat in class, the respectful thing to do is to ask him        or her.
4. Lastly, if you know you are going to be eating something in
class, at least offer your friends some food; we’re hungry too.

For basketball fans, it looks like you will only be watching college games due to the NBA owners’ inability to agree on a revenue split.  With the recent decision to cancel all November games, fans around the country are impatiently waiting to find out whether there will be a 2012 season.  NBA players are just as anxious as their fans; they must wait to find out whether or not they will be playing this year.  Many players have Tweeted their opinions on the issue, such as the Phoenix Suns’, Steve Nash, who posted, “Why are the owners unwilling to negotiate in good faith? As a player I apologize to the fans that we’re in this position but we will not be taken advantage of. In our hearts we’re desperate to play, in our minds we know better and are prepared to #standunited.”  Miami Heat’s Lebron James, voiced his frustration as his team was scheduled to play the Knicks this week.  He Tweeted, “I’m supposed to be in NY preparing to battle @carmeloanthony @Amareisreal and the Knicks in the Garden 2morrow night! SMH. #NBAlove.”  Others, like Miami Heat’s Dwyane Wade, are making jokes on Twitter as a result of the hiatus.  Wade posted, “Any1 Hiring…I’m available for all bar and bat mitzvah and weddings…but my specialty is balloon animals.”
All humor aside, the NBA lockout has been a nightmare for the majority of the players as they are currently not getting paid.  Previously, the players were receiving a 57% split with the owners on basketball-related income (BRI).  Now, since the owners of many of the small-market teams, like Milwaukee and Charlotte, claim they are losing money, they are dropping the players’ BMI and increasing the owners’ revenue.  The players’ union and the NBA union met Saturday night on November 5th for over six hours. While some of the NBA reporters seemed optimistic, comments by the players’ union afterwards indicated that no progress had been made and the owners placed an ultimatum with a Wednesday, November 6th deadline.  The ultimatum entails that the players have a possibility of earning a 50% BRI.  However, if the players’ union does not accept this offer, Stern threatened a 47% guarantee.
When asked his opinion on the lockout, graduate student Andrew Jackson said, “The NBA lockout is a giant mess. I feel like this is going to go for the entire season. Unlike the NFL, the best players, like Lebron James and Kobe Bryant, aren’t actively involved in the lockout like how Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Drew Brees were. NBA players also have a nice second option by going overseas and playing ball as well.”  Senior History major John Medford also compared the NBA lockout to the NFL lockout.  “The lockout affects me as a basketball fan in different ways.  I compare it to the NFL lockout who were able to make a deal and their seasons.  I think the [players’ union] representative, Derrick Fisher, is speaking more for himself than for the other players and that is causing a problem.  It’s gone on for too long and the players are not thinking about the fans whatsoever.  Derrick Fisher is hurting the NBA and the players.”  Though optimism is diminishing for both NBA players and fans, players and owners are attempting to negotiate in the hopes of reaching an agreement by Wednesday.  For now, fans will continue twiddling their thumbs and hope that the owners and players’ union are able to overcome this major setback to the season.

This week, a good friend of mine decided to buy a new car.  She asked me what she should buy.  I told her to get a used car, but she didn’t want to.  She bought a new Ford although her finances are low; as a college student, who has the money?  But each month, she will make payments in order to pay off the car.  My friend’s purchase inspired me to give the Pioneer’s readers a list of cars that are affordable and reliable. Winter is fast approaching; you’re going to need an outstanding car.  So sit back and car shop with me.
Ford has become quite the affordable brand in the past few years.  Cars like the recent Ford Fiesta and compact car Ford Focus are cute, affordable, and great on gas.  The Focus starts at $16,000, which is a little steep, but you can always throw down a payment and pay monthly, which will build up your credit!  The Ford Fiesta is a bit more affordable starting at $13,000 and gets a whopping 38 mpg on the highway.
The Mazda 3 is not only an adorable car, but it’s also decently priced.  It starts at $15,000. The car also gets 33 mpg on the highway.  Hyundais have become frequently-seen on the road due to their sleek style and low prices. The Elantra starts at $15,000 and gets 40 mpg on the highway.  The car also offers features such as standard XM satellite radio and hands-free Bluetooth that other cars at that price can’t match.  For a cheaper Hyundai, look at the Accent, which starts at $13,000 and guarantees 40 mpg on the highway as well.
For SUV’s, look towards the futuristic designs of the Kia Soul (you know, the car with the cute Hamster commercials), the Nissan Cube, and the Scion xB.  The Soul starts at $13,000 and gets 31 mpg on the highway.  The xB starts at$15,000 and gets 28 mpg on the highway.  The Nissan Cube starts at $15,000 and gets 28 mpg on the highway.
For the affordable hybrids, look at a Honda.  Honda has an outstanding reputation for making affordable, durable vehicles.  The Honda Civic Hybrid starts at $24,000 and can get 44 mpg on the highway.  The Honda Insight is also a hybrid that’s a little smaller and cheaper.  This car starts at $17,000 and can get 43 mpg on the highway.  The Toyota Prius, one of the more popular Hybrid cars, starts at $24,000 and can get 51 mpg on the highway.
Some other honorable mentions: the Nissan Sentra, a cute, compact car that starts at $16,000 and gets a good 31 mpg on the highway.  The Volkswagen Jetta and Golf, both start at around $17,000 and get over 30 mpg on the highway.  Chevys are also good to look into for affordable, gas-efficient cars.
For those looking into buying used cars, websites such as kellybluebook.com and nadaguides.com can help you with your search.  Buying a car is an important investment, so pick the one that’s right for you and your budget. Happy car hunting to all and, as always, safe driving.

A few decades ago, the dating game was different. Everything from the way the girl was asked out, to the places you went on a date. It was traditional for a young man to introduce himself to the family of the girl he was taking on a date. He would ring the doorbell, go inside and make small talk with the parents, and let them know what time he would have their precious girl home.
Those were the days when holding hands was a big deal and a kiss on the cheek meant you were boyfriend and girlfriend, both of which are ideals that seem silly to today’s modern daters. Especially being introduced to parents on your first date, that is a tradition that has seemed to have gone out the window, and frankly, I’m happy it has.
When that was a custom, it was based on being respectful to the parents, letting them know who was taking out their daughter, where they were going, and what time they would be home. As a young woman who still lives with her parents, I would be mortified if the guy taking me out came in my house to meet my family on our first date. At that point, I’m not even sure if I like the guy yet, let alone adding the stress of my family liking him.
Personally, meeting my family is a very big deal. I have a large family that is very close; we meddle in each other’s business constantly. We are also rather unorthodox and, in my opinion, slightly crazy. Before I will let any guy in my house, I need to make sure that I plan on going out with him for a little while. I also need to make sure that the guy is mentally capable of handling my sometimes-overwhelming family. A guy that I’m only going on one or two dates with doesn’t get the luxury of meeting the Parkers.
Meeting the parents may not be as big of a deal for everyone. I’m sure it’s not just girls who stress about it either; it may be just as worrisome for boys. Some people may still feel that the old-school way is the proper way. It’s just another one of the aspects of the dating world that is changing.

Many students have been increasingly aware of where their money is going, and they are also seeing a lot of things that need to be done not getting done, like repairing the roof in Humanities Hall, renovating the bathrooms in the dorms, keeping electricity and internet running in the dorms. At the beginning of the year the faculty was on strike because it was being offered a zero-percent pay increase over the next five years, and the increase in the payments needed for faculty health insurance, when quantified in monetary terms, translated essentially into a pay cut for faculty.
According to Anke Grosskopt, twenty-two percent of a student’s tuition goes towards endowment. Why? Because Administration puts a bulk of the money they get towards building and the general upkeep of the outside of the campus. The phrase “It’s the inside that counts” doesn’t just apply to people. A university can be beautiful on the outside, but it is how the students feel about the institution and how their day-to-day needs are met that ultimately matter.  Andrew Albrechtsen, a Junior Computer Science Major says “I think this is the worst possible time for the administration to be doing this. We can’t offer the faculty any raises, yet we’re going to spend $4.5 million to drop two letters off our name? I think it is extremely insensitive of the administration to do this just two months after our faculty went on strike to protest the unfair terms of their contract extension.  It’s hard to take the school seriously as it cries poverty when it’s time to renew its full-time faculty’s contracts, yet, has no problem with contemplating a multimillion-dollar expenditure to unnecessarily change C.W. Post’s name. Meanwhile, students are struggling to afford tuition and housing, taking out enormous student loans – how about we funnel that money into scholarships or grants?”
 
If a person were to walk up to a resident student and ask him or her what he or she dislikes the most at Post, here are the top five answers:
1.                        The bathrooms in the dorms (in need of renovation)
2.                        Internet in the dorms (consistent interruption that can last for days)
3.                        The dorms (mold in some of the buildings; and, electricity blackouts)
4.                        Food (lack of variety)
5.                        The School’s inability to minimize congestion at the food stops during common hour
The economic crisis in the country is severely affecting students and the ability to get loans; scholarships have not compensated for that because our endowment coffers are empty. President Steinberg said “a majority of the money is put into building because it is a better investment return” (Building what? I have just listed several areas in need of repairs which are not addressed. Regardless of these much-needed repairs, the school will be spending $4.6 million on a new stadium. Considering the prevailing circumstances, this is not too bad but it is the fact the school has apparently magically conjured up an additional $4.5 million for renaming the school. This is disrespectful towards students and faculty after administration has reiterated time and time again that they don’t have the money to address the issues we have consistently brought to their attention. Many decisions made by administration appear to have been made blindly and without being cognizant of the needs and desires of the majority of the school’s population. The faculty and the students are the backbone of the university; without them, the university cannot exist.  The administration’s actions towards the current student population is bound to have a negative effect on prospective students, and already enrollment is low.
A university’s reputation is not solely built on the back of public opinion or the publications that rank the schools. A good portion of it is based on word or mouth. If a student is extremely unhappy with the university they are attending and they find a vast amount of their peers have the same feeling they are less likely to recommend it to their high schools or tell their friends who are planning on attending college. Ioanna Panopouplos, former Post Biology Major, said “When people asked me if I enjoyed going to Post, I said I enjoyed the social aspect of it. I had fun with my friends but academically it wasn’t challenging enough for me. The name has nothing to do with my reason why I came here or left. I didn’t recommend Post to any of the students from my high school or my friends.”
This school’s administration is ineffectual at times. They push to make this campus more technologically advanced with Blackboard and iPads, but it is worthless if students aren’t able to get online to use the technology. How about spending some of that money on wireless internet throughout the dorms? We will probably be told that it cost more than that but there is a solution; be more aggressive with fundraising.  Healthcare Administration Senior Christine Pena responds to the news with, “Why change the name? It isn’t really a change at all. I think this school likes to waste money. It works so hard on the outer appearance and there are other things that need to be fixed, things students are constantly complaining about. I don’t think changing the name will do much for the school. The school makes up their brand by their actions and the quality of education.”
Outraged students are mad not so much about the idea, but at the cost of the name change. Farouk Houssein, a Political Science Major and Veteran, says  “In reality, those funds should be going towards improving things on campus or even towards making tuition more affordable to make the school more attractive to prospective students if they are so worried about their retention problem! The bureaucracy of this institution really needs to get its priorities straight before a lot of others, including myself, transfer out because they are robbing our pockets and bank accounts.“
Political Science Professor, Michael Soupios, had the following to say about the name change: “I am in favor of doing anything that will reposition this school. This is a kind of window dressing and I’m very suspect of it. I’m not sure it will work and in fact it begs the question where is this money coming from? As far as substance versus cosmetics, I would like to know why the money isn’t going into scholarships. Many faculty members share the skepticism of students. Our administration is confusing academia with Madison Avenue.” In terms of the Administration’s idea that a name change or rebranding of the institution will bring new students, Professor Soupios concurs with Ms. Panopoulos stating, “A lot of it is word of mouth. Students go back to high school and talk about their time here and negative responses cannot be erased.”
Our university’s President Dr. David Steinberg is falling under a lot of scrutiny from students and faculty. The national average for the length of time any one person is president of a university is about 8 years, according to the American Council on Education. Dr. Steinberg has been in office for twenty-five years. Professor Soupios gives him due and says “He chases down members of our Board of Trustees when they haven’t given him their minimum requirement of $25,000 to remain on the Board.” Dr. Steinberg has done more than his predecessor and did a lot during the beginning of his term. Events in the last few years have caused people to question Dr. Steinberg’s ability to do his job efficiently. “He has fallen off the wagon in the last ten years, he is comfortable; stepping down will mean he loses a package that allows him to live quite comfortably… The Board of Trustees has low expectations of him so they themselves have become complacent. They should be pushing each other. There is a lack of enthusiasm that is needed to raise money,” said Soupios again.
People are at the end of their rope and things need to change. Our administration heads need to remove themselves from the circle and look at the bigger picture. They must reprioritize and listen to the people who endure the day-to-day life and sometimes the burden of this university. Now that students and faculty are united on this issue and are joining the trend of protest, will we see administration put blinders on their eyes and wax in their ears, or will they stop and listen? Will they really listen and do some serious self-evaluation, because that is what needs to take place. It’s time to add substance to the existing image.

Well another year, another vote. As Election Day passes and positions are filled again, people are already looking ahead to next year’s election: the next Presidential election in 2012. It may be a little early to start saying who will come out victorious, but it is never too early to begin thinking about where you want your vote to go.
By now I’m sure someone is reading this and thinking, “Does my vote really matter?” The answer is, yes it does. Just in case anyone isn’t sure why the vote matters, here is a brief breakdown. Everyone over the age of 18 gets to vote for their favorite candidate. After everyone votes, each state tally’s their votes. This is called the Popular Vote. Now for argument’s sake let’s use the last election as an example. According to CNN, in New York 63% of the people voted for current President Obama, so he won the popular vote in New York. This number then goes into Congress. Based on how many members each state sends to Congress determines how many electoral votes they get. No state can have less than three since every state has to have two senators and one representative. New York has 29, California has the most with 54, and Vermont, Delaware, Montana, Wyoming, Alaska, and North and South Dakota all tie for the least amount with three. Depending on population this amount can change; in 2008, New York had 31 electoral votes. From here each state representative places their electoral vote based on the popular vote. So since 62.2% of people voted for Obama in 2008, the 31 representatives placed their votes all for president Obama. The first candidate with 270 electoral votes becomes the new President of the United States.
This is an extremely long, tiring, and agitating process, so who in the world wants to bother running with all the stress?  A lot of people, to answer the question, in fact far too many to list. First off, it is no national secret that President Obama will run again, but what are his odds this time around? According to a national poll done by the American Presidency Project, in January of 2009, 68% of Americans approved of Obama and as of November of this year only 42% approve of his policies. A 26% approval drop means he needs to put a little pep in his step for this next election. So you might ask, what are a few of his current policies he is pushing? Right now Obama is trying to cut back government spending, stabilize the middle class by creating jobs and cutting taxes, and helping small businesses stay alive with more governmental help. That are just a few of his home economic policies. Out in the mean world beyond our borders, the President is taking steps to encourage more democracy in places like Egypt and Libya, stretching better trade with places like South Korea, and his most recent and probably the biggest step, pulling any and all United States troops out of Iraq by the end of the year. This all sounds great, but obviously something isn’t right because of his 26% drop. Perhaps this is just because he needs more time to work, maybe it is all in process, after all Rome wasn’t built in a day and the economy wasn’t fixed in a night. It doesn’t help that the greedy rich don’t care who can’t afford to eat. So for now, let us all forget that 26% drop and look at what his second term may hold, which if all goes his way, might mean a fixed economy and a democratic world for all. That sounds fantastic, right? Well there are two sides to every story, and more than one candidate in every election. If the Republican Party has its way, President Obama will not be reelected in 2012, but can it produce a better candidate?
The Republicans need to find someone to run. This means that a whole bunch of different people will all fight for the one coveted spot, and only the best of them will have a chance to run nationally. Right now there are 16 people who have openly said they want the spot. Out of those 16, let’s look at the top three; Herman Cain, a business man from Georgia; once speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich; and the former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney. As of right now, national statistics say these three have the best shot of going head-to-head with Obama for that big oval office.
Herman Cain is up first. I’m going to ignore those sexual harassment charges from his past that he was asked about recently. I know they are there but I’d rather look at policy for now. According to his campaign website, Cain is a firm believer that the federal government has no right to pick which companies to bail out or give tax breaks to. This cuts out that horrific thought of favoritism. He also believes that workers rights should be left to unions and the federal government should be left out. And for all the non-business people he wants to cut taxes, which is always a crowd favorite, this sounds great, right? It will save a lot of money and help the little guy stay in business without that pesky favoritism issue. Now let us see his foreign policy. His website doesn’t give a clear plan of action but if you read it, you can tell what he wants. He wants to dump tons of money into the military for training, technology, and equipment. Current statistics show that the military uses billions of billions of dollars a year, if we poor more into that, then all that money you just saved is gone. Well no candidate is perfect right? Economically he has an idea, leave business to the business people, and government to the politicians, a decent idea.
So, what of this guy, Newt Gingrich? Newt Gingrich is by far no youngster coming in at age 68, which many may say is an issue, as they did with John McCain. But does age bring wisdom? Well, Newt has some similar ideas to that of Obama and Cain, cut taxes. Gingrich is highly in favor of cutting taxes and setting up laws that will permanently keep taxes at a set rate. He also wants to bring business back to America by giving tax cut incentives to industries that set up shop back here instead of outsourcing. This will bring back jobs, but when do you hit the point of too many incentives and breaks? Ok, foreign policy time. Gingrich has a very unique point of view; he basically wants to isolate the enemy from the rest of the world and defeat it. This cannot work and honestly, his view of the enemy is a bit too much for this writer, so I am going to end my bit on him here. If you want the specifics, feel free to visit his campaign website, newt.org, and find out for yourself.
Ok, our final candidate is Mitt Romney. Romney has a very detailed website that clearly states his purpose in our economicall- troubled country. Cut taxes (nothing new there), implement acts that will cut the federal budget by $20 billion, make it easier for unions to operate, and abolish the regulations making it harder to create jobs. Sounds great, right? However, it’s a bit repetitive. Romney brings another unique idea to the table, watch the world and avoid trouble before it comes to war. Romney wishes to involve America in many organizations worldwide and help keep the world at peace so that the costs of war aren’t an issue. His overall concept seems great but in order to do this Romney seems to have the idea that America needs to watch over everything at once, a concept that could go either way on the spectrum.
Well there it is, an extremely brief overview of what is to come. I say extremely brief because, well, there are literally dozens of parties who hope to run candidates and I only mentioned two. I also only mentioned a few of the candidates from those parties and I also highlighted from their policies, key points of thought that affect us most right now, especially the economical aspects. Every single party and every single candidate has a website. I strongly encourage you to view a few of them and get an idea of what else these candidates, and what some others, want to do. Four years is a long time and electing a president is no joke. It shapes what direction our country goes in, and what happens to us as a whole. Yes, your vote counts, so please use it wisely.

Q: A friend who really hurt me recently reached out looking to mend our friendship.  Do you think he/she deserves a second chance? – A. W.
This is a scenario I think everyone can relate to pretty easily.  Friends are the people that you let get the closest, know the most about you and the ones that you know, or at least assume, would never do anything to hurt you.  In fact, I’ve also recently had a friend who shattered my trust and our relationship, but has persistently tried to reconcile things.  While I’ve personally decided that things are beyond repair between my friend and I, that may not be the case for you.  But honestly, that’s something only you can know.
If you do decide that you’re willing to at least give this friend one more chance, here is what I recommend that you do.  Enter back into your friendship slowly and with a great sense of caution.  Remember, they have hurt you before, so what would stop them from doing so again?  That’s not to say that you should completely block them out and make any reconciliation impossible, because then there’s not much point.  Make sure that the first time you see this friend again you explain that the recovery might be slower than they’d like and that things might not be the same as they once were for a while.  Above all, always be comfortable with your choice.  If at any point you decide that making amends is something you’re not ready for, then say so.  After all, a second chance is not a promise that things will work out, but rather you’re just willing to try.
 
 
Q: I’ve gone out on a few dates with this guy, and I’ve really enjoyed our time together, but it’s getting to that point where a kiss is probably coming and I don’t think I really want to kiss him.  What should I do, suck it up and kiss him or tell him how I feel? – K. J.
This is a tricky one – you don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but on the same token, you also don’t want to lead this guy on.  If you’ve really liked spending time with him like you said, then maybe rather than dating him, suggest that the two of you would be better off as friends.  It may sound like the cliche option, but even though there is that chance he may not be so keen on this idea, it is also possible that he’s not feeling that spark either. It definitely beats letting him think that things will progress into something greater.  You might be surprised by his reaction and if this is the case, and it could turn out to be a great start to your friendship.  One day you might even be able to joke, “Remember when we tried to date? What were we thinking?!”
If a friendship is something that you’d be interested in with this guy, then make sure you handle that conversation with care.  Lead with a compliment, because let’s face it, no one wants to hear that they’ve done something wrong.  For instance if he’s a big comedian, tell him that you love his jokes and that he’s really kept you laughing these past few dates.  This way when you get to the “it’s not you, it’s me” part, and you can quickly add that you’d like it if the two of you could still try to have a friendship full of laughter instead.  There’s definitely no reason to think that you two can’t work as friends, but keep in mind that he could turn your request down.  With matters of the heart, there is never really any guarantee.

Harry’s Law
NBC
The legal comedy-drama starring Kathy Bates as Harriet “Harry” Korn entered its second season with an entire revamp of the series.
Harry, a recently fired patent lawyer, sees the good in people even when everything says they are guilty. She runs her office out of a shoe store with her associate Adam Branch (Nate Corddry), an attorney who accidentally hit her with his car. One can’t forget big boy Thomas “Tommy” Jefferson (Christopher McDonald), Harry’s attorney friend who is known for his commercials and big performance he puts on for each trial. In each episode, someone in need from the impoverished neighborhood where Harry set up shop is helped in a very touching way.
This season saw two prominent characters step into the shadows. McDonald’s character has been upgraded to series regular. To offset the balance, Oliver Richard (Mark Valley), an attorney that worked at the firm that fired Harry, and Cassie Reynolds (Karen Olivo), a lawyer Harry hires after expanding, join the firm which is now located upstairs and out of the quaint shoe store. Tommy relocated his office to share in Harry’s new space. So far, Harry has not defended someone from the neighborhood. The emphasis of the hood seems to have disappeared. The new atmosphere and shift in clientele reminds me of ABC’s “The Whole Truth” which aired last year. That show was cancelled after six episodes. The charm of the original 13 episode season has followed its characters into the shadows but Harry is still Harry. My ruling, a B-.

Marisa de los Santos
A truly heart-warming and beautiful story, “Love Walked In” is written so delicately and simply that you will not want to put this novel down. It’s a perfect rainy day read because you won’t want to put it down until you are finished. Marisa De Los Santos will capture your heart with her delicate and simple words, which describe love in such an alluring way.
The novel tells the tale of Cornelia Brown, a twenty-something year old who manages a coffee shop in Philadelphia. When a man named Martin Grace, who looks astonishingly like Cary Grant, walks in, he changes her life forever. Typically, you would expect that they fall in love and live happily ever after. However, Martin is merely a connecting character to someone else that Cornelia meets.
His eleven year-old daughter, Clare, whose life he has not been involved with, suddenly comes back into the picture. Although Cornelia realizes she is more in love with the idea of Martin rather than the person he is, she also sees that the love she has developed for his daughter is one that is unexplainable. Clare’s mother is struggling with emotional problems and has, therefore, abandoned her daughter, so Cornelia is left to love, comfort, and play the role of mother to her.
As the plot develops, we are introduced to more characters from Cornelia’s past, such as her family and her childhood friend and brother-in-law Teo. Relationships develop, strengthen, and grow in ways that were unforeseen to Cornelia. All of this has happened because a man by the name of Martin Grace walked into her coffee shop a few months prior.
An incredibly touching story about finding your hearts desire and never letting it go. We learn that, sometimes, love comes in forms we would have never expected. Santos’s use of comparisons to classic films gives the novel a nostalgic and romantic feeling that is so easy to relate to. Definitely a “chic-lit,” but if you adore a good love story that will make you both laugh and cry, then this is it! The best part is that there is a follow up book to this novel called “Belong to Me”. Read next week’s issue for a review on that.

This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films, and whenever I ask people about it, they don’t seem to know too much about it. The plot revolves around a boy named Walter, who is dropped off by his mother to live with his uncles in Texas for the summer. From the beginning of the movie it becomes apparent that the mother wants her son to find out about the alleged millions that they have hidden on their property. The uncles, Hub and Garth, aren’t your normal everyday relatives either. From buying a lion, to Hub beating up four guys in a bar brawl, to shooting at traveling salesmen, there isn’t a dull moment. However, there is an amazing back story as to how they became so rich in the first place. During the movie, Garth tells Walter of their adventures in Africa and Hub falling in love with a princess as well as having assassins trying to kill him at every turn.
However, everyone else says that the uncles were bank robbers and stole all the money, so the whole movie is discovering which story is true. If you want to know, well, you’ll have to watch the whole movie. This movie is a comedy, a drama, and a heartwarming film about a boy who feels no love from his mother and finds happiness from two unlikely relatives.
I highly recommend this film; it’s just good fun, and the back stories of the uncles are great and action packed. My favorite part is the bar scene were Uncle Hub beats the hell out of four teenage boys, and Hub has no weapons, while they all have knives. Hub is just awesome in every way. Pick up a copy and watch it for yourself; its great!

  The C.W. Post football team began the season 0-3. Sophomore running back Jeff Mack ran for 51 yards in the three losses, and freshman quarterback Steven Laurino was struggling to learn the offense.  Since then, Mack and Laurino have been the cornerstones of the Pioneers’ offense, leading the team to victories in four of five games after the Pioneers beat Cheyney 42-27 on Saturday, November 5th, 2011.
Steven Laurino threw for 156 yards and four touchdowns, and Mack did his part, rushing for 164 yards and a touchdown of his own. Post kicked off the scoring with a 21-yard pass from Laurino to junior wide receiver Ryan Derham.
Throughout most of the first half, the Cheyney Wolves kept themselves in the game. Just three minutes after Laurino connected with Derham, the Wolves responded with a score of their own. Quarterback Chris Anderson rushed the ball into the end zone for a five-yard score to tie the game.
Joe Botti gave the Pioneers the lead right back with a 27-yard catch to give the Pioneers a 14-7 lead. But, again, the Wolves countered back with another Anderson rushing touchdown, but a missed PAT gave Post a 14-13 lead.
The Pioneers managed to increase their lead right before halftime when Laurino found Kyle Hardy for a 38-yard touchdown to increase the C.W. Post lead to 21-13.
In the second half, the Pioneers dominated the ball, especially in the third quarter when they kept the Wolves off the board completely.  Mack ignited the scoring with a 57-yard rush, and later in the quarter, fellow running back Anthony Brunetti caught a four-yard dump off from Laurino to give the Pioneers a 35-13 lead.
In the fourth quarter, the Wolves got two more scores on the board. The first was a 13-yard pass from Anderson to wide out Prince Stewart.  Laurino followed up with a 56-yard rush into the end zone for the Pioneers final score.
Before the game was over, Anderson also found Wasserleben with a 10-yard touchdown pass to make the final score 42-27 in favor of the home team.
Laurino finished the day with 74 rushing yards to go along with his 156 passing yards. Of Laurino’s ten completions, he managed to hook up with seven different receivers.
Linebacker Anton Rukaj led the Pioneers in tackles with 10; Ronnie Modik intercepted a pass, and Kadeem Huggins racked up 2.5 sacks in the Pioneers’ victory.
With the win, the Pioneers guaranteed themselves a finish above .500 this season and will look for their seventh win to end the season Saturday, November 12th, when they face Slippery Rock at noon for the final game of the season.

The C.W. Post women’s volleyball team is on a five-game winning streak. The team has not lost a game since its 2-3 loss to N.Y.I.T. on October 25th. Their overall record is an impressive 9-3 since snapping a four-game losing streak on October 11th with a 3-2 win over Queens College.
The team’s most recent victory came on Thursday, November 3rd, with a 3-2 win over Queens College again. The match took place at the Pratt Recreation Center and was played in honor of the team’s two seniors, Andrea Nolan and Laura Garbarino.
The Pioneers took control of the match early when, down 21-23, they ignited a 5-1 run to come from behind and take the lead 1-0. A .290 hitting percentage helped the team continue its success into the second set, as the Pioneers made 12 kills to open the gap to 2-0. Sophomore setter Stephanie Schwarz contributed 11 assists in the set that the Pioneers won 25-19.
What looked like an easy victory became much more competitive in the third set. Six attacking errors and a hitting percentage of only .053 on the side of the Pioneers helped the Knights win the set 17-25 – their largest lead in the set. The team appeared to regain its control in the fourth set, but the Knights were able to squeak out the win with a solid finish and 15 kills.
Down 14-12 in the fifth and final set, the Pioneers converted a 4-0 run to capture the momentum and take the match.
The conference win improved the Pioneers’ record to 16-14 overall and 7-6 in the East Coast Conference, while dropping the Knights to 8-18, 3-10 in the ECC. The team’s final regular-season game will take place on Tuesday, November 8th, on the road against Molloy College at 7 p.m.

On Sunday, November 6th, the C.W. Post men’s basketball team traveled to face the University of Connecticut Huskies, a tough task, as UConn is the defending Division I NCAA Champions. In their second and final exhibition game of the season, the Pioneers lost to the Huskies by a score of 91-61.
Although the pace on offense was slow at the beginning of the game for both squads, the Huskies eventually found their rhythm as their lead at the half was 54-21. UConn sophomore forward Jeremy Lamb was silky smooth from the field as he shot 10-14 with 23 points, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. Lamb was dangerous from both inside and beyond the arc as he also had a couple of three pointers to give the Pioneers a ton of trouble.
On Sunday, the Huskies proved why they are ranked fourth in the preseason list of Division I college basketball programs in the country. Their offense didn’t only rely on Lamb. The Huskies had a multitude of options, including the top-recruit in the country: 6’11”, 270 pound center, Andre Drummond. He has already been declared the Big East Preseason Rookie of the Year and has been discussed as a possible top pick in the NBA Draft.  This freshman has enormous size and talent and displayed it against the Pioneers as he had a double-double, scoring 16 points on 8-10 shooting to go along with 10 boards and three blocked shots. The crowd at the XL Center went wild on a couple of his nasty, vicious dunks, most notably on a breakaway, where Huskies’ sophomore point guard Shabazz Napier threw a pass off the backboard for Drummond to slam home as the crowd erupted.
There was little the Pioneers could do to stop the defending champs, as the Huskies had an abundance of something you just can’t teach: height. The Pioneers’ tallest players are sophomore forwards Vaughn Allen and Amir Turif, each standing at 6’6”. On the other hand, the Huskies had six players who saw floor time and stood at at least 6’8”.  Not to mention, some of these tall players, such as freshman forward DeAndre Daniels, could also shoot from beyond the arc.
Allen led the Pioneers with 14 points while chipping in for five rebounds. The backcourt for the Pioneers had a tough time getting going on offense, as senior guard Stefan Bonneau finished with 11 points, shooting 4-19 from the field. After an impressive showing against Saint John’s University on October 25th, scoring 28 points, Bonneau’s first bucket in this contest came with just over two minutes remaining in the first half of play.  Junior guard Tobin Carberry also struggled from the floor, going 3-18 scoring 10 points, while securing seven rebounds.
The Huskies were a tough test for the Pioneers. The Huskies’ size made it difficult on both sides of the ball for the Pioneers. The Huskies shot just under 60% from the field for the game, boasting five players in double-digit scoring, while the Pioneers shot 29%.  Another area where the Pioneers could not find a rhythm in was the three-point shot. The Pioneers were 4-19 (21%) from beyond the arc, while UConn was an impressive 7-12 (58%) for three.
However, the Pioneers did improve their play after the first half of play. Adjustments seemed to be made as the Pioneers outscored the Huskies 40-37 in the second half.  Despite being severely undersized in comparison to UConn, the Pioneers battled and created 23 points off turnovers and 18 second-chance points.
The Pioneers begin their regular season on Saturday, November 11th, at 6 p.m., as they travel to face Saint Anselm College for the Saint Rose Tip-Off Tournament in Albany, New York.

Freshman forward Eivind Austboe was extremely frustrated after losing the East Coast Conference final on Friday, November 4th, saying the team played awfully. The Pioneers ended their ECC season with a 1-0 loss to N.Y.I.T., in what might have been their last game in 2011.
After an overall outstanding season, with a 16-1-1 record prior to the final, the C.W. Post men’s soccer team has changed historical records this year. When the All-Conference Awards were announced early on November 4th, the Pioneers took home four out of five of the top awards, which were decided by the votes of the league’s coaches.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg was announced Coach of the Year; sophomore Cemil Turan was named the Offensive Player of the Year; freshman Eivind Austboe received the Rookie of the Year, and sophomore Marco Jorgensen was honored as Goalkeeper of the Year. Both Turan and Jorgensen were named to the All-Conference First Team along with C.W. Post junior midfielder Andreas Olson, sophomore back Leron Haywood, and sophomore captain Eirik Bjoernoe.
After a 1-0 win against Queen College in the semifinal on November 2nd, C.W. Post advanced to the final. When sophomore forward Cemil Turan picked up a pass from junior midfielder Andreas Olson and scored from a short distance in the first half, the game was settled. Queens fought back and raced to score with several double and triple chances that were avoided after a good performance by sophomore goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen. In a game that could have easily ended with the opposite result, the Pioneers managed to keep the goal clean.
“Clean sheet and one goal – that’s all we need. Hopefully, we’re going to improve our level in the next game though,” said Jorgensen. His wish was not granted in the following match.
Ready to secure their second trophy this season, the Pioneers entered their home field Friday in front of a mixed crowd of spectators coming to support C.W. Post and neighbor school N.Y.I.T. After a draw (2-2) in the regular season, it was time to settle the score in the East Coast Conference Championship Final.
With the wind as a third opponent knocking down most of the high air balls, it became a battle on the midfield. In a non-productive game, neither of the teams succeeded in producing chances or effective attacks, and it was a lot of back-and-forth play.
N.Y.I.T. got an early goal and took a 1-0 lead in the beginning of the first half. Being down by one has been a habit of the Pioneers during the season but has usually been an awakener leading to pressure, goals and wins. Not this time. The Bears wiped off all the Pioneers attempts to score with smothering defensive play.
Neither team plays nor individual performances succeeded for the Pioneers, and the 90 minutes went by without any major chances. Freshman forward, and highest-scoring Pioneer this season, Eivind Austboe was almost invisible on the field along with Olson, who did not serve the benefit of his speedy runs. Without successful attacks from Turan, Austboe nor Olson, nor from the rest of the squad, no goals were scored, and the N.Y.I.T. supporters could applaud their team with a final victory.
“One of our worst games this season,” said Austboe. “I can’t really say what went wrong; I am still trying to understand what actually happened.” The Pioneers suffered their second loss this year, leaving them with a 16-2-1 record. Monday night, the NCAA regional selection will decide if the Pioneers get to continue their season with NCAA East Regional action.
