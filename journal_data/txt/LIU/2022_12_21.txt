The 2022 Major League Baseball season has concluded. This immediately leads into the MLB offseason, which brings about all the free agent signings, trades and any other roster moves made by every major league club. 
The Yankees and Mets have both been at the forefront of much of the coverage surrounding offseason news. After breaking the American League home run record and being named AL MVP, Yankees superstar Aaron Judge became a free agent following his first six seasons in pinstripes. 
On Wednesday, Dec. 7, it was announced the Yankees and Aaron Judge agreed to a 9-year deal worth $360 million. 
This is the third largest contract in baseball history, only trailing extensions given to Mike Trout and Mookie Betts. It is also the largest deal ever for a free agent. 
Just one night prior, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Aaron Judge was headed to the San Francisco Giants, but immediately corrected himself after jumping the alert. 
After the announcement of Judge returning to the Bronx, it was confirmed Aaron Judge turned down a 10-year deal from the San Diego Padres worth $400 million. The Average annual value (AAV) from the two offers is the same at $40 million. However, Judge would have received an extra year had he accepted the Padres’ offer. 
Senior digital art & design major Anthony Hines confirms resigning Aaron Judge was the Yankees’ top need this off-season. 
“One of the Yankees’ top priorities, much like how it was of the utmost importance, was to re-sign Judge,” he said. “The face of your franchise and the AL MVP had to be back in the Bronx, especially after he hit 62 home runs and broke the American League home run record.”
Hines believes Judge should be named captain to secure his legacy as a career Yankee.
“I would expect the Yanks to give Judge the captaincy. They made the commitment, he’s a Yankee for life, now let’s give him that honor,” he said.
Hines is happy with the acquisitions the Yankees have made so far but would love a couple more pieces to be brought in. 
Besides Tommy Kahnle, the Yankees have brought back Anthony Rizzo and Judge. I wouldn’t be surprised if we land Carlos Rodon to pair him well with Gerrit Cole in our rotation,” he said. “I wanna say we’ll make a sneaky run at Dansby Swanson. I just have that feeling.”
On the other side of the Whitestone Bridge, the Mets have been making many acquisitions as the third offseason of Steve Cohen’s ownership continues to bring high hopes to fans. 
Despite two-time CY Award Winner Jacob Degrom leaving in free agency, signing a 5-year, $185 million contract with the Texas Rangers, the Mets quickly looked for other pitching options. 
The Mets locked up 17-year veteran and reigning AL CY Young Award winner Justin Verlander to a 2-year deal worth $86,666,666, with a vesting option worth $35 million in 2025, pending Verlander pitches 140 innings in 2024. 
This is similar to the 3-year, $130 million deal the Mets agreed to with Max Scherzer last offseason. Currently, the Mets have both Scherzer and Verlander for the next two years, each making $43,333,333. With Scherzer now 38 years old, and Verlander heading into his age 40 season, it is clear the Mets will try and get the final productive years out of the veteran starters. 
The Mets also signed Japanese phenom Kodai Senga to a 5-year, $75 million deal following his 11-year career in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. 
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell had high expectations for the Mets’ off-season. 
“My top priorities were retaining our guys, especially Edwin Diaz, Brandon Nimmo and DeGrom, while also looking for hitters and bullpen help,” he said. 
Following his incredible 2022 campaign, which featured 32 saves and a 1.31 ERA, the Mets brought back their closer Diaz to a 5-year, $102 million deal with a 6th-year club option. 
Campbell believes it was crucial for the Mets to make the signings to keep their pitching at a top-tier level. 
“It was huge to get Verlander and Senga. After DeGrom and Walker left, I wasn’t sure where we would pivot to, but Steve Cohen and Billy Eppler were able to go all out to win over some of the best pitchers on the market,” he said. “Verlander may be older, but he is still one of the premier pitchers in the game, and Senga has superstar potential. Those two moves were very important after losing DeGrom and Walker.”
The Mets also re-signed outfielder Brandon Nimmo to an 8-year, $162 million deal following his seven seasons in a Mets uniform. Campbell believes bringing back a home-grown talent was a great move. 
“Nimmo has always been an important player on this team. He may not be a superstar, but the type of way he plays is very unique. He is a very consistent and disciplined hitter, and he is always reliable in the outfield,” he said. “He’s always the hardest worker, and you can see how much he loves being a Met. He is a fan favorite, and I think he can play a crucial role in this team’s pursuit of a championship.”
Campbell has high hopes for the Mets’ future following their moves so far. 
“I am very happy with what has been done thus far. I still think they need another big bat or two and a few more bullpen arms, but overall I am pleased and very excited for the 2023 season and beyond,” he said.

It’s fall 2022 on the Post campus, and the social calendar is back in full swing. Oftentimes during common hours in Hillwood Commons, campus life is electrified across many different extracurriculars as student organizations have sign-ups, activities, and lots of fundraising tables. Greek life, a major part of the LIU student community, is a large part of that fundraising. 
“In the grand scheme of things, being part of a sorority revolves around sisterhood, of course, but also within cultivating this said sisterhood through philanthropy and giving back to those who need it,” senior broadcasting major and acting Vice President of Sigma Delta Tau, Kerry Cullen, said. 
Alongside the passion for helping others, Cullen disclosed some more details behind Greek life organizations and their constant active fundraising on campus.
“Organizations are responsible for generating the funds for their chapter. Fundraising for the chapter is a great way of generating these funds that don’t come directly from our own bank account and allow us more flexible spending,” she said. “And finally, in order to remain an organization and to be permitted to remain on campus, each Greek organization must also meet a set of University standards called Pillars of Excellence- which often revolves around fundraising.”
Throughout the semester, the sister of Sigma Delta Tau have had busy social calendars in part to their many fundraising efforts on and off the Post campus. In light of these efforts, many of the campus communities have been active benefactors within the success rates that are credited to some of the sisters favorite events. 
“All semester long, we [SDT] host fun and interactive events for the Post community.” senior criminal justice major and SDT Vice President of financing, Jillian Hugh, said. “One of my personal favorites and probably our biggest has to be the annual Fall Fest event that’s held every October which specifically raises money towards one of our philanthropies, Jewish Women International (JWI).”
Hugh went on to describe SDT’s Fall Fest. 
“This year, we generated nearly $900 to donate within the [Fall Fest] activities we hosted which included carnival-style games, inflatable obstacle courses, and so many other fun activities like ring tosses, paint a pumpkin and more. Within the event, you can also see many other organizations attending in efforts to show support and Greek unity on campus.” 
Greek organizations have many responsibilities and engagements they must participate in while being active members. Just as any other team or club on campus must, fundraising allows Greek organizations the access and ability to ways that they can spread their overall messages of support and charity. 
“During my time in Sigma Delta Tau, we’ve had several successful fundraisers that we all look forward to planning and participating in year to year. It’s part of the reason why we fundraise so often and plan these every year– because we want to constantly support our philanthropies throughout the semester,” Hugh said. 
As proactive pillars of charity at Post, the sisters of SDT often table in Hillwood Commons to raise money for their philanthropies. The organization typically sells baked goods, holds raffles and promotes their upcoming events at their tables. 
“We [SDT] work directly with the Promise office to organize these fundraisers to get approval and assistance because every organization has an extensive portfolio of philanthropies and general goals within their semesterly calendar,” Cullen said.
Overall, SDT enjoys fundraising for charities and many sisters consider it one of the best aspects of their organization. 
 “We love coming together towards a greater cause; in efforts to spread love, support, and to try and make the community a better place,” Hugh concluded.

Taylor Swift has officially announced her new tour, titled The Eras Tour. The tour is being promoted as a celebration of her career thus far with artwork showcasing a picture of her from each of her eras.
  With Swift being one of the biggest names in the industry at the moment, it is no secret that getting tickets to the tour was going to be difficult. What nobody expected, was the mess that ensued during her presale.
  Taylor Swift is known to have a close relationship with her fans, and as such, she wanted to make sure that her Swifties were the first to get tickets. She has previously completed a similar presale back in 2017 when she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour.
  To obtain a presale code for the Reputation Stadium Tour, Swifties were tasked with various tasks, such as watching a music video, purchasing merchandise, streaming the songs and other little tasks that would separate the casual fans with those who are hardcore. The hardcore fans were rewarded with a presale code, and therefore were able to obtain their tickets without worrying about scalpers.
  In 2019, after Swift released her album Lover, she decided to embark on a tour once again titled Loverfest. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the tour was inevitably canceled. Fans who held tickets to this event were promised first access to tickets for a future tour. However, this did not prove to be true.
  When The Eras Tour was announced to have presale to the fans once again, Swifties were extremely happy to be able to see their favorite singer live once again. Powered by Ticketmaster, it seemed as though everything was looking good for Swifties. However, it quickly became a disaster.
  Anyone was able to apply for presale by filling out a brief profile on Taylor Swift’s verified fan page. However, fans had to wait upward of an hour to even get access to it; the first red flag.
  Second, Swift’s promotional team, Taylor Nation, decided to email those who are subscribed to Swift’s newsletter saying that they would be boosting their spot in line to receive a code. This proved to be nothing more than false hope.
  Both of these things coupled with those who missed out on Loverfest made it virtually impossible for Ticketmaster to truly see who was deserving of getting a code. They sent out codes to fans in waves, ending at around 12 a.m., before the presale launched. 
Due to the extreme demand, those who believed they were a shoe-in, were eagerly waiting for nothing.
  “I held General Admission tickets to Loverfest and although I understand why it was canceled, I was really hoping to get similar tickets to The Eras Tour, but here I am still waiting for general admission sales,” junior business administration major Rebecca Margolin said.
The day for presale had finally arrived, and those with codes were ready to go at 10 a.m. sharp. The volume of visitors to the Ticketmaster website was unprecedented. According to Ticketmaster, 1.5 million codes were distributed, but over 14 million visitors went to the site for the presale.
  This led to the site being extremely slow. And only half an hour into the sale, Ticketmaster paused all sales until they were able to “control the demand.”
  Fans were incredibly angry as they were stuck at a standstill to what looked like no end. Sales were paused for over an hour and even when the line began to move again, it took a similar amount of time to even access what was left of the tickets.
  “I thought that the sale was going to be quick, hence the point of a presale. I missed out on my entire morning just waiting for the screen to move when it never did,” junior education major Erin Carlin said.
  When fans finally got into their show of choice, tickets were virtually gone already. This made everyone, even those who got their tickets, furious because they felt like they had to fight for their lives. Swift was accused of price gouging, even though days prior she said that she would not.
  “When I finally got my tickets, I honestly just blacked out and bought whatever I saw available. Little did I know, I was purchasing a VIP package that I did not [want], all I wanted to do was get the seat,” Carlin stated.
  Some fans were not as lucky as they went into their venue to only see a gray screen with nothing available. 
“I went in hopeful for a code but after looking at this disaster, I will admit I was relieved that I did not have to suffer the way everyone else did,” Margolin said.
  Swift remained quiet on the situation for a few days before coming out with a statement on her Instagram basically saying that she was upset at Ticketmaster for not delivering on their promise to not only her, but her fans as well.
  She said that she had no choice but to go through Ticketmaster for sales due to their partnership with Live Nation, a company that dictates virtually all live venues in the world and who would be able to book them.
  Fans were demanding their service fees get refunded because they were not given the smooth ticket purchase process they were promised. The disaster made headlines as Ticketmaster fearlessly tried to defend themselves. 
Chairman of Live Nation Entertainment, Greg Maffei, said in an interview that Swift’s popularity is the cause of issues.
  “The reality is, Taylor Swift hasn’t been on the road for three or four years and that’s caused a huge issue,” Maffei said. “We could’ve filled 900 stadiums.”
  Ticketmaster had planned to have general sales the Friday after presale. But after the backlash revealing the shortcomings of their site, it was inevitably canceled.
“It makes sense as to why it was canceled. But at the same time, all I want to do is see Taylor Swift and I don’t know why it is so impossible to get these tickets when it was never an issue in the past,” Margolin said.
  Presently, the presale disaster has been brought up to Congress where an antitrust case is being formed. Questions are being raised about Ticketmaster being a monopoly. As of right now, general sale for The Eras Tour has yet to take place, with no word from Swift or Ticketmaster.

Finals week is in full swing on the Post campus, and tensions are high among students preparing for midterms. With stress being a common theme, a change made to library policy post-pandemic has only upped the pressure felt around campus. 
Like most departments at Post, there were various budget cuts and layoffs as a result of the pandemic. The B. Davis Schwartz Library was no exception to this, as they laid off two full-time librarians, along with a few adjuncts. This isn’t all, however, as the “budget students,” students who were paid through the library’s budget, were removed. 
Today, outside of Heather Hesse, who has worked for 17 years specializing in archives and special collections, and Anna Giuga, who has worked for 20 years primarily for the Dean, the staff is limited and heavily reliant upon federal work-study students. 
Due to this limited staff, various modifications were made to the library, none of which were felt more by students than the end of the extended hours during finals week. 
Prior to the pandemic, the B. Davis Schwartz Library was open 24/7 for students during the last week, which many students took full advantage of. Reportedly feeling more productive and prepared to go into their final exam schedule, students utilized every level, every night, using the facilities to their full extent. 
With that luxury being taken away, students have felt this loss now more than ever. 
“We had one student last night complaining about the hours. I had to explain to them that it is beyond our control and that I would like to have the library open 24/7 once again,” Anna Giuga said. 
That one student was not alone, as many have expressed their concern about the lack of availability. 
“It’s extremely frustrating that there’s already so much pressure and stress around finals and now there’s the added stress of the library closing– let alone as early as 10pm.,” junior veterinary school student Carly Raspante said.
Giuga understands the students’ concerns, as she has worked for the library for over two decades, and has seen first-hand how vital the library is for students. In her time at B. Davis Schwartz, she has seen the department shrink, and the changes to the hours are just one of many. Former offices, work centers, and upstairs facilities have all been altered or removed, a trend that she does not foresee changing. 
“The problem is that we do not have the people to work these overnight shifts,” Giuga explained. “Work study students can only work 17 hours a week. When I asked if anyone could work until 12 p.m. to extend our hours, we only had one response and it was a ‘no’… I would love to keep the library open because it is so important for students, but [Heather and I] can’t work 24/7.”
As of writing, the library’s hours were extended by just one hour from Monday, Dec. 12 to Monday, Dec. 19, with the library closing at 11 p.m.. Junior veterinary school student Bailed Decker thinks that this has become an obstacle for many students. 
“In general, this makes life for students so much harder- especially for students that can’t focus at home or in their dorms,” Decker said. “We need somewhere quiet to study and get our work done, where are we supposed to do that after 10 p.m.?”
This is a problem that Decker has dealt with personally, as she has had to change her schedule in order to have adequate time to study at the library. 
“The library having limited time to study has 100 percent added to my already existing stress level. It’s been extremely detrimental to my mental health and stress levels as a student … I have to pre-plan and ration every second of my day, just to ensure I have enough time to study before they start asking students to leave our campus library,” Decker said.
Along with the additional stresses and pressures that come with the limited library hours, many students chose to point out the financial component of being a student at Post as well. Paying a significant tuition, students expect the services that are expected to come with it. 
“It’s not only frustrating but so confusing that we pay nearly 60k in tuition
each year and don’t even have a library to study in during our finals,” Raspante said. “We pay a lot of money for buildings and services that the students can’t even use when they have to— and now we’re actively getting kicked out of our library during finals.”
While this issue is outside of Giuga’s control, she offers a solution that could make 24/7 availability possible once again. 
“I have a lot of international students that would like to work here, but they do not qualify for federal work-study,” she explained. “If administration allowed for budget students again, we could add to our staff and possibly extend our hours, because students need this space.”

Ranked one of the best business schools by the Princeton Review, many Post students in the business program study an array of topics including accounting, finance, economics, management and entrepreneurship. Although it’s not currently offered as a major, entrepreneurship courses study the path of starting and operating a business. It helps individuals become independent and use their creativity to invent something new. Some of the most anticipated entrepreneurship courses are taught by professor Daniel Klein, an LIU alum and the CEO of Sage Marketing.
“The thing about my connection with LIU, I’m a second generation professor at this university,” Klein said. “So my dad taught here for 52 years, and so as a little kid, I grew up on this campus visiting him. I went to school here, undergraduate, and now I’m back on campus, and able to teach, which is just huge. So my dad, his name was Stanley Klein. He had a stroke three years ago, and so he had to retire.” 
Klein didn’t begin teaching until a sudden event happened, which led him to his first teaching experience.
“ [My father] had his stroke the day before I gave my first lecture,” Klein said. “Teaching, for me, just kind of happened by accident. I was asked to guest lecture, and I did that and I loved it. Then, I was asked to teach a class and that’s how I became a professor here. My first class was a summer program, that was one of the high school summer programs on campus because he had a stroke in the summer. After I did that, I taught my first class in the fall which was ENT-17.”
Students who took Klein’s classes speak about the experiences in his ENT-17 class.
“Dan was super energetic and overwhelmingly positive about everything. It motivates everyone around him to excel and he creates an environment that makes other people happy and optimistic,” sophomore finance major Ailer Thomas said. “I learned a lot about mindset and the importance of mindset. The class was from an academic workload standpoint, a very easy class; but from a different aspect, it was a very challenging class because it forced you to think about yourself and think about how you would respond to situations and it challenged you to react and work in a real environment to understand yourself. It’s one of the most valuable classes I’ve taken because we did simulations and DISC profiling to help you understand yourself and how you work with other people so that you can work with other people better moving forward.”
Apart from being a professor, Klein also owns a multitude of companies all based on the Post campus for over five years. 
“All of our companies start with the word Sage. It’s Sage Marketing, Sage Advisors, Sage Coaching and Sage Staffing,” Klein said. “Sage has two meanings, there’s sage advice, and sage wisdom. Sage is also a medicinal herb. They cook with it and they use it in some holistic medicines. So it’s got a very nice feeling to it. We’ve been on campus for five years and it’s been wonderful. I work with the students, which I love. Funny story, I moved my business here because my dad wouldn’t retire and I didn’t want him to drive. So I relocated my office here from Westchester. And then I would drive my dad to campus to teach his classes. Then after he had his stroke, I just stayed here because I liked it so much.”
Every company has a beginning, an inspiration, a goal or dream that one day will hope to become a reality. 
“I always wanted to own my own company. I worked on Wall Street for over 20 years at major companies, and I’ve always been entrepreneurial,” Klein said. “When I went to school here, we didn’t have the resources that you all have… I kind of learned from trying it on my own and making mistakes on my own.”
However, that’s not the only thing Klein does with his time. He also runs his own entrepreneurship podcast called Andiamo.
“I had some student interns for the summer, Isabella and Justin, [that] had the idea to do a podcast,” Klein said. “We decided it would be a good idea to focus on some of the topics we focus on in my entrepreneurship class, and broaden it out to make it available for anyone — Isabella and I co-host the podcast. I’m 51, she’s 21, we’re two very different generations. She asks great questions and it’s a great way to dive into if someone wants to start a business or learn how to grow a business or learn how to run a business, there’s not a whole lot of places that they can go to learn that information. We wanted to make that information accessible to anyone and offer our guidance on how to help people.”
After teaching ENT-17, he also began teaching another class, ENT-61 — Entrepreneurship in Management. 
“The goal of this class is to be able to give students real world exposure to business and give them an unfiltered view of what it’s like to run a business,” Klein said. “We do that through actually engaging with live companies — one CEO came in and the students presented their ideas for her business. We also had Deborah Solomon as a guest speaker who is a professional networker and entrepreneur. This gives students an unfiltered view of any of my businesses to see what parts they might like or might want to go into as a profession. The thing that makes experiential learning unique is that it doesn’t always happen in a classroom. I have to allow all of them to make mistakes, and I can’t teach that. It’s not bad to make a mistake, it’s how you recover when you make a mistake.”
Students in his ENT-61 class are grateful for the experience they are able to receive.
“This class has been an incredible experience,” Thomas said. “The entire class is just an internship with Dan at his company. The opportunities that he’s provided to the students, including myself, have been absolutely phenomenal. From incorporating us at all levels of his business, giving us access to his proprietary system, trusting the students enough to put his own personal money behind our work; and he’s okay if we fail. He’s letting us learn at his expense and that’s really, really incredible that he would make that sacrifice for us.”
Many learn from past mistakes and experiences, and it may become a vital lesson in life if applied correctly.
“One lesson I learned is that it is never too late to learn new skills,” Klein said. “I think I’m a lifelong learner and I apply that in my own company by being able to put my ego to the side and learn a skill that can help my business or help me professionally. About a year ago we pivoted our business because we saw that was the direction that our industry was going in. So I had to create a whole new system. If we didn’t do that, I don’t think we would be as successful as we are now. Do not shy away from learning something new.”
Professors want their students to excel in their studies and career. They will often try to give valuable lessons and advice in and out of the classroom.
“Dan has taught me a lot about the importance of time management,” Thomas said. “He’s also taught me about my DISC profile and how I interact with people and learning that has allowed me to accelerate my career opportunities and my personal opportunities. I, in no small part, credit Dan for helping me win my vice presidential election for the post student government.”
Entrepreneurship is all about experience and learning. Experiential learning is one great way to learn new skills. 
“He [Klein] believes that experience is the best when learning,” Thomas said. “Instead of sitting down and telling us what to do, he helps us to figure out how to do it for ourselves, which adds in our own personal sense of achievement and accomplishment, which makes us personally vested in the work that we’re doing and in our learning.”

China is one of the countries that is strictly regulated for COVID 19, and they have a Zero Covid policy to limit behavior. However, recent actions caused a huge protest against the Zero Covid policy in China. 
It is extremely unusual for protests against the government to occur in various parts of China. In the protest, many people attended to seek freedom. In Shanghai, which is the biggest city in China, protests were held on both Nov. 26 and 27, with protesters being seized by police. 
Many protests were also held at colleges and other institutions throughout China. According to the Chinese government, this is the fifth consecutive day with a record number of COVID cases cases, so it will be interesting to see how the Chinese government responds to the Zero Covid policy.
Many police officers and police vehicles were deployed in central Beijing, where hundreds of people gathered to protest. Near the location where the protest took place is the U.S. Embassy, where people usually take a walk. However, on that day the protest took place, the atmosphere was completely different from usual. 
In addition, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) issued a statement saying that a correspondent covering the protests in Shanghai was temporarily detained for several hours. The correspondent claims that he was beaten and kicked by police officers, and he blames the authorities for the incident.
Most people who attended the protest were young people. Then, they stated that the government was silencing the words and actions of the citizens, and they protested that and held up white papers to show their protest.
“This protest that happened in China is something that I believe should have happened. As the people who participated in the protest said, in other countries, restrictions against Covid have been eased and the symptoms of Covid are less severe than before. So I don’t think it is necessary to restrict it as strictly as in China,” senior Western Oregon University communication major Hibiki Ouchi said.
Also, senior University of Hawaii at Hilo business management Erick Shinjo commented.
“Recently, the number of infected people in China is increasing. The government has implemented the Zero Covid Policy as a countermeasure, but I do not think it is working. Therefore, I think this protest is fair,” Shinjo said.
On the other hand, junior Fresno Pacific University business management Koutarou Matsumaru sees the policy in a different light.
“I can agree with people who participated in the protest, but I think that the Zero Covid policy is a good idea. In fact, as the Chinese government has said, the number of Covid cases in China is still increasing. If the number of infections is still increasing, even now that Covid has become less infectious, then I think it is the right decision to take that policy,” Matsumaru said.
In these ways, there are several opinions on this protest. In China, the number of confirmed cases reached a record high on Nov. 26. In China, the number of people infected with Covid has not been reduced. Some people have an opinion that the government’s Zero Covid Policy against it may not be working, thus, the Chinese government views their response as urgent.

Multiple police forces, SWAT team members and emergency medical service vehicles congregated in the Post hall parking lot after multiple individuals called 911 to report possible gunshots in the dorm on Wednesday, Dec. 7 at approximately 3 p.m.. The calls came after students reported hearing screaming and loud noises. 
Signs of gunshots were unfounded by the police, and a statement was released by Chief Operating Officer Joseph Schaefer at 6:41 p.m. stating that “there is currently no threat to the University community.”
Sophomore musical theatre major and Post hall resident Jackson Houska was in Post hall during the reported incident.
“I had just finished my classes for the day, and was on my way back to Post … I came in through the front door and headed towards the stairwell on the women’s side. As I passed, I saw people talking to each other in the hallway,” Houska said. “As I started walking up the stairs—and even through my headphones— I could hear a commotion. People were yelling … I stopped for a second, and as soon as I did, I heard five to seven really loud bangs. What those bangs were is up for debate for right now, and is certainly piquing people’s curiosity. But at the time, we thought that there was a shooter in our dorm.” 
Houska was working at Vans and witnessed a mall shooting in 2021, and has experience hearing gunshots being fired inside a building. 
“I kind of had that thought [of a potential shooting] when [the noises] happened, and I got really scared,” he said. “Those hallways also carry echo, so that could have been part of it but I wasn’t thinking about that at the time. I tried to stay calm … For a second, I hesitated and thought about going back downstairs, but decided to go to my room just in case. My heart was racing … My friends contacted me and asked why there were a bunch of policemen outside of my window. I saw men coming into Post with assault rifles and a canine unit.”
Houska recalled many students being alarmed at the situation.
“The second floor of Post hall has a group chat that started blowing up,” Houska said. “People were saying to barricade your doors, turn your lights off, close your curtains. There was some sort of situation, and people were saying they heard shots. So now, this became a very real situation. We thought that there was an active shooting situation in my hall.”
Sophomore finance major and Student Government Association (SGA) Vice President Ailer Thomas worked with the university and police officers to alert students about factual information as it became available.
“I spoke with some of [the police sergeants], they told me that they had received multiple 911 calls in regards to a potential active shooting situation inside of Post hall. They asked me to help remove students from the area, which I did,” Thomas said. “At approximately 3:20, one of the commanding sergeants and I had a conversation where we talked about the process and it was at that point that the officers started clearing the building [of students]. He told me that it was most likely a false alarm. At this point, I met with administration, and we spoke in regards to effective communications with the students. We sent out multiple text message communications.”
Thomas reiterated that the police and SWAT team swept the entirety of Post hall to ensure there was no evidence of a gun being present in the building.
“The police started sweeping Post hall room by room with SWAT teams and canine teams. This took awhile. The whole building was swept top to bottom. No evidence of firearm discharge, including residue or scent, was found,”Thomas said. “The canine units did not find any explosives or gunpowder residue. At that point, Post hall was declared safe and students were allowed to return.”
Upon being notified by the police force that students could return to their dorm rooms, many students still felt unsure of the situation.
“During the event, I didn’t think too much of it,” junior finance major and Post hall resident Emma Thibodeau said. “Although, I was weary because there was a super loud noise in the dorm. But, once I saw a bunch of police officers and SWAT team forces running into my dorm, I felt panicked because that’s not normal. And giving us no information at all is inappropriate and unfair. This is where we live, we have no other place to go. This is where we eat, sleep and shower. I am obviously thankful it wasn’t anything fatal or deadly to anybody, but the fact that it’s been almost a week and students have absolutely no clue what happened is a little ridiculous. And I do believe that the university should provide students with some sense of closure, since this is their home during the school year. Just telling us that the claims were unfounded is not enough, it still could have been anything.”
Houska agreed with Thibodeau’s sentiments. 
“I think most people that live here just want more clarity. Like, did the police find anything? What did they find and why aren’t we being told? Especially because we are college students who, yes, pay a lot of money to live here, but we also just live here. It’s supposed to be our safe space and our home,” Houska stated. “I would like to know the university’s recollection of events from that day and what they can tell us. Maybe they don’t know anything.”
Thomas said that the most likely reason for the shouting and loud noises in the dorm was a steel door being slammed shut multiple times.
“Our current working theory is that there was a dispute between two students and a door was repeatedly slammed. Due to the door being metal and the echoing in Post hall, some students thought it sounded like a gunshot,” Thomas said.
The SGA is working on potentially including padding on the doors to reduce sounds from doors slamming in the future, but students are still unsure of a door being the cause for these noises. Doors are often slammed in the dorms, and this does not cause multiple individuals to contact the police.
“The only information the school could provide is that it wasn’t a gunshot,” Thibodeau said. “We can’t rule out that it wasn’t violence if we don’t know what it was. It could have been a domestic dispute. It was definitely something, and I don’t think it was a door slamming. How are we supposed to just go back into the dorms and sleep knowing that this situation is unresolved?”
As students hope for more information from the university regarding what happened in Post hall, the SGA urges students to sign up for the Emergency Alert System for more efficient communication during events at https://web apps.liu.edu/EmergencyContact.Login.aspx.
