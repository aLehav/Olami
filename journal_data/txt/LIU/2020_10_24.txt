Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic illness that affects millions of families each year. According to the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, PD is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Modern medicine and neurologists have been developing stronger and more effective treatments for this disease every year. 
Dr. Gemma Moya-Galé is a professor at LIU Brooklyn  and speech-language pathologist who researches PD. Her expertise can be most notably witnessed in her recently published article “The effects of intensive speech treatment on intelligibility in Parkinson’s disease: A randomised controlled trial”, where she discusses the newfound breakthroughs in the use of intensive speech treatment to improve speech intelligibility for those with PD.
“Our study was the first one to examine conversational intelligibility gains in a randomized controlled trial for PD and we were able to provide evidence of treatment benefits to improve that aspect of their lives. The clinical implications for this are, therefore, huge,” Moya-Galé said. 
Moya-Galé’s goal is to improve the quality of life in her and her colleagues’ patients. Her study that was published by the Lancet took six years to complete, and contained documented and verified research supporting both Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) effectiveness, as well the importance of physical activity. 
“Close to 90% of people with PD develop voice problems over the course of the disease. One of the most devastating consequences patients face in their quality of life is social isolation and withdrawal, given that they lose the ability to be understood, particularly in noisy environments. Once voice problems have appeared and worsened, many patients may decide not to partake in conversations anymore, out of frustration, for example.” 
In order to get a better understanding of the disease itself, Moya Galé elaborated on what exactly the nature of the disease entails.
 “The disease is progressive and it may start long before a diagnosis is made, loss of smell could actually be one of the first signs. Getting the right treatment is crucial, as many times modifications to medication have to be made based on patients’ reactions to it.” 
LSVT LOUD treatment, is the most well researched and understood kind of treatment used to treat individuals. The LOUD part of the treatment, refers to patients using their loud voice, and emphasizes use of sounds like “AH” at various pitch tones, in order to rehabilitate their speech. 
“[LSVT LOUD] is currently the gold standard in the treatment of hypophonia in PD. It also has decades of research behind it that show its benefits in improving not only voice, but also facial expressions, or even swallowing,” she said. 
Moya-Galé said that LSVT LOUD has significantly improved intelligibility and patients with PD’s ability to be understood. This is important because there is a gap between the communication levels of the patient with PD and their caregivers. Improving the communication between the patient and the caregivers will improve the overall mental well being and stability of those with PD because they will know that they can still speak clearly enough to be understood. 
Moya-Galé believes that exercise is also essential to improving the neuroplasticity in patients with PD. Neuroplasticity is the concept that the brain can still learn, improve and remain malleable even within the patient’s final years being alive.
 “Physical activity not only improves aspects like balance and walking, remember that people with PD are at a greater risk of falls, so addressing these problems is very important for overall safety, but it can also increase quality of life, for example, by fostering and prolonging the individual’s independence,” she said.
Moya-Galé urges those with PD to begin rehabilitation as soon as possible.
“Rehabilitation is key in PD, and the earlier someone starts receiving those services (including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and such) the better. Rehabilitation services undoubtedly improve quality of life and we, as therapists, advocate for their early implementation,” said Moya-Galé. 
While she does hope there will be a cure in the traditional sense, she still noted that there are factors within our control that can prevent the disease interfering drastically with the patients lives. 
“As for habits or factors that could have a protective role; exercise is key. Physical activity has tremendous benefits …  not just for maintaining good physical function but also cognitive function.” 
Moya-Galé continues to study PD and work as a speech pathologist in order to foster independence in patients so that they can keep their voice for as long as possible.
Her work not only continues to impact the lives of not just her patients, and their families, but the scientific community, who research PD and attempt to learn how to effectively treat those who develop PD, at any stage of their life.
For more information about speech therapy treatments for PD, refer to Moya-Galé’s research on “The Lancet”.

After a scandalous off-season, the Houston Astros made it to the American League Championship Series against the Tampa Bay Rays. Despite injuries across the whole team, losing star pitcher Gerrit Cole in the offseason and finishing the regular season with a losing record of 29-31, the Astros made it to the ALCS. 
After getting healthy and getting going in the playoffs, Astros shortstop, Carlos Correa talks about the usual difficulties of a full season. “when you play 162, you usually have one or two bad months, and then you recover with the three or four more that are solid,” he said. After the shortened season and making it this far, Correa mentions how right we’reis equivalent to going on a hot streak in the middle of the season. “Right now, we’re in the third month of the season, and we’re getting hot at the plate.”
This past offseason was all about the Houston Astros cheating scandal and the ramifications it has had on all of baseball ever since the 2017 MLB season. The Astros fired general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch for their involvement in the scandal, and they were both suspended for one year. Other punishments towards the Astros include getting fined $5 million, losing their first and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021. Also fired amidst the scandal was Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who was the bench coach during the time of the Astros cheating scandal when he was also suspected of stealing signs as the Red Sox manager in 2018. 
In spring training, when the MLB season was getting underway, the spotlight was still on the Astros and how fans, teams and more would react once the regular season started. Once the coronavirus pandemic hit and closed down the season, the spotlight turned elsewhere for a moment. Once they came back for the shortened regular season, they had a lot to prove to those rooting against them. It wouldn’t come easy as the Astros had to deal with injuries to multiple players throughout the season, including closer Roberto Osuna, starter Justin Verlander, DH Yordan Alvarez, 2nd baseman Jose Altuve, 3rd baseman Alex Bregman, and outfielder Michael Brantley. Even after these injuries and the regular season’s mediocre results, the Astros came into the playoffs as the sixth seed with an eye on another trip to the world series. 
Going into the wild card round of the playoffs, the Astros swept the Minnesota Twins 2-0 in a best of three series as the bats started to come alive. Next, in the division series, the Astros defeated the rival Oakland Athletics 3-1 in a best of five series as each game saw both teams exchanging home runs one after another. After the big division series win, Astros shortstop Carlos Correa praised the Astros’ bullpen for the team’s success. 
“Our bullpen did such a great job keeping us in games, I think they are the reason why we won the series,” he said. After all, they had been through, and the adversity they faced, the Houston Astros, to many Yankees fans disliking, were in the American League championship series once again.
Despite having so much momentum going into the series, the Astros didn’t fare as well against the Tampa Bay Rays, losing the first three games to be down 3-0 with some critical errors by 2nd baseman Jose Altuve. With their backs against the wall, the Astros wouldn’t back down as star Carlos Correa helped lead the team back after three straight wins to force a game seven. In a decisive game seven, Rays ace Charlie Morton was lights out, allowing only two hits in 5.2 innings and six strikeouts. ALCS MVP Randy Arozarena hit another home run to end the Astros playoff run and lead the Rays to the World Series for the first time since 2008. The Rays won’t have it easy, though, as they will be taking on the National League Champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.  
Ryan Kaim, a freshman adolescent education major and big Mets fan, details his thoughts on how the playoffs are going so far. “Both championship series were intense with both games going into game seven it gave every baseball fan something they wanted to see, as many intense games played as possible,” he said.
Fans are eager to see how this series of the two top-seeded teams play out. “Despite wanting the Rays to win, I ultimately feel that the Dodgers are stacked, and their bats will ultimately outdo the Rays great pitching staff,” Kaim said. “Along with the Dodgers solid pitching staff of Walker Buehler and relief arms like Blake Treinen, who will hold the Rays at bay. I predict the Dodgers in six games.” With an exciting series on the way, baseball fans have more to look forward to before the season comes to a close.

The Commission on Presidential Debates canceled the second presidential debate on Friday, Oct. 9 after President Donald Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate. The debate was originally planned to take place in person on Oct. 15, but the Commission decided it would be held online upon Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis. 
“I feel as if that the cancellation of the debate was simply a strategic move by Trump and his campaign team since after the last debate, many viewer polls favored Biden,” sophomore psychology major Jessica Day said. “I think that this was the right move for him and his team to make because of the results of the last debate. However, I feel as if it is not fair to American people in this confusing time in history.”
Political science professor Jeremy Buchman believes that not having a real debate benefits Trump’s campaign because although he is trailing behind Biden in polls, he has less tactful debate skills than Biden.
“In one sense, the cancellation is surprising, since usually candidates who are trailing in the polls want more debates, either to maintain their visibility or to create more opportunities for their opponents to stumble and thus change the tenor of the race,” Buchman said. “But President Trump has no trouble getting attention whenever he wants it, and the town hall format of the second debate is one that’s especially ill-suited to him. In town halls, he’d have to interact with ordinary people, and he’d look even more obnoxious if he tried to talk over his opponent’s answers. It’s also a format that’s well-suited to former Vice President Biden. The president’s greatest fear is looking weak. The problem for him is that both options run the risk of making him look weak, especially if his health is worse than he’s letting on. Cancelling creates the appearance of ducking a fight and raising health speculations. But debating and performing poorly doesn’t serve him well either.”
Sports management major and senior Eddie McQuade thinks that canceling the debate was unfortunate but necessary for the health of Trump.  
“I understand a couple weeks ago President Trump unfortunately tested positive for the coronavirus,  so cancelling the debate was for everyone’s safety,” McQuade said. “I’m not sure how Trump is doing right now but it looks like he’s doing very well and should fully recover along with the First Lady. I would have rather seen them debate [but] if one candidate isn’t healthy enough than there’s not much we can do.” 
McQuade hopes that there will be another debate before the election and urges those who are able to vote to watch them.
“I’m not sure if they’re going to debate again before the election but if they are, I will make sure I watch it and everyone who can vote should too,” he said. “However, the moderators have been absolutely atrocious and I would recommend hiring a non biased TV show host to just simply ask the questions and tell them times up.”
Day thinks that having a debate virtually would be an effective way to have a debate that prevents the candidates or attendees from contracting the coronavirus.
 “I think that the virtual format that they originally planned on utilizing would have been a perfectly reasonable way for the candidates to get their views across and communicate with the American people considering the entire country has had to adjust to virtual meetings and differently formatted lifestyle,” she said.
Buchman is a fan of the virtual town hall format. “A town hall could work very well in a virtual format,” he said. “To me, it’s not that different from all of those TV interviews that Trump scrambles to get.”
With the election less than a month away, voters could have been making a decision based on the debates. However, Buchman argues that voters should know their decision by now.
“I’m really not sure what else we need to see at this point,” he said. “It’s astonishing to me that any voter might not have made up their mind one way or the other. With early voting already having started in many states, the pool of voters who are up for grabs, which was never that large to begin with, is shrinking as we speak. I guess I’d like the Commission on Presidential Debates not to be added to the long list of American institutions that Trump has broken.”
Biden and Trump both hosted individual town hall forums on Oct. 15 instead of the combined town hall debate.

TW: Childhood, Sexual, and Domestic Abuse. 
Editor’s Note – This article mentions sensitive topics such as childhood, sexual, and domestic abuse.
By Alyssa Spagna, Staff Writer
Safe Center LI announced that they will be holding informational courses at Post that cover the issue of child abuse. Everyone is welcome to attend these courses.
“We all know a child, so it’s important that all of us are trained in how to recognize child abuse,” Keith Scott, the Director of Education for the Safe Center, said.
Safe Center LI provides counseling for adults and children, group therapy, advocacy for victims and their non-offending family members, specialized forensic exams, forensic interviewing, housing, educational seminars, legal representation, and other services. 
“The Safe Center’s mission is to protect, assist and empower victims of family violence and sexual assault while challenging and changing social systems that tolerate and perpetuate abuse,” Scott said.
Child abuse often occurs more often than the public knows, according to Scott.
“Child Sexual Assault is a frighteningly common occurrence in our communities. Indeed, one in five children will be sexually abused before they turn 17, and these victims account for two thirds of all sexual assault survivors in the United States,” Scott said.
Cases of child abuse and domestic abuse are currently rising in the U.S., according to Scott.
“While we know that one in four women and one in seven men is abused by an intimate partner, within the LGBTQ community the numbers are even higher. 44 percent of lesbians, 61 percent of bisexual women, 26 percent of gay men, and 37 percent of bisexual men experience some form of partner abuse,” Scott said. “When we focus on college students, across the board one in three will be subjected to domestic violence during their college experience.”
The Safe Center is providing courses on abuse because they believe this is a serious and chilling topic. They are trying to break the stigma that abuse is taboo to discuss. 
“The goal of these courses is to establish a safer community through awareness,” Scott said. “Our hope is that participants walk away with applicable knowledge on the recognition and reporting of child abuse.” 
The courses being offered are recommended for survivors of abuse and the general public. Some people do not recognize the signs of abuse.
“Many survivors are reluctant to acknowledge that their partner is abusing them, don’t want to or are afraid to report it and may flat out deny that it is even happening,” Scott said. “We must remember that their abuse is not their fault, and that they need our understanding, our patience and our support.”
Safe Center LI can be reached at (516) 465-4700. To learn more about abuse and how to identify it, students can take part in these courses or contact Safe Center LI or Promise for more information.

The results of the 2020 election will shape the future of America for years to come. With a global pandemic, a potential Supreme Court nomination and healthcare hanging in the  balance, a lot is at stake. A key demographic in the 2020 election for both parties is Generation Z. Gen Z is composed of people born from 1997 onwards. Gen Z voters from 1997- 2002 will be eligible to vote in the 2020 election. 
Individuals from this generation of voters are already sharing their voices through various movements and platforms such as the “Blackout Tuesday” movement on Instagram. They are one of the first generations to use social media platforms to advocate for certain issues. According to Pew Research Center, Gen Z is also on track to be the most educated generation yet. Nearly 24 million of these voters will be able to vote in the 2020 general election, but nobody knows how many actually will.
The 2020 election has proven to be an election unlike any other. The coronavirus  pandemic has impacted everyone’s daily life, and social justice initiatives have made everyone  more aware of injustices around them. The stakes of this election have caused some Gen Z voters to change who they plan to vote for. 
“This time last year I thought I was 100 perecent sure of who I would vote for, now my vote is different,” sophomore Marketing major Rachel Jenkins said. “I switched my vote because this election is too big to vote for someone who might not have a chance to win.”
While some Gen Z voters changed their mind on who they will vote for, others easily made the choice. 
“I cast my ballot through mail a few days ago,” undeclared sophomore Madi Margroff said. “I never questioned who I would vote for or how I would vote during the pandemic.”
While Gen Z looks to use their voice through voting, it’s clear that this election will be critical to shaping the political landscape for years to come. New York early voting begins on  Saturday, Oct. 24, and ends on Nov. 1. Registered voters can vote on Election Day from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mail-in voters can begin mailing their ballots now or dropping them in a NY state dropbox. Mail-in ballots must be postmarked no later than Nov. 3 and received by Nov. 10.

Students walking by the Great Lawn this semester have probably noticed the orange “lawnbots” that have made an appearance at Post this year. New to campus, the small robots have been diligently mowing the Great Lawn since student’s returned to classes in September, but what some students might not realize is that these robots are more than meets the eye. 
“I know that we do not have the most basic sort of lawnbot, Post paid for a hard, orange exterior on these bots,” Steele Whitney, a junior acting major said. Students have had mixed opinions on this addition to campus 
“They simply go all the time,” said Whitney, “it really prohibits one from having kickball games or playing frisbee on the Great Lawn when the pandemic is over with.” The lawnbots operate around the clock, having even been seen diligently cutting the grass late at night. But even lawnbots have their limits, a discovery sophomore English major Clare Coursey made during her thorough examination of the bots and their habits.
“It saddens me when I see a lawn bot fail at returning to their charging station before they die,” Coursey said, “one dayI decided to rescue one of the stragglers by carrying it to it’s charging station after it lost the energy to do so itself. It was quite the endeavor.” 
With them being constantly underfoot, and at times unable to return to their own charging stations, the odds seem stacked against the mowers in having any success at being quality lawn care machines. Still, even with their shortcomings, students have still managed to see the good in the robots and their lawn care methods. 
“The Great Lawn has never looked better,” said Whitney, who added that “they are also quieter during class periods which is a huge plus.” Coursey echoed Whitney’s sentiments “they are doing a marvelous job at maintaining the greens. They are also quieter than human-operated mowers which is a huge plus.” Whether or not the lawnbots were the most cost-effective choice for maintaining the Great Lawn is still a subject of debate, but for students that have developed an affinity for the bots, their presence transcends the effectiveness of their lawn mowing. 
“I love just watching them go,” said Whitney, “I look at them, and I’m like… ‘you go little buddy.’ I find them to be quite inspirational.” In the times of uncertainty the world is experiencing, perhaps three little lawnbots were just the inspiration students needed. As Coursey put it: “Will the covid numbers go up? Will we switch to remote learning for the rest of the semester? No one really knows. But what we do know is that there are three diligent electrically powered workers trying their best to keep the great lawn looking great.”

In honor of National Coming Out Day, the Rainbow Alliance is putting together a video compilation of coming out stories of members of the campus community.  
“The video series is a chance for students that are out to help other students that want to come out, do not feel comfortable, or are having mixed thoughts on it. Situations vary so much depending on households and friends; some people come out to open arms, some less so,” said Nicholas Frank,  senior Game Design major, said “This series is being created in the hopes that the sharing of coming out stories of members of the Post community can help to empower and inspire those hoping to come out.” 
Anyone interested in submitting a video for this series can do so at tinyurl.com/wearestillcomingout, according to the Rainbow Alliance club president, Nicole Ludwig, 
“I’m excited to see everyone’s videos. We’re all ‘coming out,’ and we all see ourselves in each other’s stories, but everyone’s journey is different.” Ludwig said. 
Members of the campus community that are interested in watching this series will be able to find it released on the Rainbow Alliance’s Instagram at the end of October.
Although National Coming Out day occurred on Oct 11, Ludwig still wanted to create something to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. 
“While normally we’d do something in person to celebrate, the pandemic has made it more difficult to give it the attention it deserves. We wanted to do something that meaningful; to provide a space for people to share or listen to stories they might see themselves in,” Ludwig said, “Coming Out Day is not only about coming out, but about supporting and lifting up the people who do. We came up with this idea when thinking of ways that we could provide a platform to do this.” 
Despite the challenges of COVID-19 both Frank and Ludwig are excited about the upcoming series and can’t wait to share it with the rest of the campus community. 
“Everybody’s journey is different. You might not be able to come out yet, and that’s okay. The most important person that needs to love and accept you is you – everyone and everything else will come after that,” Ludwig said “There will be a day where you can be you, openly and unapologetically. I can’t wait until that day comes, but until then, I’m proud of you. And you should be too. Stay strong.”

Saturday, Oct. 17, the art department held a virtual exhibition for their Alumni artists.  Caroline Bert, host of the virtual reception, opened the club’s doors to current students, professors and alumni.  The reception was held to showcase the pieces created by Alumni of Post and to speak on the artistic processes and emotions that sparked their artwork to life.  
Artists revealing their artistic processes to aspiring artists filled the virtual room with a sense of connection and hope. Aside from serving as a showcase for work and artists, attendees were allowed to ask the panel of showcased artists questions on their artistic processes, how they found their voice to their artwork, how they overcame obstacles and finally, life as an artist after graduation.  The alumni invited were able to relive their college days through their selected pieces.  A major theme of the photos during the exhibit were college memories and transitioning into life after university.  Each Alumni thanked Post for their student experiences and artistic breakthroughs each has encountered.  
The virtual exhibit revealed that for each artist, the artistic process is completely different.  When creating art, it’s explained that you find yourself in finding your art style.   “I like to use my creativity as a voice for the ocean and sea animals.  I’m sure you’ve seen how poorly humans treat the ocean and its inhabitants.  I try to convey the cries of the ocean and her beautiful life-forms into my work, so more humans view the destruction that they have caused.  If others can see the beauty that the ocean holds, then that’s where we can begin to truly rescue our ocean.” Danielle Savarese, an alumni from the class of 2020 said.
  As the exhibition went on, each artist dived deeper into the origins of their work.  Joie Candido, an Alumni from the class of 2019 expressed thanks to the art department for allowing her to obtain the ability to transcend artistic expressions to various students.  Her favorite form is art therapy.  Art therapy is a distinct discipline that incorporates creative methods of expression through visual art media.  
“At a point in my life, I feel that my art saved me.  It started with an artistic blockage where I couldn’t create.  I’d go to my canvas and stare at it for hours, sometimes I’d cry depending on how overwhelmed I was.  School and life were stressing me out at the same time, and it trickled into every part of my life.  I finally got that first sign of relief when I began art therapy.  I stopped focusing on the finished product and just enjoyed the journey to the finish.  My art began speaking to me at that point, maybe because I wasn’t so focused on the end piece and the criticizations, but rather I enjoyed my time spent creating, the flows of my brush, the colors blending on my canvas, and then finally connecting it all into one piece.  I hope my work speaks for what I’ve come through.  I want all artists to at least explore art therapy when they are feeling drained or blocked creatively.  Put the brush to your canvas and just go wild,” said Candido.  
The art department invites those who have a passion for art and wish to be around those who share that same passion.  The community allows each member to find themselves through their personal artwork and the support that is shared throughout the department.  
“LIU Post Art department helped further my artistic exploration by one, helping me hone my craft.  Two, giving me a community of talented colleagues and professors who inspire me.  And finally, three, the Art Department taught me to be confined in my artwork and ideas.” Hannah Kerin, graduate of fine arts of the class of 2020, said. 
The art department virtual alumni exhibition presented an opportunity for these creatives to display their artwork and the processes that led them to the end goal.  In the process of this, current art students or faculty members were allowed to ask questions and connect for mentorship or creative collaboration.  The general theme of support and finding the foundation of personal artwork resonated well with the members attending the virtual call.  
Sharon Papp, graduate class of 2020 with a master’s in fine arts shared her views on the matter, “I am grateful for the conversations, critiques, and collective support stemming from the tight-knit community of Post Art faculty and fellow students.  Throughout my years at LIU, I found a sense of self, belonging, and artistic integrity.”
