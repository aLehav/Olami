Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

Dr. Gerald Lachter, the chairperson of the department of psychology and a professor of psychology for more than 40 years, passed away on Wednesday, Oct. 12.
Lachter studied many areas of psychology, but specialized in developmental disabilities, and experimental and applied behavior analysis. He was very interested in making learning easier for children with autism.
In addition to his academic interests, Lachter enjoyed watching pro sports, especially tennis. He often explained concepts in psychology by using sports as a metaphor.
Teaching psychology may have been Lachter’s job, but it was easy to tell the field was his passion. Lachter had no problem expressing to his students the importance of skepticism, and his absolute hatred for pseudoscience and shows that promote such “nonsense” like Ancient Aliens on the History Channel.
Lachter was beloved by his colleagues. Psychology professor Lois Tepper reflected on meeting him for this first time at Southampton College, 11 years ago.
“LIU had just informed us that [Southampton] college would close at the end of the 2005 spring semester and several of us would teach at C.W. Post in the fall,” she said. While many professors were understandably nervous, Lachter did his best to calm nerves and keep everyone together.
“Gerry made a special trip to come [and] personally talk to the four of us [at] the Southampton Psychology Department. He patiently waited so we could teach our classes and see him individually during the between breaks,” Tepper said. “This act of consideration took up a lot of his time but made a lasting impression of the kindness and understanding that our new Department Chair would show all of us. He will be remembered fondly and [will be] greatly missed.”
Professor Ethel Matin also worked alongside Lachter. He inspired her to develop her own version of his “personalized system of instruction.” This is simply known to many around Post as “Applied Behavior Analysis with Gerry Lachter,” according to Matin.
She coined Lachter the “enthusiastic and eloquent local champion” of his own teaching methods. Matin uses Lachter’s teaching methods today, and doesn’t plan to stop anytime soon.
“Over the years, Gerry became a respected and loved colleague,” Matin said. She noted that his work with autistic children and adults had a large influence on the department. “He will be sorely missed,” she said.
Professor Grace Rossi remembered Gerald Lachter as a man who had true love for his late wife, Abby, and his two daughters Eloise and Katie. Alongside his passion for tennis, Lachter “never turned down a cup of coffee, no matter what time of day it was!” Rossi said. Maria Barrios, a senior criminal justice major and former student of Lachter’s, remembered him as a “great man and a great professor that was loved by LIU as a whole.”
Barrios admitted morning classes aren’t the easiest for her to get excited about, however, Lachter was an exception. “He was very unique,” she said. “He was able to get his point across and grab my attention very well.”

Faculty representatives from LIU Brooklyn and Post sat in at the University Board of Trustees meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 18. Jennifer Solomon, communication strategist at the university, said the meeting was not planned specifically to address post-lockout concerns, but confirmed negotiations with the faculty was one topic of discussion.
The meeting, originally scheduled to take place at the Post campus, was moved off-site to the Cornell Club, a midtown city-location, late last week. Solomon explained that it is not unusual for the Board to meet at various locations on Manhattan.
Eric Krasnoff, chair of the Board of Trustees, recently sent out an email addressed to LIU stakeholders, urging the community to “work collectively and in good faith to form a better mutual understanding of our history,” to avoid further disputes among faculty, students and higher administration.
But Michelle Fernandez, a LIU Brooklyn Student Coalition representative, was not convinced. “This act [moving the meeting] serves as a means to keep student voices out of reach from the Board of Trustees,” she said. “We see that she [Dr. Cline] is feeling the pressure from the student body and views the relocation of the meeting as a major victory in our struggle against her hostile policies.
The Student Coalition organized free busing from Brooklyn to the meeting location. Using Eventbrite.com, the coalition urged LIU Brooklyn students to join the student-led “Action at the Board of Trustees Meeting.”
Ralph Engelmann, Vice President of the LIU Faculty Federation (LIUFF), and chair the LIU Labor Council—a consortium of unions on the Brooklyn campus—didn’t want to call it a protest. “It’s the college community voicing their thoughts and concerns with those who are ultimately responsible,” he said.
While LIUFF only addresses these concerns in bargaining, Engelmann said the federation supports its colleagues and the Student Coalition in their approach to seeking answers to their academic concerns.
Board Chairperson Krasnoff, however, wrote in his email that no one side is fully responsible for recent measures. “Whenever someone tells me it is all the faculty or union’s fault, I know that is nonsense. It is also nonsense when we hear it is only the Board or administration that is to blame,” he wrote. “There are no simplistic stereotypes of good and bad people.”
Rebecca States, president of the Brooklyn Faculty Senate, addressed the Brooklyn faculty’s position following the lockout of the Brooklyn faculty before fall classes began, and the subsequent no-confidence vote taken by the Brooklyn faculty. A similar vote of no confidence in the university leadership was taken by the Post faculty at the beginning of the fall semester. The Board allocated a total of 45 minutes to faculty concerns.
States emphasized the faculty senate’s main goal was to “get the trustees to see the extent of mismanagement throughout the university, and to understand the university cannot survive if this trend continues.”
She believes the recent positive numbers presented by the university are “macro-level financial gains” occurring as a result of “unsustainable cuts,” which has led to “widespread distress” among students, faculty and staff.
“Enrollments are down substantially, there is major turnover in the university leadership and staff, maintaining the physical plant remains a huge problem, and promises to students are being broken,” States said.
In connection with classes being taught by substitute professors at the beginning of the semester, during the lockout, Fernandez said, “The University agreed to provide certain amount of hours for a certain amount of cost. LIU breached that agreement when it failed to produce what was advertised.”
She described students’ anger of paying tuition money and being taught by replacements. “In many cases, classrooms were unattended, and administrators would come for the sole purpose of collecting attendance. This was immediately followed by dismissing the students.”
The university’s communications strategist did not respond to The Pioneer’s request for comment about the replacement teachers.
The Student Coalition is preparing a class action lawsuit against the university, which is expected to be filed within a matter of weeks. It demands such things as refunds of tuition money and lost scholarships as a consequence of the lockout, and the removal of President Kimberly Cline, according to its Facebook site.
The Post Faculty Council prepared its monthly report to be discussed at the meeting, too. The document, written by various faculty members on and off the council, concerned Middle State Standards, for which the Post campus is “currently out of compliance with several,” according to the document. Particularly, the council addressed standards II-VII, which all fall under the category of institutional context, according to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education’s website.
“We have generally seen this [the monthly report] as a request for a statement that captures the sentiment, activity, goals, or shared vision on campus,” the document reads. ”We have tried to get a pulse on the feelings and reactions of over 200 faculty members. We know that many feel anger and frustration, and, perhaps even more feel a sense of fear.”
The areas discussed include institutional policies, planning and budgeting, organizational structure, and assessment of administration. The Post council underlined that the lockout, and “the ripple effects those events have had on the functioning at Post,” was only another example of the council’s concerns.
In an attempt to improve communication, Cline and the deans of the respective colleges want to establish, together with the faculty senates, “more formal and robust mechanisms to address faculty and university issues in an effective, open and meaningful way and with Board oversight,” according to Krasnoff’s email.
But the Brooklyn faculty senate has no interest in putting together one more “mechanism” to enhance communication, according to States.
“We have tried collaborating, devoting countless hours and hard work to all manner of joint projects such as Strategic Planning, Outcomes Assessment, the Brooklyn Leadership Council, Academic Round Tables, and many other venues,” she said. “None of them seem to matter in terms of actually getting the leadership team to be transparent about resources, discuss how to prioritize the resources with us, or provide funding for student support, academic budgets, maintenance of the physical plant, replacement faculty lines, and of course, a reasonable contract!
States alleged that the higher administration is transferring students’ tuition money to better its endowment–$10 million in 2014, $20 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2016, according to her own statistics.
Solomon was unable to respond to The Pioneer’s request for a comment on the endowment, or whether States’ numbers reflect the university’s actual figures.
Krasnoff wrote, “Long Island University has seen its stature and health rising. Let’s add to that list our labor relations.”
University communication strategist Solomon further ensured “the best interests of our students [remains] our first priority.” She said that the university currently has “a comprehensive outreach plan in place to gather student feedback and to be responsive to their needs.”
But Fernandez disagrees. “The lockout signified a direct attack towards higher education, students, and unions,” she said, hoping to serve as “an inspiration for students nationwide to resist the corporate takeover of higher education and restore integrity to academia.”
Many Universities have student representation within the Board of Trustees, according to Fernandez. A representative would give the student body its “true voice,” necessary as decisions on the Board “greatly affect the Student Population.”
She added that the representative should be voted on by the entire student population.
Late on Tuesday evening, following the meeting, Board Chairperson Krasnoff sent out a statement that read, “After carefully listening to the faculty representatives, the board unanimously voted a motion expressing full confidence in the leadership of Dr. Kimberly Cline and her team.”

Over the summer, several classrooms in the hallway located on the left wing in the basement of Humanities Hall, were renovated and converted into new studios for the dance program. In addition to the removal of desks and white boards, new wooden floors were installed. Contrary to what one might believe, the studio’s construction made the task of scheduling classes much easier, said Concetta DiMare, academic scheduler.
“When the dance studio was ready for the fall term, four new classrooms on the second floor of humanities were added to my inventory, which made the task of assigning rooms a bit easier,” DiMare said. Although the renovation cost is unknown, the old studios are still intact along with new classrooms added to compensate for the renovations, according to William Kirker, the head of facilities.
“The dance studios that went into Humanities did not eliminate any classrooms. New classrooms were built on the second floor to replace them. And the existing dance studios are still in operation.” The construction of the studios began last May and was finished by the start of the school year, opening on Sept. 15.
The studio has been met with excitement among dance majors, dance enthusiasts and coordinators alike, especially by Dr. Cara Gargano, chairperson of the department of theater, dance and arts management. “We [have been] asking for a new studio for years and once our new president arrived, it finally became a possibility,” Gargano said. “We owe a big debt of gratitude to the wonderful people in facilities who made this a reality.”
Gargano’s excitement about the studio is only boosted by the benefits the studio brings for the potential of all of her dancers; she says the larger space allows for the dancers to practice their technique as well as utilize their abilities to their fullest potential. “They no longer hit the ceiling when they jump and they can work to the fullest extent in a space this size,” Gargano added.
The new studio is more than twice the size of the old one, located in the Theater, Dance & Arts Management building in front of the library. It is complete with a piano, new hardwood floors, as well as new mirrors and full dance floor matting that feels soft and comfortable but is also sturdy and durable. The new studio is a sticking image of a professional dance studio, according to Kirker.
“Dance students at LIU Post have access to unparalleled educational experiences and the instruction from our world class faculty – who have performed and produced for outstanding companies like New World African Dance Theatre and Empire State Ballet – is reinforced by the opportunity to attend performances
in New York City and work with their choreographers,” Kirker said. “It’s only fitting that our facilities should reflect the excellence of our faculty and our students.”
Jennifer O’Neill, a senior dance major, said that the new dance studio has boosted the morale of the team. “I feel very professional in this studio and the positive energy on the team is contagious because we are all happier and more excited than ever before.”
O’Neill said that the new environment has helped her and her teammates improve and refine their craft, “If gives us dancers freedom to move with no restrictions, teaches us to dance larger and it will greatly improve our stamina as well.”
Junior dance major, Emily Bivona, also feels that the studio has helped her grow in more ways than one. “These new studios with benefit my future by not being restricted by space side to side and up and down. I can jump and run as high and far as I please now. My creativity has no limits due to unlimited space.”
Torun Esmaeili, a senior transfer student from Norway who is also a Musical Theater major, praised the changes. “I finally feel free! I can finally take big leaps and really reach my true potential. I just feel like the dance program is so much more appreciated.”
Griffin Lockette, a sophomore Musical Theater major said, “The most exciting part is that we can have at least two classes at one time so it gives more people the opportunity to dance.”
“I was missing out on simple things in our smaller space because they were not possible. I am learning things such as traveling more in choreography, dancing bigger, and overall truly filling the spaces, “O’Neill said. “The one thing above all else is that being in a professional space will create a professional dancer and that’s what we are all here to be.”
She also expresses praise and gratitude for this new addition to the program, “These will all shape me into a better dancer and make me more employable as soon as I graduate in May. As for the program, Post dancers are going to be better than ever because this space gives us the opportunity to do so and we are so grateful!”

The student-run businesses have expanded this semester to include a talent agency and PR firm, along with gaining staff operation of The Doll House, The End Zone, and Time Out. In addition, Pioneer Nation set a new sales record, and product changes are being made within veteran businesses.
According to senior business management major Nick Rakiec, the student business PR director, there is now a talent agency and public relations firm located in the College of Management’s incubator spacein the basement of the library. The talent agency will benefit those interested in the performing arts by helping students gain experience, and find performance opportunities such as talent shows and club events on campus. The PR firm is aimed towards business majors.
The Pratt snack stand, Time Out, has been open to students since spring semester of 2011. This semester, it has transitioned into being run by students instead of the university. Although Aramark will still be the vendor, students will staff the snack stand, as opposed to Aramark employees.
The concession stand was a hit over homecoming weekend, according to Rakiec. The End Zone and The Doll House will also be added to the “student biz” list as they are in the process of becoming officially operated under students. Though Aramark will also still be the vendor for these venues, students will be working there as well.
Hutton & Post, formerly the Post Treat Shoppe, has also undergone changes. Formerly the store was limited as a candy shop, but it is now seeing a variety of sandwiches, cakes, cookies, cupcakes, frozen yogurt and bottled beverages. Hutton & Post is now partnered with Grimaldis and a Massinas Marker in Oyster Bay, to get different and better food quality. The most recent effort is finding a vendor that offers Nitro coffee.
Pioneer Nation, the apparel shop in Hillwood Commons, held a “study the bag”  sale during freshman orientation week. “This broke and set a new sales record for all stores on campus,” Rakiec said. “We were able to clear our inventory and are now in the works of designing and bringing in new styles of clothing.” Although Rakiec said the sale surpassed prior promotions by a landslide, he did not provide specific details in response to The Pioneer’s inquiry.
Success coach Cara Caporale is starting her first semester doubling as the associate director of the student businesses. She is confident student-run businesses bring success to students who work within them. “The students that run these businesses are able to gain professional experience which is good for their resumes,” she said. “Many companies require a minimum amount of experience that these students will already have.”
The businesses are looking to continue their expansion. “The amount of people who are now involved in the businesses has grown. We have more than 40 active students,” Rakiec said. “Since starting [the student run businesses] in fall 2013, we are bigger than we have ever been and we are always looking for more people to join our team.”
They’re motivated to encourage the student body to shop at these businesses, as the stores have been noticeably empty or closed in the past. “People don’t go in there a lot because it is expensive,” said Alexandra Christensen, a senior psychology major. “The workers are nice and help me when I [need] anything but I feel like if they were more reasonable with their with their prices more students would buy the stuff.”

The Post Foundations curriculum has gotten a little bit of an upgrade. Along with the new text “The Pursuit of Happiness,” The 101 course is teaching students to give back to their community through several service projects both on and off campus.
Two of the Post 101 classes have a determined focus that helped with their selections of community service. The class taught by Shawn Welnak, assistant professor of philosophy, has a theme of “Man’s Relation to Nature.” He has chosen to stay close to home and beautify the gardens next to Winnick House
On his class’ theme, Welnak said, “With modernity, man has come to see nature as something to be conquered, whereas with the ancients, she was something within which man lived harmoniously.” He hopes that the project can assist his students in finding a stronger connection and appreciation for nature.
Jon Fraser, professor of theatre, and his class of theatre majors decided to go into the city and volunteer at the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS Flea Market at Times Square on Sept. 25. The students set up tables and spent the day surrounded by the community that they soon hope to be joining as performers.
“As hopeful future members of the Broadway community, they became acquainted with one of the most important charities that theatre professionals support” Fraser said.
Similarly, Adam Grohman’s class is doing a clothing drive for professional wear, and Katherine Ahern’s class will be hosting a wonted clothing drive. Ahern hopes that this “encourages our students to think of each other as part of the Post community and to think about [ways] to support each other.”
Two of the other classes are choosing to give back to veterans, and those still on active duty. Albert Devivo’s class is giving greeting cards to active military and veterans, thanking them for all that they do to protect the U.S. And Janessa Barrett’s class is raising awareness and funds for veterans. “Being that we are a yellow ribbon school, the event seemed like a great way to connect students to the university” Barrett said.
Margaret Hallissy has her students going to the Jones Beach Pancreatic Cancer Research Walk on Saturday, Oct. 15. In the meantime, the students are gathering donations, so far reaching $525 for the cause. The students will be participating with Hallissy, who has a personal connection to the disease; her students’ enthusiasm and potential have her excited for the result.
Nancy Frye and Glynis Pereyra, as well as some others, have chosen to focus on raising money for suicide prevention, as their overarching theme of the service projects is ‘community.’ To bring a community together to help others is the ultimate community service. That being said, the professors of the Post 101 courses are hoping that the members of the class of 2020 will continue through their four years to serve the community and each other as Pioneers.

The gardens behind the Winnick Mansion are among many of the campus’ treasures. Recently, it seems the grounds have been neglected. Photographers and photo shoots can always be seen around the mansion, yet the state of the area could be improved, according to Shawn Welnak, assistant professor of Philosophy, and his Post 101 seminar class.
The idea to create a service project with a focus on the grounds surrounding the Winnick Mansion came to Welnak three weeks prior to the service day, which took place on Wednesday, Oct, 12. From his office in suite 205 of the mansion, Welnak could see it overcome with weeds and garbage. “We have a door in our seminar that opens to a view of the garden,” he said.
He introduced the service project to his first year seminar class as a first step in a potential series of service and care to the Winnick gardens. “This could be a place on campus that could be magical,” Welnak said.
On Oct. 12, the students worked from 9:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. pulling weeds, de-rooting dead plants and bushes, and removing discarded beer bottles, cups and cans. At least one staff member of the facilities services was with the group at all times, offering information on how to care for certain trees, plants, or bushes.
“[We had] filled a whole truck of weeds, debris, and garbage,” Welnak said. The class received the truck, garden trowels, a wheelbarrow, and garbage bags from campus.
A class of 30 students worked alongside each other, listening to music as they restored the garden. “It’s easier and more fun with other people,” said Kesnel Chery, a junior psychology major. Many students working on the service project felt that they bonded with their classmates through the project—an unexpected, but desired outcome for Welnak. “It was wonderful to work in nature and give back to the community,” said Jenna Lombardo, a freshman criminal justice major.
Areas once occupied by weeds and dead plants are now pruned and covered by mulch made on campus from old and fallen trees. Lynn Minutaglio-Schmitt, Environment, Health and Safety manager, had the Buildings and Grounds crew get the mulch needed for the project. The mulch gave the garden a cleaner look.
Welnak’s plans for the garden go beyond a decent cleaning. “I wanted something that they could leave and go, ‘wow,’” he said. He wants to achieve a “next level” of care by continuing the gardening project with each new first-year seminar. He feels the project will introduce the campus to the students and help them get them get along and form connections, and each year (or semester), there will be new additions to the garden.
“I want to take personal responsibility for this area,” Welnak said. He aims to secure a donor to give funds to supply new bushes that line the stone paths. Originally bordered by boxwood bushes, a type of bush that does not do well in the Long Island climate, the bushed had died off. Welnak hopes to replace them with ilex bushes, which can withstand the weather.
The full day project achieved Welnak’s goal of renewing the garden.
Nicolette Agostinacchio, a freshman business management major, said, “We had taken something ugly and made it beautiful.”

What excites you? The weekend and its fantastically fun festivities? Maybe it was homecoming last week, where you could tailgate and scream until the sunrise of Sunday. Perhaps it’s Christmas?
Although, these things do excite me a hell of a lot, it’s the tiny things, which to others may seem insigificant, that “gets my juices flowing.” When you fill a bowl of cereal, for example, and reach for the milk in the fridge… you begin to pour, and the milk runs out just enough for you to enjoy your cereal and not have a dry mouth from lack of moisture. That would make my morning and provide me high spirits for my math class first thing on a Monday.
It could also be as simple as when you are driving to school, and one of your favorite songs randomly begins to rock the car. For me, that completely boosts my attitude towards the day.
Although, you guys may not get excited about the end of a milk carton, I think that we all need to appreciate small, good things, which could potentially lift our mood. Why do we need something major to dig ourselves out of a mood? We don’t have to wait to receive an A in a paper to feel fulfilled; perhaps a simple gesture of someone opening the door for you can create a positive shock around our body and mind. It may even get us to walk around happy? Wow, that would be amazing.
Yes, we all have stresses that get us down and dampen our spirits, but come on guys, let’s not be so angry and unapproachable. I really feel that we could all do a better job at being a little more ‘sprightly’ and having more of a ‘spring’ in our step. And maybe the first step of this new and improved us, is the simple allowance of satisfaction for small things.
Let’s get more excited over someone buying you a coffee, or offering you a light for your cigarette, or even someone letting you go when you are in your car, merging onto the LIE. Just imagine our appreciation for big things, if we start to love and become more excited at the small ones.
Life really is going to throw some curve balls at you. It’s also going to hit you when you’re down. The best remedy—the best cure— is to smile and enjoy tiny things, which occur on a daily basis; things we don’t even acknowledge. Maybe it’s because they are expected. They shouldn’t be. We should relish in the moment: when we go to butter our toast, half asleep, and as we spread the last golden crust, we realize there is no butter left, and we say “phew…that was a close one?!”
More often than not, you will run out of milk for your cereal, and would have to eat dry Special K; the butter usually is gone, and you notice only after you have put your bread in the toaster. Just think back, and see which out-weighs which: small things that go wrong, and make it feel like the end of the world, contra small things that go right, that we don’t even acknowledge?
Be excited by the small things. Appreciate every bit of ‘luck’ or good riddance you experience. Because what if something big doesn’t come along? We will all just be miserable people. Now, go and enjoy your toast.

To call this year’s election cycle ‘once in a lifetime’ may be an understatement. Seriously, who could have foreseen billionaire businessman, turned pop-culture icon (for better or for worse), Donald J. Trump, square off against former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Presidency?
Less than one month away from Election Day, Nov. 8., Trump and Clinton boast disapproval ratings above 50 percent. RealClearPolitics, a poll tracking site that equates the average of all scientific presidential polls, shows 52.3 percent of Americans disapprove of Clinton’s candidacy, while Trump sports a disapproval rating of 58.8 percent, more than six points higher.
As a millennial, and as an aspiring journalist who plans to cast his vote for his first time in this year’s election, this is supposed to be an exciting time for me and the rest of the my generation. Exercising the right to vote is something we are privileged to have. I take my right to vote personally and hold it dearly. I vote for my future, I vote for my family, born and unborn.
This election is a historic one indeed. Which candidate will raise taxes? Which candidate will raise the minimum wage? Who’s going to make college tuition more affordable? What about securing our borders? Protecting us from terrorism, foreign and domestic; and what about the environment?
All of these questions are well worth answering. Heck, it’s our right to know the answers to these questions.
My question is simple, why hasn’t the media held our presidential candidates and their surrogates to the highest standard, ensuring that these questions are answered for the American people?
According to a Gallup poll, released on Sept. 14, “32 percent [of Americans] say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year.” For the sake of perspective, that figure has steadily decreased since 1999, when, according to Gallup, 55 percent had a favorable view of American mass media.
What is the growing distrust toward America’s mass media attributed to? I decided to find out what Post students thought about both the candidates and the mass media’s coverage of 2016 election.
“I’m undecided, and take pride in it,” said Gabriella Vitolo, a senior business major who has followed this election cycle since before the Iowa Caucuses in February. “I personally feel like I have to decide between the lesser of two evils instead of the better candidate,” she added. As for the media’s coverage of the candidates, Vitolo simply said, “The media is toxic, do your own research.”
Vitolo wasn’t the only millennial who expressed her displeasures in this year’s election cycle. Freshman Bailey Anderson, who’s yet to declare a major, has also yet to decide which candidate to support. “I was planning to support Bernie [Sanders], but now, I really don’t know what to do,” Anderson said in her somber tone.
Pondering the reality of a Trump or Clinton presidency, I asked her what her take was on the media’s coverage of the candidates. Her reaction was priceless.
Grinding her teeth, Anderson shook her head and said, “You wouldn’t even know what these candidates are running on.” Anderson’s enthusiasm or lack thereof was so prevalent that, she asked to take “no more questions” on the matter.
Not all students feel negatively about the candidates. Jayce Fuller, a sophomore education major, said, “I plan to support the GOP [Republican] nominee.” Fuller was quick to make note that he originally supported the Republican Senator from Florida, Marco Rubio, and that his support for the GOP comes down to ‘economic principle’.
As for the debates, Fuller said, “They’re a circus, entertaining, but a circus. No one sticks to the issue, the only thing the debates are good for are ratings.” Fuller echoed a sentiment conveyed by others on campus.
According to the Nielsen Ratings systems, “66.5 million” people nation-wide watched the second debate. Astonishing, yes, but not nearly as much as the “record-setting 84 million” viewers who watched the first  debate, all across 13 television channels.
Yet, despite the record-setting rating, the debates have left a ‘bad taste’ in the mouths of Post students, according to Mohammed Boydajin, a senior biology major. “I get it, Trump’s recent tape from Access Hollywood from 11 years ago isn’t going to pay my bills, and Bill Clinton’s affairs aren’t going to get me a job,” he said.
Boydajin said he plans to vote third party, which according to the RealClearPolitics average, is right on pace for voters under age 30 after the second debate. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party Candidate Jill Stein are polling at collectively at 39 percent in a four-way race; Clinton, 41 percent, Johnson 23 percent, Stein, 16 percent, and Trump, 9 percent.
Oct. 19 it the third and final Presidential Debate between Trump and Clinton. Hosted by Fox News’s Chris Wallace, the third debate will have America’s undivided attention, in large part because there are no      prime-time NFL games on television.
As polls tighten, it’ll be interesting to see which candidate comes out on top. Historically, the final debate doesn’t draw as many viewers as the two previous debates via Nielsen ratings system. For those still undecided, this debate may serve as a pivotal factor in their decision making. All the American public is asking for, and deserves, is a policy-oriented debate, not a reality television show.

With the upcoming presidential election, the media has been full of details and interviews about the presidential candidates. But the political system that the new president will work within has not been discussed nearly as much.
Part of the explanation is probably due to the fact that governmental politics is affected and relies heavily upon the people within it. Even though there are legal and constitutional structures, politics, when viewed as an industry, offers a people-based solution to the problem how a nation should be governed. Why else would it matter so much who is elected?
On other fronts, though, society seems to be moving in a different direction, solving problems through system-based solutions rather than with people-based systems. The job market is becoming more and more automated, and in the future it is likely that many of the jobs today will be replaced with systems and computers.
Cars are getting closer to becoming self-driven every day. Internally, companies in every field are using software systems to capture, keep track of, and use the increasing amount of data available. Even when it comes to individuals, digitalization has made it easy to use apps for systematic approaches for losing weight, controlling sleep or studying.
The phenomenon is not something new. Digitalization might have sped up the process lately but ever since the Industrial Revolution, machines and systems have affected the way companies work. The speed, stability and repeatability of machines often outcompete human production, making these more efficient and chapter solutions than labor by hand.
People, however, have qualities that machines have not had in the past, including flexibility, ability to learn, complex problem-solving skills, communication and creativity—all important qualities when it comes down to decision-making. But what is happening now is the artificial intelligence is moving forward, starting to mimic these human qualities.
The most used example of computer intelligence is often playing chess. The ability to plan, be logical and strategic were thought to be typical human qualities, until a computer beat the world’s best chess player. Interestingly, though, when a human uses a computer to play against another computer the human wins, even though the computer the human is using has less computational power.
Therefore, the term human-computer cooperation is trending, suggesting that a symbiosis between people and systems is the way forward. And in some ways it’s already here. When a pilot files an airplane today, it is  mostly a monitoring and controlling task, intervening when human decisions have to be made.
 So it doesn’t seem like cost, speed and efficiency are the only reasons for using systems instead of people. There are qualities those systems offer that humans don’t, for example, handing a lot of data and not having to deal with the impact of human error and irrational behavior. For instance, train crashes can be avoided with automatic breaking systems.
In politics, though, where decision-making is the core, we will naturally continue to rely upon the people we elect. But maybe even the current system of politics and how it could be improved by systems should be debated. The technology of today could make it possible to retrieve the public opinion instantly, opening for using more direct democracy. Then comes the question about how much decisive power there should be. In order to be part of a solution, the value that a person adds through flexibility and dealing with new situations has to outweigh the cost of the unpredictability and irrationality brought into the system by humans.

Woody Allen’s newest romantic comedy-drama, “Café Society,” is anything but romantic. A beautiful film in every way except for the characters, this latest film has the audience and box office questioning its success.    
The story of the fast-talking, Brooklyn-born Bobby Dorfman, played by Jesse Eisenburg, and his adventures and mishaps in 1930s Los Angeles, made for what should have been a funny and beautiful love-story. However, the casting of Kristen Stewart and the idolization of her character, Vonnie, the romance between her and Phil, played by Steve Carell, and her and Bobby seemed to fall short. While she smiled more in this movie than in any I have ever seen her in, she was still stoic and not very interesting to watch. She does not need to be animated, you want a subtle actor when it comes to acting on film, but the casting of her as the love interest with two men fighting over her and dreaming about her over the years just does not seem realistic.   
Teamed up with the fast-talking, type-casted Jesse Eisenburg—who could have been plating into of his past roles in the film and we would never have known the difference—the love story between Vonnie and Bobby brought the entire film down.
To win back the audience, the film was beautifully shot. Each scene was set up with visually appealing symmetry and excellent camera frames. One of the best parts was a beautiful shot where Vonnie and Bobby are walking into a cave; the shot is framed in such a way to show the jagged rocks of the cave they are walking into.
Each scene is made up of characters dressed in a beautiful array of costumes, from classic movie star gowns to mini-skirts and crop-tops. From the costumes alone, it is easy to understand why “Café Society” is the most expensive film Woody Allen has ever made. The lighting is also terrific. With the warm, soft lighting of jazz clubs in the early mornings and the bright sunshine of an L.A. beach it added a nostalgic feeling to the film, harkening back to classic Hollywood days. This combination of cinematography, costumes, and lighting painted a romanticized version of 1930s L.A., one where the action of gangsters covering bodies with cement was a running gag.
Sitting in a small cinema in Roslyn on a Wednesday evening, with an audience of four—including myself—the box office fumble was apparent. Granted, the movie was released on July 15, so the hoards of Woody Allen fans have come and gone long ago, but the movie never seemed to have struck a chord with its audience. Being Allen’s most expensive movie, with a budget of $30 million, and past box office successes, such as, “Annie Hall” and “Midnight in Paris,” it would be expected that “Café Society” would follow the same pattern. Unfortunately for Allen, the film has not even made a profit, only earning $20.8 million at the box office, according to google. This is a big hit for Allen after his last two films made more than double their budget. While it seemed like it would be the right time for a movie like “Cafe Society,” a film that doesn’t feature superheroes or is an adaptation of a young adult novel, unfortunately, it has not been successful.  
Even though “Café Society” is not a movie that needs to be watched over and over again, or really more than once, it was entertaining and interesting. After leaving the theater that night, the casting and characters were questioned, but the film as a whole was a much-needed step into the past that was beautiful and smart.

How do people recover from a tough, heart-rending break- up? Drinking ‘til they cannot think, sleeping in bed for days, talking to their friends about it continuously, or connecting with the characters in a romance movie awfully similar to your own? The new Chinese movie, “I Belonged to You,” is that kind of “break-up and healing” solution.
The movie is based on the bestselling short story series by Chinese writer, Zhang Jiajia, who just recovered from a terrible divorce four years ago. After his wife left him, he traveled all over China. He visited many places and talked to people, leading him to write a book, recounting the many love stories—good or bad—he gathered. The movie is a touching romantic tale revolving around two radio DJ’s and the life they live.  
They find that the audience they reach reflects their own love and heartbreak, and it makes them deal with some bigger issues than their own.
In this movie, there are four young couples going through four different lifestyles and love lives. The only common thread is the expectations deep down in their hearts. They all expect to meet each other again, to get back together. Some of them are positive; others are desperate.
One of the main characters, Chen Mo, says, “No matter how hard we try, we will never be able to change our destiny.” If you’re going through a tough break-up, you will definitely gain a new angle of thinking and new found hope after watching “I Belonged to You.”

On Oct. 9 and 10, the Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA) performed a staged concert of “Holy Musical B@man,” in the Rifle Range Theatre. Isabelle Rutens, a sophomore theatre major, directed the show, with a cast featuring 16 students.
ESTA is a club that provides the opportunity for students interested in theater to write their own shows, or direct already written shows, and produce them for the student body. Funded by the office of campus life, all tickets for ESTA performances are free. Any profits made from candy sales and/or raffles, are donated to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, an organization that helps fund HIV/AIDS research, and those affected by the diseases.
ESTA recently produced “Holy Musical B@man.” Starring Brendan Murry and William Pope as Batman and Robin respectively, the performers made the audience laugh with even the smallest lines. The singing and dancing were extremely entertaining, showcasing the cast’s talent while still fitting well into the theme of the show.
The show was a hit with the audience. “I know it made them [the audience] laugh, so honestly that’s the best I could ask for,” Rutens, the director said. “There is nothing more rewarding than being the source of someone’s laughter.”
“I wanted to do HMB because I have an undying love for Starkid [the theatre company that originally produced the show],” Rutens said. “I have been a huge starkiddie since my freshman year of high school. Now being a sophomore in college, I felt like it was time to manifest that love [into] something on stage. Over the summer, I was telling my PTC Big [in the theatre department, freshmen are assigned a “Big” as a mentor to help them throughout college] about my love for Starkid and she suggested proposing a Starkid show for ESTA’s 2016-2017 season.”
Rutens chose “Holy Musical B@man” because she knew these were characters that people would want to play, and the idea of a Batman parody musical would draw a lot of interest for auditions. “It’s also very well written and concise, and so, so hilarious. It was really the obvious choice for me,” she said.
The show was originally a full, two-hour stage production. As the ESTA version was a staged concert, it was slightly edited by students, Rutens, and Brandon Bennett, the musical director.
“I decided to do a staged concert mostly because if I were to do a full show, I would have to give it the attention it deserves, and in reality I just didn’t have time for that. Neither did my cast,” Rutens said. “Doing a staged concert was different because the overall runtime of the show was much shorter than if it were a full production [The ESTA production was roughly 45 munities shorter than the original production]. So instead of worrying about getting everything done, I could worry about making the littles scenes we had had really shine. I could afford to be nitpicky about some things because I didn’t have a full production that needed my attention.”
“Holy Musical B@man,” was first written and produced by Team Starkid, a musical theatre company founded by Glee’s Darren Criss, and his friends and fellow students Brian Holden, Matt Lang, and Nick Lang, according to its website. The company is well-known for making parody musicals of popular franchises, such as “Harry Potter,” “Star Wars” and “Aladdin.”
First produced in March 2012 at the Hoover-Leppen Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, “Holy Musial B@man” a parody of the DC comic books superhero, Batman. It makes fun of things such as secret identities, sidekicks and friendship between heroes. The music and lyrics for the show were written by Nick Gage and Scott Lamps, and the book was written by brothers Matt Lang and Nick Lang, all of whom are members of Team Starkid.
ESTA’s next production is “No Control,” an improv night at 9 p.m. on Oct. 21 in the End Zone at 9pm. “The Every 28 Hours Plays,” a show of 90, one-minute plays inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, follows on Oct. 23 at 7 p.m. in the Hillwood Cinema. For more information on “Holy Musical B@man” and other Team Starkid shows, visit www.teamstarkid.com.

Based on the true story of Edward Snowden, a retired contractor for the CIA and the NSA who leaked documents disclosing the unconstitutional actions conducted by these programs, Oliver Stone’s “Snowden” is a film that will satisfy any hacker, polecat junkie, or anyone who loves films that are contentious and can spark debates on government trust.
The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Shailene Woodley, Zachary Quinto and Nicholas Cage. Snowden, played by Levitt, is training for the military when he accidentally breaks his leg falling from his bed bunk. He then applied and eventually worked for the CIA where he was assigned to the organization’s global  communications division. After a short time, the CIA assigned him to diplomatic cover, responsible for maintaining computer network secularity in Geneva, Switzerland and then in Tokyo working as a                sun-contractor for the NSA.
After leaving Tokyo, he moved back to his home state of Maryland and finally worked at an NSA office in Hawaii. This was his last job prior to releasing the classified documents showing that the NSA not only was illegally spying on Americans, but also on countries around the globe. Once the documents were released, Snowden fled to Hong Kong and eventually gained asylum in Russia where he still remains today.
The movie also depicted several possible unknown truths about Snowden’s personal life. Viewers start to see the fluctuation of the relationship between his wife, Lindsay Mills, and himself due to the stress of constantly traveling to various parts of the world. Viewers will also find out about his struggle dealing with seizures while working in Maryland and Hawaii.
Unlike most films that romanticize and exaggerate true stories, “Snowden” did not. It incorporated real news clips and videos of politicians, news anchors and meetings. Such as the infamous hearing with NSA Director James Clapper, deliberately lying to Congress about NSA surveillance, and a surprise ending that provided a more realistic feel to the movie.
This film provided the audience with a very accurate while simultaneously entertaining account of a story that shows the true nature of a malicious and unconstitutional form of government. It also displays how heroes like Edward Snowden- are responsible for fighting for basic civil liberties- are treated by the media, political figures and government organizations, It is a film that is contentious and shines light on the debate whether people should trust the government and what the government’s role in society should be.
