Last week was the C.W. Post’s Greek Life Rush Week. Rush Week is the introduction to a sorority/fraternity. Students of Greek Life lead those who are interested in joining through a week that hosts various events such as campus touring, games, informational, and competitions. The events, dates and times are listed on their websites or can be found from an e-mail to the Greek Life organization.
Delta Phi Epsilon hosted five events from January 31st to February 4th. Each day, the girls would give information on the sorority’s philanthropy and background to each girl’s journey in Delta Phi Epsilon.
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity does not participate in Rush Week says Curtis Dabel, the polemarch of Kappa Alpha Psi. “We will have two informationals this semester” says Dabel, “which interested gentlemen can attend and learn more about our illustrious fraternity.” The main social aspect of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity is diversity. The members of the fraternity have a strong belief in diversity. “We do realize that we are a pre-dominantly African-American organization, but membership is not limited to anyone regardless of race, color, religion, or national origin.” Dabel hopes the fraternity will make the C.W. Post community better through programs and community service initiatives. “Involving students in things that we do is one of biggest emphasis. We want to show the students of C.W. Post that Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity does indeed strive for achievement in every field of human endeavor.”
Alpha Epsilon Phi calls Rush Week ‘recruitment’ week.  Vice President of Operations Ashley Kranjac says, “During recruitment week we hope to attract girls who share the qualities that we look for in each other, to get to know the girls on a deeper level, and to show them the many benefits of being in a sorority. Each and every one of us has the common bond of being in AEPhi, but it is our individuality and love for one another’s differences that keeps us so close.” Some of the events AEPhi will be sponsoring are a scavenger hunt called PHI PHIND where the sisters and interested girls go on a scavenger hunt together in order to get to know each other. Informationals and lectures on philanthropies were also given during Rush Week.
Those who have gone to Rush Week and are interested are encouraged to join. Many famous people, CEOs, media moguls have been part of Greek Life and are proud to say that they were. The students who are part of Greek Life at C.W. Post are proud and devoted to their sorority/fraternity and you can be too. Be part of this and have a great college experience, one that you will never forget.

It seems as if this snow will never stop. Some people like it because they admire the excitement it creates. Crisp snowflakes that you can catch on your tongue, building a snowman, or perhaps skiing down a beautiful white blanket of snow. Hot chocolate with a pile of whip cream that you can lick off your lip works as a good remedy to this cold harsh weather. Then again bad snowstorms prevent you from returning to school or work; almost like a dream come true.
What people do not enjoy about the snow has been causing a ruckus on the C.W. Post Campus. Mountains of ice and snow are building up so high that it is beginning to seem like a good idea to make an igloo out of it.  Black ice is covering the ground causing people to slip and slide. The worst part of it all is the frozen snow piled on top of cars. Many students have been frustrated because the snow has not been plowed in parking lots on campus. Parking lots are supposed to be used for students and faculty to park, and the one thing keeping these spots vacant is the snow.
Most people can agree that snow can make driving dangerous because it can cause card to skid, potentially causing an accident. Snow can also make walking just as dangerous. Brookville Hall for example, a dorm building on campus, does not have the parking lots plowed. Students who park their cars near Brookville are finding it difficult to park, due to the ice and snow. It is a challenge to get out of cars without being bombarded by the boulders of snow.
Sam Tenadu III, Environmental Science major, was not able to find any parking spots. “It is absolutely ridiculous that someone has not cleaned up this parking lot. There are so many spots available, but the snow is in the way so students are parking their cars crooked, which is taking up more than one spot,” said Tenadu. “I go around the campus and it seems as if Brookville Hall is the only residential parking lot that looks like this. It is really unfair.”
Samantha Osgood, Sociology major, did not have a good experience as she attempted to have a bite to eat at the Winnick cafeteria. “I fell on the stairs behind Winnick. It was ridiculous that they weren’t shoveled,” said Osgood. “The school should have handled the snow a lot better. Even areas like the chipmunk trail should be safer to walk on because people can get really hurt.”
C.W. Post is a place for students to explore their surroundings and be in a safe environment. It is the responsibility of the school to ensure a secure environment for students, faculty, and visitors, even if that means in harsh weather conditions. With the help of public safety and the sanitation departments, they can help prevent accidents and make this campus a better place.
