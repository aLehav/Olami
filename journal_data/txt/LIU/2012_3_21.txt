On March 7th in the Cinema Room of Hillwood Commons, all ears were listening as students showed their voice at LIU’s own Post Idol. Students had gone through three rounds to make it to the stage show, like on the real “American Idol”, to show everyone at Post, including the judges, that they were the next Post Idol.
Like on American Idol, Post Idol had three judges who determined which contestants made it to the next round.  “I felt Post Idol had many similar things to American Idol, like the judges and how they gave feedback,” said freshman Nina Hemby.  “It just could have been a little more organized when they did the elimination round.”
Post Idol made it very clear that they had a Paula, Simon, and Randy, like from the original “American Idol.” The feedback that each judge gave was interesting, real, and even harsh. Judges said how they either loved the performance or hated it.
The competition had 13 contestants, with nine female contestants and only four male contestants. The voices varied from amazing to not so great.
Songs the contestants chose came from a lot of different genres with songs like “Motivation” by Kelly Rowland, Katy Perry’s “The One That Got Away”, and even “Vienna” by Billy Joel. Adele seemed to be a popular choice, with two contestants singing “Someone Like You” and one singing “Rolling in The Deep.”
At the end of the performances, each judge handed in their tallies for each contestant. All the contestants stepped up onto the stage to see if they were able to make it to the next round of Post Idol. Nine contestants made it to the next round.
Each contestant who was moving on had 2 weeks to prepare for the next round. Round Two is March 21st at 9 p.m. in Hillwood Cinema. Find out who your next Post Idol will be!

Recent statistics show that one in five college students experience dating violence, and the Red Flag Campaign at LIU Post is designed to address that startling statistic and promote the prevention of dating violence on college campuses.
On March 6th, organizers of the campaign held the “ Find Your Strength” lecture and self-defense seminar, where Post freshman and Social Work major Allison Caldwell spoke about her struggle with an abusive relationship.
The audience was silent as Sarah Boles of Student Health and Counseling began the event by saying, “Anyone can be an abuser, and anyone can be a victim.”  After a brief introduction, she welcomed Caldwell to the stage.  No time was wasted, and Caldwell began to tell her story of an abusive relationship that started in high school at the age of sixteen.  She explained how in love she was and how perfect things seemed to be.  Within the first three months, Caldwell acknowledged there were little fights but nothing too serious.  As time went on, her boyfriend began calling her names, became obsessive and became possessive, which then lead to isolation and physical abuse.              Caldwell spoke about how she too began to change as a person, lying to her family and friends about things in an attempt to cover up for her boyfriend. Any time Caldwell would try to leave the relationship, her boyfriend would threaten to kill himself.  It was an off and on relationship for almost two years.
Caldwell explained that she shared her story because she doesn’t want other students to allow this to happen to them.  “Speaking at the Red Flag Campaign was the first time that I have ever shared my story publicly.  People don’t know what happens behind closed doors.  I truly believe consequence is no coincidence; there is a reason for everything.  Everything I have gone through has made me a better and stronger person.  I am not ashamed of the path that I took, and for this reason, I will not conceal my story.  Regardless of how scared one may be, there is always a way out.  No one should ever be ashamed to ask for help.”
Mike Riggs, a junior Mathematics major, attended the event, and he said, “What impacted me the most was Allie’s talk in the beginning.  Most of the time, red flags are hard to notice for people outside the relationship, such as your parents.  Maybe your friends notice differences in your behavior, but no one really knows many details of the relationship.  The story taught me that someone may look like they have it together on the outside, but they could just as easily be broken on the inside.”
Lauren Fiore, a senior Social Work major, was a part of the Red Flag Campaign.  Fiore is very passionate about this campaign and explained how most people have a stereotypical view about dating violence,but do not take notice of the less obvious ways a relationship can quickly become unhealthy.  Students can seek help at Student Health and Counseling Center and Public Safety.  For additional hel,p students can call the Nassau County Coalition Against Domestic Violence Hotline, visit domestic violence websites, or call the national hotlines for sexual and domestic abuse.  “I really hope that students walk away with an understanding of how serious the issue of unhealthy relationships is as well as the many resources that are available to students both on and off campus,” said Fiore.
 
The night ended with a self-defense seminar.  Post mom and Martial Arts fitness instructor Diane Calise showed students different ways to defend themselves.  Everyone laughed as she introduced one move she called ‘the JLo’.  For a situation when someone may be grabbed by someone else by the shirt with bold hands, Calise instructed the students to chop down in the crease of their offernder’s arms, bringing the hand back up to hit the offender in the face.  She calls it ‘the JLo’ because Jennifer Lopez did this move perfectly in her 2002 movie, “Enough.”
The public awareness campaign has entered into its fifth year on campus, and many clubs are active participants. Some of these clubs include BSW (Bachelors of Social Work) Social Work Club, MRAW & WARM (Men Respecting All Women and Women Appreciating Real Men), the fraternity Phi Iota Alpha and the sorority Omega Phi Beta.
Many students were a part of the Red Flag Campaign, and the clubs involved offered different events that Post students could attend in support of the campaign.  “I think this year was really very successful, and I’m very happy with how everything turned out.  What I would like to try in the future is to work closer with faculty to possibly include the program in certain course curriculum,” said Boles.

I spent part of my break away from Long Island visiting a school upstate. Being away from home made me realize a few things. One, as much as we hate Long Island, there is no other place like it. Two, guys don’t suck just here, they suck everywhere. Let me preface the main point of this article by making one thing very clear. I do not condone sleeping around and acting like a hooker.
Anyway, I overheard a few boys talking while I was away and one was talking about a particular booty call of his. He was saying how great it is because she always answers the phone no matter what time of the day it is and is usually down for anything. Then she made the colossal mistake of thinking the favor would be returned when she called him the previous night, looking to take care of business. Well to her misfortune, it was not.
That’s not my problem with this situation. My problem is this guy went on and on about how when he has needs she should meet them, but when the tables are turned it’s not his problem. Seriously? What part of that is even remotely fair?
When I posed that very question, the boys looked at me like I was slightly insane. They basically told me that this particular girl sleeps around all the time and is a “dog” so it doesn’t matter. That has to be some kind of joke right?
So, it’s acceptable for this guy to do what he wants with whomever he wants whenever he wants. It’s more than acceptable; it gets him high fives and an “atta boy” from his friends. But if a girl does the same thing it makes her a dog, a derelict.
As I said before, I don’t condone harlotry. But this is only one small example of double standards between young men and women. For all of the guys reading this who are nodding their heads and smiling to themselves because you know you’re guilty of this, not cool. And ladies if you find yourself faced with a mongrel like this, do yourself a favor and don’t pick up the phone next time.

The Republican primary race continues to push on and it still has no definitive winner. As each state holds its primary election and the tallies go up for Romney, Santorum, Gingrich, and Paul, the question is quickly shifting from who is the best Republican candidate to lead the country to who can beat President Obama in November? The even bigger question is; can he even be beaten? Of course no candidate is impossible to beat but do any of the four Republican contenders have what it takes to become President?
Part of the question relies on what the American public thinks of Obama going into Election Day. This isn’t looking to good at the moment since Obama has just hit an all time low approval rating of 46.8%, according to realclearpolitics.com. The numbers are not exact and could of course fluctuate over the next few months and alter the final election in November. But what about the Republicans; are they really up for the challenge?
America seems to still be unsure about that. Not one of the four major remaining candidates has a clear view of the finish line. Ron Paul, who is currently in last place, has yet to win a single state in the entire primary race. Why would he still continue to run this late without having a single state on his side? Of course he could bounce back and win a few but it probably won’t be enough to give him the nomination. What he can still do is be a spoiler. If Paul drops out, his loyal supporters will have to find another candidate to vote for. So by staying in the race he can at least take the few votes he will get and not have them handed to another candidate. For the rest of the candidates this just means fewer votes to go around, making every other vote count just a bit more.
And then of course there is Newt Gingrich, who is currently third in the race. Gingrich has won just a few states here and there. When the recent elections in Mississippi and Alabama occurred, Gingrich needed to come in better than third or dropping out would be a very real possibility. Although Gingrich didn’t win either state, he managed to pull in second place in both, keeping his hope alive just a bit longer. But even though he won second place, it still doesn’t give him a major push towards first overall. Gingrich made it clear from the beginning that he is in it for the long haul, so it doesn’t seem like he will be giving in any time soon.
So while Paul and Gingrich’s hopes hang on by threads, the two front runners are Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. A few months ago it seemed Romney had a clear victory and no one had ever heard of Santorum. Today, Romney is barely ahead of Santorum and the race is quickly tightening up. Santorum has been racking up the Deep South states such as Alabama, and Mississippi and other major states such as Kansas while Romney is picking up numerous other smaller states. Romney did pick up the majority of states in the Super Tuesday election but the battles in the more important states, such as Ohio, were so close it is almost impossible to tell that Romney had won at all. These states are considered more important because of the size of the population. The higher the population, the higher the number of delegates the state has. So states like Ohio, New York, California, and Texas are worth more than states such as Wyoming or Delaware. Santorum is quickly catching Romney and before long, Santorum could have the lead and a nomination if things continue in the same fashion they have been.
This brings it all back to the original question. Will one of these candidates be able to beat President Obama in November? The answer is still unclear. It is extremely difficult to tell at this point because things are so close at the moment. It does play in his favor that the Republican Party is so divided because if the party can’t pick a clear candidate then how will it ever agree to vote on the same one in the long run. But if Obama’s popularity continues to sink, then it may not look too good in November. It seems yet again that only time will tell what the outcome will be. For now the Republican candidates will fight for the first place spot, and Obama will fight for more popularity among the American people, but it will be the fight in November that will answer all the questions.

You can’t escape it! The ads for makeup on the television, in magazines and newspapers, even when you’re playing a game on your phone, there is an ad for a product that promises to make you more beautiful. Well, sign me up! I’m all for looking good. I can admit in the recent years I have spent hundreds of dollars on beauty products, but is it worth it? What do people see when they look at your painted face anyway?
I came to this realization a few weeks ago. I used to cake on the makeup, especially foundation and eyeliner. I’ll admit I have terrible skin, so the more foundation I use, the more it starts to cover up. Eyeliner just looks bad when it’s not even so I’m constantly checking it. I never noticed it before, but while at work one day, as I was checking my face in the mirror for the umpteenth time, a guy I work with confronted me and said, “Kat, you really need to lighten up on the makeup. I can see a makeup line and honestly, men don’t find that attractive.” I was shocked, hurt, and angry. So I ripped the guy a new one and continued with my shift. Later on, I was complaining to a few girlfriends about the comment and they agreed with him. I couldn’t believe it, had I been walking around looking like a clown for the past four years?
The answer is no, I just needed to lighten up. I didn’t actually need all the makeup. But when you go to a makeup store and the girls make you up what they’re really doing is selling a product. Besides, let’s be honest, a lot of girls wear way more makeup then they should. So I’m just going with the trend I guess you can say. A friend finally told me that makeup should be worn, but it shouldn’t be obvious except for eye makeup. I was stunned. I want people to know I take the time to do my makeup, but ladies, no guy is going to start a conversation by asking how long it takes you to do your makeup. It seems most men would prefer their women to wear little to no makeup (unless of course they wear makeup themselves). So what did I do?
I lightened up entirely on makeup and I can say I feel more confident. Yes, my skin isn’t great, but I’ve learned to accept it. Besides I look a lot better without all that crap caked on to my face. And besides my skin is clearing up because my pores aren’t clogged with ingredients that I can’t pronounce.
So ladies, how much makeup is too much? Makeup should only be applied once a day and removed at the end of the day. Sure a touch up is good here and there, but not another application. It also should not take you any longer than 10 minutes to do your makeup. Also it is important to blend your makeup with your face color so you don’t look like a circus performer. Tips can be found online or if you want, go to a specialist. Sephora and MAC give great advice and can find the right products for your skin. Good luck with your application and remember makeup is just an enhancer for your beauty. You already have the beauty; you’re just trying to compliment it.

You wake up past 9 a.m. and realize your class starts in 20 minutes. If you live on campus, you can get dressed and arrive to class in time. But if you are a commuter there are a couple of other factors to take into account. So, what is better – living on campus, or being a commuter?
With being walking distance to classes, dining services, the post office, the gym, and easy access to on-campus events at all times of the day, the LIU-Post residence halls are filled with dormers. The social opportunities are just a small step away, as the other dorms are filled with other students, and the Winnick dining hall often has a big crowd. But still, close to 80 percent of LIU students are commuters.
“You definitely have more freedom living off-campus,” said sophomore Journalism major, Lauren Thomas. Her friend, sophomore Alexandra Scott, disagrees. She lives in Hicksville with her parents. “In some way you have more freedoms, but in other ways you don’t,” she said, explaining how her parents’ guidelines and curfews catch up with her while living at home. But she does agree that living at home has its benefits.
Both Scott and Thomas enjoy the opportunity of eating healthier, more diverse, and affordable. “If I want to, I could go home during common hour and check what we have in the fridge,” Thomas said. She lives in East Meadow, approximately 20 minutes from campus. She drives back and forth every day, and even though the commute is stressful and demands gas money, she prefers the benefits of living at home.
Commuters have access to the school by cars, the Student Shuttle Bus, and the N20, which passes by the library a couple of times an hour. Off-campus living includes both those living together with their parents and those renting apartments – often for a lower cost than the on-campus living.
“I have my own big room, I can play music as loud as I want, and my parents appreciate me more when I am living at home,” Thomas said. She finds commuting to be annoying at times, but appreciates the benefits more than she is annoyed by her dislikes.
Elsa Klarin is a sophomore who has been living on-campus for the last two semesters. “It’s very convenient. You have everything you need just a five to ten minute walk away,” she said, explaining how she finds the dorm life to be a good experience. Klarin plays on the women’s soccer team, and has practices several times a week. “Mondays through Thursdays are the same; study, practice, drink a lot of coffee, watch some movies, and hang out with friends,” she said adding, “The weekends are more varied.” She finds campus to be boring at times, and said the advantages of being a commuter would be the opportunity of having a bigger room, a nice and cleaner bathroom, and hallway, and better interior, along with being able to vary the food a little more.
“I felt kind of trapped living on campus,” Scott said, explaining how she is more in control in her own house, “I can have it quiet when I want it to be quiet, without having to walk over to the library or somewhere else.” The two agree that the weekends especially make commuting a better choice: “Campus seems dead during the weekends,” Scott said. Also, because she lives at home, Scott has the freedom of inviting more people over. “On campus you’re only allowed to sign in two or three people to your room at a time,” she explained.
Dalae Min is a senior Broadcasting major living on-campus. She finds the advantages of living on-campus to be getting more sleep, and getting to class in just a couple of minutes. Still, she finds some disadvantages with dorm living. “During the weekends on campus there is really nothing to do,” she said, adding that she finds the location to be too far from the city and the mall.
Both commuting and on-campus living have benefits and disadvantages. A definite answer to what is better depends on what each student is more comfortable with. With these insights into what other students think, hopefully you have a better chance of deciding what suits you.

Despite the unseasonably mild winter we have had on Long Island, the warmer spring weather is still a welcomed mix of refreshing and renewing. The warm weather also brings about wonderful and vibrant new color trends. When it comes to spring colors, the brighter the better. Here is a list of my top five colors blooming this season.
 
The first color is coral, which is a mixture of pink and orange hues. Whether incorporating it through a bold lip color or a statement bag, coral is the color of the season. Many people tend to shy away from bright orange tones, so coral is a great alternative. It marries the best attributes of orange with the undeniable ease and femininity of pink.
 
Mint is another fabulous pastel color to update your spring wardrobe. The minty blue color craze began with the overwhelming number of mint-colored jeans in just about every store and boutique. This is a new take on the typical denim blue while still appearing quite subdued.
 
This next color is no longer just a studying tool. Try introducing some highlighter yellow into your life. I know, I know, I felt exactly the same way you probably are when I began researching the “it” colors for spring 2012. I am a grey, black, and navy kind of girl myself, but the effects that the color yellow have on everything from your mood to your wardrobe is evident. Besides, no one said you had to wear an entire neon yellow jumpsuit. Begin with a cute pair of flats or a bracelet.
 
Ever since I was a little girl, we had a lilac bush in my backyard. I could not wait for the day that the weather was temperate enough that the little flower buds would begin to bloom. It was almost like an alarm that alerted me to the beginning of spring. Stop to smell the many flowers around campus and you might find yourself a little slice of inspiration perfect for this season. Lilac nail polish, breezy blouses, or a cute dress… the possibilities are endless.
 
No spring color list would be complete without the mention of a certain color that we see every March 17. There is no need to save or put aside your kelly green for only St. Patrick’s Day, my budding fashionistas. Green is a relaxing, harmonious color that is sure to make nearly every lassie cheerful on the sunniest of spring days.
 
As author Susan J. Bissonette once wrote, “An optimist is the human personification of spring.” During spring, anything is possible. Spring is a chance for us to take some risks especially with our sense of style. There is no color too bold or too effervescent during this 2012 season, so go for it! Revitalize not only you, but your wardrobe as well. Happy springtime, everyone!

If there is one thing that I wasn’t taught in driver’s education, it was hazard lights. What is that button that looks like a triangle? Driving on the road and seeing people using the lights, I started to get the idea, but when is it totally appropriate to use these lights?
Commonly, hazard lights are used on cars that have broken down, been hit or are disabled. The lights are more useful at night so people don’t hit the car and are warned that this car is not working up to its potential. Those who drive with the hood up and hazard lights on are looking for help. Not that I have ever seen this situation before, but I suggest calling the cops if you ever see a vehicle driving like that because it is illegal to drive with the hood up. When driving behind a vehicle with its hazards flashing, the smart thing to do would be to go around it. If that is not possible because you are on a one-way street, slow down and respect the driver because they’re probably just as nervous and angry as you are. How would you feel if you had to drive your broken car somewhere?
Some other uses of the hazards are during harsh weather. During heavy rain or snow when driving on a main road, using the hazards is a good idea since it warns and alerts other drivers to slow down and take it easy because the road conditions are not good ahead. I hope people would be smart enough to not drive like fools in bad weather conditions, but these days you can never assume.
According to the federal law on hazard lights, only vehicles that are disabled or have lawfully stopped can have their hazard lights flashing. Cops may pull you over for using hazards for any purpose because they are afraid you are driving a dangerous vehicle or that you need help.
The hazard lights are trying to warn the people on the road so they know to go around you if you are going slowly or if you need to travel slowly. Hopefully none of us will need to use hazards in the future, but for future reference use them carefully and as always safe driving to all!

After football season ended, I was heartbroken. What was I going to spend all my time reading up on now? Two months later, I got my wish: Baseball, the American game, the greatest game ever played.
Many Americans can agree baseball is a fabulous sport – a long, drawn out one – but still an exciting one. This year with the recent big trades, we might be seeing different teams rising up from being underdogs. So here are my predictions for the 2012 MLB season.
The American League: With the introduction of Prince Fielder, having an MVP pitcher, and an almost trip to the World Series, the Detroit Tigers are looking pretty good. Look for them to definitely make the playoffs along with newly named LA Angels. The Angels just acquired one of the greatest players in the game, Albert Pujols. The Tampa Bay Rays have BJ Upton who is heading to becoming a contender for MVP. The Rays are also looking at new pitching that is sure to change the team.
The Yankees will also have to be mentioned because every year they seem to squeeze into the playoffs. With Alex Rodriguez healthy and the team having some of the best pitchers in the league, they’ll get something done, but I don’t predict they’ll win the series. I think the Red Sox might give them a run for the money. After last year’s speculation of the team drinking in the dugout, a fired coach, and playoff woes, the Sox are back with a new coach, Bobby Valentine, formerly of the New York Mets, who is not putting up with nonsense and vows to beat the Yankees. This rivalry isn’t ending anytime soon it seems.
 
The National League: The National League is looking much more interesting this year. I predict the NL will take the World Series title again. The team that got the buzz recently was the newly revamped Miami Marlins. The Marlins acquired ex-White Sox coach Ozzie Guillen, closer Heath Bell, Mets shortstop and NL batting leader Jose Reyes, and Mark Buehrle. The Marlins spent $190 million on their team. Will they make the playoffs? Doubtful. With the accident-prone Reyes and hot-tempered Guillen, the Marlins may fill up their stadium, but that’s about all for now.
The Washington Nationals may not be great this year, but in the next few years, the team will dominate the NL. Which brings us to the plagued New York Mets, my favorite team, but a team I can’t say too much about. With their money woes, injury-prone players, bad pitching, and lowered payroll, there’s not much to look forward to in the Mets future unless the Wilpons sell the team. This year won’t be the best year – they will probably finish in last – but as a Mets fan, I have hope they will be better because as Mets fans say, “Ya gotta believe.”
The Cincinnati Reds have had a few disappointing seasons recently, but this year they are expected to make a comeback. They added a few strong players to the roster and are expected to have the best rotation in the NL. The Philadelphia Phillies will keep their spot on their top and probably be the contender for the World Series this year. Their pitching is unbelievable, and so is their hitting. Other teams to look out for are the LA Dodgers, and the newly minted World Series Champion Cardinals. Although the Cardinals lost Pujols, they still have a solid team that can assure a playoff standing. The Dodgers can look forward to a new beginning. Similar to the Mets, they are coming off of being broke, but can look forward to new contenders and an awesome rotation.
The MLB season is looking more interesting than last year. I invite all to watch even if it’s not your favorite team or you need to distract yourself from a Mets game. Watch another team or even get into fantasy baseball if you really want to take a gamble. It’s less than 20 days until baseball season. I’m ready. Are you?

There cannot be a single New Yorker left who hasn’t at least heard of Jeremy Lin. Even if you’re not a fan of the NBA, you all must be aware that he plays for the New York Knicks. There has been more hype about this Asian-American player in Madison Square Garden then there has been about anyone in many years, even all-stars Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire.
Lin may be considered a key player for New York but that hasn’t always been the case. He was not offered any athletic scholarships out of high school and was undrafted out of Harvard in 2010. Lin was only able to reach a partially guaranteed contract with the Golden State Warriors. He barely played and was assigned to the NBA Development League three times, not exactly a good start to his career.
During the lockout, Lin was waived by the Warriors but was then claimed off waivers by the Houston Rockets. Lin played less then 10 minutes in two pre-season games before the Rockets decided to waive Lin to clear payroll on Christmas Eve. Then the Knicks claimed Lin off waivers on December 27th to be a backup point guard behind Toney Douglas and Mike Bibby. He went on to play only 55 minutes in the first 23 games.
On February 4, Lin had his breakout game against the New Jersey Nets with 25 points, five rebounds, and seven assists, leading the Knicks to 99-92 victory. After that game, Anthony was out because of an injury and Stoudemire was out because of a death in the family; it took about seven games before they all played together. Jeremy Lin was on fire. In his 12 starts before the All-Star break, he averaged 22.5 points and 8.7 assists. He wracked up wins against the Utah Jazz, Washington Wizards, Minnesota Timberwolves, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, and Los Angeles Lakers. Jeremy Lin was instrumental in bringing the Knicks back up to .500 not only with his own skill as a point guard, but also because he makes the rest of his team play better.
The media exploded with story of Jeremy Lin. He was pictured on the cover of two consecutive Sports Illustrated magazines, only the third NBA player in the magazine’s history to do so. Once the team began selling replicas of Lin’s jersey and t-shirts, the sales and traffic of the Knicks’ online store increased more than 3,000 percent. “Linsanity” has swept the nation. He’s still a rookie who makes plenty of mistakes and has a lot to learn, but it’s safe to say that he helped save the Knicks 2011-2012 season by making the team a contender for the playoffs.

            What was your favorite toy when you were growing up? A Spiderman action figure, a Barbie doll, or maybe a train set? Product recalls have been all over the news during the last decade ranging from foods to now, even children’s toys. These reports are provided by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and also news reports on toy recalls. Here are the ones, I think take the cake.
The Cabbage Patch Snack Time Kids Doll: We probably all remember the Cabbage Patch dolls, those insanely creepy dolls with the soul less eyes and disturbing grins. In 1996, a new line of dolls was released that were basically dolls with motorized mouths. Kids would feed the doll plastic vegetables and snacks. Only this toy ended up eating more than just plastic veggies. Kids hair would get caught in the dolls mouths’ and the dolls would literally rip the child’s hair out by the root and cause bleeding. In less than a year, the dolls were recalled. Also even more disturbing reports developed that the dolls eyes would turn blood red. Some people reported that the temperature in the room where the doll was would drop sufficiently when the doll was turned on. This was like a bad sequel to the movie “The Exorcist” called “Return of the Demonic Dolls.” I bet if they brought back the dolls for some reason, you would get a free bottle of holy water with every purchase.

“G.C.B.” is a funny, witty new drama on ABC based on the book, Good Christian Bitches. The show circles around Amanda Vaughn, played by Leslie Bibb, who moves back to her mother’s house with two teenage kids after 20 years following the death of her husband.
Even though Amanda has been away from Dallas, Texas for the last two decades, the women in this town find it very hard to believe Amanda, who once spread rumors and told over the top lies as the teen queen bee, is no longer the mean girl she was in high school. The women haven’t exactly grown out of their high school attitudes either.
Kristen Chenoweth plays Carlene Cockburn, a strong Texan religious woman who is out for revenge. She is also Amanda’s nosy neighbor and rival. Carlene has taken over Amanda’s post as the new queen bee, and what she says goes. These ladies formed a very tight-knit clan, where no secrets are kept for long. They all try to cause chaos in Amanda’s new life to get her to leave town.
There are definite similarities between “G.C.B.” and ABC’s hit show “Desperate Housewives” with all the scandals and secrets between the ladies that may come out within the season. “G.C.B.” may have the potential of replacing “Desperate Housewives,” which is in its final season.
“G.C.B.” airs on ABC Sunday nights at 10 p.m.

I am by no means a sushi connoisseur. In fact, my previous experiences with raw fish dishes were bad. This did not stop me (and tons of other people) from rushing to the grand opening of the newest restaurant in Oceanside: Masago.
This neo-Asian fusion establishment claims to use fresh ingredients in all of their dishes, and the presentation is phenomenal. You first enter the lobby and are greeted warmly in the quaint red and black themed eatery. The restaurant’s ambiance glows with delicate fixtures on the wall, and actual sushi chefs (decked in chef hats and armed with knives) are visible in the front.
The establishment features traditional dishes, like California and Rainbow Rolls, but it also has offerings that are not as banal, such as their Tekka Don Roll, which is a chef special of mixed tuna, seaweed salad and Oshinko rice.
The menu has a variety of options, including cooked dishes. I had the pleasure of savoring the Golden Spider Roll, which is composed of soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, scallion, and tobiko. The crab tastes very fresh and tender, and all of the ingredients come together in a harmony of flavors and textures without the ‘fishy’ aftertaste. Masago does offer desserts, like tempura ice cream, tiramisu, and other interesting-sounding dishes.
That being said, the food in this casual eatery is very affordable. A dinner for two can easily run you less than $20, tip included. My first impression of the restaurant was that it was going to be a little pretentious – I mean, really, neo-Asian Fusion? My thoughts immediately went to a glorified, Japanese PF Changs, but it is far from that. Enjoyable, enchanting atmosphere, and astounding prices… who could want more? Well, maybe just one more roll.
Masago is located at 32 Atlantic Avenue in Oceanside, NY, 11572. Its hours of operation are Monday-Friday 11:00 a.m. – 10:30 p.m., Saturday 12:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m., and Sunday 12:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. The restaurant’s phone number is 516-766-6888. Major credit cards are accepted.

One of the most fashionable and trendy places in Manhattan is a restaurant, bar, and lounge called “Onegin”. Opened quite recently, Onegin  has already received successful promotion, an appealing reputation and great popularity.
This lavish Russian bar and restaurant is located in Greenwich Village. The cuisine, as you can guess, is mostly Russian, so it’s the right place to go out if you want to try some traditional Russian dishes, like beef Stroganoff, caviar and blini (pancakes), and chicken Kiev. As for the alcoholic beverages, there is a full bar, where you can order whatever you want, including an amazing selection of flavors of house-infused vodkas. The prices are relatively high, but it’s not a big deal when you enjoy unique, tasty meals and your favorite drinks in an adorable atmosphere. “Onegin” has a terrific décor with 19th century-style portraits and huge chandeliers hanging from the ceilings, awesome sofas, and plush banquettes. The ambience is trendy and upscale, and you are expected to be dressed at least in a casual-elegant way.
The hours of operation are Sundays until Thursdays from 11:00 a.m. – 1:00 a.m., Fridays and Saturdays from 11:00 a.m. – 2:00 a.m. On Sundays, “Onegin” presents its brunch party from 1:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m., so if you miss your chance to attend a night club on Friday or Saturday nights, you can get a real clubbing atmosphere with loud music, disco lights, and cocktails on Sunday afternoon.
This place is surely worth going to at least once, though I am sure if you make your way there, you will truly want to come back for more of its terrific and unique experience.
The address of “Onegin” is 391 6th Ave., Manhattan, NY 10014. For more detailed information, you can visit the restaurant’s website at www.oneginnyc.com or send an e-mail at info@oneginnyc.com.  The phone number is (212) 924-8001. Enjoy your time and chillax at “Onegin.”

Known as Switzerland‘s largest city, Zurich is the first place tourists flog to. It is often referred to as the “portal to the Alps” because of the city’s close distance to tourist resorts in the Swiss Alps. Contrary to what some believe, Zurich is not the capital of Switzerland (that honor belongs to Berne.) However, Zurich has successfully generated a cosmopolitan vibe which has made it a fascinating and worthwhile travel destination. Furthermore, Zurich has been consistently ranked as the city with the best quality of life as well as the wealthiest city in Europe.
Airlines: Switzerland is highly accessible from all corners of the globe. Switzerland’s flag carrier airline, Swiss International Air Line, takes passengers directly to Zurich Airport, which is Switzerland’s largest and busiest airport.
Hotels/Lodging: Zurich is the financial center of Switzerland, and most travelers come with lots of money on them. Zurich is known for its superb hotels, but these won’t come cheap. As a result, the hospitality sector falls in the 4 and 5 star category. Whether you are a business traveler or a leisure traveler, finding a hotel to suit your need and budget is not a tough job. On your visit, stay in some of Zurich’s most luxurious hotels, including Alden Hotel Splugenschloss, Hotel Zum Storchen, Baur Au Lac, and Park Hyatt Zurich. These establishments will allow you to enjoy the best of modern-day comfort and luxuries, blended with traditional hospitality. Bed and breakfasts are also very popular in Zurich. The city also offers an amazing selection of mid-range accommodations, including the X-Tra Hotel, Hotel Bristol Zurich, Hotel Wildenmann, and Best Western Premier Hotel Glockenhof. For budget travelers, hotels, such as Hostel Suisse and Youthhostel Zurich, are simply unbeatable.
Attractions/Sightseeing: Zurich offers so many sights to see. A relaxed stroll through the city reveals something amazing at every corner: architectural highlights, historic squares, streets and districts, churches, works of art, and much more. The city is also visually striking, with the River Limmat snaking through and the snow-covered Alps looming in the background. Being fairly compact for a major European city, Zurich is perhaps best seen on foot. Cultural attractions are aplenty. Zurich boasts over two dozen museums, including the renowned Kunsthaus and the intriguing Swiss National Museum. As for distinctive architecture, check out the twin towers at Grossmünster Cathedral as well as the seventeenth century Rathus, which is Zurich’s baroque town hall. Shoppers will want to stroll down the cosmopolitan Bahnhofstrasse, where they can get anything from diamond rings to chocolate to fur coats.
Cuisine: Probably the most famous of Swiss foods, fondue is typically a pot of melted cheese into which you dip pieces of bread. Although cheese fondue is the most popular, fondue does not necessarily have to be made with cheese; there are meat fondues, too. Breakfast is one of the best meals in Switzerland. Muesli was invented in Switzerland and is always available for breakfast. Switzerland also has a great variety of breads. The Zopf is a white bread often eaten on Sundays for breakfast with butter, cheese, jam, or honey. Like most European cities, Zurich is abundant with cafés where you can enjoy a leisurely cup of coffee, glass of wine, or other beverage. For the best dining and entertainment, take in Niederdorf, which is the historic old town in city center.

The LIU Post women’s swim team spent much of its 2012 Spring Break in Texas, participating in the four day NCAA Championship meet from March 14th-17th. At the meet, a number of Post swimmers walked away with both All-American recognition and new school records.
The Pioneers finished their southern experience with a 20th place finish out of 37 teams from around the nation, six positions better than the team’s 2011 finish. Wayne State, out of Detroit, walked away with the national title with a grand total of 497 points.
Sophomore Tamara Garriock kicked the events off for the Pioneers, competing in the 200 individual medley preliminary. However, her 2:07.26 time, which put her in 20th place, was not enough to advance to the finals.
Later in the first day of competition, senior swimmer Cornelia Hanes provided the Pioneers with their first finals appearance of the meet in the 50 freestyle. After swimming a 23.54 in preliminaries, tying for 13th, she completed the final race in 24.01 to take 16th place and to give LIU Post one point in overall meet standings. Hanes also garnered All-American Honorable Mention recognition for the event.
To round out day one, Hanes and Garriock joined with teammates Mairi Morrison, a junior, and Johanna Pettersson, a freshman, to fight it out in the competitive 200 medley relay. In preliminaries, the team completed the race at 1:45.55, a new school record. In finals, the team’s 1:46.19 proved enough to land it in 14th place, accumulating six more points towards the team’s total score, and earning it an All-American Honorable Mention nod.
After coming into day two of competition with just seven total team points, the Pioneers turned up the heat March 15th, putting 33 more points on the board and moving into 17th place overall. By the end of the day, the Pioneers had also earned two more All-American Honorable Mentions in the 200 free relay and 400 medley relay and an All-American Honor, awarded to Garriock in the 200 free.
The Pioneers also broke a number of school records on the second day of the Championship, including Garriock’s 1:50.92 in the 200 free preliminaries and the team’s 3:52.45 in the 400 medley relay.
Garriock began day three for LIU Post when she competed in the 500 free. For the second straight day, she earned All-America honors, this time with a Pioneer record-breaking 4:55.19 that landed her in fifth place and gave the LIU Post team 14 points. Next, Pettersson received All-American Honorable Mention recognition for her efforts in the consolation final of the 100 back.
To round out the team’s NCAA run, the Pioneer 400 free relay, consisting of Garriock, Hanes, Pettersson, and Morrison, swam a 3:29.64 to both earn yet another All-American Honorable Mention and break another school record.
The Pioneers cap their 2011-2012 season with a perfect 7-0 record, a big step up from 2010-2011’s 3-7 record.

On Saturday, March 10th, the LIU Post men’s basketball team lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament against the third-seeded Adelphi Panthers by a score of 66-65. The Pioneers came into the game as the sixth seed in the East Region, as they won the East Coast Conference and were given an automatic bid into the tournament.
Both teams started the game off slow and were unable to get any offense going through much of the first half of play. At the end of the half, the Panthers led 29-26. Both teams played solid defense and caused difficult shot opportunities. The Pioneers only trailed by three points because of their perimeter shooting. Through the half, the Pioneers made only 10 shots, but four of those shots were three-pointers. Graduate guard Vince Rosario and junior guard Tobin Carberry each drained a pair of three-pointers, which accounted for nearly half of the Pioneers’ scoring output during the first 20 minutes of play.
The second half was more up-tempo, as both teams could sense winning the game and advancing into the next round of the tournament. Both teams answered each other and hit clutch shots down the stretch as the game went back and forth.
The Pioneers remained in the game despite not getting the usual production from senior guard Stefan Bonneau. Bonneau, the East Coast Conference Player of the Year, had one of the quietest games of his Pioneers career. The Panthers’ defense was swarming and constantly pressured Bonneau, causing him to score only six points and turn the ball over seven times. With just about five minutes left to play and the game still in the balance, Bonneau went down with a hip injury and had to be helped off the floor.
However, despite Bonneau’s absence in the game, the Pioneers still led 63-56 with three minutes remaining in the game. With just over two minutes left, Panthers’ junior forward Bradley Simpson hit one of his three three-pointers in the game to cut the Pioneers’ lead to only four points.
With the score 65-64 in favor of the Pioneers, sophomore forward Vaughn Allen missed a difficult shot inside with 20 seconds left in the game. Following a timeout, Panthers junior guard Chris Ranglin put up a wild missed shot in the paint with seven seconds left, but Panthers senior forward Norron McDonald grabbed the offensive rebound and made the lay-up. McDonald’s put back gave the Panthers a 66-65 lead with 1.8 seconds left, which ended up being the final score.
Sophomore forward Vaughn Allen led the Pioneers in both points and rebounds, as he finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds.
Despite the tough loss in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Pioneers had a tremendous second season under head coach Chris Casey. The Pioneers won the East Coast Conference, finished with a 23-6 overall record, and went 15-1 during conference play.
The Pioneers also had several players win awards for their individual accomplishments. In addition to being named East Coast Conference Player for the second consecutive season, senior guard Stefan Bonneau was named the 2012 Division II East Region Player of the Year, as he finished third in the country in scoring at 22.3 points per game. Along with Bonneau, junior guard Tobin Carberry and sophomore forward Vaughn Allen were named to the ECC All-Conference First Team. Carberry averaged 17.9 points and 5.9 rebounds per game, while Allen averaged 15.0 points and 9.6 rebounds per game. In addition, freshman forward Tyuan Williams was named the 2012 ECC Rookie of the Year. In his first season, Williams put up 8.5 points and 7.9 rebounds per contest.
Although the Pioneers’ season ended in heartbreaking fashion, the 2011-2012 campaign was a great year for the Pioneers, and there is plenty to look forward to next season.

The LIU Post Lady Pioneers basketball team’s season came to end with a 57-56 loss to the Southern Connecticut Owls in the first round of the NCAA Division II Championship Tournament.
This is the second year in a row that Pioneers fell in the first round of the tournament.
Senior guard Felicia Joyner led the Lady Pioneers with 16 points in the loss. Sophomore guard Alexis Peters added 13 points of her own, while contributing nine assists and three steals. As a team, the Pioneers shot 39 percent (21-53) from the field and 33 percent (3-9) from three-point range.
In the first half, LIU Post went on an 18-4 run to jump ahead of the Owls 22-9. The run was highlighted by layups from junior guard Ashley Caggiano, Peters, and Joyner, and sophomore guard Kenyatta Sears. The Owls were able to move within ten points at the end of the first half trailing 27-17.
The Lady Pioneers extended their lead to 16 points early in the second half with buckets from Peters and junior forward Nicolette Marciniak, as well as two free-throw shots added by Joyner.
But that lead would begin to disappear as the half progressed. With 13:28 left in the half, Owls’ senior guard Alex Fiola hit a three pointer to cut it to a 12-point Pioneer lead. Sophomore center Moni Smith-Ocran made a lay up to cut the lead to 10. The two teams would trade baskets, but the Owls’ Smith-Ocran hit a layup to make it an eight-point game. Senior guard Sylvonya Moore made another layup to cut it to a six-point lead and then followed with a jump shot to make it a four point Owls deficit.
Trailing by two, Fiola stole the ball from the Lady Pioneers and, with 6:08 left to play, Smith-Ocran tied the game at 45.  Joyner answered back with a jump shot and Peters hit one of two free throws and moved the Pioneers back ahead by three. But, Owls junior forward Keshia Primo made a layup and was fouled on the play. She hit the free throw and tied the game once again.
The Lady Pioneers and Owls traded the lead for several minutes, but LIU Post managed to pull ahead by five with 1:37 left to play.
Once again the Owls quickly chipped away at the Lady Pioneer lead. Owls sophomore forward Shaniqua Fuller made a layup on an Owls fast break and was fouled by Marciniak. Fuller hit both of the subsequent free throws to make it 57-56 Pioneers. Fiola fouled Joyner with 14 seconds left in the game, but she missed the front end of her one and one free throws. Primo came down with the rebound for the Owls and Southern Connecticut got the ball to Moore, who quickly moved the ball up the court and made the game winning layup with 4.7 seconds left in the game.
Felicia Joyner was able to get off one last shot for the Pioneers, but fell short and the Owls held on for the 57-56 victory.
The Pioneers finished the season with a record of 21-10, their highest win total since the 1987-88 season. It also marks an end to the careers of Catherine Lutz and Joyner.
Lutz, a graduate student, played one season with the Pioneers. She put up 243 points over the course of this season and averaged 7.8 points per game. Joyner, a senior, averaged 16.9 points per game this season and scored a total of 525 points this year. Over her four-year career at Post she scored 1,563 points.
As a team the Pioneers averaged 73.8 points per game and shot .412 from field goal range and .323 from beyond the arch.
