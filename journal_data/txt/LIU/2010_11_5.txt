The C.W. Post football team is coming off two incredibly crushing losses to great teams. But the Pioneers could only afford to drop one of those games, and have now backed themselves into a corner by falling to Kutztown first. And even though last week’s loss against Bloomsburg had all the odds stacked against Post, excuses cannot be made for the Pioneers.
The Bloomsburg Huskies came into last week’s contest as the 13th-ranked team in Division II. The team featured Franklyn Quiteh, the leading rusher in the country across all divisions. The program has been wildly successful for years. Despite all of those accolades, C.W. Post had no room for error. And the way the Pioneers played, it didn’t seem like the team was aware of the severity of the game.
On a day where the Pioneers had trouble moving the ball against a tough defense, the offense did not do itself many favors with several mistakes. An illegal motion call erased a 13-yard completion to Darnel Williams. The team recorded 7 fumbles, 2 of which went to Bloomsburg. Two loose balls were the result of low shotgun snaps by Center Will Strano.
Quarterback Eric Anderwkavich did not have his most impressive performance of the year. Anderwkavich only completed 50% of his passes, and while he only has 1 interception on the box score, there were several balls dropped by the defense that could have been turnovers.
The running game did not show up either. Thomas Beverly’s only carry was on the first play from scrimmage. He fumbled the ball and gave it to Bloomsburg at the Pioneers’ 31-yard line, which set up a Huskies touchdown. Beverly limped off the field after that play and Freshman Halfbacks Anthony Brunetti and Jeff Mack took over. The two combined for just 67 yards and did not make a big impact.
WCWP’s color commentator Ryan Pettys pointed out the questionable play-calling. Pettys suggested that late in the game, the Pioneers should move to a 5 wide receiver set. C.W. Post had success with that formation in their 50-48 loss to Kutztown two weeks ago. However, the Pioneers continued to use running back sets. When Post finally went to 5-Wide, Anderwkavich was able to move the offense down the field.
And with all of those offensive mistakes, the score was still close in the 3rd quarter because of strong red-zone defense. Bloomsburg was forced to kick 5 field goals and failed to get in the end zone, but the offense never capitalized.
Now, the Pioneers have a very slim shot at getting into a playoff spot. We all knew these would be tough games down the stretch, but no one expected the Pioneers to disappoint the way they have. With two games left to play, Post will be scoreboard watching.

Following a tough double-overtime loss to Nyack College, the C.W. Post Men’s Soccer team bounced back to beat Queens College 2-0 in a must-win game to clinch a spot for the ECC Championships.
On Thursday, Post squared off against the out-of-conference team. Early in the game, sophomore forward Betim Bajrami struck the back of the net for his sixth goal of the year, and second consecutive game recording a goal.
The Pioneers played lockdown defense and controlled the tempo for most of the game. But Nyack put up a last attempt to tie up the score in the waning moments of the game, and did so successfully. With just over one minute remaining, Nyack evened the score up at one goal apiece.
Both teams could not close out the game after the first overtime session, but Nyack found a way to finish off the Pioneers in the second overtime period with a late goal from Ryan Walters.
After a difficult 2-1 loss to Nyack College (7-10), the Pioneers had to keep their heads up because a win versus Queens College (5-12-1) would mean they would qualify for the ECC Championships.
Midway through the first half, senior forward Rumen Kerekov scored off a header from freshman back Eirik Bjoernoe to give Post the early advantage 1-0.
“There was some pressure in the beginning, said Kerekov.  “But when we scored the first goal everything came into place.”
In a pressure-packed game, the Pioneers thrived on offense by scoring yet again off a header. This time, junior midfielder Neil Franco was the recipient of the Eirik Bjoernoe pass.
“The team was organized, we were fighting hard, and we did not let the other team play with the ball as much,” mentioned Kerekov. “We were clearly the better team.”
The Pioneers came up clutch winning the game that absolutely needed to be won in order to qualify for the ECC Championships. The final score ended up being 2-0 in favor of the Pioneers in their most important game of the year.
The Pioneers (7-8-1) are currently the number four seed in the ECC Championships. The final ECC seedings have yet to be determined, but Post is confident with whomever their opponent is this upcoming Friday.
“I strongly believe that if we beat the team on Friday we will win the conference title. If we play on Friday in the same way we played against Queens we will definitely get what we need,” declared Kerekov.

Post was in for a challenge, taking on 13th-ranked Bloomsburg University at Hickox Field, for the final home game of the season this past Saturday.
The Bloomsburg Huskies, 6-0 in the division, started out quickly going up 16-0 before the Pioneers could even get on the board, and would not score a touchdown until the final minutes of the third quarter.
The Huskies scored the first touchdown of the day when Pat Carey threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to make the score 7-0. The Pioneers held the Huskies out of the end zone, but couldn’t keep them far enough away from field goal range. Bloomsburg kicker Dan Fisher connected for five field goals on the day, three of which came in the first half.
Post finally got on the board, when the Husky offense was called for a holding penalty on its own three yard line, forcing a safety. The score stood at 16-2 Bloomsburg at the half.
Husky kicker Dan Fisher kicked a pair of field goals to increase the Huskies lead to 22-2, but Post responded when Erik Anderwkavich found Darnell Williams in the end zone, to cut the deficit 22-9.
However, before the Pioneers could get something going offensively the defense allowed a pair of touchdowns to put the Husky’s farther ahead 36-9. Post attempted to respond, scoring on a pass to Joe Botti for a 19-yard touchdown. But the rally was too late, and the Pioneers fell to the Huskies 36-16 in the final game at Hickox Field this season.
Anderwkavich finished with 209 yards passing and two touchdowns, Botti led the team in receiving with 54 yards on four catches and freshman running back Jeff Mack rushed the ball for 34 yards. Ronnie Modik and Billy O’Connor each led the team with 12 tackles.
Prior to the game, the coaching staff honored the seniors and during half time Ronnie Modik was given the Durrell “Bronko” Pearsall award.  This award is given annually in memory of C.W. Post Alumni Durrell Pearsall, who lost his life in the World Trade Center attack on September 11th, 2001.
The Pioneers look to bounce back next Saturday when they travel to Cheyney University.  Coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com begins at 12:30 PM with kickoff slated for 1 PM.

The Pioneer Field Hockey team suffered a 4-3 triple-overtime shootout loss at the hands of Kutztown University after coming back from a two goal deficit.
The loss dropped 7th-ranked Post’s record to an even 8-8 overall and 1-5 in Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Eastern Division play, while boosting fellow PSAC East member Kutztown to 9-6 on the season.
The 5th-ranked Golden Bears started the scoring early in the game when Jenna Gregory hit the back of the net just over six minutes into play. However, Kutztown’s lead was cut short when Pioneers’ freshman Carlee Dragon quickly responded with a goal of her own less than three minutes later. However, the Golden Bears would reclaim the lead going into the half with another score.
With 25 minutes left to play in the second half, Kutztown scored another goal to increase their lead to 3-1. Yet charging back with two goals from senior forward Amanda Nann, Post would again cost the Golden Bears the lead and send the game into overtime.
After two scoreless rounds of overtime, the match would ultimately be decided by a shootout. Kutztown four out of five attempts earned Kutztown the win over the Pioneers who scored two goals in four attempts. Senior goalkeeper Cortney Colern had a solid day notching 26 saves in a game in which the Pioneers were outshot 42-14.
Post field hockey will be back in action looking to end their four-game losing streak this Saturday, November 6th against Indiana University of Pennsylvania at home on Hickox Field.

The C.W. Post Men’s and Women’s Cross Country team were back in action this past Saturday as both teams competed in the St. Josephs College Invitational in Kings Park, NY.
On both sides the Cross Country squad put on exceptional performances in the race that had a mix of Division I, II, and III teams. Both the men’s and women’s squad took home trophies from Saturday’s race.
The Lady Pioneer’s competed in a 5k race. Coming in first for the women was freshman Jennifer McLaughlin who ran a time of 21:28, which placed her 5th overall. Coming in second was sophomore Caitlin Smith who ran a time of 21:51 placing 7th. The third Lady Pioneer to cross the line was freshman Karissa Chiantella with a time of 22:20. Not far behind was freshman Angelica Price finishing 14th overall and with a time of 22:29.  Rounding out the top five for the women was Sara McLaughlin who came in at 23:15.
The women had a great showing, beating conference schools such as Dowling and New York Institute of Technology to place first among Division II schools. Overall in the race the women came in second. “Today was a test to see where we stood against some of our conference competition before the ECC championship race,” said Jennifer McLaughlin. “We proved to ourselves as a squad that we are right where we need to be in order to win the conference championship in a few weeks.”
The men’s squad once again competed in an 8k race. First to finish was graduate student Vincent Giambanco with a time of 27:55, placing 6th overall. Right on his trail was freshman Joseph Lasher who ran a time of 27:56. The Pioneer’s third man was sophomore Raymond Coyle who clocked in at 28:23. Coming in 10th place was sophomore Matthew O’Keefe with a time of 28:26. Rounding out the top five was sophomore Christian Altamura who crossed the line in 28:38, placing 12th overall. The men dominated the race as they not only placed first in Division II but placed first overall in the race.
“After today’s race we have our two championship races and based on today’s performances I believe we are ready,” proclaimed Sara McLaughlin. “We have trained all year for ECC’s and Regionals and I think we are in a good position to do great things on both the men’s and women’s side.”
The Cross Country team will be back in action on November 7th as they host the East Coast Conference Championship meet right here on campus. The men look to defend their conference title and the women look to make a statement by capturing their first cross country conference title since 2005.

We have all heard that line from Mean Girls: “Halloween is the one night a year when girls can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.” While the first part might be true the second most likely is not. If a girl does dress like that, most people would have something to say about it, perhaps both positive and negative. So is it really a bad thing that girls dress this way?
Go into any Halloween store and you will see young children with their cute costumes, scary ones for men, and skimpy outfits for women. The costume store, Party City even has a section titled “sexy costumes” on their website, which is just three tabs away from children’s costumes.
So while your younger sister can be a cute Snow White, you can be seductive Snow White. Elmo becomes Sassy Elmo, Big Bird is Sassy Big Bird, and Minnie Mouse is now called Mickey’s Mistress.
Now, many would argue these are women’s costumes; parents would never allow their children to wear these kinds of outfits. However, the teen costumes really are not that much better. They may have changed the names, but the short skirts and seductive nature is still there.
So is this really a bad thing? “I’m in the middle,” says Senior Marissa Russo. “It does have a negative effect on younger girls to see outfits like this, but if you are older and you’re comfortable with your body it’s okay. It depends on where you are wearing this too. If it’s a party with other older people that’s fine. Girls should not wear these outfits trick-or-treating though.”
Junior Cori Rende has a different take on these kinds of Halloween costumes,
“it is okay to an extent, but if you’re walking out the door and your mom is yelling at you then you know it’s probably bad.”
There are two arguments as to why girls choose to dress this way. The first says that they are doing it for attention. The other says girls do it because it has become a social norm. In an article for AOL-news, dating expert Marc Rudov commented, “I expect guys to wear gory costumes on Halloween, but if women are going to be slutty, it does send a signal. You can’t say, ‘I was slutty for Halloween, but that’s not really me’.”
Do guys really think this is appealing?  Junior James Sullivan says there really is no point for girls to wear such provocative costumes. “It is appealing to see less clothes but that’s about it,” thought Sullivan. “All the girls wear nothing for Halloween and they expect attention. Sure they get it for the first hour but then everyone just starts talking to the girls wearing regular costumes.”
When asked their opinion, Matt Marando, Nick Marshall, and Andrew Emerson unanimously agreed it is appealing for girls to wear such costumes. Although, they did say it was only okay if it were girls “18 and over.” Marshall went on to comment that it is only one night a year, “but it can be bad for younger girls, and some parents might not like it.”
In the end it seems that it is a lose-lose battle. It goes back to the movie Mean Girls, the main character Cady went to a party dressed as a zombie bride, and people talked about her because she was dressed scary instead of slutty. On the other hand, her friends went dressed slutty and people still spoke ill about them.
It is really a personal decision, and students agree, if you are old enough and comfortable then go for it. Just do not open the door to trick or treaters dressed in the “Holly the Heart Stopper” nurse costume.

Well freshmen, throughout the last week or so many of you have probably been smacked in the face with the reality that midterms are here; which means your first semester as a freshman is almost over. Pat yourselves on the back– you’ve made it. Experience is the greatest teacher, or so they say, and now that you have some of that under your belt here is some advice for surviving what is left of your freshman year. There are so many crucial things to know that it is difficult to number them in an order of importance, so take them as you will.

Make a connection. Many of us come from high schools where your success is tracked and ensured by teachers and advisors. However, at college it is important to go out and make that connection yourself. Make yourself known to your advisor, your professors, and the head of your department. All of these connections will help you out in the long run. Always make a plan before going to a meeting with someone; for example, if you are going to plan your schedule with your advisor make sure your own voice is heard, not that you are just complying with what they want you to do. If you are not satisfied with something, question it and go see someone else. College is all about being independent and going after what you want. You wouldn’t want to miss out on an opportunity because someone gave you wrong information and you didn’t double check.
Freshman Jonathan Seltzer advises to “know when to study and when to have fun. I learned through experience by going out and getting a bad grade on a test the next day,” he said. Priorities are especially important as a college student. Whether you live on campus or commute, knowing how to differentiate when it’s time to do school work and time to party will make or break your semester. If you don’t stay on track with your classes, it will impact the outcome of your semester drastically. Make schedules for yourself and set aside time every day to study and do homework. If you have an hour and a half break in the middle of the day, solely dedicate that time to school work and you will feel much better than knowing later that night you can’t go out because you have to study for a test.
This is supposedly one of the best experiences of your life, and it is in your power to do everything you can to make that happen. “Use ‘rate my professor’! It helps a lot!” sophomore Georgia Tsoumas said.  At C.W. Post, students make their own schedules so take advantage of that. Make your experience as rich as you possibly can. Think about what interests you and then apply it to how you can contribute to the campus community using your interests. Whether you get a job at the Pratt to not only make some extra cash but meet great people, or take a yoga class during common hour, it will still give you a chance to meet others with common interests. Being a freshman can be an overwhelming experience, but C.W. Post offers many resources for you to have a great year so make sure to take advantage of anything you can.

In last week’s issue, we would like to apologize for the front cover story.  Our intention was to write an article about the South Hampton radio station, which is part of Long Island University.  The photo and headline were very deceiving and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
We would like to apologize for not publishing ACP’s letter along with our response in last week’s issue.  We value your opinion and sincerely apologize for not displaying your thoughts.  Here is your letter in response to the Pioneer’s Homecoming issue.
October 25, 2010
To the Editor of the Pioneer,
On behalf of the Association for Campus Programming (A.C.P.) as well as the additional clubs and organizations on campus we would like to express our distaste with The Pioneer’s last issue covering C.W. Post’s Homecoming 2010.
The images displayed conveyed one focal point in our eyes, tailgating during the football game. This is not a sanctioned event and should not have been publicized to the extent that it was. Instead, we would have liked to see more of the events leading up to the actual family day event that is Homecoming.
A.C.P. is responsible for Homecoming Week, seven days of events leading up to the actual Homecoming game. Kicking off Homecoming week on Sunday was the co-sponsored A.C.P and Commuter Student Association (C.S.A.) Six Flags Freight Fest trip. This event was sold out, sending 2 bus loads of Post students to Six Flags.  On Monday, A.C.P. sponsored Monday Night Football, a program where students were able to watch the game in Hillwood Commons Cinema. We raffled off a pair of New York Jets tickets. Tuesday, we held the kickoff event for the Banner Bash; an annual event in which all clubs and organizations participate in. Wednesday, A.C.P. sponsored its annual talent show with over 200 students supporting diverse student performers.  The first place winner, a C.W. Post student, Annie Jules (junior) sang an inspirational rendition of Stand Up by Destiny’s Child, yet no mention of this in the Pioneer. Finally, on Thursday evening we had our first ever Homecoming Ball.  At this event the finalists of the Post Pride award were recognized and made speeches about what Post Pride meant to each of them.  There was no mention of this or who even won the Post Pride awards at all in the Pioneer. Finally, on Friday evening, A.C.P. in conjunction with the Office of Student Life & Leadership Development sponsored the annual Homecoming Pep Rally. Over 1000 students, athletes, guests and administration were in attendance. This event, by far exemplified the very definition of “POST PRIDE.” With performances by students, the dance company, residence life students and athletes, there was no press by the Pioneer about this annual event or event a word describing the event in the last issue of the Pioneer.
The purpose of Post unity was not exemplified in the photographs that were run in the last issue of the Pioneer. There was no sense of actual post pride and what it means; a sense of leadership, family, and involvement in our campus. Coverage of homecoming week and all the activities that surrounded the actual game, including the annual carnival which is co-sponsored by A.C.P. and the Office of Student Life & Leadership Development were minimal to nonexistent.
Homecoming is a day of family, friends, alumni, and current students celebrating all that Post has grown to be. Over fifty clubs and organizations worked diligently to represent their contributions to Post’s life. The clubs and organizations raised over $4000 during the carnival. A lot of the funds went to charity and local philanthropic organizations, yet all the the Pioneer showcased was the non sanctioned drinking and the lewd activity demonstrated by a small collection of students.  If the Pioneer was in need of positive images throughout the week, the Opticon staff was available and in attendance at every Homecoming event and captured every positive moment.  Furthermore, we are extremely disappointed that the student run newspaper didn’t see fit to cover all the hard work and efforts put forth by hundreds of student leaders.
In closing, students, student athletes, alumni, faculty, staff and administrators contributed their time and efforts to pull off a successful Homecoming.  All that we ask is everyone is thanked appropriately for their hard work and dedication for Homecoming 2010. Homecoming 2010 is a celebration of student life at C.W. Post, not the negative portrayal that the Pioneer condones and displayed
With Regards,
Association for Campus Programming 2009-2010 Executive Board

Here at The Pioneer we’re always looking for new contributors. So here is a list of reasons why you should join your student newspaper!  Drum roll please…
 
*Getting a paper out every week can be a daunting task that takes a lot of effort. There are too many hot topics and not enough writers to cover it all. If there is a topic you would like to see covered come to the meeting! Or you can email an idea to cwpstpnr@gmail.com and ask if you could write the article. And if you think you aren’t a decent writer, we have editors who are here to help to make your work top notch to be published.
 
*Build your resume: joining an extra-curricular activity is great to put on your resume! When looking for a job seeing that extra imitative makes you stand out from other applicants.
 
*Earn 3 credits: If you’ve taken journalism 4 and 5, you are eligible to take journalism 41 in which you can earn 3 credits for a semester! The best part of this class is that it only meets Monday from 12:30-1:30 in The Pioneer office. Articles are due by 5p.m. on Sunday and they go into the next issue.
 
*Meetings are only an hour: We all know that school can be stressful and tiring but now with common hour interrupting the middle of everyone’s day, sometimes it’s nice to have a little break from class. However, it could get boring trying to find a place to go. If you get bored, come find your way to The Pioneer’s office and sit in on a meeting, introduce yourself to the editors.  Who knows, you might even be intrigued by what you hear but as our parents told us, you won’t know until you try.
 
*Free lunch: Who can pass up a free anything? Come to the meetings and enjoy a free lunch sponsored by Lontza’s pizza. There’s always enough for all and drinks are included.
 
*Make great friends: If you are looking to mingle and meet new people well than this is just the meeting for you. Here at The Pioneer, the staff is extremely friendly and we are always open for meeting new people.
 
*Choose your topic: maybe there’s a topic you want to write about that you haven’t seen in the past issues. Come to the meetings and ask, just as easy as 1-2-3! If you are passionate about a certain topic, get it approved and write about it. Again you don’t have to be the best writer because everything is edited and we want to make your work as awesome as you intended it to be.
 
*You don’t have to write: Fact: you hear newspaper and automatically assume the staff is all writers. False. In fact, there are other jobs besides writing that are pivotal to this paper. We need more advertisers who will go out to local businesses and find shops that are willing to spend money on an ad for our paper! Ads are how media publications work since a bulk of their money comes from that factor alone. I also need help with promotions! Hanging posters and getting the word out about the paper is hard work for just one person. What’s the kicker in all of this? If you are one of those students who are eligible for journalism 41, you can receive credit for doing just this, advertising and promoting! Now that’s what I’m talking about.
 
*Find an internship: In a few years when you all go out into the real world and look for those post graduate jobs, you are going to want to have all the experience you want. Being that this is a student newspaper, companies in the industry are looking for peppy interns who are eager to learn. The Pioneer post internships that they are sent for everyone to see. If anyone is interested, the information and the job description are posted.
 
*It’s just fun: Every week the meetings are a great place to interact with your peers and make new friends. The conversation is never dull and we always share some laughs. Maybe you have a friend on the staff? Come visit them and have some lunch! Chances are they will talk up the paper so much that you’d be motivated to join! There’s no pressure. Maybe you attend a meeting and it isn’t for you. Being on a newspaper staff isn’t meant for everyone.
 
If you are interested in anything you’ve just read or you want more information, The Pioneer staff meets every Monday from 12:30-1:30 in The Pioneer office (upstairs in Hillwood, just follow the signs)! And please don’t forget to visit of website at www.liu.edu/cwpost/pioneer.

Change can be a frightening thing. Whether it is good or bad change, it is extremely hard to alter our normal behavior. It is especially quite challenging when it comes to making changes in our everyday eating and working out regimes. Many of us feel as though it’s impossible–– “it’s too hard, it doesn’t work, there’s not enough time, I JUST CAN’T DO IT!” The excuses are endless. Although it may sound cliche, anything is possible, but like stated in the previous issue, nothing works over night.  Everything takes time. Slow change is change that is more realistic and surprisingly gratifying. Rushing to loose ten pounds in two weeks creates unrealistic goals and irritating failures. It is all about changing your lifestyle in incremental and realistic steps that become embedded in your everyday life on a daily basis.
 
For those of you who feel that there is just no hope, here is a little test trial the Pioneer would like to challenge you with. For three days, yes just three days, make FIVE small healthy changes to your everyday routine. They do not have to be extreme changes, but small tweaks here and there to fix an unhealthy habit. These little steps in the right direction are huge accomplishments within themselves. After completing the three days, you will prove to yourself that you can do it, and “change” can be quite rewarding after all.
Examples of healthy tweaks to take on during your three day Pioneer challenge, good luck!
 
Have the whites of eggs only, forgo the whole egg.
Use whole wheat toast instead of white.
Drink water, not orange juice.
Grab an apple, not a bag of chips.
Walk the extra long way to class, don’t take shortcuts.
Take the stairs, not the elevator.
NO SUGAR for one whole day.
Walk around the campus after meals.
Don’t go for second Winnick rounds.
Don’t pick, sit down to eat your meals.
Add a serving of fiber.
Skip the dessert.
Don’t snack two hours before bed.
Drink an extra glass of water.
Stay an extra twenty minutes at the gym.
Smile.
 
Stay positive throughout the three-day challenge. Have faith in yourself that anything you put your heart into, you will accomplish. Whether it is simply choosing water over soda, go you! 
 
 
What is ever more important is your mental health. Beyond all eating and exercising regimes, the number one thing is to be happy. Just as we take care of our outer being by eating right and working out, we need to make sure we are in tune with our inner being, our true self – our mind. Now that mid-term week is over, we are a lot less stressed and much more relaxed. It is time now to slow our roll, take a deep breath, and concentrate on ourselves for a change. Take a day off as a “me” day; a day where you can be completely selfish and cater to your individual needs. Shut off your phone, disconnect your Internet and your Blackberry, and refuse to enter the world of Facebook. Take a long hot shower, have a nutritious breakfast, run around campus, play your favorite music all day long, read the book/magazine you never got to read, explore something new, or just simply sit back, relax and do absolutely anything and everything you want.
 
We must all understand that life isn’t so serious, and when we become overwhelmed within society is when we are going to damage both our inner and outer beings. We start to become concerned with our self-image, some of us even relieving such pressure through extreme dieting and exercising. After four years here at C.W. Post, the most important thing I learned is that we are who we are, and whether society likes it or hates it, embrace what you have and be the best person you can be. Those who truly love you will love you no matter if you’re in shape, out of shape, healthy or unhealthy. Believing in yourself is the most attractive quality someone can have, and when you accept that is when the social pressure will be relieved. So yes, when you’re on that date, don’t try to act like someone you’re not and order the salad because it’s more socially acceptable. If you want the cheeseburger, get the cheeseburger. If you do want to make healthy changes to your lifestyle, do it for you, because you want to do it, not for anyone else. 
 
With that, have a happy, healthy and easy-going week. Try the three-day challenge and please share your experience at  HYPERLINK “mailto:katieshealth@gmail.com” katieshealth@gmail.com. 
 
🙂 Katie

“Well my boyfriend and I, when we do have the opportunity to have sex, pick at least three new positions to try,” Michelle, a senior at C.W. Post, said. She was part of a group of friends seated in Hillwood during common hour who, in addition to eating, were all looking at a relatively new iPhone application that illustrates different sexual positions. It’s called ‘kalm sutra’ and is a hit with college students.
“I’ve done that position, and that one, and that one, and that one,” Eric, another senior, said as the iPhone was passed to him. Eric and Michelle were willing to talk about sex and the application if I agreed to only use first names. “Actually I’ve done most, if not all of these positions.”
The ‘kalm sutra’ application is one of the 20 applications offered by Apple to enhance sexual play. Other applications include some like the ‘iKamasutra’, virtual sex dice, and sex facts.
In the ‘iKamasutra’ you can click on a position and there will be an illustration and then a ‘catch phrase’ to get your attention. If you click on the ‘catch phrase’ once then it will open up and there will be instructions on how to try the position. It also recommends how you should try it as well as gives you clues on what you need to be aware of. For example, the ‘pump’ position, the clue is “plenty of strength and balance is required of the man to pull it off.”
There is even an application for virtual sex dice. These virtual dice, much like the real dice you can buy at Spencers have a verb on one die and a body part on another. All you have to do is touch the screen and the dice will roll until it stops. You have to do whatever the dice say, for example ‘kiss neck’.
The applications are not just for heterosexuals, either, but for homosexuals as well. There is ‘gay kamasutra’ and ‘gay kama sutra sex positions’. With these applications, Apple has created something for everyone.
Senior Nhya East doesn’t have the ‘kalm sutra’. Instead she has ‘sex facts’ app. The sex facts apps are just that; applications that give you facts about sex. Some of which you might never have known, such as more Americans lose their virginity in June than any other month.
The only requirement that’s needed to attain these downloads, aside from the $.99 that some costs, is to click ‘yes’ when the company asks if the user is over 17 years old. There is no way of confirming whether or not the person is actually over said age.
In the group of friends discussing the ‘kalm sutra’ application, the youngest age that someone lost their virginity was at the age of 15. The others ranged from 17-20. These are not sex crazed, promiscuous young adults either. They are actually pretty average.
The Kaiser Family Foundation states that, “The median age at first intercourse is 16.9 years for boys and 17.4 years for girls.”
“These apps are instructional,” Nhya said. “They aren’t like dirty movies.”

Greek life has had a long withstanding reputation of being just a bunch of people getting together to party. Movies like Old School and Animal House portray perfect examples of the stereotype society has on Greek life. However, Greek life is not about the boozing and partying, it’s about philanthropy, trust, sisterhood/brotherhood, and growing up.
The C.W. Post administration has failed to recognize what the sororities and fraternities do especially when it comes to fundraisers. Every week in Hillwood Commons, you will see a table set up for a different cause with the sorority or fraternity (and sometimes both) trying to raise money for different organizations. Community service is another thing that sororities and fraternities do. “We do a lot of community service. It helps us develop ourselves and become more of a man,” says Senior Yianni Milonakis, Grandmaster of Kappa Sigma. “Last week we were in Garden City for community service and the week before that we were at the Milk Pail Apple Orchard,” Milonakis continues.
In speaking with several members of fraternities and sororities, there were several strong opinions. “I just don’t know why we don’t get recognized,” states Junior Kelly Kirsh of Delta Phi Epilson. Sophomore Liza Gomelski agreed and said, “I feel like a lot of people think sororities and fraternities are stuck up so they may not take us seriously, but they do a lot of community service.”
However, one sorority member believes the administration is noticing Greek life.  “They’re recognizing us more this semester than last,” said Junior Jessie Ternes of Alpha Zi Delta.  “We’re trying to get a better reputation and change all together.” Junior Colleen Smalley agrees saying, “Greek life is doing things with other clubs now. We’re making a name for ourselves and getting recognized.”
Senior Brian Starkman, long-time member of Kappa Sigma thinks, “Greek life is held back. I feel like athletics get away with stuff, but Greek life doesn’t.” When asked what the administration could do he said, “let us live.”
Each semester, every member of a Greek organization must pay dues to the national headquarters for Greek life in America. The money comes straight from the sorority and fraternity members. The fundraisers set up by the Greek organizations and the money raised is sent to the different organizations that are featured. Kirsh mentioned that, “we have to raise all of our money, we pay our own dues out of our own pocket.”
Each week there is a Greek week prize for a different fraternity or sorority on campus. But all of the hard work comes from these young adults that are trying to make the world a better place. Senior Sarina Sigimn stated, “we’re working towards the community each fundraiser at a time.”
Each week the brothers and sisters of Greek life meet every morning on Monday at nine o’clock at night. There they discuss what their next fundraiser will be and assign different projects. There are four sororities and one fraternity recognized by the CW Post campus.
The young adults within these organizations can be seen wearing Greek lettering on their clothing.  They do their philanthropy (community service) to help others and they have fun while doing it. Fraternities and sororities are truly a great cause to society and it is unfair that they are not recognized for it. Past problems including hazing allegations and sororities and fraternities to be exclusive to only a few, have put Greek organizations in a bad light.
As it is now apparent, Greek life is not all about partying and booze. These are young adults simply trying to make the world a better place. The Greek life organizations on campus are urging the C.W. Post administration to recognize them what they do. When going through Hillwood Commons in the afternoon, stop by the tables and see what Greek life is all about. Donate some money or just make some small talk and appreciate what they do. These young people represent our school and we should be proud to say that they do.

Dear readers,
So what’s next on the agenda?  We’ve all gone through the endless nights of studying, wanting to pour the coffee over our heads, hoping it would somehow give us even more energy to stay up and finish cramming for those midterms.  Then we rejoiced the end of midterms by enjoying the spooky festivities of Halloween this past weekend.
Now it’s the beginning of November.  Students and faculty seem to be on edge.  Everyone seems to just want a break and it’s like Thanksgiving can’t come fast enough.  But we say, let’s take this time to relax.   We have about two and half weeks until we get our “turkey day” break and that’s just enough time to sit back and enjoy the fall season.  Go out shopping for a new winter wardrobe or maybe you want to get a jump start on your holiday shopping?  You could always catch up on your papers and start writing that 8-page essay you have due the Monday we return from Thanksgiving break.  There’s also a ton of events happening on campus over the next few weeks; so stop by Hillwood during the common hour and see what’s going on!
We also have a lot happening in the jam-packed issue of this week’s Pioneer.  Our news section includes information on the new genetics lab introduced to Post just last week.  A new section we are featuring is our “Peak at the Greeks.” Each week we will highlight one of the sororities or fraternities on campus.
Our nutrition section is back again with a new exercise regime to take off those “candy pounds” you gained from Halloween!  Another writer also discusses the pros and cons of organic verses nonorganic foods.
Like we say each week, we love to hear feedback so please feel free to email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.com or visit our table in Hillwood this Wednesday and drop a note in our contest box and qualify to win a prize worth $500!

On Thursday October 28th, Diane Kennedy, the President of the New York News Publishers Association (NYNPA) visited C.W. Post’s campus.  She traveled all the way from upstate in Albany, NY to share her experience and knowledge of working in the industry of journalism and politics.
As the President of NYNPA, Kennedy represents over 50 news organizations in the state of New York. NYNPA is the non-profit trade association representing the daily, weekly, and online newspapers of New York State. NYNPA monitors the New York State government on behalf of the newspaper industry, opposing unfavorable legislation and working to craft new laws to open up government activities to public scrutiny.  The Association also provides training and professional networking opportunities to its member publishers, advertising and marketing, and circulation staff.  The Association also manages the New York Newspapers Foundation, which provides grants to literacy-oriented community organizations.
Speaking to the editorial staff of the Pioneer, Kennedy mentioned that working on a campus newspaper is a resume builder.  Students should utilize the campus newspaper to publish their work.  Speaking from experience, prior to joining the NYNPA twenty years ago, Kennedy was a reporter for The Record newspaper located in Troy, NY.
When asked if the newspaper publishing industry is as bad as it seems, Kennedy replied, “it’s worse.”  She continued to encourage students to take advantage of the resources available to them at Post.  This would include the newly founded iPad program, which is now offered to all undergraduate students.
Kennedy mentioned that the industry is rapidly evolving and adapting to the newfound media of our world today.  As this is no news to us, to have a professional come and speak on behalf of the industry made it seem more of a reality than a rumor.
Kennedy is not only a veteran in her industry, but her down-to-earth personality was comforting as well.  It gave hope to the staff of the Pioneer that despite the industry’s changing ways, there are still people in the industry that believe in its traditions and roots.  “It is tough out there, but while you’re still here you can make a difference.  You have the possibility to present new ideas and display creativity.”

In early October, graduating journalism majors received a jolt of fear as they found out a required class would be canceled for their final semester.
Journalism 56, and Broadcasting 54 normally ran on Wednesdays in the spring semester. The Producing the TV Newscast course took up two class periods and went from 12:30-6:10 p.m. The first half of the class was devoted to developing new story ideas, and critiquing work from previous weeks. Students then went out and shot the stories in pairs, one being in charge of the camera, the other being the reporter. After the footage was recorded, students edited and produced news packages much like those you see on television.
“I know some seniors are quite disappointed that this double class was canceled, said Media Department chair, Barbara Fowles. “The faculty involved is also disappointed. We loved this class!”
According to Dr. Fowles, the reason for the cancellation is a lack of enrollment. In order for the course to work well, there have to be enough students to create the reporting/production teams. In the past, the class has had very small numbers, making this a difficult task.
“We decided not to offer it again until we have enough students to provide a good educational experience for everyone, Fowles said. “I hope this will be the following spring.”
The course is in deferment, however, Professor Sandra Mardenfeld, head of the journalism department, plans on reworking the course to adjust to the changes in the media world.  “Due to a shocking change in media, we are re-working the curriculum,” said Mardenfeld.
Kayla Krause, a graduating senior had the advantage of taking the course last semester. “It was probably the most beneficial class I’ve taken here at Post,” Krause said.  “I learned everything from writing the story, to using a camera, being on camera, and then editing my footage to make the final story.  The class taught me how to be a one man band and that’s what the industry wants in a journalist nowadays.”
Senior Nhya East has yet to take the course. “I think it’s really upsetting that they canceled the class,” said East. “I personally think it would have proven to be valuable for me, especially since I’m about to graduate and go out in my field.”
As for the other journalism students who will not be able to take the course, both Dr. Fowles, and Professor Mardenfeld are willing to work with the students to find an alternative that suits their needs and interests.
