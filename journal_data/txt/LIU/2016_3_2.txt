Students at Post have all heard the word “portfolio.” Whether it is for a project in a course or a final product during a semester, students have been asked to collect their finest work.
As a journalism major, creating a portfolio of published works is a given. It is a goal that is set early on in the deciding factor of selecting that particular major. Internships and jobs alike don’t want to hear about what you can do; but rather see what you have done. Having a physical, tangible copy, or e-portfolio, of published work is essential for one’s future career. The perfect way to gain hands-on, practical experience prior to graduation is through a school newspaper.
At Post, the student body is fortunate enough to be part of a smaller campus. One may say it is included in the tuition. Journalism students have the opportunity, and are encouraged to join their campus newspaper. Because there are not thousands of journalism majors to contribute, the newspaper is a student run “club” that allows students of all majors to have their work published and create their own voice.
As one of the current news editors of The Pioneer, it is my job (and the job of Brian Riley, my coeditor) to find topics for campus news stories as well as write and edit those stories. Part of the title includes delegating selected stories to staff writers.
Annual tuition for Post is just under $35,000, according to college-tutiton.startclass.com. Universities are often compared to businesses. Thus, as paying customers, quality customer service is implied. Yet, week after week, journalism students working for the school newspaper are dismissed by administration and staff when asked for simple comments or quotes. More often than not, the staff writers are unjustifiably ignored. This is a customer service fail.
The Pioneer editors invited Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, and Abby Van Vlerah, Dean of Students, to one of their early staff meetings to address these concerns. Berthel and Van Vlerah both expressed their “concern” for the constant adversity. The duo encouraged amateur journalists to do interviews via email and said to expect a response within four-tofive business days, longer than The Pioneer’s staff writers are given for stories; despite the endless number of credible journalism professors who adamantly advise against email interviews. Who knew an email reply took longer than Amazon shipping! The reason for the delay in answering questions, even about the most basic matters, is allegedly because the information they provide is seen by many eyes to have a polished yet vague press release feel. It has happened consistently every week since I have been news editor.
Just this past week, The Pioneer faced rejection from various sources. Assistant A&E Editor Thomas Gillen contacted a fellow student who works in the office of Campus Life, for simple, non-controversial information regarding the spring concert. Yet the fellow student told Gillen he couldn’t say anything because the information had to go through “marketing” first.
Even the Tilles Center staff has informed writers that they could not respond to requests for information without speaking with Dean Van Vlerah first. Staff writer Shelby Townsend also experienced rejection, in a more passive approach, while working on a story about the new director of the photo department. After Townsend sent an initial email, which went without response, she then called the office of the associate professor. There, she reached the receptionist who told Townsend to send the professor an email. All requests sent to the faculty member went without reply.
Haley Rydowski, another staff writer, wrote an article about the technological renovations that were being done around campus. When she contacted the IT department in search of a representative to comment about the progress all refused to comment.
Even as an editor with a seeming position of authority, I have suffered the rigmarole that is LIU Post. Most recently, I was writing a news brief regarding alcohol and women, which required a quote from a representative of the campus counseling center. With unreturned phone calls and unheard messages, the brief went without a quote from an LIU representative, something the Pioneer editors do not want to do.
Journalism majors are suffering at Post and are experiencing the cold shoulder from administrators and staff members. As I near my graduation in May and apply for jobs using the skills that I have acquired as a journalism major at LIU Post, I have found that my experience as a journalist at Post is a limited one that does not provide students with adequate support from their alma mater.

They say money can’t buy happiness, and that is one of my main philosophies in life. Don’t get me wrong, everyone loves to have a good amount of money in their pockets for leisure’s sake, but over the past few years, I’ve witnessed this get a bit out of hand. In my opinion, the issue is that as a collective society today, we have so much money that we allow ourselves to get comfortable and end up mistaking that ‘comfort’ for true happiness. We can buy fancy cars, smartphones, condos, sneakers, jewelry, etc. However, can all of these things truly make us happy?
There have been times in my life where I’ve been flat-broke and times where I’ve had more money than I knew what to do with; but the reason I was happy either way was because of my passion in life, basketball. Basketball has been with me since I was a child and the game itself would serve as therapy for me in most difficult times. Eventually, writing poetry would do the same and I found myself to be truly happy. I may have had some stress here and there, but overall, I was happy because I realized what was truly important. Recently, I’ve been questioned as to why I’m able to be happy without much money. I don’t go to school to simply get a job. I come here to learn about more the world from a different angle and how my voice could grow in perspective and adapt to adversity.
Sadly, buying happiness isn’t unheard of according to statistics. As of 2013, studies conducted by Daniel W. Sacks and Justin Wolfers of the University of Pennsylvania, as well as Betsey Stevenson of the University of Michigan for Forbes magazine, revealed that richer countries were ‘happier’ than poorer countries based on their Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Interestingly, the U.S. was shown to be unhappier as wealth rises but not because we’re peace-loving angels. We’re unhappy because of the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the country.
In light of other recent research, UK’s Office for National Statistics in Sept. 2015, revealed that the larger your household income is, the more satisfaction and happiness you have, in conjunction with less anxiety and stress. The issue with this is that you can’t qualify happiness in such a way because everyone has a different view on what true happiness is. Secondly, when it comes to the ONS statistics, I think that we often confuse ‘happiness’ with ‘comfort.’
Now, here’s the big one; following your passion vs. getting a highpaying job. A former Goldman Banker who, through Banker’s Anonymous, posted his article which was spotlighted on Business Insider titled, “What it Really Means to be Wealthy,” (Jan. 18, 2013). He stated, “If you have enough assets plus passive income to cover your personal lifestyle expenses for the rest of your life, and that money allows you to work at something you love – without concern for the amount of compensation – then you are wealthy.” This sounds like a dream come true to me but it’s possible and true. That said, I’m not the only one who believes passion should always come before riches as a few students have given their own similar opinions on the issue.
For sophomore computer science major, Myles Goldman, it’s passion before money-making. “For me, I’ve always wanted to become a professional skateboarder; I wouldn’t care if I was making pennies or making millions, even though that would be nice. As long as I’d be able to achieve my dream, then I’m happy regardless,” Goldman expressed.
Siding with the notion of following dreams before materialistic values, is junior accounting major, Natalie Miranda; for her, they go hand in hand.“My biggest passion in life is seeing the world and making a difference, like getting involved with different cultures and donating among other things; but going into a career field that would pay me more is what I’d prefer because the more money I’d make, the more I’d have to put away; so with all the money I’d have saved up, then I could travel more often,” Miranda said.
Overall, I believe that your passion should always be valued over how rich you could be by doing something that could possibly get you a quick buck. As for me? Love. Whether it be for those precious to me or for the passions that have brought me this far in my journey, it is worth more than any dollar bill or coin could ever buy in this lifetime. I’d rather die with one passion that brought me years of wisdom and peaceful joy than live with millions of dollars and be dead inside.

Jalyn Brown, a senior physical education major from Riverhead, N.Y., is the starting point guard for the women’s basketball team. In her senior season, Brown served as a vocal leader both on and off the court and played some key, significant minutes in last year’s East Coast Conference Tournament.
Q: How do you feel about your collegiate career coming to a close? 
A: Four years goes by quick in college and I enjoyed it, but it’s kind of sad that my time is winding down.
Q: Can you describe your experience as a player here and what influenced your decision to come to LIU Post? 
A: I liked the program and just fell in love with the school and the campus. Plus, I’m only an hour away from home. I really fit well in Coach Moore’s program and it’s just been an amazing four years here with her. This place feels like home and if I come back here it would just feel great because I’m a Pioneer.
Q: Is there anything you would have done differently both on or off the court?
A: I was really nervous my freshman year coming in here. I was scared to meet new people and was worried about how I would do in my first year and I wish I would’ve worked harder. My game has progressed each year, so I wish I would’ve focused on that more in my freshman year than sophomore year. Academically, I changed my major from health sciences to physical education. I wish I would’ve stuck with health sciences because now I have to stay an extra semester, but it’s not a problem because of how much I like this campus.
Q: Do you have any plans on what you would like to do here next semester? 
A: If Coach Moore needs me to help out with practice, I would be more than happy to assist her with that.
Q: How do you think your season went as a team? 
A: We had ten new players coming in and only five returners, which was our senior class. When you have a young and new group of girls playing together it’s difficult, but we didn’t break down because we stayed together. Unfortunately, this is the first year in my four years here that we didn’t make the playoffs, but next year with new recruiting and a core group of players returning they should have a better season than we had this year.
Q: Do you have any advice for any younger basketball players who are on the rise? 
A: Just play every game like it’s your last because these four years go by quick. You need to just enjoy the experience; meet new people, do new things, and it’s a whole new lifestyle when you’re living by yourself and preparing for the future.
Q: How has Coach Moore and her staff helped prepare you for your future after graduation? 
A: I feel like I’m the most yelled at on the team, but she’s given me so much advice. I know if I need her in the future she’s just a text or phone call away. I’m always going to have a love for the game, but I really want to focus on my career and be a physical therapist or a basketball trainer. I want teach young kids and tell them what I’ve went through and my history of injuries.

The softball team is looking to build on a successful 2015 campaign, during which they were 32-17-1. The Pioneers had a very strong showing in conference as well, going 22-6.
Just two years ago, the Pioneers were NCAA East Region Champions; the fourth time the Pioneers have held that honor since 2007. The head coach who is tagged with bringing the Pioneers back to the promised land is Jamie Apicella. When asked what the team could improve to take the next step, Apicella said, “Our emphasis all preseason has been to be a more contact conscious team and cut down on strikeouts. We also would like to improve our on base percentage and average more runs per game. Our offense was down in all categories last season and because of it our pitchers were under more pressure.” This sounds familiar. The Kansas City Royals, the team that won the 2015 World Series, sound like the epitome of the team Apicella wants to have this season. The Royals are a contact team to the heart and rarely swing and miss.
One of those pitchers under pressure last season was junior Ashley Martin. Martin was named the East Coast Conference Preseason Pitcher of the Year in early February. In 2015, Martin earned ECC Pitcher of the Year honors and Division II All-East Region first-team accolades; boasting an 18-6 record with a 1.61 earned-run average and 120 strikeouts.
Apicella’s desire for more runs is a legitimate one, and one that will no longer be on the shoulders of Aly Dzierzynski, who played her final season in 2015 and is now an assistant coach. In a Pioneer uniform, Dzierzynski accumulated a .346 lifetime average with 51 career home runs and 205 runs batted in. Her 51 career round trippers shattered the program mark set by Christie Softy from 2007-2010. Even though she is not a part of the action on the field anymore, Apicella still sees her as a valuable asset to the team. “Aly’s influence on our younger players has been very positive. Reason being she experienced everything a softball player can experience.” Dzierzynski’s softball resume includes: four NCAA appearances, a College World Series appearance and conference championships. Not too shabby.
The Pioneers have been a model of consistency since Apicella took over the program 17 seasons ago. They have reached 14 straight NCAA Division II Tournaments. Apicella says it’s because of the culture of the program. “The alumni and seniors that graduate continue to pass the key. They make it loud and clear what is expected from the younger players to keep the tradition going. Every member of this team understands that we expect their best on a daily basis.” Apicella has certainly got the best out of his players over the last 14 years.
Getting student-athletes to gel and mesh together is a challenge, but it’s one Apicella is up for. “Over the years we have not always had the most talented team. We have always recruited the ‘right fit’ player. Excellent student first, softball player second. We want student-athletes that have a strong work ethic and are goal oriented. We do not want studentathletes that cut corners and take the easy way out. All these characteristics make a true team. A team that will sacrifice and commit to one another to achieve a common goal.”
So what is that common goal? “To win the East Region and have a chance to play for a national championship.” Apicella said. “That goal will never change.”
The Pioneers’ season begins with a 10 game road trip in Clermont, Fl. that gets underway on Sunday, March 6, against the University of the Sciences. Their first home game is scheduled for Sunday, March 20, against Stonehill College. First-pitch is set for 11 a.m

A rough second half for the seventh-ranked men’s lacrosse team (0-2) proved to be the deciding factor as ninth-ranked Adelphi University (2-1) came out on top in a 15-9 decision on Saturday, Feb. 27, in a non-conference tilt at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Falling behind 3-0 early in the opening quarter, Pioneer graduate midfielder Jeremy Morgan and senior midfielder Anthony Berardis teamed up for back-to-back goals to cut the visitors lead to just one.
However, senior attackman Cory Stavis and junior midfielder Christopher Racalbuto, scored the lone two goals of the second quarter, giving the Panthers a 6-3 edge at the intermission.
The Pioneers flipped open the book of the second half when senior attacker Matt Bellando punched in an unassisted marker at the 10:28 mark, bringing the hosts within two. It wouldn’t be long before the Panthers began to pull away though. Four of the final five goals scored in the third period belonged to the Panthers, who took a commanding 10-5 lead into the fourth quarter.
After the visitors earned a 12-6 cushion, the Pioneers stringed together three unanswered goals to pull within three (12-9). Morgan, Slane and senior attackman Matty Beccaris found the back of the cage during that stretch. However, Adelphi was able to hold on and netted in the final three markers of the contest.
Slane led all scorers for the Green and Gold collecting four points while Morgan and Bellando each registered two goals and an assist. Beccaris pitched in with two scores and Berardis also recorded a three-point effort as well. In the cage, junior goalie Matthew Liantonio totaled 11 stops for the Pioneers. As for Adelphi, senior net-minder John McGrath denied 14 shots.
Head Coach John Jez and his Pioneer squad will continue to search for their first victory of the 2016 campaign when they square off against the Spartans of St. Thomas Aquinas College on Wednesday, March 2. The opening draw from Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium is slated for 3 p.m.

With time winding down in double-overtime and the men’s basketball team leading by one, the University of the District of Columbia escaped the Pratt Recreation Center with a victory when junior guard Virgil Fleming nailed a three pointer as time expired. The 86-84 defeat on Saturday, Feb. 27, leaves the Pioneers with the number four seed in the East Coast Conference Championship.
Earlier in the game, the Pioneers trailed by double-digits before a huge 21-4 run over a five minute span flipped the script. Junior guard Jared Hall, who earned ECC Men’s Basketball Player of the Week honors, got the run started with the first eight points. Junior forward Greg Dotson, who turned in a career performance with 30 points and 19 rebounds, also had eight points during that stretch and led all players with 16 points at the break. At the horn, the Pioneers led 36-31.
The Pioneers pushed their lead to as many as nine in the second half thanks to free throws from Hall and fast break points from senior guard Akosa Maduegbunam. The Firebirds from UDC showed resiliency though; battling back to even up the score at 62 with just under four and a half minutes left.
In the last minute of regulation, both sides had chances to win the game. The Firebirds missed two shots from the field while the Pioneers failed to convert on any of their four chances at the charity stripe.
The overtime sessions were a back and forth battle that saw a handful of lead changes. After a deadlocked first overtime, the Pioneers seemed poised for victory in the second overtime on several occasions. At the four minute mark, senior guard Devon McMillan nailed a three pointer to put the Pioneers up 80-76 and with under a minute remaining and the Pioneers up one, Dotson put his team up three with a thunderous dunk.
After free throws by the Firebirds made it a one point game, the Pioneers failed to extend their lead with a basket on the offensive end which gave the Firebirds an opportunity to win the game. After a timeout, sophomore forward Thomas Robinson set up Fleming for the gamewinning, cold-blooded three at the buzzer.
In addition to Dotson’s terrific play, Maduegbunam totaled 20 points and seven boards while Hall collected 16 points and grabbed five rebounds. McMillan also pitched in with 11 points, nine boards, three assists and five steals.
The Pioneers will host fifth-seeded University of Bridgeport in the first round of the ECC Championship on Wednesday, March 2. Tipoff is set for 7 p.m.

On Saturday, Feb. 27, the women’s basketball team hosted the University of the District of Columbia and lost a close battle. The 57-53 loss concluded the Pioneers season and left them with a 5-23 mark, with all of their wins coming in conference play.
The match was tightly contested throughout and the first quarter was evident of that as both teams were even at 14. The Firebirds pushed the tempo more in the second quarter and that resulted in a lead that ballooned to as much as seven on multiple occasions. At halftime, the Pioneers trailed 25-18.
The Pioneers battled back though and trimmed the deficit to just one as the third quarter came to a close. In the final quarter of action, the Pioneers took a 43-41 lead, but that was quickly erased when the Firebirds responded with a quick 7-0 run to take a five point lead. The Firebirds were in control from that point forward.
Junior forward Melsha Messam finished with 15 points and 10 boards for a double-double while fellow junior forward Janaysia James totaled 14 points and grabbed seven rebounds. No other Pioneer finished in double-figures.
Seniors on this year’s team include: Jalyn Brown, Kalinka DeRoche, Khea Gibbs and Quanisha Ratley.

LIU Post welcomed Paul Taylor and Alex Megaro, both 2009 Film BFA alumni, to screen their feature film “Driftwood” on February 29. The event was held in the Gold Coast Cinema in the Hillwood Commons, was well attended by film and art students, and included a Q and A afterwords. “Driftwood” was directed, written and shot by Taylor, with Megaro taking on editing and producing duties. The film won the Grand Jury prize for Best Narrative Feature at the Slamdance International Film Festival in Park City, Utah.
The filmmakers discussed their minimalist film, devoid of dialogue, telling the story of a young woman (Joselyn Jensen) who washes up on a mysterious shore and is held as a captive, infantile wife to a lonely bald man (Paul C. Kelly) in a cabin. Taylor described the story as rooted in Greek mythology, particularly of the tale of Charon who shuttles the dead to hades over the river Styx. In this case, the beach imagery and symbolism suggests the lead character to be a soul who hasn’t fully made the journey. The film was shot on a small budget, raised with the Kickstarter service, during a six day trip to upstate New York.
In addition to dissecting the subtleties of their film, Taylor and Megaro provided advice to those seeking to enter the film world. “Watch everything. Even if you don’t like it, learn why. Don’t just think something is [bad] because it is slow,” said Megaro.
Taylor stressed the advantage of having resources at Post as an undergrad. “You have access to free gear, as far as I know, it’s still free,” he said. “Use it while you can. You’re already at a better position than we are [as alumni] since we had to rent equipment out.”
Both filmmakers are accomplished in their own right, working consistently in the business since graduation, both for companies and freelance. “I’ve mostly worked editing jobs, since they are the most common to encounter,” said Taylor. The director has also spent significant time behind the camera, not only for “Driftwood” but numerous short and feature films, including “Eidos” — a thesis short by 2013 LIU alum Louis D’arpa.
Despite their personal successes, the filmmakers acknowledged the difficulty in making money as in the business. “It’s hard to make a lot of money,” said Taylor. “If you’re looking to make a whole lot of money, maybe study business.” However, Megaro pushed a message of perseverance, particularly as a freelancer. “If you stay at it, you can find a way to eek out a living. After doing so many commercial gigs, it’s the same thing as going to festivals, you’ll meet people, see what you like and don’t like and accrue experience,” he explained. “Go out and live for a few years, you’ll get experience and the films will get better too.”
Megaro noted that the professors at Post were critical in their learning as young filmmakers. He credited Professors Soopum Sohn, Elizabeth Robinson and Michael Atkinson for helping him. “Soopum helped us get onto film sets,” he said. ‘Listen [to the professors]. They know what they’re talking about. Don’t disavow advice because you think you know better.”
While accepting that their tastes in film are not definitive, both filmmakers stressed the notion of being open to experimental films, not just the mainstream. “Just understand that there are thousands of people doing the same thing, so it’s going to be hard for you to stand out,” Taylor said of the pursuit of Hollywood writing and filmmaking.
The most important advice, according to Taylor: think different. “Make things outside of the box, not just what is easy,” he said. Make films that push the boundaries and are different, so when you graduate you’ll know what works and what doesn’t. This is very important: don’t make films on campus. Go somewhere else, I tell you that your film will be a lot better for it. Hillwood Commons is not interesting.”
Before they departed, Taylor and Megaro told students that they are open to contact. “Reach out to us, seriously don’t hesitate to reach out to us,” said Taylor.

The “Shakespeare Forever” event will commemorate the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death. The iconic poet, actor and playwright, who passed away on April 23, 1616, at age 52, has been read, recited, and reinterpreted ever since. Through a partnership among professors and departments at Post, over a dozen events will take place throughout the month of March until April 21.
“We’ve been brainstorming for over a year and wanted a wide spectrum of people involved,” said Manju Prasad-Rao, head of the library’s Instructional Media Center (IMC), and project director of the event.
Along with Kay Sato, director of Hutton House, a for-pleasure, personal enrichment program for senior adults on campus, Prasad-Rao has been able to spur wide interest among departments, including enthusiasts within the local community. Libraries in Port Washington and Great Neck are also hosting some of the events.
Prasad-Rao has received grants from The New York Council for the Humanities, the Dorothy Dayton Sorzano Theatre Library, the John P. McGrath Fund, as well as additional contributions from various partners, including a personal contribution from John Lutz, English department chair.
“The commemoration is important because Shakespeare has made major contributions to our understanding of humanity and the modern world,” Lutz said. “His work has captured the interest of both Western and non-Western cultures and his plays are taught all over the world. Since his works were first performed four centuries ago, they’ve continued to capture people’s imagination and been subject to reinterpretation through reading and performance.”
The almost two-month long event includes exhibits, programs, movies, performances, and workshops for groups and local high school students.
Prasad-Rao emphasized that there will be performances in addition to the literary elements of the event. Dr. Mark Shapiro, associate professor of music, has curated the music and will be conducting at several of the events, including a musical performance at the keynote lecture by Dr. James Bednarz, professor of English and Shakepeare scholar, on Thursday, March 3, during common hour.
“Many of Shakespeare’s plays and poems include references to music,” Shapiro said, explaining why music will accompany the program. “The extraordinary melodiousness of his verse suggests that he must have been a profoundly musical person.”
In the labyrinth-like English department on the second floor of the Winnick House, the door to room 215 sits open, revealing a movie poster on the wall, a book of antique scent unfolded on the desk, and a smiling fellow dressed in shirt and mustache.
“Can you believe it? Some people still believe Shakespeare didn’t write [the plays] himself,” Dr. James Bednarz said amused, pointing at the large paper advertisement in bold that reads “ANONYMOUS,” a conspiracy thriller-drama released in 2011. “I just had to put it up there.” Bednarz, professor of English and an internationally known Shakespeare scholar, unwraps his soul like a child does his birthday gift.
“I’ve been a fan for a while,” Bednarz admits, since he was a student at the Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, to be exact. He has gained international recognition for his extensive studies of Shakespeare’s earliest performances and quill jot-downs in the 1600s.
As the keynote speaker of Shakespeare Forever, Bednarz will indulge in Shakespeare’s comedies, histories and tragedies, known as the “First Folio,” from 1623—a collection put together collaboratively by Shakespeare’s closest friends seven years after his passing. It includes 36 of his plays, 18 of which had never been published before.
“There’s this bizarre relationship, a paradox between comedy and tragedy, which really defy all the classical laws,” Bednarz said. “He is an experimenter. He has become a repository of wisdom.”
The myth of Shakespeare, as Bednarz recalls it, is a man of the theatre, one with little interest in publishing at all. Yet, by the time of his death, half of his works could be found in print.
“He used the increasingly commercial days and previous works— Italian novellas, poorly written short stories—and transformed them. Ninety-eight percent of his works were based on previous works,” Bednarz said, pointing out that Shakespeare is the most translated secular author in the world, available in more than 90 different languages.
Today, researchers believe only 233 printed copies of the original First Folio have survived, according to Anthony James West and Owen Williams, curators of the 2011 “Fame, Fortune & Theft: The Shakespeare First Folio” exhibition at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington. Prasad-Rao applied to get an original copy of the First Folio for the purpose of the commemoration, but it was cost prohibitive and neither proper security measures nor temperature control were acceptable for storing it on campus. An original copy can be found at the New York Historical Society in Manhattan.
“Shakespeare has been transformed, even in our program, into all me dia. People are tweeting Shakespeare quotes, actresses have tattoos from King Lear on their arm,” Bednarz explained. “We have Shakespeare in ballet without a word; we have Shakespeare added to music with some words. Shakespeare in film, there isn’t one media that Shakespeare…” he interrupts himself, “When Alexander Graham Bell was inventing the telephone, he was citing Shakespeare over it. He just keeps growing,” Bednarz said.
Shakespeare’s eloquent linguistics are still studied and appreciated today. “When he talks about crying, he’ll talk about ’the fruitful river in the eye.’ He won’t just say ‘a tear,’” Bednarz said. “Very few people in your life will give you more than you give them, your mother perhaps. And Shakespeare.”
The Honors College, in collaboration with the Poetry Center, has taken on the challenge of Shakespearean expression by offering a Sonnet Contest open to all undergraduate and graduate students. Each student could submit up to three entries, which were accepted until Feb. 1. Winners will be presenting their works on Wednesday, March 2, at the Steinberg Museum of Art during common hour. A sonnet is a particular form of poetry that is “written predominantly in iambic pentameter, a rhyme scheme in which each sonnet line consists of ten syllables,” according to Google.com.
“We all know a procrastinating Philosophy major, a would-be political usurper, a maniacal leader, a despondant lover. The fact that so many of his plays have been made into operas and into contemporary films proves this point exactly,” said Joan Digby, honors college director.
“Shakespeare, who gathered his plots from previous writers, also helps us understand how creativity can have a foundation in the past and even in borrowing or sampling to make something new.” Some may still ask themselves: why were Shakespeare’s works so groundbreaking, and how can they still be important 400 years after his death?
“The humanity that I see in him, that he has looked at a human being so thoroughly from the inside itself, I feel that’s one of the reasons why he can cross so many different cultures, because of his connection with humans,” Prasad-Rao said.
Sato elaborated, “He can make us feel that regardless of where we’re coming from, we can get whatever it is that he’s trying to present on stage. And it’s very puzzling sometimes too: what did he mean by that? And you can go back and see something else the next time.”
Shakespeare’s depth and humanization of characters are significant to Bednarz. But to him, the key to understanding Shakespeare is to know he won’t solve your problems—he is going to let you know what they are.
“He thinks of human beings living in time as subjected to incredible contradictions and all kinds of forces, and a dilemma—a human dilemma—which we can never extricate ourselves from,” Bednarz said. “So he teaches us where the complexity is, rather than resolving it.”
The commemoration is an attempt to revive the English-native playwright, and leave a new generation of college students and community members excited about Shakespeare.
“It’s like a big festival,” Sato said, her lungs swelling up like balloons before bursting into giggling laughter. “The next thing we can do is to come dressed in a garb.”

From July 1-16, students in the LIU Post Jazz Ensemble and Long Island Sound – Vocal Jazz Ensemble will be traveling to Switzerland to participate in the annual Montreux Jazz Festival, which is the second largest jazz festival in the world. The Montreux Jazz Festival is entering its fiftieth year in existence and takes place on the edge of Lake Geneva. “The LIU Jazz Ensemble and Long Island Sound Vocal Jazz performed at the 2007 Montreux Jazz Festival and have been invited by a jury of peer reviewers to perform at the 50th Anniversary Montreux Jazz Festival this coming July,” said Jennifer Miceli, chairperson of the department of music.
Miceli said that the purpose of the jazz tour in Switzerland “is to provide experiential learning and performing opportunities for LIU Post music students.” According to montreuxjazzfestival.com, “the festival rapidly earned a reputation for fantastic concerts, unbelievable artistic collaborations, rare moments, improbable anecdotes, audacity, ambitious projects, and impulsive decisions.” Past artists who have performed at the festival include David Bowie, Prince, and Deep Purple.
Junior music education major Robert Riepe is the bass player in the LIU Post Jazz Ensemble and the Long Island Sound – Vocal Jazz Ensemble and spoke of some of the benefits of playing at the Montreux Jazz Festival. “Since the Montreux Jazz Festival is a world renowned event, I get to travel and play in Europe and neighboring countries.” Riepe also stated that the LIU Jazz Big Band has been preparing for the festival since the fall semester.
The 40 students going to Montreux will be able to push their musical careers forward by playing at this renowned event. “Students advance their musical careers by performing at a prestigious festival where intentionally recognized jazz artists will also be performing. Last year’s Montreux Jazz Festival line-up included such artists as Lady Gaga, Tony Bennett, John Legend, Lenny Kravitz, Mary J. Blige, and Herbie Hancock,” Miceli said.
Some of the festival venues where groups will perform include the Auditorium Stravski, Montreux Jazz Club, Montreux Jazz Lab, and Montreux Jazz Creations. The Auditorium Stravski is the biggest venue, with a capacity of 2,800 to 4,000 people.
Besides paid events at these venues, visitors will also be able to listen to jazz music in the park and attend aftershows and workshops.
“The 2016 Jazz Tour gives students the opportunity to share a uniquely American art form in a foreign country. Through jazz music, LIU Post music students will serve as ambassadors to the Department of Music; College of Arts, Communications, and Design; Long Island University; New York State, and to the United States. Other benefits include performing in famous venues, listening to jazz greats, experiencing a foreign culture, enjoying the beauty of Switzerland, and making great music with life long friends,” Miceli said.

“The Witch,” opened in theaters on February 19, is not a typical horror movie. While not relying on jump scares and large amounts of gore, “The Witch” manages to stay tense from the opening scene to the finale with the help of its setting in 1630s New England and its take on witches. The overall atmosphere of the movie is disturbing, in particular, several scenes involving the witch. The sense of dread is increased by the isolation and paranoia that the main characters suffer as the movie progresses.
The film stars Anya Taylor-Joy as Thomasin, the daughter in a Puritan family that is exiled from a community in New England over religious beliefs in the 17th century. After leaving the community, Thomasin and her family set out to establish a new life on the edge of a forest. Rounding out the cast is Ralph Ineson as William, Thomasin’s father; Kate Dickie as Katherine, her mother; and Harvey Scrimshaw as Caleb, her brother. With a small cast, all of the actors have a lot of screen time throughout the movie and for the most part, they all do a fine job. Taylor-Joy and Ineson are the standouts and are able to deliver the authentic dialogue with ease.
“The Witch” revolves around the disappearance of Samuel, the youngest child in the family, who goes missing one day while being watched by Thomasin. After going missing, the family begins to turn on one another, with Thomasin initially being blamed for Samuel’s disappearance. Eventually crops begin to fail and other bad luck befalls the family as the children talk of a witch being responsible for taking Samuel.
One of the strengths of “The Witch” is its 17th century New Eng land setting. Writer and director Robert Eggers makes sure that everything in the movie is authentic, right down to the dialogue. At the end of the movie, a text comes on the screen stating that most of the dialogue in the movie was spoken at actual witch trials several hundred years ago. While the dialogue is hard to understand at some points, it’s clear that Eggers is very passionate about the subject matter and put a lot of effort and research into the production of “The Witch.” Besides the dialogue, the costumes and set design also feel authentic to the time period and help to immerse the viewer in the grim world of “The Witch.”
The scenes with the actual witch and the elements of black magic in the movie are well done. Even though the witch does not have a large presence, the atmosphere becomes more sinister and supernatural when she is on screen. Eggers spreads out her appearances throughout the film, allowing the actions of the family to move the plot forward while the witch shows up to inject a supernatural element to the world.
There are only a few negative aspects about “The Witch.” The movie does have a slow pace, which could put off some audiences used to faster paced horror movies like “The Cabin in the Woods” or “The Conjuring.” The slower pace fits well with the setting and mood of the story but might come off as boring to some viewers. The story slightly drags in the first hour of the movie.
Despite these small issues, “The Witch” is worth seeking out. Rather than focusing on the actual witch or elements of black magic, the story centers on how a family deals with the loss of their child in a world where witchcraft is real. “The Witch” is now playing in theaters.

All incidents that take place on the Post campus are, by law, a matter of public record and can be found at Public Safety. The Crime Blotter is provided by the Pioneer as a public service for the campus community.
Criminal Mischief 
On Tuesday, Feb. 2, at 10:49 p.m., the fire alarm in Post Hall sounded. The alarm was reset in about 10 minutes. Less than 10 minutes later, the trouble alarm sounded and lasted 7 minutes. At the scene, there were open circuits and the system was still in trouble. Workers were sent out to find the trouble. Three horn strobes were found misplaced on the second floor of Post Hall and are currently being replaced.
Lost/Stolen Property 
On Tuesday, Feb. 2, a student sat alone on the library with her laptop. She claims she moved to the computer area to print and does not know if she put her laptop in her bag with the rest of her belongings. The next day, she went to look for her laptop and noticed it was missing. Public Safety is currently reviewing security cameras.
Vehicle Damage 
On Feb. 4, a student reported that he parked his Lexus behind the Kings Hall loading dock in late December. When he checked up on the car almost a month later, he noticed damage to the driver’s side front bumper. The student claims he does not know who caused the damage or when it was done.

The LIU Post community is mourning the loss of fellow student Ian Matuszak, who passed away on Wednesday, Feb. 24. Matuszak was a junior English major, with plans to graduate in 2017. He was diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal cancer during the fall semester, in September 2015. Matuszak was a triplet who leaves behind his sister Sydney, and his brother Alec, who is a junior journalism major at Post.
Although Matuszak was in a wheelchair, it never stopped him from accomplishing his dreams. One of Matuszak’s many accomplishments was earning his blue belt in jiu-jitsu from Pete Sell and Dave Patton, Brazilian jiujitsu instructors, under the UFC welterweight champion Matt Serra, last October. The event took place at Longo & Weidman MMA in Garden City.
“Ian was an engaging young man with a bright spirit who was undaunted by physical limitations,” said Wendy Ryden, an English professor who worked closely with Matuszak. “He was eager and open to new perspectives, the kind of student that makes teaching a joy. The challenges he faced gave him unique and interesting insights into literature and writing as well as life.”
Ryden added, “He once told me how being in his position had taught him patience with others’ ineptitudes. I admired his grace and overall goodness and felt I learned so much from hearing what he had to say. And he was funny, too. Once after class, we had a race in the hallway-I was on foot; he was in his chair. I believe it was a tie.”
“Ian helped me become the person I am today,” said Charlie Moerler, a senior broadcasting major, and a close friend of Matuszak’s. “Who knows what my life would be like if it wasn’t for him. He is my hero and I’ll miss him each and every day.”
Natalia Skoda, a senior socal work major, said “Ian was an amazing friend that I met my sophomore year of college. We would have lunches together and the smiles that he would have would make anyone feel comfortable. I could tell instantly the beauty and love that Ian had in his heart for everyone. I was truly lucky that I had a friend in him.”
Marie Fatscher, director of the Learning Support Center, said, “Ian Matuszak was a remarkable young man who enriched the lives of everyone he came in contact with. When he entered the room, he lit it up with his smile. His amazing ability to make you laugh brightened your day.”
Fatscher continued, “I count myself among the many in the LIU Post community who was blessed to have the opportunity to meet Ian and experience his gifts of optimism, empathy, and humor. I also count myself among the many who will miss him, but will always remember him with a smile in my heart and will honor his life and memory with laughter as I am sure that is what he would want.”
Susan Deaver, a professor in the music department, said “ Ian was in my MUS 1 class during the spring semester of 2014 and he was excited to learn about classical music. He always remained active in class discussions and wrote a very excellent final paper titled ‘Handel’s and Mozart’s Impact on Choral Music Throughout the Generations.’ I’m sure that we all agree that Ian made an impact on our lives. I know that he certainly impacted my life, and like others, I’m very grateful to have been part of his life and experienced his strong and enthusiastic character.”
On Wednesday, Feb. 24, the Social Work Club set up a table during common hour to sell rubber bracelets with the words “I.M. Strong,” and held a bake sale to raise money for Matuszak’s family to help cover the cost of his overall medical expenses.
On Thursday, Feb. 25, Abby Van Vlerah, dean of students, sent an email message to the community, reading, “Our thoughts and prayers are with Ian’s family and friends. The Center for Healthy Living is available to students who need counseling services. To speak with a counselor, please visit Life Science Room 154 or call 516-299-4162.”
The campus radio station, WCWP, will air a tribute to Matuszak on Thursday, March 3, on its Midday Madness show during common hour (12:30-1:45) on 89.7FM and mywcwp.org. The tribute will be recorded by students in honor of Matuszak.
Governors Comedy at The Brokeridge in Bellmore will hold a standup comedy benefit show on Sunday, March 6, at 3:30 p.m. Tickets are $25 and can be purchased through https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ stand-up-benefit-for-ian-matuszak-tickets-20849707035. All proceeds will go to the Matuszak family.
The university will hold a memorial service in honor of Matuszak at noon on Friday, March 4, at the Inter-Faith Chapel. A reception follows at the Chapel Community Room.

This year’s annual Spring Fling concert featuring Jason Derulo will be held on Thursday, April 21 at 8 p.m. in the Tilles Center. Derulo, whose music is a mix of pop, hip-hop, and R&B, is expected to attract an audience of between 1,700 and 2,000 students, according to Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. Past Spring Fling artists have included Kesha in 2015, Big Sean and Jhené Aiko in 2014, and Miguel in 2013.
The concert is just one of many events during Spring Fling week, according to Akeem Victor, a senior broadcasting major and president of the Student Activities Board. On Monday, April 18, there will be a manhunt game; on Tuesday, April 19, a murder mystery dinner will be held in the Great Hall; on Wednesday, April 20, Riggs-Pocalypse in Riggs Hall and on Friday, April 22, there will be a cookout on the Quad Lawn. Events being planned for Saturday and Sunday will be announced in late March, according to Victor.
Riggs-Pocalypse is a simulated zombie attack in Riggs Hall. Participants will be chased by zombies throughout the building with only a nerf gun to protect themselves. If zombies are shot with a nerf gun, they have to freeze for five seconds. The goal is for participants to reach a common room on the second floor of Riggs and pick up a phone in the safe zone. Participants also have two flags attached to them and will lose when both flags are gone.
“The Student Activities Board and office of Campus Life go through an extensive process to select an artist each year. The artist unveiling took place on Wednesday, February 27 and we have received very positive feedback about Jason Derulo,” according to Berthel.
Jason Derulo released his latest album, “Everything is 4,” in June of 2015 and has also been a judge on “So You Think You Can Dance.” “We are excited to host Jason Derulo in April and continue our tradition of bringing nationally recognized artists to campus,” Berthel said.
Derulo may not be performing alone at in the Spring Fling concert, as Victor stated that Post is still looking for possible opening acts for him. Two years ago, Jhené Aiko opened for Big Sean. As with previous Spring Fling performers, the Student Activities Board and Campus Life considered several artists to headline this year’s concert. “It was a difficult decision. We released a survey via social media and asked the student body who they would like to see perform for our concert,” Victor said. “We gathered the data and made a list from most voted to least voted. Jason Derulo was one of the top artists on the list and [he] accepted our bid.” Other artists were asked to perform at the concert before Jason Derulo, but were unable to due to scheduling conflicts.
Nicole Balnis, a senior psychology major, is looking forward to the concert, but would’ve preferred another artist to perform. “I think it’s going to be an awesome concert, unfortunately I work at the Campus Concierge every year during Spring Fling so I won’t be able to go. Jason Derulo wouldn’t be my first choice because I mostly listen to classic rock music but I do think he’ll put on a great show.”
Tickets for Spring Fling can be purchased at the Tilles Center Box Office starting Monday, March 14. Students may purchase up to two tickets for $15 each. The box office is open from 1-6 p.m.

LIU Post’s first annual rUNDEAD event will take place at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, April 1. rUNDEAD is a trail run event that will raise money and awareness for Special Olympic New York, a charity that helps individuals with intellectual disabilities overcome obstacles through sports.
“I am excited about the opportunity to partner with Special Olympics and bring rUNDEAD to campus,” said Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life. “Our students have shown how passionate they are about performing service in the community, and we are proud of our students in Phi Sigma Kappa for taking the initiative in starting this program,” said Berthel. The office of Campus Life and Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity are collaborating to host this service project.
Runners may register at 9:30 a.m. on the day of the event or sign up in advance at http://tinyurl.com/LIUPOST-rUNDEAD. “The idea was to bring something new to campus that provided a fun opportunity to fundraise for a great cause,” said Arianna Livreri, Campus Life coordinator. 100 percent of the proceeds that are raised go to scientific research on cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. To date, rUNDEAD for Special Olympics has raised over $32,ooo.
Participants can register for either of two sections, “Escape the Virus,” which consists of two different running divisions, or “Join the mob,” which is the running division where registered participants dress up as zombies and can choose to run short distances or walk.
The two different runner divisions, which consist of five laps are “Fast Food” and “All You Can Eat”. The first division, “Fast Food,” is a competitive run at which each runner will start off with a flag belt and three flags. Zombies throughout the course will be attempting to take these flags one at a time. If you lose all three, you’re dead and the zombies have won. The second division, “All You Can Eat,” is a non-competitive run consisting of five laps, which participants can move at their own pace.
“Join the mob,” where participants choose to register as zombies, can either be “Hunters” or “Crawlers.” If you hope to be a zombie, there will be an event the week before in order to decorate the shirt for the day of the run. Participants are required to bring their own white shirt. Red, white and black paint will be provided. Also, there is a $10 donation to register as a runner.
At rUNDEAD, tables will be set up by Phi Sigma Kappa, WCWP Radio Station, Browse and other student run businesses as well as other student organizations. “I will be participating, as well as a few of my sister’s of Alpha Xi Delta. I plan on participating in the actual run and I cannot wait to support this wonderful cause! Special Olympics is something close and dear to my heart and I’m so happy I can participate in something so great!” said Katelyn Caraveo, art major and sister of Alpha Xi Delta.

Assistant Professor of Economics, Veroknika Dolar, was invited to the American Economic Association Conference in January 2016, for her method of teaching in her Economics of Obesity course. She was invited for her innovative teaching method, which essentially combines an independent study course with a typical lecture. At the conference she presented this information, and took questions from other interested professors.
Dolar’s course covers how food prices and income determine how we make decisions on what we eat. The other side of the course is the research component, where students are given the opportunity to choose, either individually or in a pair, a specific topic within the economics of obesity that can be proven or disproven through research that spans over the semester.
In the early stages of developing ECO 37, Dolar had to write a new course proposal to be approved by the department. She wrote her dissertation for her PhD on the economics of obesity, which gave her the experience to try out this course.
This semester is Dolar’s second attempt at the course; she taught it before during the spring semester in 2014. ECO 37 is a high-level elective that doesn’t get offered every semester because of the niche interest. This semester the course has 21 students enrolled. During her first semester teaching the class, Dolar said that she made the mistake of making the research component of the course only 15 percent, despite of the massive amount of work student put in to complete it. At the end of the semester, students told her that the research component was the most valuable part of the course, which caused her to increase its weight to 50 percent.
Elizabeth Barcia, a junior psychology major who is currently enrolled in the course, said, “It’s similar to the motivation psych class I took last semester where our research paper was a majority of our grade. I think it helps students get ready for deadlines in ‘the real world’ after college. I prefer a challenging course such as this. I’m not paying $3,000 a class to just get a degree and move on.”
Barcia, along with Valeriya Marchenko, a junior dance major, are researching how students’ body mass index is affected by when they eat. She spends six hours a week on the course and was slightly surprised when she realized the amount of necessary writing and research. “I was not prepared for that, however, the material is fascinating and it doesn’t feel like work.
”The AEA “was organized in 1885 at a meeting in Saratoga, New York, by a small group interested in economics,” according to aeaweb. org. Currently, there are over 18,000 members. It produces several different economic research journals, and hosts the annual conference that Dolar attended. To be accepted for the conference, she had to display her techniques, and innovation of teaching the course.

Just this year, LIU has affiliated with new study abroad programs at universities in four countries. Students from both Post and LIU Brooklyn now can also choose to study for a semester at Science Po Toulouse in France, University of Nicosia in Cyprus, Södertörn University in Huddinge, Sweden and HITIT University in Çorum, Turkey.
Oscar R. de Rojas, Director of Global Partnerships for LIU, said that he is very pleased with the new additions and thinks it will be very beneficial for the university. Other than the option of studying abroad through LIU Global, where students can pick to study abroad for a semester in any of the countries the LIU Global College offers or through non-affiliated programs, the university already had an affiliation with Regent’s University of London. If a student decides to study abroad through an affiliated program, any of their financial aid with LIU would apply for that program, whereas that is not the case for non-affiliated programs.
For more information on the new study abroad affiliated programs, contact the Study Abroad Office by emailing: patricia.seaman@liu.edu.
