“The School for Good and Evil” by Soman Chainani is the first book in a fantastic fantasy series. This first book tells the story of best friends Sophie and Agatha, living in the isolated town of Gavaldon. Every four years on November 11, according to legend, a School Master kidnaps two children from the village. One kidnapped child is always beautiful and kind, and the other is homely and odd. These children are taken to the School for Good and Evil, which exists somewhere beyond the woods surrounding Gavaldon. The children are never seen again, unless they appear in a fairy tale, one as a hero and the other as a villain.
Sophie, who is beautiful and focuses on her looks and good deeds, believes that she will be kidnapped for the School for Good. Meanwhile, Agatha, who is ugly and wears only black, doesn’t believe the School exists but seems like the perfect candidate for the School for Evil. They are the two kids who are kidnapped by the School Master that year. However, Agatha is brought to the School for Good, and Sophie to the School for Evil. What first appears to be a great mistake turns into an adventure that not only reveals the character’s truest selves, but also blurs the lines between the stereotypes of good and evil.
Along the way, Sophie and Agatha meet the other students, who are descendants of fairytale characters. The best friends from Gavaldon take classes at their mismatched schools while they try to solve a riddle the School Master gave them that will lead them home. However, the School Master is more than what he seems, and has a different ending in store for Sophie and Agatha.
“The School for Good and Evil” is a very entertaining book, but the plot doesn’t go far beyond the school. Although this series takes place in a much larger world, the first book takes place only in Gavaldon and the School. The world of fairy tales is supposedly endless, but readers don’t get to experience much of this world in the first book. One must read the rest of the series to see more of this magical world of Good and Evil.
In “The School for Good and Evil,” nothing is as simple as it seems. It is a great read for those who like dramatic twists and sneaky foreshadowing in their books.

In “Smite,” you play as one of the many gods that exist in the different pantheons, from Shintoism to Hinduism, Greek to Egyptian and more.
One of the gods in this game is Amaterasu, the highest goddess in Shintoism and the “goddess of the sun.” The game does a great job of making her truly unique because unlike the other gods whose abilities revolve around their titles and characteristics, Amaterasu’s abilities revolve around
her three sacred treasures, all of which play a vital role in her story, both in the game and in her mythology.
The first of Amaterasu’s sacred treasures is her sword, Ame no Murakumo, or “sword of gathering clouds in heaven.” Amaterasu’s brother, Susanoo, found Ame no Murakumo in the tail of Shinto’s most hated demon, “Yamata no Orochi.” He gifted the weapon to Amaterasu to apologize for treacherous deeds he committed against her. This mirrors Japanese mythology.
The next treasure is the jewel Amaterasu wears around her neck, which dates as far back as 14,000 B.C. It is a symbol of fortune to ward off evil. This treasure is what gives her “divine presence” via valor and benevolence. When passed down to the next generation, this jewel gives the owner the power of its original spirit.
Amaterasu’s jewel was a gift from her father, Izanagi (the god responsible for creating Japan), granting her the power to rule. In “Smite,” the jewel gives Amaterasu the two powers of herself and her father.
The final treasure that Amaterasu uses is her sacred mirror, Yata no Kagami, which grants her “heavenly reflection.” It was used to bait Amaterasu into leaving her cave where she sealed herself and her light away after being wronged by her brother.
In the game and in the mythology, the people who loved Amaterasu held a huge festival outside her cave. The roar of celebration coming from outside drew the Amaterasu out, and she saw a radiant goddess inside a jewel- encrusted mirror. Amaterasu smiled, and light returned to the world.
Just as the Yata no Kagami reflected Amaterasu’s power in the mythology, the mirror reflects the power of enemy gods in the game. Using the sacred treasures as the focus of Amaterasu’s power in the game, the creators captured the true power and story of Shinto’s Amaterasu perfectly.

This January 2019, the dance team will head to Disney World for the Universal Dance Association (UDA) national championship.

The team is competing in three categories: Game Day, Jazz, and Pom. Although the competition requires them to train hard and stay focused, the dancers remain committed to their roles as spirit ambassadors for the university.
The dancers are thrilled to be competing in Orlando at ESPN Wide World of Sports. This is a huge accomplishment after the tough season they experienced last year. “We were coachless for half the season last year, and we were run by captains,” Lauren Juchem, a sophomore on the team, said. “The three of them did a really great job of keeping the program alive.”
Juniors Kaitlyn Ulrich and Marina Kilkenny, are the team’s captains for the second year in a row. Both girls danced at nationals during their freshman and sophomore years.
The team’s biggest fan and supporter is their new coach, Tiffany King. She filled the vacant position in December 2017, just before last year’s nationals. “This year I get to bring them to where I competed in college, and we get to work on two incredibly difficult routines that really showcase not only, you know, pretty faces and pom poms, but [rather] technique and what they’ve worked so hard for since they were five,” King said.
Performing at nationals requires high-energy and endurance. The team holds two practices and a 6 a.m. workout every week, and they are planning to add a third practice on the weekends.
“We do a team mile on the track above the gym. We add drills to it like Indian runs and lunges,” Juchem said. Kilkenny described the workouts as, “a half-hour on the track and a half-hour in the weight room.” On top of practicing for nationals, the girls are rehearsing for half-time and spirit performances.
Due to the recent announcement about NCAA division changes, football is one of two remaining sports at LIU that showcase the dancers on the sidelines and during half-time. This will be the team’s last year competing in the open division which includes Divisions II and III and community colleges. In 2020, they will move up to Division I, going head-to-head with neighboring universities such as Hofstra, Stony Brook and St. John’s.
The team members welcome the challenge, saying they can do anything if they do it together. “I’ve never been closer with any other team I’ve been on,” Alexa Stefanidis, a sophomore team member, said. Ulrich agreed, saying, “I think it [the team] gives you a stable family that you have throughout your years at the school. So, you always have a friendship, and you get to do what you love [with them].”
Kayla Braccio, a freshman team member, isn’t letting the division changes keep her down. She’s excited for her next three years on the team and is looking forward to welcoming new family members each year. “I think nationals will be a really nice reward for that [division changes]. Plus, we get to perform at Disney, and who doesn’t want to perform at Disney?” Kilkenny said.

The Pioneers dominated this homecoming weekend, beating Saint Anselm College 37-6, improving their record to 6-0 for the season. Backed up by the first half, in which they scored 21 points, the team cruised to a decisive 31 point victory.

Saint Anselm kicked a 33-yard field goal for the first points of the game. The Pioneers responded quickly by scoring the game’s first touchdown. Graduate student quarterback Chris Laviano of the Pioneers found senior Michael Richardson wide open after Richardson returned a punt 34 yards to the Saint Anselm 44-yard line.
The Pioneers extended the lead after a touchdown scored by senior Malik Pierce. Pierce rushed into the endzone on a one-yard carry to complete a seven-play, 27-yard drive. Saint Anselm kicked an additional 44-yard field goal as time expired, making the first half score 21-6.
During halftime, all candidates of the homecoming court addressed the crowd, as the king and queen were presented on the field.
Matt Goldstein, a senior criminal justice major, and Olivia Kavanaugh, a senior art art education major, were crowned homecoming king and queen.
For Kavanaugh, this was her first homecoming. She was excited to be both an attendee and a part
of the court. “I always knew that Homecoming was one of the biggest events of the year so being a part of the tradition for Post was so humbling and incredible,” she said.
Goldstein was excited about being crowned the last king of Post. “I really enjoyed campaigning and making sure everyone voted, especially the athletic community,” he said.
When the game resumed, the Pioneer’s defense shut down Saint Anselm’s offense, leaving the latter team scoreless for the second half.
Major contributions to the defense include junior Zach Co- francesco’s team-high ten tackles, graduate student Kevin Petit-Frere’s two sacks and Nazir Streater, who picked off three interceptions.
It took 95 seconds for the Pioneers to further extend the lead as Laviano found redshirt-senior Deon Mash down the left sideline for a 48-yard touchdown strike to make it a three-possession game. Senior Joey Tolgyesi added a 31-yard field goal late in the third quarter before Richardson hauled in his third touchdown reception of the day on a seven-yard pass from Laviano during the fourth quarter.
The Pioneers will face Pace University at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium on Oct. 20, kickoff scheduled for 1:00 p.m.

Homecoming 2018 featured many other events for students, faculty and alumni to enjoy. The fun-filled weekend began Friday, Oct. 12 with a professor panel discussion and dinner, as well as a concert with Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo. Students gathered for a pep rally at 7 p.m. on Riggs Lawn, as opposed to its usual setting in the gym.
Jack Tomlinson, a freshman physical and health education major, attended the pep rally. He believes that the event helped strengthen the student body after the recent announcement of the OneLIU athletic merger. “It’s no secret that our student body has had a lot of mixed emotions about recent events at Post,” Tomlinson said. “Which is why I think [the] pep rally came at a perfect time. We all needed that school spirit.”
The festivities continued on Saturday before the football game, with tailgates, food trucks and a carnival held in the Pratt Recreation Center parking lot. Kiernan Griffin, a sophomore art therapy major, enjoyed the occasion. “I had a lot of fun at homecoming and hanging with all my friends,” she said. “I also had a lot of fun going on all the rides and trying new foods from the trucks that were there.”

Matt Goldstein and Olivia Kavanaugh were named Homecoming King and Queen at the 2018 Homecoming on Oct. 13. Voting went up for students via SimplyVoting on October 11 and lasted until October 12, 5 p.m. Other candidates for Homecoming King and Queen included Samantha Samant and Angelique D’Alessandro for Queen, and for King, Joseph Migliara and Daniel Puntorno.
Goldstein, a senior criminal justice major, has lofty goals. “Some of my academic and career goals are to make the dean’s list again and to obtain a career in the field of criminal justice,” he said.
As Homecoming King, he wants to present the best image for the university. “What I would do as homecoming king,” he said before he was named, “is promote positivity throughout the campus and represent the school in all of its glory.”
He has some advice for students. “Don’t be afraid to set goals and to face adversity.”
Goldstein felt that not being in a fraternity was an asset. “I feel like it’s pretty cool to have won against two people who had frat connections because the last five years it’s always been
a frat [member] and it’s about time that someone from a club won homecoming king for a change,” he said.
Olivia Kavanaugh, a senior art education major, was excited about being crowned Homecoming Queen. She, too, has ambitious plans for the future. “I’m working hard to prepare for student teaching next semester and eventually hope to teach art in an inner city school,” she said.
Kavanaugh wants to be the face representing her fellow students at events such as Founders day and the mansion lighting. “It is a huge honor to have been chosen by my fellow students to represent them as Homecoming Queen; I am very humbled to have won over my fellow, well-deserving, candidates,” she said.
Kavanaugh has simple advice for others: Work hard, “but enjoy all that you do and if you are given a good opportunity, don’t pass it up,” she said.

Co-Editor-In-Chief
A controversial, anonymous student-written pamphlet titled, “Common Sense: Truth & Ethics, Accountability & Morals – Where have they gone?” appeared in various locations on campus, including the Little Theatre, Hillwood Commons, Pioneer newsstands in Humanities, and in the locker rooms in the Pratt Recreation Center in the days preceding Homecoming.

The pamphlet, modeled after Thomas Paine’s
“Common Sense” written in 1775-76, lists grievances of the student body and demands for University President Kimberly Cline to make changes, or to step down. The Pioneer fact-checked the statements in the pamphlet
President Cline’s Salary
The author of the “Common Sense” pamphlet brought up Preisdent Cline’s salary, saying, “In December 2016, Money magazine quoted Cline as making $859,494.000, including total compensation.”
Cline declined to comment on her salary, saying that salaries are “disclosed in IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System)” and it can be compared to other university presidents as an average. Cline also denied the claim that university funding was going into her salary.
Funding Decrease
The pamphlet listed a decrease in funding of scholarship awards and the Tilles Center for Performing Arts.
Director of the Tilles Center, William Biddle, said there were no cuts to the Tilles Center budget. “In fact, there have been significant capital improvements made to both Tilles Center and Krasnoff Theater,” Biddle said in an email. He also said that the Krasnoff donation does not directly affect the budget, as funds were used for capital improvements through facilities.
President Cline reported over a $100 million increase in scholarship funding in November 2017 when her tenure contract was extended.
LIU Brooklyn Faculty Lockout
“Cline’s administration and trustees are the FIRST to LOCKOUT Professors…”
This statement is true in the United States; in the 2016-17 academic year, the administration made an unprecedented decision to lockout the LIU Brooklyn faculty to prevent the repeated action of negotiations ending in strike votes for the new faculty contract. Faculty lockouts are rare, but not unheard of; in Canada, a lockout occurred in 2007 at St. Thomas University in Fredericton; more recently in May 2018, the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières also had a faculty lock- out of 445 professors.
More information about the Brooklyn faculty lockout can be found in The Pioneer’s Sept. 14, 2016 article, “LIU Faculty Disruption to Begin Semester,” at liupostpioneer.com/liu- faculty-disruption-to-begin-semester/.
Cline’s Tenure Extension & Vote of No Confidence
“Despite the fact that the faculty from LIU Post and Brooklyn gave Cline a vote of ‘NO CONFIDENCE,’ the board of trustees thought it wise to grant the queen a new contract.”
This statement is true. In Nov. 2017, the board of trustees extended Cline’s contract by six years to Dec. 2023. Eric Krasnoff, chair of the board, said in an email that the extension was granted due to her “outstanding accomplishments” since her hire in July 2013.
That same year, faculty at both Brooklyn and Post campuses voted no confidence in
the president. The faculty council sent a 284 report with supporting documents detailing the charges against the administration and the board of trustees to the New York State Education Department (NYSED). The Pioneer also covered these issues in the Nov. 29, 2017 article, “President Cline’s Contract Extended Six More Years,” and can be read at liupostpioneer.com/president-clines-contract- extended-six-more-years/.
Mercy Lawsuit
“Cline and Weis did not respond to any inquiries made by The Pioneer.”
While Cline and the newly appointed Vice President of Academic Affairs Edward Weis did not directly respond to The Pioneer, Weis and LIU publicly denied the allegations in the lawsuit filed by Mercy College against them. A spokesperson for the university, former director of university public relations, Jon Schneider provided a statement when the lawsuit was filed that “this lawsuit is without merit, and we will address the facts in court.” University counsel Michael Best said there are no further updates in the case.
More details about the allegations in the Mercy lawsuit can be found in the Pioneer’s Sept. 19, 2018 article, “LIU Gets Served,” at liupostpioneer.com/liu-gets-served/.
LIU “Broken Promise”
The “Common Sense” author claimed there are “not enough Promise Coaches” and “just this semester we have lost nearly half of our Broken Promise staff.”
Before the start of the fall 2018 semester, three out of the 20 (not half) Promise Coaches left the university to move on to higher positions after spending “six or seven years” here, according to Dean of Students Michael Berthel. The remaining 17 promise coaches meet a 150 student cap and advise students personally based on specialized training in their academic departments. Two of the three coaches who left were residence hall directors, so the office is searching for replacements. But it won’t happen overnight. “It’s all about finding the right people,” Berthel said.
Mold Across Campus
“Students have been starting to get severely ill. There is at least one report of a student being rushed to the emergency room after becoming so sick from the mold.”
The anonymously run Instagram account, “Everything_Broken_at_Post,” features images and videos provided by students of unsanitary, mold/bug infested areas on campus. There are several posts on the account documenting the mold in the academic buildings, residence halls and the Winnick Student Center dining hall.
Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, said they are addressing any mold as quickly as identified/notified.
“We have been working behind the scene to mitigate and minimize the conditions that can promote mold growth,” Fergus said.
“Some steps already taken include more frequent HVAC unit filter changes, better ceiling insulation and insulation methods, de-humidification in areas prone to condensation activity and sealing open areas that allows excessive amounts of outside humid air to get into occupied – especially cooled air conditioned – spaces,” he continued.
Fergus encourages all students to report mold sitings through the work order link app to get the information to the facilities team. The link can be saved as a shortcut on the home screen of any smart device.
“We have and will work as part of the larger team effort, to aggressively address/ combat any and all evidence of indoor mold activity.
Veterinary Medicine School
“How did LIU jump from being 12th to 1st on the list of schools being considered for the accreditation by the Council on Education?”
The administration forwarded a request to the accrediting body.
“We requested a site visit, the accrediting body has a certain number of site visits they do each year, we met their requirements and they granted us a site visit,” said Dr. Randy Burd, senior vice president of academic affairs.
Another claim stated the advertisements of the new vet school “features the façade of our current library, suggesting that it will be in the current likeness of the present structure.”
The location for the new vet school is slated to be an extension of Pell Hall between Pell and Kumble Hall, not replacing the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial library. The style of the building was created to match the traditional style of the other buildings on campus to make it fit in, according to Cline.
The projected cost of the vet school is a projected $40 million, not $50 million. Governor Andrew Cuomo promised $12 million in state transformative funds, and the university has hosted several fundraisers, including a polo match on Sept. 15, to raise additional funds.
$28 Million in Debt
“…rumor has it” that the university is $28 million in debt.
Cline denied the existence of a deficit, saying that there is actually a surplus in this year’s budget. “In the last five years the university has gone from $86 million to about $230 million in endowment. We’ve had surpluses every year since I’ve been here,” she said.
University CFO Chris Fevola confirmed Cline’s statement, saying, “There is no deficit. The university is the most financially secure and stable it’s been in the last six years.” Capital investments increased from $2 million per year to $15 million now; funding for endowed and restricted scholarships are also high, according to Fevola.
One LIU Athletic Merger
“Without informing anyone, without consulting the student body, the University destroyed hundreds of college careers.”

The announcement for the merger did come after the start of the fall 2018 season, and two weeks after the class add/drop period, putting student-athletes in a difficult position for their next year – if some decide to transfer, they lose a year of eligibility to play; the status of their athletic scholarships are also uncertain.
Cline said that the timing of the announcement was not done without thought of timing; announcing mid-season and after the add/drop period was unrelated. “As we were looking at timing, in the beginning we thought it might be a little bit later, but as we got nearer to making the final decision, we really felt that just before Homecoming would be the right [time],” she said. “Most importantly for our students, we wanted to make sure that as we were moving forward, we wanted to be in a place where we can talk to them and have the ability to meet with them as teams and individuals.”
Cline said that student-athletes’ scholarships are secured. “We got a waiver from the NCAA that we can actually meet all scholarship commitments for our students and we are committed to doing that,” she said.
More information on the merger can be found in The Pioneer’s Oct. 10, 2018 article, “Game Changer: Athletics Becomes One LIU,” at liupostpioneer.com/game-changer-athletics- becomes-oneliu/.
More Department Mergers
“Dean Valli is rumored to be merging both the Fashion Merchandising Department and Computer Science Department soon.”
A proposal to merge the two departments was made, but it has not yet been approved, according to Christopher Malinowski, professor and chair of the computer science department.
Robert Valli, dean of the school of business and management, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the merger.

The Post campus has been in uproar since the OneLIU announcement that the Post and Brooklyn sports teams would merge. Stacks of guerilla pamphlets were left on The Pioneer newsstands, in the Little Theatre, on cork boards in classroom buildings, and in other locations around the school.
The pamphlets open with, “The student body is furious, and We will not longer fall into silent apathy.” They describe the feelings of certain students on multiple issues, including the promise coaches, alleged mold problems and department mergers. The pamphlets demand change and end with, “The good students of LIU Post refuse to simply do nothing any longer.”
The declaration was inspired by Thomas Paine, who helped ignite the American Revolution in his “Common Sense.” Paine wrote a list of demands and encouraged independence from Great Britain. Similar to Paine, the pamphlets seem to imply a sort of coup d’etat. “Spread the word, make sure we’re heard, and dethrone Queen Kimmy NOW.”
The rage of the students has not gone unnoticed by administrators. President Kimberly Cline stated, “Change is not easy, even change that is embraced by University best practices. I appreciate and respect debate and engaging conversation. What does not help the larger conversation are those who may have personal agendas and are comfortable disseminating inaccurate or negative information.”
The president assured students that the administration is not trying to fight the student body and wants to address these issues civilly.
Faculty members, too, have not been silent. “The faculty is coming together in a way that I haven’t seen in many years in opposition to the administration’s policies,” political science professor and president of the faculty union, Michael Soupios said.
One of the main focuses in the pamphlet was Cline’s salary of “around $800,000 per year.” Despite there being no correlation between the cuts and alleged deficit and Cline’s earnings, the anger stems from a lack of knowing.
“When you got a problem, you have a huge budget hole in your operations, and you refuse to acknowledge that, that’s the problem,” Soupios said. “She’s being paid and she’s not doing the job. There is a problem when you’re getting paid and conducting yourself like a tyrant, that’s the problem.”
Faculty and students appear to be in a state of confusion and the chaos has led to backlash.
The pamphlet discusses student issues with the promise office, which was designed to help students with their academic careers. “Broken Promise” as the program was nicknamed by the writer, suffers from a “high staff turnover rate and underfunding.”
Some students decided to do the promise coach’s job for them. Senior digital game design and computer science double major Kyle Duncan found, “a lot of them (promise coaches) slack. A lot of them are hard to get to. I tried connecting mine and she was gone for a month.”
The cries did not go unheard. Cline described the program’s purpose. “We put this program together so that each student would have a personalized coach. In fact the promise coaches have been dedicated [and] trained in special areas.” The objective of the Promise Office is to give a personalized experience to students, which is why the ratio is 1:150, according to Cline.
The program attempts to meet the needs of students. “All of our coaches are at the 150 cap. We are currently searching for two new [residence] hall directors. It’s all about finding the right people,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said. “We try to pair up our staff with what they’re passionate about.”
Another issue mentioned in the “Common Sense” pamphlet was mold. “From the dorms to the classrooms and offices of Pell Hall there is no respite.”
Duncan, a resident of Post Hall, supported the pamphlet’s allegations. “It’s crazy nothing has been done about it. The fact that they just let it go by. The fact that there are tons of students with this problem.” The pamphlet highlights the importance of this issue because mold can lead to health complications and should be addressed immediately.
Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, said the
facilities team is working as fast as they can to address issues of mold as they are reported.
“The facilities custodial and other staff have been directed to look for any evidence of mold growth in the areas (class- rooms, offices, hallways, stairs, public areas, restrooms, closets, etc.) where they are working; or are responsible for facilities maintenance service(s),” Fergus said in an email. “If mold
is discovered, the custodial staff is mobilized to clean any evidence of it with the established approved cleaning procedure that we have in place,” he continued.
Concerns about athletics were brought up. “All these athletes came to a Division II school with the promise of being able to play Division II and have now had the floor torn out from underneath them.”
Cline responded that the merger of the Post and Brooklyn sports teams “has been talked about for more than ten years” before she arrived at LIU. “At one point we were D1 for a few teams… and so this started before I got here. It has continued to be in conversation. We wanted to move forward when we were in the position that it made sense to move forward with some strength,” she said. The administration deemed that the appropriate time to make this change was when they had enough information to address all student-athletes.
The Paine Poseur included the department mergers. Multiple departments are being consolidated under one chairperson. The Pioneer reported on Sept. 12, 2018, that the English, foreign language and philosophy departments are now merged into one department with Professor John Lutz as chair. The political science, history, economics and sociology departments have also been merged. “Imagine a fashion merchandising student asking a computer science professor for academic advice. What a joke that would be!” the anonymous author lamented in “Common Sense.”
Students have not been informed of the motivation behind the department mergers. Some faculty members have responded.
“It’s because of money, they’re collapsing departments on each other, you’ll come up with savings. From an operational viewpoints students will be sacrificed,” Soupios said. Regardless of efficiency, students have noticed consequences already.
“We’ve been trying to fight for a new computer lab, but it’s almost off the table. With the budget cuts it’s probably going to be a thing in the past,” Duncan said about the needs of the game design program.
The author of the pamphlet called out the newly proposed veterinary school at Post, mainly asking why the accreditation process has proceeded so quickly. “How did LIU Post jump from 12th to 1st on the accreditation list?” How would LIU rival their competitors?
Cline responded to the accusations. “There is a huge need in this community for veterinarians. There are only 30 vet schools in the whole country and there are many more students highly qualified than there are spots so we would only be the 31st.” She stressed the potential the new vet school will have for the university. As for the issue concerning the expedited accreditation process, Cline clarified, “We forwarded a request to the accreditation body to come and review us, they sent a letter back with a date that said we were being reviewed.”
The driving force behind the pamphlet appears to be confusion. Students are unsure of the direction of the school, especially with the perceived financial uncertainty. The pamphlet questioned administration, “Oh, rumor has it Post is $28 million in debt?”
Cline declined that there is a deficit. “There is no $28 million deficit. In the last five years, our university has gone from $86 million to about $230 million in endowment. We’ve had surpluses every year I’ve been here,” she said.
University CFO Christopher Fevola confirmed Cline’s statement, saying that the university is more financially stable and secure than it has been in years.
Some faculty feel that the university’s problems are due, at least in part, to admissions. Enrollment figures analyzed by the Pioneer show a decrease in enrollment from an average of 820 to 550 in the last six years.
“The current administration [is] not being honest in terms of [the] financial situation. They have the wrong people doing the administrative operations; they’re not professionals in enrollment services. They conduct themselves like bullies, they’ve intimidated people, people are afraid to talk, people are afraid to make a policy, everything’s coming from the top. Everyone is terrified,” Soupios said, describing the feelings of some of the faculty members.
Students are uneasy, but they are not hopeless. “Students should come together. I feel like we should discuss our issues with the campus,” Nicole Zito, a sophomore psychology major, said. Plenty of students are ready to reach out.
“I feel kinda inspired. There are a lot of problems in this school. But me having two years left, I can be
a part of fixing it,” Khoa Nguyen, sophomore biology major, said.
