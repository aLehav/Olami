Long Island University has agreed to purchase the Racquet Club at Old Westbury, a private 10 acre outdoor tennis membership club located at 24 Quail Run, adjacent to the LIU Post football field. The Racquet Club consists of outdoor clay tennis courts, miniature golf courses, baseball batting ranges, driving ranges and archery, according to Nassau County land records. The property, which is at the end of a cul-de-sac, and also consists of a club house, does not appear to be currently in use. Calls to the Racquet Club’s telephone number were not returned.
According to Multiple Listing Service, the property was sold on Jan. 1, 2017 for $4.2 million. Joseph Schaefer, LIU’s Chief of Administration and Student Affairs, confirmed the property purchase. “A thriving University is constantly looking for growth opportunities to invest in the future and provide more programs for students, which is why LIU Post purchased the Racquet Club,” Schaefer said in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “There are very few opportunities for LIU Post to expand our footprint and this acquisition is a clear demonstration that the University is thriving, growing and investing in its future,” he added.
An entity called LIU Tennis Inc. was incorporated to buy the Westbury Tennis Club as of June 10, 2016, according to NYS Division of Corporations records. The state records indicate that LIU Tennis Inc. is a not for profit corporation, which means it has met tax-exempt requirements. According to the records, LIU Tennis Inc. was incorporated by Albanese & Albanese LLP, a law firm in Garden City.
Schaefer discussed the purchase in a Dec. 2, 2016 meeting with the Pioneer’s former editor-in-chief Maxime Devillaz, “The tennis club is contiguous to campus, and while the deal isn’t closed, its relative location by the athletics will likely have an athletics focus,” he said at that meeting.
“Purchasing [the tennis club] should be seen as something encouraging. It means the university is healthy, it means growth,” Christopher Fevola, LIU’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated at the same meeting.
The university has not issued an announcement about the purchase yet. “We are very excited about this new opportunity which will support student academic programs such as our Sports Management minor as well as Varsity Tennis,” Schaefer said. “The facility will also be available for intramural and other student activities. We are currently working to make this facility available to students, and we are planning a formal announcement closer to its available use by students,” he added.
Walter Giacometti, head coach of the women’s tennis team at Post, stated that the team has not used the tennis courts at the Racquet Club at Old Westbury in the past. “We have not used the courts at all since we have six courts already on our campus. It would not be a good fit for us to use the courts for the women’s team since the courts are clay courts, which are a different surface than the hard courts we use for all our matches,” Giacometti said.
Tennis team member Meagan Byrne, a junior business marketing major, said that while they have never played on the courts at the tennis club, it would be nice to have another place to practice if we ever needed it.”
The Pioneer filed a Freedom of Information Law request for records related to the Racquet Club at Old Westbury, but current records relating to the sale of the property were not yet on file with the Nassau County Clerk.

The Browse store and P.A.G.E.S club will host a Mario Kart video gaming competition on April 28 at 6:30 p.m. in the Fish Bowl. The grand prize for the winner is a pair of Beats EP headphones. “The night’s going to run through the game’s balloon battle,” in which players compete to pop the virtual balloons on the backs of their opponents’ vehicles, Albert Donor, a senior broadcasting major and Browse employee, said. Donor and one of his fellow employees, Mary Scibilia, will run the event.
This is the second gaming tournament sponsored by Browse on campus. The event is an opportunity for students to get involved on campus and have fun. “You meet a lot of new people,” Donor said, “because it’s not just Post students that can participate.” The event is open to students from other colleges as well. Browse has advertised the event via social media on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
Donor’s past participation in the event has helped him hone his gaming skills in areas he wouldn’t normally consider.
The first gaming tournament was held last semester for the video game “Call of Duty,” with roughly 20 people attending. Refreshments will be provided by the P.A.G.E.S club. Donor is also president of the P.A.G.E.S club, and he said the name, “is an acronym that stands for “Post Anime Gaming Entertainment Society.” Donor explains how the club is “all-inclusive” for entertainment purposes on campus. “We do everything from video games, movies, TV shows, board games, card games, you name it,” he said. The club will be providing more support for the event in the form of extensive video game knowledge. Since there are only two Browse employees proficient in gaming, “It’s nice to have a group that knows that they’re doing to help run our event,” Donor added.
There is a $5 registration fee that can be paid in the Browse store before the event beings.

On Wednesday, April 12, the Timely Conversations series held a panel on “Current Immigration Policies and their Effect,” in the Tilles Center Patrons Lounge. The Timely Conversations series was initiated by Shaireen Rasheed, professor of philosophical foundations and multiculturalism. The series aims to help students gain better understanding of the current issues discussed in classrooms, according to Rasheed.
The panel included Murtaza Hussain, journalist for The Intercept; Maryann Slutsky, executive director of Long Island Wins, and Laura Lemus, special project coordinator of Long Island Wins. It was moderated by Rasheed. The event started off with Slutsky, who spoke about the fear in the homes of immigrant families. According to Slutsky, crime is not being reported by undocumented immigrants because they fear that coming forward will result in their deportation. She also commented on how fear is affecting students. According to Slutsky, students of undocumented parents are afraid to go to school because they fear that they will come home to a parent missing. “Promising students are dropping out because they’re afraid they could get arrested by I.C.E.” Slutsky used words like “fear” and “afraid” constantly when describing the state of undocumented immigrants and their communities.
Lemus discussed the meaning of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and what it would mean if President Donald Trump were to repeal the act. Lemus is a DACA student and shared her experience. She arrived to the United States from Mexico when she was six-months old. Only after DACA was approved, Lemus was able to apply for employment using a social security number, after paying college out-of-pocket due to her citizenship status. “Now under this administration, this executive order which changed my life, has been threatened to be taken away,” Lemus said. Lemus also went over what to do during an I.C.E. raid, including, how to differentiate between an administrative warrant and a judicial warrant, which is vital information that may prevent a deportation. Additional information can be found on https:// longislandwins.com.
Hussain talked about various cases where students from prestigious universities had their visas terminated while abroad without an explanation. “International students contribute billions of dollars to the economy a year,” stated Hussain. “What makes America special, strong and great is that it attracts the best people from around the world. It gives the United States an edge in research, in the medical field and technology.” Hussain also talked about extreme vetting and how it affects immigrants’ opportunities and liberties.
Tiana Collazo, a senior sociology major, attended the event. Collazo said, “I have many immigrant friends and the changes with the new president has affected a couple people I know. So, I’d like to get more information for them, so they know what’s going on.”
The Timely Conversations series will resume in the fall.

Watching the National Football League is one of America’s favorite pastimes. The athleticism, competition and drama on display during an NFL game is at its peak, which is why the game continues to be so popular. Part of the success of an NFL game is how smooth the broadcast is on television. From the play-by-play announcer to the sideline reporter, NFL games are covered with precision. No stone is left unturned to ensure that the fans are experiencing everything that the game has to offer. Fred Gaudelli, an LIU Post alumnus turned producer, can be credited with some of that success.
Gaudelli graduated Post with a B.F.A., in communication and media studies in 1982. He chose to attend LIU Post because of his interest in the broadcasting program. “The gentleman who ran the [campus radio station] back then, Bill Mozer, ran it like a real station…Either you did what you were supposed to do, on time and professionally, or you were not getting on the air,” Gaudelli said. Growing up, Gaudelli admired veteran announcer Marv Albert and aspired to become an announcer, but he felt as though his voice was not up to par. Determined to make it in the sports industry, Gaudelli interned for a sports wrap-up program on an old channel five station known as Metro Media in New York City. It was there that Gaudelli realized he might have found his career path. “Once I did [the production] for that show, I kind of realized that it might be the better path for me than announcing”, Gaudelli said. Shortly after working a few production jobs, Gaudelli understood that in a production role, “his skill sets could really flourish.” “At that point of my life, pre-Internet, I had a really encyclopedic knowledge of sports. I saw where that knowledge could be used to shape a program,” he said. After graduating, Gaudelli worked for both ESPN and ABC until his departure for NBC in 2006. Producing Sunday Night Football for NBC, Gaudelli’s football knowledge and understanding of the importance of drama and storylines in sports gained him recognition and praise, as well as his mastery of controlling the production. Gaudelli focuses on certain minute details of the game, such as a particular matchup, between rookies and veterans.
According to the NBC Press Box website, Gaudelli has been producing NFL games for 27 seasons and has won 20 Emmy Awards for his production work. According to the website, Gaudelli is responsible for the yellow “first down” marker which indicates how far the player must run with the ball. Gaudelli is also responsible for several instant replays in which the camera catches a pivotal moment in the game, according to a 2012 Deadspin interview with Gaudelli.
In addition to his skills in capturing important moments, his attention to detail makes the announcer’s job easier. Gaudelli feeds information to announcers during the game with insights of what he sees, which can lead to the fans learning something that they were previously unaware of. Some fans may mistakenly believe that a producer’s job is simply camera work and cueing up replays but this is only a part of what is required for a successful broadcast. “Your main job [as a producer] is to make sure that the editorial content of the show is on point with the action on the field,” he said.
Gaudelli will speak on Thursday, April 20 at 12:30 p.m. in the Hillwood Cinema.

Roy Fergus, the district manager for facilities at Aramark, has begun training to replace Bill Kirker as the head of the Facilities Department next month.
Fergus’s career began in 1980, after he graduated from Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute with a degree in mechanical engineering. He began working with EBASCO Services Inc. designing equipment and overseeing safety practices at Shearon Harris, a nuclear power plant in North Carolina. He then worked at IBM from 1985-1994, overseeing engineering facilities.
In 1994 Fergus began overseeing building facilities that was angled towards the needs of the youth. “I joined Covenant House in 1994,” Fergus said, “It was a not-for-profit organization that provided a place of refuge for runaway youth. The main objective of the organization was to help young people find a rite of passage, in a time where they’re going through a time of crisis.”
At Covenant House, Fergus oversaw the infrastructure and facilities of three separate locations. He specialized in “dealing with the influx of people in and out of the facility, but it was during that time where I really refined my ‘general mode’: to always challenge myself.”
Prior to joining Post as an employee of Aramark, Fergus managed facilities at Yeshiva University for Aramark for over 13 years.
Fergus and Kirker share the same belief that the best practices within facilities will help students garner the education that they need. “The master plan is to capture the vision of the university, to implement the changes in physical infrastructure. Therefore, the more we [facilities] focus on maintaining the operations with an approach to use the best practices, then; we’ll be able to introduce new projects for the university as a whole.” Fergus said.
What does Fergus have in mind for campus? Right now, he is observing and learning in his new department. “He started March 28,” Kirker said. Fergus said, “Yes, it’s like drinking water from a fire house! I’m taking everything in. Bill’s built an exceptional program, and he’s been awesome [in terms of shadowing Bill around campus].”
“Roy’s a good man. He’s has experience, has a lot of knowledge on how a university works, and what is expected at this university…all in all, the transition is going very well,” Kirker said.
After the transition, it is not game-over for Kirker. In fact, it’s the beginning of a new act in his career. “After I’m done here, I’ll be working with an engineering firm in Manhattan; managing facilities for buildings that my firm will work with.” While he’s excited for the next step he takes in his already fruitful career, Kirker will miss his days at the university.
“I’ve had a great time at this campus. We got a lot of work done, and I’ll miss it here.”
As for Kirker’s entire staff, secretaries and assistants, Kirker believes that they will be retained after his departure. For Facilities questions, contact Roy.Fergus@liu.edu.

Long Island University educators have been honored with the David Newton Award for Excellence in
Teaching for over 30 years. On Thursday, March 23 in the Hillwood Commons Little Theater at 3:30 p.m. “As higher education continues to innovate and engage with the global community, we commemorate the professors who are pioneers in their teaching and their research,” President Kimberly R. Cline said in a statement to the university community.
This year’s honorees included three professors from the LIU Post campus. Dr. Lynn E. Cohen, professor of
special education and literacy and a founding member of the Play, Policy, Practice Interest Forum of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), has concentrated on creating spaces for multiple student voices and perspectives and providing mentoring support for students’ development as future educators throughout her tenure.
Dr. Azad L. Gucwa, professor of biomedical sciences, worked on characterizing the localization and phosphorylation of Ack1 mutants in collaboration with Professor Todd W. Miller of Stony Brook University and is a certified medical technologist under the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP).
Dr. Patrizia Porrini, professor of management, has received numerous awards, including the Professional
Experience and Career Planning Professor of the Year Award, the Eastern Academy of Management Outstanding Empirical Paper Award, the Long Island University College of Management Recognition Award for Excellence in Teaching, and the Beta Gamma Sigma Professor of the Year award in May 2004.
“Our professors do not instruct the status quo. They help students challenge preconceptions, expand their horizons, and push themselves to realize their highest potential,” Cline wrote in her email. “Through experiential learning our students are prepared to succeed in all facets of their lives and become well-rounded citizens,” she said.

The Center for Sustainability will host its seventh annual sustainability dinner in the Tilles Atrium on April 26 at 5:30pm. The event will offer a gourmet vegan meal, student musical performances, student and faculty speakers and a keynote address by former Congressman and now Chairman of the LIU Global Institute, Steve Israel. This sustainability dinner has been coordinated by Professor Carol Boyer and Professor Scott Carlin.
Carlin, who has served as the coordinator of the sustainability committee since 2010 and now as the chairman of the LIU Post Center for Sustainability, described sustainability at Post as “an academic field of study, but it is also a way to rethink the university experience.” In 2012 the university began to offer a master’s degree and now it offers an undergraduate degree and minor in environmental sustainability. “These degree programs are interdisciplinary and students learn how to examine the way economic, environmental, and social processes relate to each other,” Carlin said.
The sustainability committee recently benefited from the establishment of the LIU Post Center for Sustainability this past fall. “This past fall, LIU created the LIU Post Center for Sustainability which give our work greater visibility on campus and provides a more formal structure for us,” Carlin said.
Explaining the difference between the suitability committee and the new Center for Sustainability, Carlin said “The sustainability committee predates the Center; the sustainability committee had an ‘ad hoc’ structure for most of its existence. We would meet and make recommendations to different parts of the campus but there wasn’t a formal reporting structure. The Center, created last fall, reports to the Senior V.P. for Academic Affairs, Dr. Je Kane. Today, the work of the ‘committee’ is part of the work of the Center.
Amidst the growing sustainability dialogue on campus, The Coalition for Climate Change club was established last semester. The club seeks to raise awareness for sustainability on campus through programming and student involvement. The Center for Sustainability has also began to revamp the use of the greenhouse on Riggs Lawn by growing a campus garden.
Going forward the Center’s goals include expanding the campus garden, strengthening campus recycling and waste practices and finalizing a climate action plan. “On April 24, an Earth and Environmental Science class will release LIU Post’s first Climate Action Plan. Last year we completed our first campus sustainability assessment. Both efforts have used national assessment tools,” Carlin said. The sustainability assessment analyzed the sustainability practices of campus operations such as academics, campus events, residence halls, landscaping, energy, food services, and recycling.
The dinner is open to all students. Anyone interested in attending can RSVP to Carol.Boyer@liu.edu. The Center for Sustainability and in the past the sustainability committee has held these dinners to promote campus sustainability initiatives and help to inspire and expand sustainability work on campus. For more information about the Center for Sustainability, visit www.facebook.com/LIUPostGreen.

Being a part of the college newspaper is special. You become close with your team and form a dependable bond with one another. When you reach the end of your senior year, you realize that these are your last stories in the Pioneer, and although you may be happy that the stress will be gone, a feeling of sadness overcomes you, knowing you’ll see your name in the paper for the final time.
The Pioneer is losing some seniors this year who have worked hard to make the weekly campus paper possible. Although they are graduating, they have taught their fellow writers and editors skills to keep the Pioneer successful. The experience they have gained working for the Pioneer has prepared them for their future. The work and determination that these seniors have contributed show that they are ready to move on to greater things.
What did their time with the Pioneer mean to them? Thomas Gillen, the co-editor-in-chief, said, “One of my favorite things about being a member of the Pioneer is the camaraderie between the staff members. Joining the Pioneer gives you the opportunity to be part of a team in order to put together a successful paper each week.” Gillen continued, “While it’s a very long process each week, I’ll probably miss doing layout the most. It’s interesting to see the issue start as a basic document and then turn into a full-edged newspaper over the course of five or six hours.” As for Gillen’s plans for the future, he said, “Once I graduate, I’ll continue working as a video editor at NeuLion, but would eventually like to write for television or become a screenwriter.”
Joseph Iemma, a staff writer and previous features editor, said, “Writing for the Pioneer has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. Aside from writing, it’s taught me skills that I’ll use in the workplace and [with] friends forever. It’s been an honor to write for the Post community.”
Paul Whitbeck, the layout editor, said, “Being the layout editor for the Pioneer was a valuable experience that made me feel more confident as a graphic designer. It allowed me to apply what I’ve learned in school to a real world application and I am happy to have made some small contribution to the college during my time as a student.” When Whitbeck graduates, he plans to work full time at Data Device Corporation. “Throughout my career, I will always take with me what I’ve learned [at the Pioneer],” he said.
Thomas Asbaty, a staff writer said, “The Pioneer has taught me a lot within my major and has turned me into a man. In the future, Asbaty hopes to, “join the radio and television world.”
Nicole Curcio, the news editor said, “Working for the Pioneer has offered me real experience that has prepared me for reporting post-graduation. I have learned from my fellow writers and professor, and will definitely miss my Pioneer family. When Curcio graduates, she hopes to, “work professionally as a dancer on Broadway and in sports entertainment.”
Shelby Townsend, the sports editor said, [while at the Pioneer] “I’ve learned a lot about how fast-paced journalism really is, and I think everything I learned will prepare me for any type of job I may have in the future. Although Townsend doesn’t have a job lined up yet, she would love to “end up in print or broadcast journalism, preferably in NYC.”
Thank you, seniors, for all of your hard work. Good luck in the future and may it always be bright. The Pioneer staff will miss you!

Freshman social work major, Adam Silverstein adopted Gary, Miniature-Schnauzer/ Cocker-Spaniel, in abbreviated terms a ‘Schnocker’, when he was just three months old from a charitable fundraising event his Long Island School District had hosted back in 2009. “I was 10-years-old and in the fifth grade,” Silverstein said. Gary, now eight years old, is never far from his owner’s side. The two have even decided to take on college together, according to Silverstein, since “…he is now one of my best friends ever. One of my favorite things to do with Gary is walk around the LIU Post campus!” Silverstein went on to say that his beloved best friend, Gary, has “lots of friends here,” and that he has become a canine sensation on campus. “My friends all love to see him,” said Silverstein.
According to dog.petbreeds.com, Schnockers have been rated ‘affectionate, sweet, intelligent, and rarely bark,’ earning the Schnocker breed a five out of five star review. It’s also worth noting that Schnockers are a smaller breed of dog, which yields them a life expectancy of 12-15 years; leading Silverstein to believe that this friendship still has plenty of life left in it.

What is your favorite memory at LIU Post? What are you looking forward to after graduation?
Thomas Scavetta – Broadcasting
Getting the opportunity to broadcast the Northeast-10 Conference Championship game for the football team. I honestly never thought I would get to call playoff football here at Post, let alone two NCAA tournament games thereafter. The environment was just incredible that day around the campus. I remember going down to the field to interview Coach Collins at the conclusion of the win and it felt so surreal.”
Pursuing my M.B.A. at Post in the fall and learn how to promote and market myself at a higher level. I don’t know what the future holds for me yet, but I believe this will assist me in my works as a sports broadcaster.”
Din Djukanovic -Finance 
Some of the good friends I’ve made throughout my 4 years here at Post. These are great people that I’ve gotten to know well.
After graduation I either plan on working at a real estate and property management company or going back to school to get my masters degree.
 
 
Kelly Carey – Forensic Science 
Getting to participate in homecoming with the cheerleading team.

Playing baseball and partying on Riggs lawn.
Looking forward to paying off my student debt.

Savannah Cummings – Health Sciences 
Was being on a sports team, but also being involved in other things like Phenomenon and MIC Fest.

Catching up on the sleep I’ve missed over the last four years and getting to utilizing my degree in the real world.
 
 
Taylor Bass – Musical Theatre
When I was a Student Leader during my sophomore year! I spent the whole summer with students from a ton of different majors and they became my family, it was amazing!”

The Be The Change club is brand-new this school year. It’s dedicated to spreading positivity on campus and to making it a kind and loving community to help students thrive emotionally. It is the mission of the club to create a safe and judgement-free space for everyone to be themselves and feel accepted, while also making lifelong friends in the process.
Adam Silverstein, a freshman social work major as well as president and founder of Be The Change, first began the club during his senior year at Northport High School. He was inspired by Challenge Day, a national organization based in California that tours schools across the U.S. to promote students to be empathetic, and to understand the values of love, compassion, kindness and understanding. Northport hosted an annual Challenge Day workshop with a series of bonding exercises to open the students’ eyes to each other’s lives.
“Challenge Day helped me to overcome a lot of negative feelings,” Silverstein said, reflecting his first encounter with the event in his sophomore year. “It also revealed my passion to help people.” Silverstein became a team leader for the activities in his junior year of high school.
In his senior year, Silverstein wanted to create an organization that kept the mission’s ongoing impact alive. The motto of Challenge Day is a saying by Mohandas Gandhi, “Be the change you wish to see in the world,” which inspired Silverstein to name his new club Be The Change.
“It was such a passion [that] I brought it to Post,” Silverstein said. Since the start of the fall semester, the Be The Change club has gathered 15 to 20 members and has introduced several activities and events to LIU Post, including their Positivity Bake Sale, at which they sold treats along with cards depicting positive messages; All-Inclusive Valentine’s Day, when they handed out free candied hearts, chocolates and valentine notes during common hour in Hillwood Commons; and March “You Are Noticed” alienation awareness day, when students and faculty gathered in the Lecture Hall and shared personal stories dealing with the topic and sharing support. During the week of April 10, the club hosted, “Be The Change Week,” four days of spreading their mission statement to bring positivity to as many people as possible.
Monday, April 10, was “Love Yourself Day.” Be The Change partnered with the Hispanic Association club for a smile-themed bake sale in Hillwood during common hour. All proceeds went to Operation Smile, a charity that benefits children undergoing cleft lip surgery. Later that day, the club gathered in the Endzone to explore self-love.
Tuesday, April 11, was “Show Some Love Day.” The club hosted a mixer event in the Fish Bowl that evening at which they numbered tables and assigned everyone to random seating. This encouraged students to form new connections with each other. Students were able to let loose and bond through games and icebreaker activities. “We find things that help us relate to one another,” Amanda Jean-Louis, a sophomore vocal performance major and member of Be The Change, said.
Wednesday, April 12, was “Express Yourself Day.” Be The Change partnered with SNAPPS, the student poetry society on campus, to host an open mic night in the End Zone. Students shared their talents, ranging from vocal impersonations to singing and poetry. Silverstein instructed the audience in the “Art of Sass” as portrayed by Spongebob Squarepants.
“No one judges anything you say or do and it’s amazing,” Erin Gorden, a sophomore forensic science major, said.
Thursday, April 13, was “Live Life to the Fullest Day.” Be The Change seized the day by teaming up with PAGES, a gaming club at Post, to expose members to the adventurous world of dungeons and dragons. Students embraced fantasy character identities and stepped out of their comfort zones as they acted out a story using nothing but their creativity and imagination.
“All the activities we do bring us together as a family,” Matt Goldstein, a junior criminal justice major and co-secretary of Be The Change, said. The club members are proud of the diversity of thought and personality within their ranks. “It’s helped me make some amazing friends,” Silverstein said. “I feel connected, like I’m part of something great.”
The club hosted its first annual end of semester bash on Tuesday, April 18 at 7 p.m. in the Endzone. The “Be the Change Experience” was a smaller scale version of a Challenge Day workshop. Students went through a series of presentations, games and exercises which taught students how to open up to each other, be good listeners, and be better people overall.
Silverstein is looking forward to the 2017-2018 school year, when he will be both an R.A. and an Orientation Leader. “As I move through my years, I’m hoping to recruit some underclassmen to take over,” he said.

Anthony Campo, sophomore history major, hosted a ballroom dance lesson in the Great Hall on April 13 for honors merit credit. In addition to teaching the basic steps of the Foxtrot, Campo also demonstrated his expertise in other styles of dance. Students who attended learned the basics of salsa dance as well.
The Pioneer: How long have you been learning and teaching ballroom dancing?
Campo: I’ve been teaching and learning for three years now. I started learning when I started teaching.
TP: How did you get into teaching instead of just learning?
Campo: I was 16 at the time and was going to go to 7-Eleven to get a job. And then my dad said, “No you’re not going to work at 7-Eleven, you’re going to teach dance” and I was like “Ok!” I didn’t really have a choice, I was forced into it.
TP: Why dancing?
Campo: When I was little, [family members] used to call me the Jello-man because I just used to move.
TP: Is your family dance or music- oriented?
Campo: No. I’m the first dancer in my household.
TP: Are there any connections you have made in the industry?
Campo: I’ve met United States champions. I’ve met Bob Howers, 10-time United States Champion in smooth dancing. I only briefly said hi, but I met him!
TP: That was during a competition?
Campo: Yeah, we have competitions every 3 to 4 months. As a teacher, I dance with students mostly. So I bring my students out and they get judged. It’s more about them than it is about me, but I have to make them look good. Usually we spend like 1-2 hours a week just practicing these routines over and over.
TP: Do you see yourself dancing professionally in the future?
Campo: Yes, I just got a dance partner. We’ve been dancing professionally three months now.
TP: Are you with a specific group or company currently?
Campo: I’m with Arthur Murray. It’s a franchise with 150 locations around the world, the farthest one being Australia.
Campo’s goal is to be a world champion in dance. He expressed his desire to continue teaching dance on campus and believes that he is reviving a “dying art” in the millennial era. Students who take advantage of these future opportunities will get the chance to expand their minds and experience something fun, new and exciting.

HBO’s latest single-series success, Big Little Lies, had its series finale on April 2. If you’ve been living under a rock since the show’s premiere earlier this year, Big Little Lies follows the “mothers of Monterey” and the seemingly perfect lives they live while dealing with community gossip, their fractured families and a murder case. The show is based off the 2014 book, written by Liane Moriaty.
The series traces events leading up to the mysterious murder at the elementary school’s annual trivia night. Each episode is intercut with tales from members of Monterey’s PTA pointing fingers at everyone, which left viewers guessing until the very end who killed and was killed. The women at the forefront of the scandal are Madeline Mackenzie (Reese Witherspoon), Celeste Wright (Nicole Kidman), Jane Chapman (Shailene Woodley), Bonnie Carlson (Zoë Kravitz), and Renata Klein (Laura Dern).
There are many dynamics at play which signal tension between the five women: Madeline and Renata are long-time “frenemies.” On the first day of school, Renata’s daughter accuses Jane’s son – the new kid – of bullying, which results in a malicious “mommy-off.” Bonnie is now married to Mackenzie’s ex-husband, and both Jane and Celeste are harboring pasts of domestic assault (Jane was raped and Celeste’s husband physically abuses her).
When you weave these dynamics together with how the producers frame the timeline of events, the safe bet is to say one of them gets the axe. They’re at each other’s throats throughout the series, competing to be the most revered, well-liked woman in all of California – in a way that is apropos of being from stunning, successful Monterey, of course – how do they not want to kill each other?
Well, what shocked myself and most of the Big Little Lies fan base was who, ultimately, killed and was killed. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. After Madeline takes off from trivia night to find solace, Jane goes to comfort her. Renata and Celeste follow shortly after, and Renata apologizes to Jane for giving her trouble about her son (it is revealed Celeste’s son was actually bullying Renata’s daughter, picking up from good ole’ daddy dearest).
Later, Perry, Celeste’s husband, approaches the group, looking to apologize to his wife for what feels to be the millionth time. Celeste then admits to Perry that their son was the bully. Refusing to accept this fact, Perry bursts out in a fit of rage, beating Celeste as Renata, Jane, and Madeline try to claw him off of her. Bonnie, noticing the commotion, comes to the rescue, and in an immense act of courage shoves Perry o of Celeste, and down the multiple flights of stairs below him.
Perry’s physical death can be viewed as the metaphysical death of toxic masculinity, which often plagues relationships, the workplace, and even high offices of power. Our expectations as a society when a show like this hits the airwaves is that every episode will result in a cat fight over petty issues or a misread look in the wrong direction. Big Little Lies is different. It paints a picture of strong, independent women who are pitted against one another as a result of rumors and bad blood. But when a more threatening entity arises, it is the duty of the women to band together, no matter the odds, in order to defeat that entity.
Perry represents toxic masculinity personified; the “mothers of Monterey” represent the movements and marches we witnessed leading up to the 2016 election and thereafter. They stand as a testament of resistance, of defiance, of hope for a more dignified future.
Witherspoon describes her production company, Pacific Standard, which had a part in pioneering the miniseries, as a platform that “elevates and champions female storytelling, and works to creates and curate powerful content by and for women.”
In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Witherspoon said, “There’s a huge female audience in television that we want to service and help, and projects like Big Little Lies help authenticate the female experience through storytelling.”

The Merriweather Consort, a group “devoted to the performance of Renaissance music,” will perform in the Great Hall on Sunday, April 23 at 3 p.m. This is an orchestral performance combined with some band instruments, and the performers, dressed in Renaissance costumes, are “music majors who play string and brass instruments,” orchestra director, Maureen Hynes, said. “The members of the group learn to play reproductions of Renaissance instruments,” she added. The viol family (strings), the recorders and crumhorns (woodwinds), and the cornetto (brass) are included. Members of the group also play percussion instruments.
The Merriweather Consort will be performing Italian and French dances from the 16th century. “These include Pavanes, Gailliardes, Bransles and Basse dances. If you have seen a movie about King Henry VIII and his time period, these are the dances you see them doing at court,” Hynes said. The consort will “probably be teaching some of [the dances] to the audience.
The consort consists of 15 Post students who rehearse weekly from 5 to 7 p.m. on Mondays. “The semester is spent learning the repertoire that will be performed at the end of the semester, perfecting skills on the instrument and learning about the time period and the performance practices of that time,” Hynes said. The Consort group gathers input from students that allows them to carefully craft a piece in the way that the group sees t. “The music we play does not have certain instruments assigned to the parts. This allows for creativity in making each arrangement and prepares them for the future when as educators, they may be required to make arrangements of pieces for their students,” Hynes said. The performances speak for themselves, but costumes help immerse the audience in what they are watching and listening to. The Renaissance costumes add “a colorful note to the performances,” Hynes said.
The performance is open to the public, and admission is free.

The baseball team shutout East Coast Conference rival Queens College by a score of 3-0 on Thursday, April 13 at the LIU Post Baseball Field. It was the two teams’ second meeting of the season.
All of the Pioneers’ offense came in the first two innings. Sophomore catcher Anthony Vaglica broke out of an 11-for-61 slump in the first inning by knocking in two runs with a single. Vagilica was the Pioneers’ standout of the game on offense, going 3-for-4 with those 2 RBIs. He was the only Pioneer to reach base more than once, and it was his first multiple-hit game since March 29.
Vagilica said he was “very relieved” to get some big hits. “My swing got really long the past few months,” he explained. “And so I reverted back to keeping my head back, allowing me to see pitchers longer.”
The Pioneers pushed across their third run just an inning later, when junior out fielder Rob Andreoli continued his hot hitting by lacing an RBI single to left field to score junior shortstop Joe Spitaleri. Andreoli leads the Pioneers with a .315 batting average.
That Pioneers did not score another run after the second inning, but that was all sophomore pitcher James Varela needed on the mound. Varela red seven innings of shutout ball, allowing just one hit with four walks and eight strikeouts. It was Varela’s first win in his last four starts.
“Overall, my off-speed stuff was working off my fastball inside,” Varela said. He said he just wants to “keep the same mindset” to make sure he has more starts like this one. “Working hard in between each start and staying locked in with every pitch,” he said.
Varela departed after the seventh inning and 120 pitches, giving way to senior relief pitcher Brian Tinney in the eighth inning, who worked into and out of trouble, stranding two runners. Senior relief pitcher Dan Jagiello came on in the ninth to shut the door, striking out two in the inning and earning his seventh save of the season.
The Pioneers have now won the first two of their four meetings against Queens this season. The win put them at 15-13 overall on the season, and it was their sixth win in their last eight games, all of which were conference games. Their next home game comes Wednesday, April 19 against the ECC-rival University of Bridgeport.

On April 11, the softball team split a double header with the No.25 ranked Caldwell University in a non-conference matchup at the LIU Post softball complex.
The 15-15 Pioneers suffered a 7-1 loss in the first game, before coming back and taking a win 7-4 in the second game. “Splitting with the number one seed in the region was a success because their program has been very successful this year,” sophomore catcher Julia Seader, a physical education major, said.
In the first game, the Pioneers feel behind early, 3-0, until junior in fielder Claire Travis ripped an RBI single in the bottom of the second, making it 3-1. In the third inning, the Pioneers had the tying runs on base when Seader walked to lead the inning and freshman out fielder Abbey Fortin singled. Post was unable to score the runs, though, as Cougars’ pitcher Sydney Ponto retired the next three batters closing the inning.
Sophomore pitcher Hannah Olsheviki got the loss, throwing seven innings of nine hit balls, five walks and two strikeouts.
Game two was tied at three going into the bottom of the third inning, when the Pioneers put up a four spot taking a 7-3 lead, making it their largest lead of the day.
Junior out fielder Samantha Marrone laced a RBI single and Jaclyn Hahn drew a walk with the bases loaded.
In the fifth inning, the 23-10 Cougars’ cut into the lead with a Marisa Monasseri solo homerun off freshman pitcher Katie Humhej. Humhej got her third win of the year. She threw seven innings of four hit balls, four runs (three earned) two walks, and two strikeouts.
“I wanted to go out and do my best to help the team leave the field with a win,” Humhej, a health science major, said about her start.
The Pioneers have had four major injuries this year, sidelining senior pitcher Ashley Martin, senior out fielder Mackenzie Buckley, junior in fielder Leah Mele and sophomore out fielder Marisa San Antiono.
The team currently sits sixth in the ECC at 3-5 with a few weeks left in the season. To make a playoff push, “We need to work together as a team and play as loose as we can. In order to really succeed we need to believe that we are number one,” Seader said.
The Pioneers defeated Bridgeport 4-0 and 11-7 on Thursday’s game and again defeated Merrimack College in two games winning 4-2 and 6-5 on Friday. The team’s next game is a home game on Monday, April 17 where they will be playing Saint Thomas Aquinas College at 3 and 5p.m.
