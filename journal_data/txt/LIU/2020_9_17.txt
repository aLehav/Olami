As the death of George Floyd, a man who was pushed down to the ground under an officer’s knee as he said “I can’t breathe,” was broadcast over the national news, the social climate of the United States changed.
More people began to acknowledge the blatant racism and prejudice that people of color face in all aspects of their lives. The protests, educative nature and petitions in support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement became a focal point of media outlets news coverage this summer.
“I’ve always been aware of my heritage and being different from the majority of people I know,” sophomore arts management major Evelin Figueroa-Ballester said. “But the first instance I remember was this one time in third grade where I met a student who had just immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba. I was so excited to meet them and we were speaking Spanish. Everyone on the bus screamed and laughed at us. They could not believe we were speaking ‘Mexican’.”
Figueroa-Ballester said that she feels desensitized to a lot of the microaggressions she experiences because of her mixed race.
“I’ve experienced different acts at different severities all throughout my life, of course I notice things but I don’t actively try to think about them all the time,” she said.
DeVonna Brockman, a sophomore film major at Rutgers University and former LIU student, was deeply affected by the acts of violence that occured over the summer.
“It’s absolutely devastating and frustrating, to say the least, seeing Black people get killed at the hands of the police,” Brockman said. “It’s scary to see people who look like me, my older brother, my cousins and my parents lose their lives unjustifiably. I believe Floyd’s death made so many people of all races think about how Black people are being discriminated against and what can be done about it.”
Seeing the widespread support of the Black Lives Matter movement has been uplifting for Figueroa-Ballester.
“It was very nice to see the community come together and take a stand against injustice,” Figueroa-Ballester said. “It’s a whole other ball game to see people protest and stand up against racism. Even though I couldn’t be [at protests] physically, it felt great to be witness to an intergenerational and intersectional fight against injustice.”

Brockman said that as she mourned the losses of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and many more people of color who have died as a result of police brutality, she began to think of more things she could do to support the BLM movement.
“I decided to make and sell Black Lives Matter shirts and have been selling them ever since,” she said. “All the proceeds from the shirts are donated to multiple causes that benefit the advancement of and support Black people and communities.”
As the movement progressed, so did the divide between residents of the United States. A fundamental idea that many members of the BLM support is to “defund the police,” meaning to reinvest a portion of the money that police departments receive into communities. 
“The police force evolved from the slave patrol, which was specifically made for disciplining Black people,” Brockman said. “Because police training has these discriminatory roots, there needs to be a reform. Officers are given too much control and they’re misusing it; their first instinct shouldn’t be to pull out their gun before their taser, and they shouldn’t pull someone over simply because they’re Black. The police need to be re-trained, re-equipped, and thoroughly investigated. Part of their job is to ensure safety and there’s no way for them to effectively do that until things change.”
In an interview for CNN, Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of the BLM movement, said that the money could also go towards funding schools, hospitals, and housing in communities that have been marginalized.
“I’m an optimist about the whole situation,” Figueroa-Ballester said. “It doesn’t mean I’m not exhausted but I’m doing my part. There needs to be change, but there also needs to be less performative action and more movement. People in charge of schools and corporations and all that need to make the effort.”
As she spoke about the amount of students she saw post about BLM, Figueroa-Ballester expressed her concern with the people who would simply share something and not take action.
“So many people go to the Black fraternity and sorority parties on campus. They seem to love our culture and share that on social media. They seem supportive of us. But then when it comes to attending clubs like Black Student Union or supporting people of color at events; no one shows up,” she said. 
With the intensity and prominence of racism in the United States, LIU has made different efforts to support students with diverse backgrounds. Race and LGBTQ+ identity mixers have been presented for students to attend on Zoom, but Figueroa-Ballester believes that it’s not enough.
“It’s a problem that Promise can’t solve on their own,” she said. “It’s uncomfortable walking into some of my classes and being the only Black person. I feel like I have to be the spokesperson for all Black people sometimes, which isn’t fair because we all have different experiences and it’s not my job to educate others.”
Figuera-Ballester believes that while some of the meetings Promise has held on Zoom have been helpful, she wants more action from university president Kimberly Cline.
“A step in the right direction would be working towards making this school the first choice for people of color,” she said. “I think that having more diversity scholarships like LIU Brooklyn has could help.”
Figueroa-Ballester also thinks events like the mixers can be polarizing if not accompanied by events for understanding the struggles of people of color.
“I don’t want to feel isolated from other people at school. I just want to feel more comfortable and understood,” she said.
Brockman spent her freshman year at Post and believes that all schools could benefit from having a mandatory class like Post 101 for learning about different races, racism, discrimination, oppression, inclusivity and understanding.
“Some people don’t know or realize that they’re being racist, which is understandable, but nothing is really being done about it and that’s a problem,” Brockman said.
On Saturday, Sept. 26 Figuera-Ballester will be attending a rally in support of Black women from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m at the Hicksville LIRR station, where attendees will march to the gate of SUNY Old Westbury. Students interested in attending can email annelaforest7@gmail.com for more information.
“Change starts with action,” Figuera-Ballester said. “Anyone who wants to go should go.”

After nearly seven months of virtual learning, students were able to return to campus for the start of the fall 2020 semester. 
	New safety precautions have been implemented to ensure that students can return to campus, while mitigating the chances of spreading COVID-19. Areas on campus such as Hillwood Commons and the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library have seen substantial changes in their appearance and operating capacity.  
	Hillwood Commons, an area known for being a popular social spot on campus, has new limitations in place. A maximum of two students are allowed at a table at one time. This has been accompanied with protective screens at all food stations in order to prevent students and faculty from interacting face to face.
The library’s computer area has been removed, and made into a makeshift classroom. Students who need to print out materials can do so in the Career Bar on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, which features the same amenities as the original computer area.
These renovations have been accompanied by campus wide changes, such as all students being required to wear face coverings when it is not possible to social distance and requiring that anyone who enters campus complete an online “COVID-19 Self-Check,” according to the student reopening FAQ.   
The university’s reopening plan was created to ensure the safety of the campus community, according to Executive Dean of Students Michael Berthel. 
“The University has worked closely with local health officials to develop a reopening plan that exceeds CDC and state guidelines,” Berthel said. “Many measures have been put into place throughout campus that are designed to promote social distancing and allow students to freely move around campus in a safe and healthy way. Some of this include, floor and wall signage, additional hand sanitizers and touchless fixtures, removal of furniture and social distancing of spaces, and enhanced cleaning.”
Some students, such as freshman health sciences major Victor Nelson, have found the transition to a new style of campus initially jarring.
“It’s definitely weird coming from a different school and going to a whole other state, and having to go to school among a lot of people with masks on, but I think I’m kind of adapting to it,” Nelson said. 
Other students, such as sophomore acting major Nick Humphries, have been able to find educational opportunities within the new restrictions.
“As somebody who is looking into being an artist it’s good to work through times where everything is turbulent and being tossed around and situations are fluid,” he said. “Because it helps you be ready for any situation that could arise, so that you’ll always be in the moment and be prepared.”
Berthel believes that it is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to help keep the campus safe.
“Each of us will have a personal responsibility to ourselves and our community members to protect each other and keep LIU healthy. We’re counting on everyone to step up and be part of the solution,” Berthel said. “I am confident that if everyone follows the social distancing guidelines and cares about one another that we will have a successful semester on campus.”

Preceding the first day of classes at LIU, professors began the arduous process of integrating social distancing measures in their classrooms. That process was especially difficult for the Post Theatre Company, whose classes often have a large number of students in attendance and whose rehearsal spaces are generally not large enough for students to act, sing and dance an acceptable distance apart.

In order to maintain safety for the musical theatre program, the classes that are at the highest risk for viral transmission will be taking place online this semester.
“For me, that’s voice and speech as well as voice lessons because in those situations, the virus can travel up to 20 feet instead of the standard six,” Kamerann Burney, a sophomore musical theatre major, said. “We avoid [possibly spreading the coronavirus] by making [those classes] a Zoom University experience.”
Burney said that she and her classmates feel extremely uncomfortable wearing masks in order to attend their dance classes. Some of the dance classes have been moved to the gym to allow more space for the students to spread apart, but face coverings are still required. 
“If [wearing a mask] is what it takes for us to be working in a studio, we are all more than happy to do it,” Burney said. “We will not compromise our health or our education, and masks are a means of accomplishing that.”
While students were aware of the unique challenges presented to the program because of the coronavirus, some opted to take all of their theatre classes online via Zoom or simply take a gap year.
BrayLynn Willis, a sophomore musical theatre major, is one student who considered taking a gap year.
“Ultimately, I decided not to take a gap year because I felt that I had finally found my place in the department,” Willis said. “I’ve come to know and love working with the people in my program. If I took a gap year, I wouldn’t be graduating with my friends and I’d have to make all new connections with a new group of people.”
The theatre faculty members send out emails and create online meetings to constantly keep the students informed.
“It’s almost like the updates physically can’t come fast enough because of how fluid the situation is, but we’re all very connected and very candid with each other. We help each other through this,” Burney said.
While the students attend classes and prepare performances in such an uncertain environment, it is an ongoing conversation in the department on how the shows will be viewed by audience attendees.
Currently, students and faculty plan on pre-recording shows on Zoom and posting them online for students to watch.
This past week, the showcase for students who were freshman last year was cancelled by a student vote.
“Between the stresses of starting a new school year during a pandemic, and the awful Wi-Fi problems we’ve been experiencing, the students and faculty agreed [the] showcase was too much of a burden to put on,” Willis said. “We held one rehearsal and there were multiple people who couldn’t stay connected to the Zoom for longer than a minute. What we were capable of performing under the circumstances wasn’t the kind of art we wanted to put out there.”
Announcements for upcoming shows will be posted to the theatre company’s Instagram handle @ptcliupost.
Despite the stressful and changing nature of how the program will best adapt to social distancing, while maintaining a solid foundation for learning, the students try to keep a positive outlook on their education.
“Nothing is the way it should be,” Burney said. “So it is difficult to pinpoint [the biggest change in the program], and I feel everyone on campus can relate. I don’t love that this is our new normal, but again, I have to accept it just like the rest of us.”
Burney and Willis both report the amount of support they feel from their classmates as well as the theatre faculty helps them stay grounded.
“At this point, we’re all facing problems head on and I take pride in the fact that our department is committed to creating the best work we can, in spite of those problems,” Willis said.

This summer a group of students have come together to reestablish the Muslim Student Association (MSA) Club. The club is finalizing the last steps to fully be established and will be a fun and educational environment for all students willing to listen and learn. 
The group really wanted to diversify the campus and create more representation according to Co-President and sophomore biology major Freshah Sarwari. 
“We all wanted to raise awareness about Islam, that was our main goal because there is a lot of misconceptions these days and media coverage that isn’t the best to hear. I think that having MSA can teach others that your Muslim peers are doing great things so we’re spreading a positive message,” Sarwari said. “It’s not something that might be shown in the media [but] if you have real life interactions and you have muslim peers that are making a difference it kind of changes your perspective if you have a negative one.”
Honyah Dutt, sophomore biology major and Co-President of MSA, explained that the club’s goal is to address misconceptions about Islam.
 “Basically our goal is to create a sense of comfort and to help other peple understand [that] there is a big misconception of Islam in general. We also have main goals to raise awareness for other countries that are in need,” Dutt said. “There are a lot of countries like Yemen and Afghanistan that are going through a lot of crisis right now so our goal is to raise a lot of money for those counties as well as help people realize that it isn’t just America that is going through something and other counties are in need.”
Co-Presidents Dutt and Sarwari also wanted to create a sense of unity between the Muslims on campus.
 “One thing I’ve seen in a lot of Muslim households is that a lot of them are hospitable, I think that its important to have that kind of community because it feels like home. I think that’s especially important for college freshmen because college is a new place for them and it’s scary. As a freshman,it was a frightening feeling [being in] a new environment, you don’t know a lot of people and it’s so different from high school. So I think that having a safe space where you can feel at home and comfortable is a really nice way to start the year and I feel like creating an MSA is our way of doing that.”
Treasurer and freshman accounting major Maria Pochi agreed that Dutt and Sarwari helped make her transitions to college a lot smoother. 
“Honyah and Freshtah did a good job of giving us an insight of what college really felt like,” Pochi said. “Meanwhile I got lost on the way to one of my classes so like they really guided me and seeing a familiar face on the first day really felt really good. It’s a good support group in a way.” 
Nabeena Faruque, Secretary and freshman nursing major, agreed. “It’s a really good support group if I need help in any way,” she said. “I could always go to Honyah and Frehstah and they would always guide me in any way.”
Dutt and Sarwari both want to create this safe environment for any students interested.
 “We’re not just specifying we want to be there for Muslims in general we want to be there for everyone too, we want to create a homey environment while creating an understanding and helping people learn,” Dutt said.
	The e-board members all encourage anyone wanting to join, Sarwari said, “We would definitely love to have you join. We always encourage an environment where people are willing to learn, in Islam we are always encouraged to learn more about each other despite difference,” Sarwari said. “I think in today’s world there are so many people that don’t feel at home practicing their own religions or don’t even feel comfortable in their skin colors and ethnicities so it’s really important to understand that beyond all our differences we are all human and we all want to make a difference in life and we all have a purpose in life.”
	Any students interested in joining the MSA club should contact Freshtah Sarwari at post-msa@my.liu.edu.
