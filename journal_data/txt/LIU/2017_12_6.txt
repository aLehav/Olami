The College of Management is in its second year of its Dean Scholars program. First initiated in the fall of 2016 as a collaboration between Dean Robert Valli and Assistant Deans Raymond Pullaro and Graziela Fusaro, the Dean Scholars are a selective group of 25 students handpicked from a pool of high achieving high school seniors interested in studying business, management, and entrepreneurship at Post.
“Much is provided for them, much is expected of them,” Valli said. The second prong is to have the Dean Scholars act as first line ambassadors for the school. They help promote new initiatives to the student body, like through student run businesses and events during the Global Entrepreneurship Week; meet, recruit and mentor new students; and they represent the school within the community with businesses and government agencies, such as through the LIU-iQ Consulting firm.
At the start of the semester, there is a three prong goal put in place for the Dean Scholars, according to Valli. The first is to help accelerate their passions and skills – both hard skills like excel, presentations, and so that they can be most prepared for job interviews and jobs. “We begin with the end in mind,” Valli said. “And that’s a three letter word – J-O-B.”
The third prong involves tracking the scholars over a four year period to help them with core requirements, both inside and outside of the college. “We track them over four years and the expectation is that they will have four internships in four years. Some of them might be summer internships, or short internships [like] during accounting season for two months,” Valli said.
The deans start by putting the scholars in touch with professionals and VIPs that not only come through a Leadership Speaking Series on campus, but also to put them in touch with professionals “coming into town.” Last year’s group went to a luncheon with Colin Powell when he spoke on campus, and this year’s group went to hear former President Bill Clinton speak at the Tilles Center in October.
Second-year Dean Scholar, Dylan Silva, a senior business management major, works as a teaching assistant (TA) where he focuses on recruiting potential Dean Scholars for next year and on getting the current scholars involved on campus through different opportunities. “Dean Scholars has personally benefited me extensively,” he said. Last year, Silva interviewed with 11 different companies, all interested in what “Dean Scholars” listed on his resumé meant.
“The Dean Scholars program leaves me speechless,” Antonio Deodato, a freshman computer science major, Dean Scholar and Sanford Scholar [a full ride scholarship], and member of the baseball team, said. “The amount of connections they have made for us is greatly appreciated. Especially the events they recommend us to attend, [such as] Bill Clinton and IMA where we got to speak with a variety of companies, like Canon, for potential internships. I wouldn’t be able to get that anywhere else, especially with Dean Valli and Pullaro being able to be that close with us, by our side, guiding us through college. You don’t get that at another big school.”
“I got an internship with Meijer [a food market industry], which is the 16th largest privately owned company [in the U.S.],” he said. Silva worked as a business analyst for the company. At the end of his internship, he was approached by the CEO & President of the company, who is worth $18 billion, and asked one question: “Why LIU?”
“Essentially, because of the Dean Scholars program and what it has done for me. It has allowed me to take what I am learning in the classroom and implement it into real world use through different organizations on campus such as student run businesses [and] the investment firm, LIU-iQ.”
One of those faculty members is Dane Stangler, a visiting associate professor of marketing, who is the Vice President of Research & Policy at the Ewing Marion Kau man Foundation, which is considered to be the “mecha of entrepreneurship.” Stangler teaches ENT15 alongside Dean Valli for the first semester of the Dean Scholars program.
“I hope to create an environment of exploration, especially in the entrepreneurship side,” Stangler said. He wants the scholars to explore what entrepreneurship means. “You can’t turn around these days without seeing the word ‘entrepreneurship’ or ‘startup,’” he said.
Stangler encourages open discussions in class. “It’s hard to learn or teach management in a classroom setting. It’s actually impossible; it can’t be done,” he said. Management skills are something that have to be learned “on the job.”
“They’ve been teaching us the content you wouldn’t be taught [elsewhere]. How to present yourself in a professional environment, how to dress properly,” Deodato said. “It sounds simple, but it actually makes a big difference. It’s those very slight aspects that you hold for yourself that make a difference in the long run.”
Deodato is also in the Honors College. “We have great discussions on the content we read, we go really in-depth and relate it to now,” he said about his honors English course. The interdisciplinary nature of the Honors College goes well with the Dean Scholars program, according to both Dean Pullaro and Valli. “[We] are actively collaborating on how to get those academically high achieving students that want to do an honors program, write a thesis, do undergraduate research, and also want to do Dean Scholars, and how they can do that more efficiently,” Pullaro said.
“Students will be able to graduate with honors and dean scholars on their diploma,” Joan Digby, director of the Honors College, said. Dean Scholars who are in the Honors College will be able to write about their experiences in the program for their honors thesis, according to Digby.
Another area of focus in the dean scholars program is the concept of agility. The scholars are taught on how to deal with circumstance and changes within their environments. “The ground is always going to shift beneath your feet,” Stangler said.
“I think it [agility] is definitely more valuable to me now,” Danny Keane, a freshman, undecided, Dean Scholar and member of the baseball team, said. “I never considered how time consuming college can be. Going to class, studying and playing baseball is a lot at times. Being agile is valuable to have, without it I would be overwhelmed.”
This theme intertwined with a lecture from guest speaker David Bodde, a retired professor of entrepreneurship in the automotive engineering program at Clemson University, a theme developer for a hedge fund, Ark Invest, and a senior scholar at the Kau man Foundation in Kansas City. Bodde was one of several guest speakers this semester for the Dean Scholars program. He spoke about the “unknowable future,” and the direction in which technology and the market are going.
“In the unknowable future, agility is the only recourse you have. You can’t know enough to set your course,” Bodde said. He also spoke about artificial intelligence and how it is becoming a “game changer” in entrepreneurship.
“Forty percent of jobs haven’t been created yet,” Samantha Piccolo, a freshman marketing major and Dean Scholar, said. “The more you know about yourself the more you can go into your career and succeed through that,” she said.
The Dean Scholars program is in its second year and still growing. Dean Pullaro expressed that they are soon hoping to see an increase of 25 students a year to 50 students. The students in the program believe that the work, experiences, and opportunities available to them will clear a path to success.

Students of all majors are required to take a certain number of core courses across a wide variety of disciplines to receive a well-rounded liberal arts education. Many students complete the 45 credits in their core requirements within their first two years before delving into the required and elective courses for their specific major. A committee of professors have been working this year on reducing the number of credits in the core curriculum from 45 credits to 32 or 33 credits. Professors John Lutz of the English department, Jay Diehl of the history department, and Amy Freedman of the political science department co-chaired the Thematic Core Curriculum committee. 
Elaine Patrikis, a sophomore music education major, is enrolled in two core classes this year. “This semester I am taking a history course; it’s History 1 Western Civilizations. I’m taking Political Science 2 next semester,” she said. “They’re not very challenging, but it’s important that you continue your education even in a core class, even though you’re here to find something you’re gonna specialize in and become very good in.”
Vincent Torelli, a freshman radiology major, is enrolled in Post Foundations, ENG1, MTH3, HSC101, BIO103. Torelli is satisfied that he is getting a well-rounded education. “My English class is awesome, [Professor Hempel] is great,” he said.
The university administration is implementing a reduced core with a new thematic curriculum for fall 2018. The new core will consist of 12 or 13 less credits than the current core, which is the standard amount at most universities. The first-year experience will consist of 13 credits, Post 101, First-Year Seminar, Writing I, Writing II, & Quantitative Reasoning, and new thematic clusters will account for the remaining 19-20 credits. The clusters will offer classes in Scientific Inquiry and the Natural World (inquiry and analysis, quantitative reasoning); Creativity, Media and the Arts (creative capabilities, critical thinking); Perspectives on World Cultures (intercultural knowledge); Self, Society, and Ethics (ethical reasoning, critical thinking); Power, Institutions, and Structures (ethical reasoning, critical thinking).
The core faculty committee began meeting in May 2017 to design this new curriculum, according to Lutz, associate professor of English, and president of the Faculty Council. “We set out to create a 32- to 33-credit thematic core curriculum, and we’ve divided the core into a first-year experience and a second level, to be taken mainly in the sophomore and junior year, of thematic cluster,” Lutz said. “Those clusters will be populated with courses that correspond to the theme. One of the distinctions between what we have now and what we’ve created is that many of the core courses now are in a distribution model distributed among disciplines. So we’ve now completely broken out of individual disciplines and moved the core in an interdisciplinary direction by having categories that students will take classes in.”
Students will take courses from these five different categories, with greater choice in what they take. “Some of the courses will be the same,” Lutz said, “except instead of taking a science sequence, students will take a biology course in the Scientific Inquiry and the Natural World category, or students could take an art core class or a Shakespeare class or a creative writing class in [the Creativity, Media and the Arts cluster].”
This new core curriculum, according to Lutz, will entail a re-design of all the courses. The new design for the first year includes a development of the first-year seminar and Post 101, with new first-year seminars. “What we’ve done is create two different levels,” Lutz said. “A couple of things – it’s a reduction of the credits of the core. So this will give students more opportunity to take electives. We’re [also] creating at least twelve credits of electives and also giving students more room to include more minors in their degree.”
In addition, Lutz hopes that this new design will lead to more interdisciplinary work among faculty, development of learning communities, and intentional linkages between core courses and courses within students’ majors.
Freedman said that the new changes and thematic clusters will give students more choice in fulfilling their general education requirements. However, some faculty members have noted a potential downside in the new core curriculum. “The number of credits students will take in the core curriculum has shrunk,” she said. “So where current students and students in the last couple of years have had to take a larger number of core general ed requirements, they [the courses] had more depth. We’re trading the advantages of choice and exibility, but there’s a loss in depth.” Students won’t be taking a sequence of courses in this new system, unless they choose to do so as electives. They won’t be required to take, for example, two lab courses or two economic courses.
Freedman noted that the changes are “the way most universities have gone.” However, there is wide variation among colleges. Brown University, for instance, has a core curriculum with zero credits. Others, like Columbia University have a set core curriculum which requires completion of Literature Humanities, University Writing, and Frontiers of Science in the first year, Contemporary Civilization in their sophomore year, and Art Humanities and Music Humanities by the end of junior year.
Faculty members, Freedman said, will be able to create new courses and do interdisciplinary work. “If I wanted to team up with an English professor, I would teach political science through the use of novels, or if I want to team up with someone from economics [I could] do a political economy class.”
This should increase student enrollment in these classes, “which gives us a greater incentive” to create new interdisciplinary courses, Freedman said. “The advantage of this to faculty is really in opening the door and incentivizing people to do new and creative things.”
The new core is not entirely brand new. Freedman stressed that this new configuration was not “starting from scratch.” Some of the classes already existed and could either be changed or set into one of the clusters. “It’s a new way of thinking how the classes connect to each other.”
Advisors have already been telling students that the core curriculum would be changing, even before the nature of these changes was known.
Diehl served as a core committee member at large, in addition to sharing co-chairmanship with Lutz and Freedman. “My main role [was] to keep the focus on pedagogy, on learning, and on trying to create a core curriculum that is intellectually consistent and not just a product of convenience or logistics,” Diehl said.
The change in the core does not only affect the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, but faculty from other academic areas as well, Diehl said.
He noted that the first-year seminar, instead of being something that fulfilled other requirements, is its own self-contained requirement in this new program. “In the current core, you take a first-year seminar, say, History 7. In addition to meeting the requirement that you take a first-year seminar, it also fulfills one of your History requirements. In the new core, you take a first-year seminar and fulfill only the first-year seminar requirement, none of the other distribution requirements in the thematic categories (although it might fulfill a major requirement). Making the first-year seminar into its own requirement is a way of allowing students to delve into separate interests and also give flexibility to meeting the thematic requirements. For example, with quantitative reasoning, that is the product of the decision that it is a foundational skill that needs to be established as early as possible in the students’ college career.”

On Wednesday, Nov. 29, the second floor of Hillwood Commons was crawling with fluffy, four-legged companions. Students swarmed around four therapy dogs brought to relieve pre-finals stress. This yearly pet therapy event was sponsored by Bideawee, a no-kill animal rescue organization, and the Center for Healthy Living. “We thought it would be a great way to psycho-educate the students and staff here,” Samantha Gonzales, mental health counseling intern, said. “People learn different techniques of how to relieve stress, but what [greater] way [than] with pets?”
“I’ve heard of pet therapy before, but just seeing it in action makes it so much more real,” Sarah Mann, a freshman nursing major, said. “It’s not a fable; it actually works. I feel a thousand times better.”
Many students attended the event due to their love of animals. Maechel Johnsky, a freshman theatre major, has a Rottweiler and two cats at home, as well as a therapy cat that lives in her dorm. “[Pet therapy] is so important, especially during finals. We’re all very on edge and worrying a lot, I think it’s good to have just an hour or so to not have to worry about anything,” she said.
The dogs were all personal companions of volunteers from Bideawee. The organization has several locations in New York that serve as adoption centers for rescued animals. The visiting therapy dogs were all trained to regulate their temperament and become adapted to large crowds of people. “We were in obedience school for about two years,” Josine Mash, volunteer and owner of Goldendoodle, Ginger, said. “Then she took a trick training class, so when it’s not so busy, she can show off.” Dogs performed tricks such as strategically taking a treat from a special tray the trainer held as a demonstration of how they could solve puzzles.
Elaine Bermas, volunteer and owner of golden retriever, Shally, has visited various types of people and locations to help. These include children with learning disabilities, residential hospitals and nursing homes. She has taught clients numerous things from how to groom and care for a dog to how to pack a suitcase. “It makes me feel good to do it because I’m just giving back for a good life,” she said.
Shally is nine years old and has been working as a therapy dog for three years. The dog had been accustomed to being in busy environments such as movie theatres, grocery stores and shopping malls. “I knew it made no sense to keep him at home as a pet, so I certified him to be a therapy dog,” Bermas said. Shally was certified by Pet Partners to become adjusted to busy environments and to not be spooked by things such as wheelchairs or people with hats. This training ensures the safety of both the animal and people surrounding it.
“I’ve really enjoyed [the event], I love seeing dogs; they’re really good at helping me de-stress,” Jason Glickman, a freshman broadcasting major, said. Though he owns a dog, he described this experience to be different. “My dog at home isn’t really trained for this sort of thing, he just runs around in circles and barks at me,” he said. Each dog present at the event displayed a docile demeanor, and was welcoming to being pet by any student who reached out to them.
Pet therapy has been proven to lower blood pressure, reduce symptoms of depression and increase socialization according to the Center for Healthy Living. “Everyone [here] seems to be in a really good mood, and I’ve talked to a few people that I haven’t really met before,” Johnsky said, “I think it’s a really good community building experience.”
Glickman claimed the value of the event lied within being able to relieve stress alongside other students. “You’re with fellow peers and you’re all collectively suffering at the expense of your professors,” he said, “Dogs are always a happy face to see.”
“All in all, they provide unconditional love, so how can you say no?” Gonzales said.

As the job market continues to change and new areas of expertise are required, many of the minor programs at Post are falling in enrollment numbers. Minors that have had zero student enrollment for a consistent amount of semesters are now being temporarily removed. This university wide sweep is expected to go into full effect in the fall of 2018.
Programs that have been temporarily “taken away” had little to no enrollment, and the resources used to run those programs will be allocated to programs that students are interested in and provide them with the tools they need upon graduation.
Within the political science department, an accelerated five- year plan for a Bachelor’s in Political Science and a Masters in Public Administration (MPA) has been removed, according to Amy Freedman, chair of the political science department. The accelerated plan is all that has been removed, not the MPA as a whole.
As of now, two minors are being removed from the department of communications, according to Barbara Fowles, chair of the department. The public relations and specialty reporting minors are being removed. “The criterion is that they have zero enrollment for a number of semesters,” Fowles said. “I believe they kept, for the time being, any minor with even one student enrolled. That would presumably be cut as well when that student graduates, unless another one enrolls.”
Steven Breese, dean of the College of Communications, Art, and Design, stated that the minors being dropped depends on the students. “How many students out of the thousands of students on campus are taking specific minors?” According to Breese, the art history and photography minors are only two of the four confirmed minors being removed in the college.
“Students who have previously declared a minor will be able to complete their program of study,” he said. Although, these two minors are being dropped from the departments, each department maintained 12 minors across the board.
Not every department is undergoing these minor adjustments. The School of Health Professions and Nursing has reported no minors with zero enrollment. “All programs are being looked at carefully and being assessed to [ensure] that students receive the best educational programming possible, leading them to successful careers and job opportunities,” Stacy Gropack, dean of the School of Health Professions and Nursing, said.
“The faculty and administration remain committed to ensuring that LIU Post students are well prepared for their future, and part of that is a constant assessment of course and program offerings,” she said.

On Sunday, Dec. 3, the Rainbow Alliance club partnered with the Student Government Organization (SGA) and Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity to host the first campus drag show, entitled “Drag Me to Heaven.” The show, which took place in the Tilles Atrium, was hosted by professional drag queen Benjamin Berry, who goes by drag name “Flolita,” and included performers both from LIU Post and from around Long Island.
The event began with a “first look” at the eight drag queens and two drag kings participating. The queens were dressed in a variety of artistic costumes, paired with wigs, sky-scraper heels, and full faces of makeup. The kings wore jackets and slicked back hair, matched with drawn-on beards and mustaches.
“All the girls [performing] are so uplifting, and I feel like I have eight new sisters and two new brothers now,” Michael Decristofaro, a freshman photography major who performed in the show said. “It was a charity event and it’s so nice to give back and have so much fun doing it.” The $500 collected from the event will be donated to the LGBT Center of NYC.
Audience members, who numbered around 50, applauded as the performers began the “lip-sync” segment of the show. The kings and queens performed to popular songs such as “Creep” by Radiohead and “Proud Mary” by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Paris, a junior musical theatre major, wowed the crowd by “vogueing” during their segment, demonstrating an important part of drag culture.
After deliberation from judges, Paris was crowned the winner of the first LIU Post drag show.“[It was] an extremely successful event, especially because for many of these queens and kings, it’s their first time ever performing, and it was an incredible opportunity for the members of the LGBTQ community to celebrate at an event that is theirs and that’s big and is also open,” Logan Dewitt, a senior musical theatre major and one of the judges, said. “It’s a great chance for people who are not in the community to come in and see a little bit of our world.”
Adam Silverstein, a sophomore social work major and member of SGA enjoyed the show. “These people let their spirits shine in such great ways, and I think it is a really beautiful display of expression and being proud of who they are, and getting us all to be proud of who we are.”

Amy Schaffler, a planning director for advertisements and commercials at NBC’s Telemundo, spoke to students in the health and physical education department on Monday, Nov. 13 about her experience in the sports management field.
Although Schaffler’s professional title is planning Director, she plays a huge role in things that affect average people every day, by managing both the money and business behind the commercials and sponsors that affect viewers’ decisions. A 2005 Syracuse University graduate, Schaffler worked behind the scenes on the Food Network for two and a half years. After that, she worked at ESPN for five years followed briefly by a CBS marketing position. The experiences she gained in these jobs led to her current position at NBC.
Schaffler put emphasis on the important steps of achieving a high position, whether it be in sports management or marketing or any area. She stated that it is not only important to work at a few different places, but to also spend time there. “When employers are looking at resumés, they want to be able to say ‘Oh wow, this person has had a wide variety of experience and has really put in the time at each place,’ which is definitely a benefit and sets you apart from other applicants,” she said.
Schaffler gave spoke about the deal between the NFL and media companies CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN to explain her work in sports management. In 2014, sports management planning directors put together the $39.6 billion agreement that assured these companies that until the year 2022, the Super Bowl would be aired on one of these stations, rotating the host every year. Over 115 million Americans tune into the Super Bowl each year, making commercial time for this event precious. Depending on the length of the ad, the host station charges between $2 to $5 million per commercial.
Schaffler also shed light on the multiple career options within sports management. Between devising campaigns with incentives and contracts that catch the eye of companies so they can buy advertising space on the network, securing liability policies, and juggling the multifaceted nature of balancing money and intercompany agreements, this field is jam packed with hands on advertising and marketing work.
Schaffler had one last word of advice for students. “Always be open to things. Don’t think that just because you went to college for one thing means that’s what you HAVE to do,” she said. “Your career post college will evolve. It can change and I think that [students] should embrace that and keep [their] eyes open. Talk to as many people as you can because everybody was in your shoes at one point.”
