With the spring semester just starting, students around campus may look stressed out and overwhelmed. Imagine how you would feel if you just arrived at Post this semester. Then, almost everything on campus would be unknown. Hundreds of new students enroll at Post each semester, embarking on an unfamiliar journey.
Denise Seigel, Director of Transfer Admissions, stated that there are more than 200 transfer students enrolled for the first time this semester from both local and international locations.
“The largest cohort of students came from Nassau and Suffolk County Community Colleges,” stated Seigel.
There are transfers from various four-year universities as well, including the University of Rhode Island, Boston University, SUNY Binghamton, Stony Brook University, Molloy College and St. Johns Univeristy. The admissions criteria for the spring are the same as the fall semester, added Seigel.
Some students have just started college this semester. Post’s Director of Freshmen Admissions David Follick confirmed that there are 15 new domestic freshmen enrolled for the spring semester. Follick said there are fewer new freshmen because more enroll in September. “New freshmen who are starting now usually have taken a semester off to work or travel,” said Follick.
Post has a diverse community with students from around the world. “In all, 17 countries are represented to date, bringing the total campus representation to 45 different countries,” said Ian Wright, Director for International Admissions.
Wright confirmed that Post enrolled 235 new international students this semester, which is an increase from last spring, when 190 enrolled. “LIU Post has experienced a spike in enrollment among students from around the globe, and as the spring semester gets underway, we welcomed students from several countries including, China, Cuba, Iraq, Kuwait, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Russia and Thailand,” explained Jessica Hayes, Assistant Provost for International Student Services.
International students who register in the spring semester go through a three-day orientation process. International Orientation started on Saturday, January 14th, when the students were welcomed in the Chapel by orientation leaders who helped them move into their dorm rooms. Alexandra Pospelova, a freshman Photography major, is an Orientation Leader from Russia. Pospelova said, “Being an Orientation Leader is fun. I enjoy meeting new people and making them feel comfortable and confident in their new surroundings.” Orientation continued on Sunday, January 15th, with a tour of the campus and a trip to the Broadway Mall for college essentials, such as bedding and notebooks. The last day of International Orientation, January 16th, was at Kumble Hall, so the students were able to register for classes.
None of the international students were allowed to register for class until January 16th, the day before the spring semester began. These students must be living on campus to register with their academic advisers. The entire afternoon portion of orientation was dedicated to this task. International students were given time to register from 12:00 to 7:00 p.m. to register. The office was completely filled with students anxiously waiting to speak an adviser. Shintaro Uraga, a senior International Business major, is a new transfer student from Japan who waited for two hours. However, many students waited there longer. Mimi Montgomery, a new student from Sweden majoring in Journalism, waited six hours to talk with an advisor to register for her classes.
Uraga said he was both excited and nervous to be spending his last semester of college in New York. When asked why she picked Post above other American universities, Montgomery said, “I have friends and family members who went to school here who recommended it to me.” Montgomery said she expects “a great experience and a great Journalism education” from Post.
So, if stress and troubles fill your mind as you join Post as a new student this spring, remember you can overcome it. Whether you are starting or continuing your journey, you can succeed if you put in time and effort.

At the conclusion of each fall semester, the majority of LIU Post students pack up their belongings and head home for three and a half weeks to unwind before the spring semester begins. Some more tenacious students, on the other hand, opt to enroll in winter classes, forgoing their breaks to gain a few more credits in order to get ahead or to boost their GPAs. Enrollment for 2011’s Winter Session, however, was dismal, begging the question as to whether winter classes are useful to students or are merely a marketing ploy to rake in more money for the University.
“There was a slight decrease in the Winter 2011 Session [enrollment] compared to the Winter 2010 Session,” said Concetta DiMare, Manager of Academic Scheduling in the Office of the Registrar. “For the 2011 Winter Term, 44 classes were offered, and 35 of them ran. During the Winter 2010 Term, 44 classes were offered, and 39 of them ran.”
In addition to the four-class cutback, the number of students who attended classes at Post this winter dropped from 403 in 2010 to 379 in 2011 according to DiMare, who attributes the decline to possible student work or schedule demands and professor availabilities. While a nearly six-percent reduction in enrolled students seems a slight decrease at best, some students say that they would have considered registering for a winter class if it were economically sensible for them to do so.
“I do think they’re too expensive,” said Nicole Mylonas, a senior Marketing major. “I didn’t sign up for winter classes because I have to pick up extra shifts at work to put towards paying off my student loans.”
Caitlin Kluko, a junior Elementary Education major, echoed Mylonas’ sentiment. “I was attempting to take a Spanish course at Suffolk Community College because it’s much closer to my house, and it also ended up costing a lot less,” she said. As a resident of Suffolk County, Kluko would only have had to have shelled out $167 per credit and a $20 technology fee to enroll in the Spanish course at SCC as opposed to the hefty $625 per credit and $115 in University fees required by Post.
Despite the fact that Post’s Winter Session tuition is astronomical in comparison to those of local community colleges, such as Nassau Community College and Suffolk Community College, DiMare insists that at “one-third [the price] of what the same course would be during any other term, it’s like courses are on sale during the off peak times.”             She also astutely points out that “taking a winter course is a good way of bringing up your grade point average, since a student has a lesser course load in the winter to dedicate his or her time to versus the 4 to 6 courses he or she may take during any other term. So, you can really focus on the one or two courses you take.”
Billie Cinelli, a senior Public Relations major, agrees with DiMare. “I took Introduction to Political Science 2 with Professor Soupios this winter. I enjoyed the class because it allowed me to focus on one class in particular, and I retained more information from this class than I did in the fall,” she said.  “Winter class is definitely money well spent, and I got an A!”
Cinelli also mentioned that there were approximately 25 students in her class, an equivalent number of students to many fall and spring semester class totals.
Unlike Cinelli, however, taking a course during Post’s Winter Session posed problems for Kluko, and her attempt to do so became increasingly more frustrating. “Post told me I wasn’t allowed to take a language during the Winter Session, so I couldn’t take it at Suffolk,” she said.  “However, I found out that Post was offering an Italian class over the Winter Session, so I emailed them back asking why I was told that I could not take a language if one was being offered at Post, and they never got back to me.” Kluko is still awaiting a response from the University, leaving her to wonder whether this was a miscommunication or a ruse to try to coerce her into spending her tuition money at Post rather than at a competing institution. That remains uncertain.
What is known for certain is that student opinions of the Winter Session at LIU Post are mixed, but these classes could be very beneficial, especially to seniors approaching graduation. “Taking a course in the winter brings a student that much closer to graduating on time or ahead of schedule if they want,” said DiMare. These classes may be a worthwhile decision for seniors who are looking to lessen their onerous last semester course loads, which is another reason Cinelli chose to take a winter course as a senior.
Whether you spent your winter break relaxing and catching up with old friends or  hitting the books in hopes of adding an A to your transcript, hopefully, it was a worthwhile experience. Welcome back for the Spring of 2012!

Here we are again, another semester at LIU-Post. In the fall I wrote a column entitled, “Why Do We Do It?” This week’s column is basically an addition to that piece. So way back when, I proposed that very question and, of course, there are a multitude of answers. The most common answer for young women is that we want to fix every messed up guy there is walking this planet.
As far as society is concerned, women are the overly emotional ones with all sorts of issues.  Is that really an accurate statement though? I don’t think so. I’m talking about guys in a specific age range, 20-23. They have more problems then I know what to do with and us ladies all fall for it. We sit patiently and listen to their nonsense and have this insane notion that we can fix them, that we are the answer to all their problems.
Being the “emotional” ones, we make the decision to be all in relatively early; all it takes is a few good dates and were in. Let’s take one specific type of guy for example; the guy who loves everything about having a girlfriend, the going out to dinner or just lounging around the house watching movies all day, however the term girlfriend shakes him to his core. No one knows exactly why but the idea of being in a serious relationship petrifies him.
So you decide after a few dates that you’re completely ready to take on this challenge. All goes well at first, but you know you’re essentially dealing with the equivalent of a deer in the wild, so no sudden movements. You think you’re making some strides in the right direction. A month or two later it’s all over; there’s no fight or anything, it just fizzles out. The question you ask yourself is, “Where did I go wrong?”
I’ve come to the conclusion that the only thing you did wrong was wasting your time on some jerk that didn’t deserve a minute of your time.  Don’t beat yourself up about it, you’re not the only girl to fall for it. This type of guy cannot be fixed and is ultimately un-dateable. Make sure to steer clear of them in the future.

2011 was a year filled with turmoil, the fall of tyrants, and political challenges. As 2012 moves in, it does not seem like it will be much different. January is almost over and already it has been a suspenseful year.
As the race for the Republican presidential nomination continues, things have become extremely unpredictable. The primaries began in Iowa where Mitt Romney originally won by a mere eight votes, but was then overcome by Rick Santorum. Not only is an eight-vote difference as close as they come, it was from a candidate who just a few months ago was barely on the radar. Of course this was challenged, and a recount found that Santorum actually beat Romney by thirty-four votes. Oops, does not seem to cover how big of a mistake that truly was considering it took away the strong lead Romney had. Yes the margin of thirty four votes is still very slim, but it pulls Romney down in the polls by a lot even with his clear win in New Hampshire. He was hurt more this past Saturday when Newt Gingrich won the South Carolina primary. So in the first three states of the primary election, three different winners have emerged and in two of them, candidates have dropped out of the election. Rick Perry dropped out, and endorsed Newt Gingrich, and Michelle Bachman dropped out after a crushing defeat in Iowa. All of this combined proves that it is going to be a very long and stressful primary season for all the Republican candidates.
Of course it would not be an election without some mudslinging going on. Mitt Romney was thrown under the bus when it came out that he had been hiding a bit of a small fortune. Apparently Romney is worth a lot more money than he had originally let on. This may have led to his defeat in South Carolina and has also caused him to have to release his last tax return to hopefully quiet some rumors. Newt Gingrich had to sit back and watch as his second wife went public with information about their relationship and their divorce. A few years ago, Gingrich publically denounced former president Bill Clinton for his alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky, even though for six years Gingrich was supposedly having an affair. His ex-wife also claimed, during an interview with ABC News, that he asked for an open marriage so that he could be with the woman with whom he was having an affair. He divorced his second wife and married the woman with whom he was allegedly having the affair. When asked about these open marriage accusations, Gingrich completely denied that they ever occurred. However, if they ever did occur, the American public will never know. This story still hits hard at the sanctity of marriage position that Gingrich maintains. It is unclear what kind of toll this will take on the Gingrich campaign since there are still a lot of states left that need to hold primary elections.
The primary election season is nowhere near over and as it progresses things are only going to get more stressful and more surprising. Only one thing is clear, in a few short months the race for President will officially be underway and the leadership of our country could be changing.

Those pesky backseat drivers! I used to be one when I was younger; my poor mother used to always call me out on it. It does not seem annoying until you become a driver yourself. A few weeks ago, I was driving four friends in my car, filling up my Sedan to its seating capacity. I started to hear some strange noises from the backseat. I turned around and the passengers seemed to be afraid of my driving. “Brake Kat!” “Kat, didn’t you see that red light?” “Stop sign means stop!” I stopped, or rather slammed on my brakes, for a few moments. I have been driving for over six years now, so what’s the deal? Is my driving that terrible?
The answer is no it’s not. I drive the way I drive, I abide by the rules and yes, I do stop at stop signs. I have the tendency to speed, but I will eventually stop at the red light. Call me a terrible driver if you want, but I have not been in an accident in over three years, (knock on wood) and I don’t plan to in the next three years.
Dealing with backseat drivers is like dealing with kids; you have to school them. Nothing is more annoying than hearing somebody else tell you while you’re driving that you can’t drive. It was already nice of you to drive them around in the first place, since in this particular situation I was driving a bunch of drinkers and being the safe, sober driver. Next time, toss them their keys and say, “Then you drive if you don’t feel I can and I’ll drink so much that you’ll have to keep pulling over so I can puke on the side of the road.” Or when they drive making a few snide comments here and there doesn’t hurt, but I’m not playing their game. Put on your seatbelt and hope for the best.
It’s a privilege to drive somebody else or be driven by somebody, so respect the car they are in and pray that you’ll get to your destination in one piece. All of my friends are always appreciative when I drive and constantly thank me. It was the new friends who didn’t respect my driving manners. Ignore them; they’ll start to quiet down after a while. You know that the day you got your license and sat behind your wheel that you had a new responsibility, a big one. You already know how to drive, thanks to Drivers Education.
So to all my drivers out there, ignore the haters of your driving; just drive to your ability. If it’s the most comfortable you feel while driving then that’s the most important thing. I hope everyone had a great break and for those who carpool in the morning, I hope you have the chance to say thanks to the driver and so forth. A little thanks can go a long way. Even if it is only driving, you’re thanking them for driving you and they’re thanking you for not being a backseat driver.

Recently, I have become seriously involved in football, well, NFL football to be exact. My team of choice is the New York Giants, as they are the team my family follows. I have never been a huge football person because I couldn’t truly understand the whole sport, but after watching a few football movies or rather the movie, Little Giants, I have grown to understand the point of the game. These past few weeks, the football world has grown a bit more interesting as teams fight their way into the coveted Super Bowl game.
Last week, the New York Giants played the almost undefeated Green Bay Packers. In an upsetting game, the Packers got creamed by a score of 37-20. The New York Giants will play the San Francisco 49ers, an underdog team that hasn’t seen a Super Bowl championship since 1994. The New York Giants won the Super Bowl in 2007 against the New England Patriots. The predictions for this game are tough. I happen to be a Giants fan, but watching the 49ers all year, it’s clear that they have been a tough team to beat. Only losing three games the entire season while the Giants have lost seven, the safer bet would be the 49ers to win.  Being a faithful fan, I still hope and know the Giants will upset San Francisco and walk to the Super Bowl against…..
Last week two other games took place in order to determine the teams that will play in the Superbowl. The Baltimore Ravens beat the Houston Texans with a score of 20-13. The New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos played, but unfortunately the Patriots seriously defeated the Broncos with a score of 45-10. The Patriots will battle the Ravens in a brutal game. I do predict the Patriots will beat the Ravens. The Patriots have a great offense and Tom Brady, although I hate to say it, has a killer arm and is an “elite” quarterback.
So, for the 2012 Super Bowl, we already know that the Giants and the Patriots are meeting again in Indianapolis. Interesting how five years later, these two teams will meet again in another showdown that will determine the winner of NFL Superbowl. I could be wrong, but can the Giants really beat them again? Only time will tell. But I do know one thing: this is going to be a hell of a show that I invite everyone to watch, football knowledge or not, the fight is well worth watching.

So, what can I start with? I am a foreign student and I arrived from a very far-away country, Russia, just a week ago. After a 10-hour transatlantic flight, arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport, finally I found myself on a true American college campus- LIU-Post.
To begin with, how did I get this idea and this goal to study in a foreign country?  I spent last summer in New York City. To say that from the very first day this awesome city made a great impression on me- means to say nothing! I really adored it!!! At some moment during that amazing summer, I surely decided that I had to come back, not as a tourist anymore, but as a serious student at a good college.  I did my best to reach my goal! It cost me a lot of effort, difficulties and nerves, but finally I got it! My dream came true! I became a student of an outstanding university, LIU Post.
So what were my feelings when I got out of the taxi that cold and windy Sunday evening on the territory of the  Post campus? It was a real mixture of excitement on one hand and nervousness on the other, joy and happiness, fear , and diffidence. It seemed to me that I was lost, but at the same time, somewhere inside me, I felt that I was finally in the right place!
Monday morning. Being terribly worried, I left my dormitory room to start my first day of college. With one look at the map, I became slightly shocked! How will I be able to find the right place in such a big territory with great amount of buildings? Names of the blocks, its numbers, paths and directions–all poured together! One deep breath- calm down! Couple of seconds…one more deep breath- come on! I have to do it! So- let’s do it!
It was a long and difficult day–checking in, orientation, talking with an academic adviser, choosing the classes, registering in- one strong attempt to understand- what’s going on! It’s not like in Russian University life; it is an absolutely different process!
I coped with all these steps and finally I did it! The thing that  I was most impressed with was the friendliness of everybody! You see the smiling faces and you aren’t afraid to ask where to go, what to do or just say, “Could you please help me?”
I know it is only the first day and everything is just starting and a lot of classes, hard work, and difficult assignments are waiting for me. But I am not scared or  worried anymore. Fortunately, from the first school day, I got a very important thing: everybody is so friendly and eager to help. Just don’t be shy to ask for help if you need and you’ll get it with a warm smile. Good luck to everybody!

Here is a scenario. It’s Friday night and you’re done with school and work. Now it’s time to go out. Where do you go? Do you find that students typically end up at a bar or nightclub rather than staying in for the night or perhaps seeing a movie.
I don’t know about you, but it seems that many students today would rather choose to go out to a bar or nightclub. Maybe it’s the fun of doing things in college that you will probably regret the next morning, such as drinking too much and waking up the next morning to a garbage pail or your head in the toilet. Or, maybe it’s the thought of doing something you know is wrong or prohibited, but you break the rules and do it anyway. This becomes fun and exciting while you are in college. Well, whatever it may be, there seems to be a connection between students and alcohol; that is when there’s a party, there is usually drinking. Why is this?
According to an article published in April 20002 titled, “The Student Perspective on College Drinking,” by Peggy Eastman, high school and college and universities students were part of discussion groups to “learn more about alcohol use and abuse from the student perspective, and to hear how students themselves would propose to solve some of the alcohol-related problems that plague many college campuses.” Many students agreed that when there is a party there is alcohol and people felt the need to have a drink in their hand at a bar where you can mingle with students from fraternities and sororities or an athletic team.
The real question is, why do students feel they need to hang out socially at a bar? Most students can agree that if you are at a bar or nightclub, you’re more likely to see people drinking compared to a small majority that just goes to hang out. There is clearly a social connection between students and partying.
You may have finished a class or got home from work late. Now students resort to finding a bar that would probably be open until 4 a.m. because it gives them something to do. In fact, some students may find going to bar an alternative than just staying in. According to Alberta Health Services, whose job is to provide a patient-focused and quality health system, “After a couple of drinks, one person might be more relaxed, another depressed, another more wild, another angry.” All in all, students may find going to a bar a reason to loosen up and unleash they crazy side because alcohol is in their system and this gives them an excuse as to why their behavior has now changed. Also, students may feel the need to “fit in” and follow their peers as a part of a social norm. In this type of atmosphere, students may see their friends drinking and feel they need to as well.
What is the real student prospective on college drinking on our campus?
Marissa Santomaso, senior Public Relations major said, “I feel that my generation is bored and drinking makes drinking a little more interesting. I think students gather at bars and clubs because it is a designated place that everyone can hang out and most people can agree it will probably be a good time. Students nowadays think it’s lame to go just hang out at someone’s house or places like movies and bowling because they feel they need to fit in and follow their friends.”
Emily Anker, senior Business Management major added, “Some people are scared to be alone or to just stay in for a night, so I feel this is why people go out to bars and night clubs. That is one of the ways I think people try to connect with others in this type of social atmosphere that involves alcoholic beverages. In our society, I just feel that no one can go to an event or club without drinking.”
Karla Villacreses, junior Liberal Arts major, feels, “Students not only get to hang out with the people they see every day, but there’s a possibility you get to meet new people when you go out to a bar or nightclub. I think when students drink, they are more susceptible to putting down their guard and talking about things they usually wouldn’t if they were sober. This is where drinking and experimenting in college comes into play.”
Josh Kramel, junior Criminal Justice Major, added, “I think students choose to go out to bars and clubs instead of hanging out on campus because they get the opportunity to meet new people, dance, listen to music, and relieve the stress of homework away from school.”

Back on the screen after their winter break, the Beverly Hills teenagers of 90210 continue a new year and a season of drama, friendship, conflicts, and love. With a dramatic winter finale, during which Liam got into a car accident and Naomi found her boyfriend kissing her worst enemy, there were bound to be some complications as the 2012 premiere was revealed.
Weeks have gone by, and things within the group have changed since the last episode: Brother and sister, Annie and Dixon, have been traveling abroad, along with Ivy and her newfound crush. Annie finally got her inheritance money and is newly rich, but she is still stuck on Liam, who has recovered from his accident, but only to find himself starting a growing affection to another girl: Vanessa, the girl who ran him over but also saved him. Naomi has yet to accept Austin´s apology and is looking for a rebound-fling to drown her sorrows. Silver has decided to dive into another relationship, as Navid is still struggling with the issues of his uncle and the family business, while he also still hides his feelings to protect his loved one.
The first episode in 2012 is packed with fancy clothes, beautiful people, and new revelations. A new girl, Vanessa, is stealing Liam´s attention, but Annie is determined to reveal all secrets and get her man back. Silver`s growing romance with Greg is continuing, despite the fact that Navid´s love for her is revealed. A dilemma occurs when she finds out that Greg is the father of the child that Adrianna gave up for adoption a couple years earlier. Naomi screws up her first big event but sheds some tears and talks herself into a second chance. 90210 is back, and it looks like the drama will be continued. The return of Naomi´s sister, Jen, is already announced, something that usually means bad luck for Naomi.
A line-up of the Spring 2012 guest stars has already leaked on the Internet, including 2 Broke Girls actor Nick Zano, who is making an appearance on the show. Robert Hoffman, who previously starred in movies, like She´s The Man and Step Up 2 along with the TV hit-show Grey´s Anatomy, is rumored to be entering the show in early March in the role as an “easygoing surfer,” and the ultimate catch; unfortunately, he is hard to get. Ariella Kebbel, known from movies like John Tucker Must Die, and TV shows including the Vampire Diaries and Life Unexpected, plays the role of Liam´s new love interest, Vanessa. Also, sister of Michael Jackson, LaToya Jackson, will appear as a guest star for an episode in February.
New year, and new beginnings epitomize the upcoming episodes, as lies, complications and emotions seem to be the main ingredients of the season. The first episode sets the foundation for new dilemmas and conflicts, which will take the show through yet another season of teenage frustrations.

I am the new Reviews Editor for the LIU Post Pioneer this semester. We are asking you, our readers, to get involved in our weekly publication. If you are interested in writing and publishing reviews, please email your ideas to paul.kalis@my.liu.edu for consideration. I check this email account daily, so you can expect a prompt response.
Students don’t have to be Journalism or Media Arts majors to write about a passion. An Art major could review the latest exhibit at a local museum, while a Physical Education major gives his or her input on new training techniques. A Music major can review the latest concert he or she attended. Excel in your field of study by writing a relevant piece, putting your knowledge to the test. Become our expert consultant, and share your ideas with others. The reviews section is open to all faculty, administrators, and parents who want to express their opinions. A review is an opinion; it can’t be wrong. I write about the television industry and the shows that are currently on the air. It intrigues me how projects develop and how they can be in development for years and either succeed or flop in a matter of 2 weeks. Figuring out what went right and what went wrong is only half the fun.
The Pioneer welcomes all students to join our meetings every Monday during common hour in Hillwood Commons. In the fall, The Pioneer featured reviews of movies, documentaries, books, albums, video games, restaurants, spas, and food establishments. These are just a few suggestions and guidelines to go by.
Students are not expected to write a review weekly, although it would be highly appreciated. If you have a test to study for, study for the test. If you have a family obligation to attend to, attend to it. If you have some free time between classes or a day off, write a review. It will only take you a few minutes. Reviews are to be submitted by email to cwpstpnr@gmail.com no later than 5 p.m. on Sundays for Wednesday’s paper.

“Are You There, Chelsea?”- Midseason Update
Airs Wednesday’s at 8:30 p.m. on NBC
Laura Prepon stars in NBC’s newest comedy, “Are You There, Chelsea?” based on actress/comedian Chelsea Handler’s 2008 best-selling book, “Are You There, Vodka?”
Chelsea, played by Prepon, is a cocktail waitress, friend, daughter, sister, and “advanced drinker” who works at Jerry’s Ultimate Sports Bar in New Jersey. She works with her childhood friend Olivia (Ali Wong), bartender Rick (Jake McDorman), and bar back Todd (Mark Povinelli). Chelsea and Olivia just moved in with Dee Dee (Lauren Lapkus), who was sheltered growing up. Author Chelsea Handler has a recurring role as Chelsea’s sister, Sloane. Both of them have nothing in common.
Definitely tune in if you are a Laura Prepon fan. You may remember her as the redhead next door from Eric Forman on FOX’s “That 70’s Show” and as Hannah Jane Daniels on ABC’s “October Road.” It’s great to see her back on television. Chelsea certainly gets mixed up in some sticky situations, such as getting arrested and making out with a woman in the holding tank. However, this show was not as enjoyable as it could have been. Yes, the sheltered Dee Dee is a hub of jokes, but Chelsea and Olivia mock and don’t respect their new roommate. They want to change her into what they have become. Olivia is also a journalist who regrets becoming one. Somebody has to put the news together, such as the team that assembles this weekly paper. These characters have limitations in their peripheral vision, which may make it harder for them to grow and for viewers to connect with any one particular character.

If I had to describe the movie “The Artist” in one word, it would be “breathtaking.” It’s a silent movie, shot in black and white with only background music. The plot revolves around two characters named Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), who live in Hollywood during the late 1920s and early 1930s. George is a silent movie star whose career as a famous actor begins to crumble as the silent era ends and “talkies,” movies with sound, begin taking over the entertainment business. Peppy is a young woman who dreams of being a star and manages to get the part of a dancer in a movie, which was her big break.
I won’t give too much away, so the movie won’t be spoiled for anyone, but the story itself is so simple, and it’s portrayed on screen extremely well. It’s the kind of movie that just by seeing the expressions on the actors’ faces and the tone of the music, you can easily interpret what’s going to happen. There are panels, which pop up sometimes for a few seconds to tell the audience what the actors are saying, but I found it wasn’t really needed because the director was able to tell the audience what was happening in subtle but interesting ways. The setting was also amazing. You felt like you were in the 20s from the outfits to the cars and how everything looked so overly luxurious and glamorous, just like the 20s were. I highly recommend this movie. It’s just classic, fresh and, finally, something different.

The LIU Post men’s basketball team has now won six consecutive games after defeating the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds (14-3) on Saturday, January 21st, by a score of 92-85. The win keeps the Pioneers (13-4) a perfect 7-0 in East Coast Conference play and gives them sole possession of first place within the conference as well.
Entering Saturday’s game, there were several storylines surrounding the two teams. First, it was a battle of the top two teams in the ECC, as the Firebirds had the best overall record, while the Pioneers were perfect in conference play. Second, since this season is the first year the University of DC has joined the ECC, this meeting provided the first game between the two sides. And, lastly, the game featured four of the top five scorers in the conference. Pioneers senior guard Stefan Bonneau is the leader, averaging 22.2 points per game, while junior guard Tobin Carberry is fifth, averaging 18.9 points per game. The Firebirds boast senior guards Nigel Munson (20.4 ppg) and Brandon Herbert (20.1), the second and third leading scorers in the league.
In a competitive, back-and-forth game, the Pioneers had a two-point advantage at the end of the first half, 42-40. The first half alone saw six ties and six lead changes, and the biggest lead in the game was held by the Pioneers when they had a twelve-point lead late in the game.
In a game that featured the two highest scoring teams in the ECC, as well as four of the top five individual scorers in the conference, a quick pace was shown on offense for both sides. Bonneau led the Pioneers in scoring with 32 points on an efficient 11-21 shooting and also nailed five three-pointers. Carberry was in foul trouble for much of the first half and struggled to find his shot all game long, only shooting 1-8 from the field finishing with 12 points. However, down the stretch, Carberry was clutch at the free-throw line going 10-10, putting the game on ice for the Pioneers.
Pioneers sophomore forward Vaughn Allen and freshman forward Tyuan Williams each posted double-doubles, displaying toughness down low. Allen, the ECC’s leading rebounder, averaging 9.6 boards per game, finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds including a clutch offensive rebound and put-back in the final minute of play. Williams also continued his solid play as he dropped 10 points and secured 17 rebounds.
The Firebirds’ Nigel Munson scored a game-high 35 points, and was unstoppable as he constantly attacked the basket, finishing shooting 15-25 from the floor. Brandon Herbert scored 21 points, but the Firebirds did not get much help from the remaining players on the floor on the offensive end. Senior guard Dishawn Bradshaw was erratic all afternoon, shooting 2-14 from the field, finishing with eight points; six points below his season average.
The Pioneers held an advantage in several statistics including three-point shooting, free-throw shooting, and rebounding. The Pioneers shot 32 percent (6-19) from beyond the arc, while the Firebirds struggled, going 12 percent (2-17) from three point range. The Pioneers were frequent visitors at the charity stripe, shooting 30-40, while the Firebirds went 15-19 from the free-throw line. And, the Pioneers held a 53-43 rebounding advantage over the Firebirds.
With the 92-85 win, the Pioneers put an end to the Firebirds’ 14-game home win streak, which dated back to last season. In addition, the Pioneers continued their winning streak, which is now at six games. Since the calendar flipped to January, the Pioneers have yet to lose a game, outscoring their opponents by over an average of 17 points per game. The Pioneers will look to continue that trend in their next game this Saturday, January 28th, on the road against the Dowling Golden Lions (6-10) at 3:30 p.m.

The LIU Post Pioneers women’s basketball team fell to the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds 75-72 on Saturday afternoon down in the nation’s capital.
Junior guard Ashley Caggiano led the Lady Pioneers in scoring with 18 points. Meanwhile, senior guard Felicia Joyner contributed 15 points of her own along with an assist and a steal. As a team, the Pioneers shot 46 percent (28-69) from the field and 33 percent (9-27) from three-point range.
To open the game, the Firebirds jumped ahead 11-7 off buckets from senior forward Dohnay Banice and junior guard Janelle Junior. From there, the Firebirds did not look back, ending the first half of play with a 38-30 lead over the Lady Pioneers.
Joyner led LIU Post with eight points in the half, but the team turned the ball over 13 times.
Late in the second half, the Pioneers managed to work their way back into the game. Caggiano made a layup with 1:02 left in the game to cut it to an eight-point lead. Junior forward Nicolette Marciniak was fouled and made the two free throws to cut it to a 75-68 Firebirds lead. Sophomore guard Kenyatta Sears hit a three-pointer with 23 seconds left in the game to make it 75-72.
On the ensuing possession, Joyner turned the ball over on an inbounds pass with seven seconds left, but the Firebirds’ senior guard Jasmine Rich stepped out of bounds and gave the ball right back to the Pioneers. The Pioneers, given new life, tried to set up a play but were unsuccessful in putting up a tying shot attempt. With one second left, Joyner threw up a last second shot: a two-pointer that did not go in.
Firebirds’ senior point guard Lauren Brittingham could not be stopped all day, filling up the box score in several categories. Brittingham finished with 23 points, four rebounds, seven assists, and seven steals. In addition, Brittingham was perfect from the charity stripe, nailing all of her nine attempts. The Firebirds’ Dohnay Banice also had a strong game, playing great defense down low and finishing with 14 points and 12 rebounds.
The loss moves the Lady Pioneers to 13-6 and 5-3 in conference play. Prior to the loss, the Lady Pioneers had won five straight. Their next game will be on the road against Dowling College on Saturday, January 28th, at 1 p.m.
