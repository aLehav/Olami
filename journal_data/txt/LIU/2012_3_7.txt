“Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, had a very shiny nose. All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names. They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.”
“No More Bullies at the North Pole,” a new self-published e-book by Dr. George Giuliani, professor of Special Education at LIU Post, examines the role of bullying in the 1964 animated television special, “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”
“About four years ago, I showed the program to my students, and I asked them to look for 10 negative signs,” said Giuliani. “They had never ever thought of it that way. These are graduate students who have seen it many times and never saw these negative signs. That’s when I realized I should write a book about it.”
In the TV program created by Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment, Rudolph, a reindeer at the North Pole, is born with a physical disability: his nose glows red. Because of this perceived impairment, Rudolph is excluded from Santa’s team of reindeer, the other reindeer are told not to play with him, and he is teased and bullied. He is also rejected by his father, Donner, one of the members of Santa’s team.
“What I am trying to do is, hopefully, get the kids listening to the story to think on their own,” said Giuliani. “We have in this country right now an epidemic. We have kids, unfortunately, committing suicide; it’s terrible. With the internet, you can bully an awful lot of people at the same time. That should never be. How do we change our culture? The best way to do it is to get into the hearts and minds of young children at a very early age. If the show was to be made today, I don’t think it would be allowed.”
Giuliani finds there are incidents of sexism, favoritism, exclusion and hypocritical behavior, among other negative behavior, in the program. For example, one of Santa’s elves, Hermey, is told he can’t follow his dream of becoming a dentist because elves are required to make toys. Toys that are not perfect are deemed “misfits” and are sent to live on an island away from everyone else. The word “misfit” is used a total of 27 times in the TV special.
In the end, Rudolph returns home after running away and is no longer mocked. The others are sympathetic towards him after the kidnapping of his family by the Abominable Snow Monster. It is when a blizzard prevents Santa from his journey that Rudolph’s gleaming nose is noticed, and he is asked to lead the sleigh.
“Now, Rudolph can do something worthwhile for Santa,” said Giuliani. “Santa now accepts him because he is going to do something very extraordinary. The message to kids is that we can mock you all we want, we can bully you all we want, and we are going to continue to do it, but we will accept you only if you can do something extraordinary. That’s total hypocrisy; that’s what Santa Claus was teaching.”
Rudolph was created in 1939 by Robert May, an advertising executive, who produced the poem, which was given away to children by Santa Claus at the retail store Montgomery Ward. Approximately 2.5 million Rudolph poems were distributed during the first year of its publication. In 1949, singer Gene Autry recorded a musical version of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” composed by Johnny Marks.
“There are people in this country who feel that it’s an attack on Christmas and that my book is trying to destroy Rudolph,” said Giuliani. “I am not trying to destroy them at all. I had no idea that my book would be looked upon as a political book.”
“Santa Claus is a Christmas miracle that brings joy to all children of the world,” said freshman Radiology major Kristine Soto. “Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but I think the majority of the world doesn’t think Santa’s a bully.”
“No More Bullies at the North Pole” has received national coverage. Giuliani spoke on “Fox & Friends” and ABC News. Newsday also published an article and two opinion pieces. The book, written as a guide for parents, teachers, and librarians, imagines a scenario where Mrs. Claus is able to point out the injustices at the North Pole to Santa and help him change his ways. Currently, the e-book is in the process of being re-edited. It will be available in print sometime this May or June. The book can be downloaded at his website learningaboutbullying.com
“Then, all the reindeer loved him, as they shouted out with glee: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you’ll go down in history!”

Academics consume most college students’ lives, along with the jobs we need, the gyms we try to get to, the families we have to see, and the friends that we all want to keep. Oh, and we all need to sleep and relax eventually. So, how do we manage all of these things we have in our lives?
On March 1st, during Common Hour in Humanities Hall, Room 119, a Time Management Workshop was held by the Academic and Career Counseling and Peer Mentor programs. Taylor Hole, a freshman History Education major, said, “I realized how crazy I was getting over midterms and projects that I felt the Time Management Workshop would help me figure out how to stay [away] from going crazy.” The workshop was an overall success, with about 30 students in attendance.
The Academic and Career Counseling program started with a review of the resources on campus that can help students relieve stress and get a helpful hand. The resources that the Academic and Career Counseling program spoke about included the Peer Tutoring Center, located in Post Hall, Room E17, the Disability Support Services, located in Post Hall, the Writing Center in Humanities Hall, Room 202, and the Student Health and Counseling Center, located in the Life Science Building. Room 154.
The workshop also helped students by discussing some goals an average student would need to keep his or her mind on the prize. The Academic and Career Counseling program suggested that every student should make a schedule of what he or she has to do for the week, make use of a daily planner, and set up a study schedule to help reduce stress.
Some Peer Tutors spoke about P.O.W.E.R, an acronym that stands for Prepare, Organize, Work, Evaluate, and Rethink. The Peer Tutors gave out some helpful hints that they use to keep themselves loyal to their P.O.W.E.R strategy.
The Academic and Career Counseling program informed students that by utilizing some of the strategies outlined in the workshop, they might be successful in beating procrastination.
The workshop also reached out to commuters and gave them some hints, like listening to audiotapes of their professors on the way to school to help them retain the information from class.
The Time Management Workshops have been held throughout the year, but this was the last one of the semester.

Sponsored by the Division for Student Success and the Division for Student Affairs, the first Suit Up for Success event took place on February 28th and 29th, on the Top of the Commons. Over 70 students attended to receive free clothes, shoes, and accessories for interviews and internships. LIU staff and faculty donated all the items.
“In the Career Services and Experiential Education Office, our main purpose on this campus is to assist all LIU Post students with internship, part-time and full-time job searches as well as work with study placements,” said senior Career Development Counselor Amber Lennon. “Since we work with students who are either interviewing for full-time or internship positions, I felt that it would be a good idea to help students acquire the proper interview-wear, as well as some outfits to wear on the job.” With suits and apparel made available by donations from faculty and staff members of the LIU community, Lennon said she was “truly grateful for the abundance of clothing options.”  For the men, two full tables were covered with ties, along with a rack of suits and a selection of shoes. For the women, there were a variety of clothes, including blouses, suits, sweaters, pants and skirts, as well as bags and purses, jewelry, and shoes.
Along with Career Development Counselors Kimberly Brown and Roni Badrian, as well as the Assistant Director of Career Development Lisa Santoro, Lennon assisted students in finding the right clothes and sizes, as well as answered questions and welcomed everyone who decided to stop by. The four women, along with event coordinator and Associate Director of Experiential Education and Employer Relations Alice Baumer, organized the event. The event was promoted by flyers around campus and announcements over the speaker in Hillwood, prompting 71 students to show up.
Lennon was pleased to see the number of students attending. “I think that this event exceeded my expectations,” she said, explaining the great feeling of seeing how appreciative all the students were.
Junior Psychology major Danielle Patterson heard about the event through flyers she had seen around school. “I think this is great,” she said, as she looked through prospective finds. “It´s good to have the opportunity to get clothes that make you look presentable for an interview or an internship,” she added. Patterson walked away with a new suit and a pair of pants. She wasn’t the only one to leave the event with new clothes.
“A number of students have walked out of here with full suits,” said Lennon. By the conclusion of the first day of the event, almost all purses and bags disappeared, and a wealth of clothes, shoes, and accessories were scooped up, too.
Sophomore Public Relations major Helene Pedersen found a new suit and two sweaters. “I was impressed. Everyone was really nice and helpful, and even though I came there the last day, they still had a variety of clothes that I could use,” she said, explaining that she definitely would come by for a future event.
With a lot of positive feedback from grateful students, Lennon wishes to arrange the event once a semester. In the future, she would like to offer an even wider variety of sizes to give students a larger selection to choose from.
All students who attended had a chance to sign up for a raffle to win gift certificates to Lord & Taylor department stores.  “If we do this event again, I definitely would like to reach out to more department stores for donations and raffle prizes,” she said, adding, “For our first time around, I would say that the event was a success.”

Don’t let the intimidation of being somewhere new stop you from the life-changing experience that studying abroad can offer. On Wednesday, February 29th, curious students stopped by the study abroad table with many questions.  Patricia Murdock, Director of the Study Abroad program, says there are five good reasons a student should study abroad.
“Study[ing] abroad is the best way to learn a language,” Murdock said.  Many students are already taking languages, including Italian, Spanish and German.  “What better way to really learn and understand the language than by studying in that country?” asked Murdock.  Being there encourages one to practice the language more in depth and to learn from the locals.
The second reason to study abroad is to get to experience a new culture first hand. Murdock explained that cultural differences go much deeper than just differences in language and food.  They reflect peoples’ beliefs and values, as well as the people from those cultures may view the world.
 
According to Murdock, another reason to consider taking a trip is because “study abroad will help you develop skills and give you an experience that is different than the traditional classroom setting.” Although this can make a student feel uneasy at first, it can turn into a very rewarding experience.  A student will discover his or her own weaknesses and strengths and learn how to overcome challenges.  “You will encounter situations that are wholly unfamiliar to you and will learn to adapt and respond in effective ways,” explained Murdock.
Studying abroad allows students to learn more about themselves, said Murdock, explaining the fourth reason for students to consider it.  Students often gain perspective about their own cultures and see them through fresh eyes.  Some students even find themselves re-evaluating their previous beliefs and values with the new ones they have been exposed to while studying abroad.
The final reason Murdock offered for why students might wish to consider studying abroad is that “study abroad can enhance employment opportunities.”  She continued, “To some employers, a student who has studied abroad can be seen as self-motivated, independent, willing to embrace challenges, and able to cope with diverse problems and situations.”
Australia and England are two of the most popular places where Post students study abroad.  Yecenia Tapia, a junior Early Childhood Education major, is currently spending her spring semester in London.  She spoke of how she loves it there and is embracing all the new experiences that are coming her way.  Tapia said, “This is definitely an experience that every student should take. No one will ever take this experience from me, and it is something I can carry throughout my whole life and talk about what an impact in my life this has been.”
Hailey Brosnan, a junior Biology major, is currently studying in Australia.  She has been there since February 14th and will return home on June 30th.  She mentioned the excitement of studying in another country and getting to embrace its culture.  She said that she has no regrets about her decision to go to Australia.  “I felt that I wanted to get the most out of my college experience, and when else would I get a chance like this to spend a semester in another country?” Brosnan said.
 
To study abroad, students must be in good academic standing and must garner approval from their department chairpersons and the Post Director of Study.  They must also have completed one full-time semester on campus.  Students can use their financial aid that they are normally entitled to, including scholarships when studying abroad.  There are additional costs for airfare and spending money, which vary depending on the location a student decides to go.
If you are interested in studying abroad, you can contact the Director of Study Abroad Patricia Murdock at patricia.murdock@liu.edu, stop by the Study Abroad office in Winnick House, Room 221, or visit http://www.liu.edu/CWPost/Academics/Study-Abroad.aspx

The men’s basketball team defeated the Bridgeport Purple Knights on Saturday, March 4th, by a score of 86-67 to win the East Coast Conference Championship and to earn an automatic bid in the NCAA Tournament. Senior guard Stefan Bonneau, named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player, led the Pioneers in scoring with a game-high 29 points and five assists.
The Pioneers (23-5) initially started the game slow, as their first basket came four minutes into the game, when Bonneau drained the first of his five three-pointers of the contest. Soon after the first bucket made by Bonneau, the Pioneers found their form. The offense picked up, and the defense swarmed the Purple Knights, consistently causing difficult shots. The first half was a very competitive, back-and-forth battle in which the lead changed several times. The Pioneers, who came into the tournament as the top overall seed in the conference, went into the half leading the third-seeded Purple Knights by a score of 36-31.
Early in the second half of play, the Purple Knights cut the lead to two points as the Pioneers led 45-43, but that is as close as Bridgeport came for the duration of the game. The Pioneers immediately answered back, going on an 11-0 run fueled by baskets made by Bonneau, junior guard Tobin Carberry, and freshman forward Charles McCann.
The Pioneers completely dominated the final 20 minutes of the game in almost every way. The Pioneers outscored the Purple Knights 50-36 in the second half due to shooting an outstanding 57 percent from the field, while the Purple Knights struggled from the floor, shooting only 43 percent. Also in the second half, the Pioneers were more frequent visitors to the free-throw line as they attempted 16 more free-throws than the Purple Knights.
The Pioneers played a great team game, as several players stepped up their efforts in the biggest game of the year thus far. Bonneau led the Pioneers and electrified the crowd while doing so, scoring 29 points and taking over control of the game. Carberry also played a pivotal part in the win, notching a double-double, scoring 19 points and grabbing 11 rebounds.
The frontcourt for the Pioneers played excellent on both sides of the ball. Sophomore forward Vaughn Allen had a double-double, dropping 11 points and securing 10 rebounds. Freshman forward Tyuan Williams made timely shots throughout the game, finishing with 13 points on an efficient 6-8 shooting while adding six boards. Off the bench, freshman forward Charles McCann displayed toughness down low, scoring nine points and blocking four shots.
Another major reason for the win was the Pioneers’ solid defense on the Purple Knights’ All-ECC First Team senior guard Darian David. He scored 17 points, but he could not get into a rhythm, as he was 6-20 from the floor.
The Pioneers, the sixth seed in the East Region in the upcoming NCAA Tournament, have their next game on Saturday, March 10th, against the third-seeded Adelphi Panthers (20-8). The last time these two teams met was on December 13th,o f this season when Adelphi edged out the Pioneers in an 83-79 victory. Tune into WCWP at 88.1 FM or wcwp.org to listen to all the action.

The friend zone has been a topic used by many writers; however, I feel it is worth addressing again. I think that some other writers have done you gentlemen a great disservice by making you think that there are a few simple steps to get yourselves out of the friend zone. I’m so sorry to be the bearer of bad news guys, but there are no such rules.
Most of the articles I have read in preparation to write this article convey a few of the same basic rules. Some of these may work whether you’re in the friend zone or you’re just looking to pick up a girl. However, don’t think for a second that if you follow these rules that you’re going to get the girl.
As a girl, let me make one thing clear; the boundaries of the friend zone are essentially concrete.
The rules that seem to show up in every article I read are to make the girl think that you don’t really need them (even though you probably do). Make her feel as if she’s attractive but so is her competition and send her conflicting messages. To show the girl that you don’t really need them, you are supposed to flake out on her every once and a while and to not make her a priority. When you’re with her, notice other girls by either just staring at them while she’s talking or actually say something about how attractive the other girl is.
HA! The fact that guys think this will get you out of the friend zone is pretty comical actually. I bet that doing these things with a girl you aren’t already friends with will work, which I can understand, we like a little bit of a chase. But if you go from being really good friends with a girl to acting like a complete jerk, we aren’t going to start pining for you. We’re going to tell you that you’re being a jerk.
Paying more attention to some strange girl and telling me how hot you think she is will not get you any points with me. Actually, that is really rude.. If we’re just friends I wouldn’t mind or say anything because I would probably say something similar about a guy I find attractive. But, if you are trying to get me to fall for you, I wouldn’t recommend that tip to you.
Conflicting messages from a guy is probably the most annoying and aggravating thing in the world to a girl. Head games are not fun for anyone so don’t play them. What you say and what you do should not convey two completely opposite messages. Girls like a little bit of a chase but if we get completely derailed by your conflicting messages, chances are we won’t stick around to find out what you really meant by them. It’s just not worth it, as the saying goes; there are plenty of other fish in the sea.
So if you find yourself in the friend zone, I’m sorry to say it but it’s most likely a permanent state of being. Little tips and tricks are not going to make her realize that you two are meant to be. That may work in romantic comedies, but life is nothing like a romantic comedy, if you haven’t realized. If you can’t get yourself out of the friend zone after a month or two of trying, just do yourself a favor and throw in the towel. There’s nothing wrong with just being friends with a girl.

On Friday, March 2, NASA admitted that its computer system was fully hacked in 2011, according to an article published on March 2 by BBC News entitled “Hackers had ‘full functional control’ of NASA computers.”  One would think that NASA, one of the most technologically advanced agencies in America, would be able to protect its computer systems. One may also think that with the available software protection technology today, all government agencies would be able to keep systems secure.
This is not always the case, as was proven in June 2011 when hackers took down the CIA website for several hours.  The group LulzSec, a growing group of internet hackers, took credit for the break in, according to a June 15, 2011, Washington Post article by Ellen Nakashima, entitled “CIA website hacked; group LulzSec takes credit.” Cnet.com and computerworld.com published articles in regards to the attacks the day after on June 15. These are not the first times major government websites have been hacked, but each time it happens it gets scarier because the hackers seem to become more daring by hacking into an even more vital computer system. What could these hackers really do?
We live in a computerized world. Just about every file is kept on a computer. Computers are space savers and an easy way to keep track of all of your information, and for the government to keep track of theirs. But what happens if a group of hackers manages to get these files? What happens if they gain access to a computer that has a satellite watching our troops overseas? The answer is catastrophe. Every single file our country holds precious, our entire national security could potentially be stolen and sold to other countries or used for their own benefit. Cyber security is rapidly becoming a hot topic in Washington and finding a way to insure it is a costly problem and the government is beginning to take precautions.
Of course hacking is already illegal, and the penalties for treason and the selling of government information would land someone severe penalties. On the White House webpage, cyber security is not a hard topic to come across. In fact, President Obama has several ideas listed on the website that outline what he is doing in terms of cyber security. In his attempt to lower the threat of a cyber attack, he is trying to create positions in which someone can over watch the security systems and keep out hackers. He is trying to have researchers create new technologies that will be able to keep out hackers. Additionally, he is pushing for better security systems and spy finding software. He is also trying to get the word out about the threat that these hackers pose to the nation, because if we are all aware of it, perhaps it will help lower the threat levels. Several pieces of legislation have already passed, such as The Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative, and more are likely to come.
For now we are not fully protected. However, we are not completely at risk either. We are still one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world and the security systems in place keep the country as safe as possible. As the technology develops, we will only become safer. But we have to hope we develop the technology to protect ourselves before hackers find the technology to break into our systems completely.

Congratulations! You’re in college, you’re getting decent grades, and you even have a few good friends already. You want to go out and have some fun, but mom and dad are already taking out loans for your college tuition, so do you really think they’re going to give you money to go out?
Think again, you’re on your own. So the next step is getting a part-time job near your school.
LIU-Post offers a work-study program for those who dorm and want to earn some extra income. The work-study jobs will be designed around your major so you’re doing something you are interested in.
For example, some broadcasting students work at WCWP, the college radio station. Here you learn how to be on live radio, write for radio, and meet other students who are also interested in broadcasting all while getting paid. Some students are residence advisors. At Post, if you are an RA you will get free boarding. Sometimes the work is difficult, but it’s a good thing to add to your resume. It shows you are responsible and trustworthy.
Maybe you want a new change of scenery and you want to get off campus. No worries, try being a barista at Starbucks. Many baristas make from minimum wage to up to $13 per hour depending on experience, including tips. Working at a local supermarket might be a great option as well. The hours are flexible, you’ll get to work with people your own age, and there will always be something to do. The starting pay can be above minimum wage.
Working in the hospitality business is another cliché college job. That’s what I did throughout college, waitressing at a corporate restaurant.  Sometimes it feels like a curse working there, but then again I made some wonderful friends, met great people, and made a good amount of money. Yes, the hours are long, but I was able to work part time, go to school full time, and even have some sort of social life. Many restaurants are willing to work with your schedule because the hours to work are strange and many restaurants have large staffs as it is.
Paid internships are a great way to make money while working on something you like to do. Looking for internships that pay is more difficult, but looking on the Internet or asking your advisor could help guide you in the right direction.
Working at the mall is another great way to get your foot in. I had a friend who worked at Abercrombie and Fitch in high school, stayed with it in college, and then was promoted to assistant manager while in college. She got benefits and made a decent salary all while going to school.
These are just a few of the great jobs that are available in the area. Find one that is good for you and make some friends. You never know, getting a small job could point you in the direction you want to go in life.

“Punch first, ask questions later.”
This is some of the advice Mercedes Vizcaino, Photography Editor for All You Magazine and the Media Arts Department’s Food for Thought Lecture Series’ guest speaker, said she received from her parents that helped her throughout her career in the cutthroat media world.
Vizcaino, a native of New York, began working for a surgeon at age 13. When she went to college, she initially thought she wanted to do something in medicine but soon realized that working in the media might be a better fit. She started as an intern at Warner Bros., where she was responsible for getting opinions of college students on productions before they debuted. While interning there, she had her first experiences with celebrities, something that proved to be a major part of her career for a long time.
Immediately after graduating from Brooklyn College with a Communications degree, Vizcaino began working for Turner Broadcasting. When she declined an offer to move to the West Coast, she soon found herself without a job. For a number of years, she worked a series of temp jobs around the New York City area, including jobs at a hospital, law firms, and an early Internet start-up.
“Get as many skills as you can,” Vizcaino advised students. “Because I had skills in web development and in writing, these places kind of took a chance on me.”
After working in a number of different fields, which, in time, led her more and more into photography, she found her current job for Time, Inc. Since beginning her work at All You, Vizcaino has earned her Master’s in Creative Writing and has begun work on a photography book of Cuba, where both her parents were born.
Through her experiences with a number of different jobs in the media field, Vizcaino has also learned many valuable lessons, which she relayed to Post students.
“Even if you don’t know what you’re talking about, you have to fake it ‘til you make it,” she told lecture-goers. “You have to project that you know what you’re talking about.” Students, she said, should take advantage of the resources their school offers and, when it’s necessary, they not be afraid to ask for help.
“I think what she said about resourcefulness was especially important,” said Sandra Mardenfeld, Director of the LIU Post Journalism program and one of the organizers of the Food for Thought lecture series. “Whatever was thrown her way, she always figured out a way to fulfill her assignment or find the next position.”
The next Food for Thought lecture will take place on Wednesday, April 4th. Co-sponsored by the Public Relations department, it will feature A.J. Carter, Public Information Officer in the Town of Huntington and former Associate Editor for Business at Newsday.

Whether you’re out on a date or just out to eat with a few friends, the bill always comes at some point. But what is the right amount to tip your server? It’s different for everyone. Most likely it depends on how your parents tipped when you were a kid. However, most etiquette guides will tell you that there are a few things to take into consideration while you are figuring it out.
The standard tip percentage is between 15 and 20 percent. The monetary differences between tipping before or after tax is added is pretty small so don’t fuss over it. If something goes wrong, it is customary for people to blame their server, now that’s just not fair. If you have ever worked in a restaurant you know this, a million things could go wrong with a person’s order that you have absolutely no control over. The kitchen staff could read the order wrong or just make a simple mistake. Don’t forget we are all human.
Friday and Saturday nights are the busiest shifts for a server. It doesn’t matter how many tables they have or what you order, your server is going to be running around like a madman regardless. So, expect to have to wait a little longer for everything. Also, keep in mind that food takes time to cook and your order is only one of many that the kitchen staff is cooking. Asking where your food is or giving your server a hard time is not going to make your food get to the table any faster.
Nine times out of ten, if your server makes a mistake on your order, they will apologize one hundred times and work as quickly as possible to correct it. I’m a server, I know because I’ve done it, even if the mistake wasn’t mine.
So you have to ask yourself a few questions when you are calculating a tip. How was your overall service? Was your server friendly and accommodating? Keep these other factors I mentioned earlier in mind and give your server the benefit of the doubt. Also remember that your server is most likely being paid less than minimum wage because servers make their money in tips. Plus, they have to tip out the bus boys and the bar at the end of their shift.
If you have a good dining experience make sure the tip you leave reflects that. Servers usually remember their customers, if you leave a less than satisfactory tip for good service, they probably won’t be so accommodating the second time around. 18-20 percent is completely fair unless you had terrible service, then leaving a lower tip is entirely acceptable.

If you are anything like me, you have spent countless hours standing exasperatedly in front of your closet, thinking to yourself: “I have absolutely nothing to wear.” It is for this reason that I have determined eight must-have items to make your wardrobe work for you.
1.  Blazer: I believe that every fashionista needs a well-fitting blazer in her wardrobe. Blazers can work in most seasons as well as in most settings such as the office and on-campus. Wear it over a dress to add some edge or with a t-shirt and jeans to be effortlessly cool. Check out Express or Gap to find the perfect blazer for your wardrobe.
2.  Cardigan: Is there anything more comfortable than a nice cardigan on a pleasant spring afternoon? No matter the color, cardigans are capable of adding comfort and style to any outfit. Worn with a pencil skirt, one can look adorable and vintage. Worn with a button-down shirt and jeans, one can look cute and studious! Look for cardigan options anywhere from J.CREW to Target.
3. Button-Down Shirt: Many of us see button-down shirts and think rigid and outdated, but these shirts are quite versatile. The most important thing when purchasing a button-down shirt is to be certain that it fits perfectly. This might take some trial and error, but it is definitely worth the time. Remember, if you are breaking a sweat just trying to button it, go up a size or two. Wear it open, with a comfy t-shirt and jeans, or tucked into a nice skirt to show that you mean business…stylish business, of course.
4. T-Shirt: This piece might sound a little commonplace, but you can never underestimate the power of a comfortable t-shirt. Try a soft, stretchy material that skims over your body and accentuates your curves. You simply cannot go wrong with a plain white t-shirt. Just look at old movies with James Dean and Marlon Brando; it does not get much better than that, ladies! Tucked into a pencil skirt or worn with skinny jeans, you are ready for anything.
5.  Wrap Dress: There is little more universally flattering than a classic wrap dress—just ask fashion designer and wrap dress queen, Diane von Furstenberg. The beauty of a wrap dress is not only the plunging, yet classy neckline, but also the waist accentuating tie. Depending on length, wrap dresses can be worn to a fancy dinner or a BBQ at a friend’s house. Old Navy has some incredible dress options for your spring fashion needs.
6.  Pencil Skirt: These skirts are no longer just for librarians and teachers! Pencil skirts can be sultry and body-hugging or classic and charming. A black pencil skirt is a staple in any fashion maven’s closet. Pencil skirts can be worn higher and with a shirt tucked in to add some drama. Head into Macy’s or Banana Republic to search for your skirt of choice.
7.  Skinny Jeans: This might be strictly a personal choice, but I think a good pair of skinny jeans is all a girl really needs in the jean department. Skinny jeans are very flattering and can be worn with a variety of shoes. Capable of being dressed up or dressed down, skinny jeans are a must-have these days.
8.  Leggings: To know me, is to know that leggings are basically my sole pant of choice. While the fashion police are still investigating the leggings-as-pants crime, I feel that leggings are comfortable and flexible. However, when wearing leggings, a longer shirt or longer tank top under your shirt should be worn to prevent any further crimes against fashion.
I hope that next time you are standing in front of your closet, you think back to what Dr. Marisa has prescribed in this article. It is important to note that there is no need to get frustrated when it comes to fashion. The key is to be yourself. As Greek sage and Stoic philosopher Epictetus once said, “Know, first, who you are; and then adorn yourself accordingly.”

Most people like sports.  Everyone chooses a kind which he or she enjoys most of all.  It doesn’t matter whether a person enjoys sports as an athlete and regularly trains or just enjoys watching a broadcast of some game on TV or watching a sporting event live in a stadium.  Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, baseball, hockey, skating, and skiing.
But have you ever thought how many relatively unknown sports exist? After searching for this information, I was greatly surprised! So, let me share with you four unknown kinds of sport. They are very unusual, unpredictable and kind of funny or even bizarre.
One of them is called “Koppball.” It’s a British game and consists of carrying a ball in a cup that should be scored in a goal as in football. It is run by the International Kopp Ball Association (or IKBA).  Koppball can be considered the modern reconstruction of an ancient Celtic game that hasn’t been played for 2 thousand years. IKBA has modified it and wishes to get it back on its feet. For the full rules of the game, you can go to www.ikba.webs.com.
The second obscure sport is Chessboxing, which is a hybrid sport, combining (as you can see from its name) chess with boxing in alternating rounds. This sport was invented by Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, who was inspired by a French comic book “Le Froid Equateur” by artist and filmmaker Enki Bilal. The match begins with a four-minute chess round and is then followed by three minutes of boxing, with rounds of chess and boxing alternating until the end. There is a one minute break between rounds. Speed chess is used, a form in which each player has a total of only twelve minutes for the whole game.
There is two more and very funny ways in which people compete and entertain themselves and others.  The first one is so called “Wife Carrying”. It is a sport in which male competitors race while each carrying a female teammate. This kind of sport was first introduced at Sonkajärvi, Finland. The male is supposed to carry the female through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. Several types of carrying may be practiced: piggyback, fireman’s carry (over the shoulder), or so called Estonian-style (the wife hangs upside-down with her legs around the husband’s shoulders, holding onto his waist). The prize in this game depends on the wife’s weight in beer.
The last unknown sport (the funniest in my opinion) is “Ferret legging”. This sport seems to have been popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England. The male-only contestants put live ferrets inside their trousers; the winner is the one who is the last to release the animals. If you’d like to look at it in more details, you may find out that competitors tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then stands in front of the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers which prevent the ferrets from having free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.If some day you become bored with popular and widespread kinds of sports, you have many alternatives at your disposal.

So many times I have heard of people driving while having a suspended license or just not having one at all. The cause of not having a license/suspended one could be drinking and driving, driving under the influence of drugs, having too many points on your license, leaving the scene of an accident, reckless driving, or driving without the proper information such as insurance, registration. While you might have your license taken away, it doesn’t stop most people from driving without one anyway. But if you are caught driving without one, you will endure consequences.
The situation is already bad, you lost your license or it was suspended because you were irresponsible. Now getting around is going to be a lot harder and more expensive. You’ll have to hitch rides from mom, dad, friends, family, or, if you’re on your own, public transportation. Being honest, you feel bad burdening your friends and family to drive you around everywhere because you were stupid a couple of times. You try to give them money here and there, but it just doesn’t feel like good enough compensation. And let’s be honest, nobody wants to take public transportation on Long Island. In the city and boroughs, it’s understandable, but everybody on the Island drives. So you take it upon yourself to drive anyway since you already know how to, but getting caught is a different story.
If you are caught driving without a license/suspended license, your car will be towed and you will be given a large fine. In other circumstances, depending on why your license is suspended in the first place, you might be arrested and sent to jail for up to 30 days. After jail, you’ll go to court, receive a few fines. and then be on probation for up to a year.
So the consequences aren’t pretty, then again getting your license suspended isn’t either. It can not be stressed enough to be safe while driving, especially if you are under the influence of drugs/alcohol. Getting a cab will be a lot cheaper than paying the fines you’ll get from a DWI. Lately on the Island, police have been locking down on drinking and driving and rightfully so. The wrong person behind the wheel could truly be fatal to somebody else. As students in college, we are expected to make mistakes sometimes, but don’t let something that could be avoidable ruin your life. DWI and suspended licenses show up for background checks so if you really want a job, you might want to think again before you get behind the wheel. Most jobs will reconsider their decision to hire you because of past mistakes made. So to my fellow drivers, please drive safely!

Being a single gay man living in New York is not as glamorous as you may think. Women tell me all the time that I’m beautiful, that they would date me, and that they will willingly carry my children one day. Unfortunately, that’s not how I see myself every day. Trust me it’s just as hard to look like Ken as is it is to look like Barbie.
Gay men can be very judgmental when it comes to body image. The demand to be physically fit like an Abercrombie and Fitch model is so intense at times that some buckle under the pressure. Sometimes, I feel the pressure and it’s heartbreaking to know that some guys won’t even speak to me because of the way I look. I’ll be honest; I’m no underwear model, but girl, look at that body. I am beautiful and you are beautiful.
Just because a group of people tell us that we should look a certain way doesn’t mean that is the only way to look. We all come in different shapes and sizes. We all come from different places and experiences. No one can tell you that you are not beautiful because beauty is not something you can define. Aesthetics are different in every culture, group, creed, and discipline. There is no handbook or instruction manual on beauty.
The only advice I can give is to be confident and to see the beauty in yourself, but believe me, it’s not easy. I struggle with it myself. Sometimes you look in the mirror and you’re not happy with what you see, but the thing that people find most attractive in a person is confidence. If you can shake off the feeling of inadequacy and see that beauty in yourself, others will respond to that. People respect confidence and when you feel comfortable in your own skin you can see it; it radiates.
My best friend Matt and I talk about this subject more often than not, because sometimes we both feel like wall flowers in room full of weeds. However, let me tell you, we are two strong, willful, and passionate men, who happen to be gay. We are not afraid to hold our heads high and be proud of who we are, even when we’re feeling less than our best.
It’s extremely hard to find and keep close friendships in a community that sometimes is focused a lot on body image, forget about trying to find a date. That’s why I’m lucky to have such a great friend, even if he calls me names while I’m trying to write my column.
Because of the pressure on gay men to look a certain way there has been an influx of eating disorders and steroid usage among many young gay men. It has affected the community in very negative ways which, considering the amount of negativity already aimed at the LGBT community, is something that no one should have to feel.
Legendary Gay icon, RuPaul, has a saying: “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?” We should remember to take the time and love ourselves for who we are, not for who someone wants us to be.

For a high school girl, prom is the most important night in her life. The hair, the shoes, the purse and the makeup all bring the prom look together…but what about the dress?
Some girls start the search for the perfect dress months before the big day. However, the dress can be the most expensive part of the prom experience. Sure, you might catch a great sale on your dream dress, but some might not be as lucky.
WCWP, PTV and The Pioneer are hosting a Prom Dress Drive for a high school (soon to be confirmed) next month. The goal is to help girls who may not have the funds to buy their dream dress. That’s where you come in. We are calling all you girls! We need dresses! Whether it be your old prom dress, a bridesmaid dress, or any kind of cocktail dress, if you’re willing to donate it, you’re helping a girl who would truly appreciate it. To all you guys who might be reading this, ask your girlfriends, your sister, a cousin, a close girl friend, and see if they’re willing to part with a dress.
For those interested in donating a dress, you can bring them to WCWP (behind Hillwood Commons), PTV (Humanities 214) or The Pioneer office (upstairs of Hillwood Commons).
Also, to anyone who would like to assist with the event, more details to follow so you can sign up.

Mitchell McDeere (Josh Lucas), a young attorney, brought down the law firm of Bendini, Lambert & Locke, which operated as a front for the Chicago mob. After ten years in the Witness Protection program, Mitch and his family are able to return to their normal lives. However, the mob boss’ son seeks revenge for his father’s prison term. Mitch’s brother and his brother’s girlfriend work for his upstart law firm. Because the family is in need of money and under surveillance, Mitch takes a job at Kinross & Clark, another shady law firm.
The series is based on the 1993 movie starring Tom Cruise, which was based on a novel written by John Grisham. This latest addition to the franchise picks up 10 years after the Cruise movie. According to Forbes, this show, which airs as a mid-season replacement on NBC, won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. The Sony Television Network, which is producing the show, has committed to a full 22-episode season. International networks paid upfront licensing fees for the right to air an entire season of the show. As a result, when Sony brought the series to NBC, almost the entire cost of production had already been covered. This allows NBC to turn an easy profit even if ratings decline, causing commercial prices to plummet as well.
“The Firm” airs on NBC Thursdays at 10 p.m. As reported by TV Guide, the premiere was the worst rating in the history of NBC for an NBC regular season drama debut. On February 3rd, 2012, NBC announced that “The Firm” was being rescheduled to Saturdays at 9 p.m.

Pop-punk group “Freshman 15” is gearing up for the release of its sophomore album, “Here’s To Feeling Good,” on March 13th, via Standby Records. The band consists of Davey Fortner (Guitar/Vocals), Davey Hoogerwerf (Bass/Vocals), Leo Teran (Drums), and Mike Baker (Guitar/Vocals).
Songs include: “Secret of the Ooohs/Wizard of Ahhhs,” “Mistake Ex-Girlfriend,” “Anywhere But Here,” and “Getting Weird.” Personally, my favorite has to be “Drink To That,” and no, it’s not because it has the same title as Rihanna’s song. I liked the beginning melody and how the song began to slowly transition into pop-punk. I have to confess, this genre is certainly one that I really have not listened to in the past. If you enjoy pop-punk music, give “Freshman 15” a chance.
The group’s “Tour Up From The Floor Up” east coast tour hits Amityville, New York, on Wednesday, March 7th, at the Broadway Bar, 198 Broadway. The phone number is 516-241-5482. Doors open at 6:00 p.m., and tickets are $10.

Known as today’s wealthiest wedge-shaped landmass, the United Arab Emirates is home to several distinct states and cities, but its main capital is the exquisite Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is one of the most modern cities in the world. Economically, it is one of the world’s largest producers of oil, which has diversified in recent years through investments in financial services and tourism.

Here is your exclusive guide to Abu Dhabi.
Airlines/Travel: Abu Dhabi is roughly located in the “center” of a typical map, which makes it easily accessible from all corners of the globe. Its main airport, Abu Dhabi International Airport, serves as the gateway to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and is also home to several successful airlines that proudly fly to this wonderful city. Such airlines include the national airline of the UAE , Etihad Airlines, and its most popular international airline, Emirates. These airlines fly non-stop from New York’s JFK Airport to Abu Dhabi. Other carriers include Air France, British Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Air India and Qatar Airways. The best time to travel is from November to February, as temperatures are not so high, and many festivals are held along with many amazing outdoor activities.
Hotels/Lodging: Tourism is a major component of Abu Dhabi’s growing success. As a result, traditional hospitality, high standards of modern-day luxury, and service come together in this city to offer guests an unmatched accommodation experience wherever they stay.

Stop by and daydream at The Emirates Palace hotel, the most expensive resort ever built. If you’re interested in an adrenaline rush, get into the fast lane at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, the world’s first Ferrari theme park. On a cultural note, consider the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, the world’s third-largest mosque, and the Cultural Foundation, an impressive arts center that certainly deserves a visit. Abu Dhabi is a compulsive shopper’s dream. There are several malls, such as Abu Dhabi Mall, Marina Mall, and Al Wahda Mall. Finally, if you are interested in exploring the lovely Arabian Gulf waters, then try “dhow” cruising along the numerous islands scattered around the city. Dhow cruising is popular among tourists for its pleasant and relaxing environment.
            Cuisine/Dining: Foods from around the world mingle in Abu Dhabi with restaurants offering a vibrant and varied mix of impressive flavors. Restaurants in this beautiful city offer a wide range of Arabic, Far-Eastern, European, Latin and Continental cuisines, served in authentic style and unique ambience. Lebanese and Arabic foods are usually at a low-price throughout the city. The city also hosts some fast food chain restaurants, like McDonald’s and several Chinese restaurants.

LIU Post is competing in the 2012 RecycleMania Tournament for the first time. RecycleMania is a recycling competition and benchmarking tool for colleges and universities to promote recycling as well as waste reduction.
The competition began in January of 2001 when the two recycling coordinators from Ohio University and Miami University came together to discuss how they could motivate their student bodies to recycle more. The result was the birth of the first RecycleMania Tournament.
Since its first year, RecycleMania has practically grown exponentially. Last year, in 2011, the competition included 630 colleges and universities representing 49 states and 4 Canadian provinces. Over 7.5 million students and staff participated and collectively recycled over 91 million pounds of recyclables and organic materials.
The competition includes 9 different categories and is 8 weeks long. LIU Post will be competing in only three: the Gorilla Competition, the Per Capita Classic, and the Electronics Competition. The Gorilla Competition is based on overall weight of recyclables, so this will be awarded to the school that recycles the most. The Per Capita Classic is based on the weight of recyclables recycled per person. Lastly, the Electronics Competition, a new category added this year, will go to the school that recycles the most electronics.
So, for the month of March, the LIU Post Recycling Program in conjunction with the Facilities Department will be collecting e-waste and tracking how much we recycle for the month of March. If you have any electronics that you wish to recycle on campus, there will be a representative from Facilities outside the Hutchins Gallery in the library to make sure that your e-waste is acceptable under our current e-waste recycling program.
Thus far, we have recycled over 8,000 pounds of recyclables. The members of the LIU Post Recycling Program as well as the Department of Facilities Services are working very hard to raise awareness about this initiative and we encourage everybody, staff, faculty, and students alike, to recycle as much as you possibly can.
 
The collection days are as follows:
-March 6th:             1-2pm
-March 14th:             2-3pm
-March 22nd:            9-10am
-March 29th:             10-11am
 
Our recycling program also accepts aluminum & tin cans, plastic bottles, cardboard, paperboard, and mixed paper. Recycling bins for these products are located in Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Interfaith Center, and the lobbies of each residence hall.
Please note that any items with batteries, liquids or chemicals cannot be accepted. However, typical e-waste items that are accepted under our program are computers, TVs, VCRs, cell phones, gaming systems, stereo equipment, and fax machines.
Go to http://www.crserecycling.com/main.php?p=electronics for a full list of items that can be recycled. For additional questions, please email CWPostRecycling@yahoo.com

America’s waistline is expanding!  In the past 20 years obesity has dramatically increased.  Obese children are becoming obese adults.  Our society doesn’t make it easy for people who have a weight problem.  There is a huge emphasis on being thin and we are surrounded by unhealthy food.  Losing weight when your obese is not just about changing your physical appearance, it’s about becoming healthier.
The “diet” industry completely misleads most of the obese population.  They promise a quick fix to a problem that cannot be fixed quickly.  This quick fix mentality is the reason why many fail at their weight loss attempts.  The only way to have successful and sustainable weight loss is a permanent lifestyle change, and change takes time.
Adequate weight loss plans are structured around portion control, eating more fruits and vegetables, and increased physical activity. Everything in moderation is a key aspect of sticking with a plan. No one wants to feel deprived.  Deprivation leads to failure, which is the reason why most fad diets don’t work.
The physical actions taken to lose weight are simple, but mental preparation is imperative for success.  Without determination, and will power to motivate your physical actions, weight loss is very difficult.  You have to accept the reality that the results won’t happen overnight and it will help you keep a positive outlook on your weight loss journey.   Changing your lifestyle will help you feel better physically and mentally.
My personal struggles with obesity have empowered me to help others.  You must change your life forever to reap the complete benefits of a weight loss plan. For four years I have sustained a 100 pound weight loss and if I can do it, you can do it.

In 2011, the LIU Post softball team fought its way to 9th in the nation, making it all the way to the NCAA Division II World Series at Moyer Sports Complex in Salem, Virginia. In 2012, the team is looking to continue its drive.
“Our biggest goal is to get back to the National Tournament,” said head coach Jamie Apicella. “But we understand that our short terms goals are the important steps to even allow us that opportunity.”
The team began its season at 2-1 after opening its season with two wins over St. Cloud State University and Ferris State University at the Rebel Spring Games in Kissimmee, Fla. on March 4th.
After winning the 2011 National Fastpitch Coaches Association East Region Coaching Staff of the Year award, Apicella said that his staff is especially excited for this season. “I like the depth we have at each position, and I feel we are much more athletic than last year,” he said.  “On paper, this is the most talented team I have coached in my 14 years.”
After losing a couple of key players last season, the Pioneers are returning with what Apicella hopes will be more than enough to fill in any gaps. In addition to proven talents, like Nicole Hagenah, a 2011 1st team All-American, and Kendall Bright, 3rd team All-American last season, freshman Megan Salcido is an outstanding pitcher from California. In high school, Salcido led the San Diego area in ERA with a 0.99 earned run average. “She will be the ace of the pitching staff,” said the 14th year head coach.
The Pioneers have also acquired a pair of transfers over the offseason. Liz Weber, a transfer from LeMoyne, is expected to help the team both on the mound and at the plate. As a freshman at LeMoyne, Weber was named to both the Northeast-10 First Team and the All-Rookie Team, and in high school, her awards included all-state, all-Long Island, All-American, and New York State Player of the Year.  The other major transfer, Alexis Gonzalez, a sophomore who spent her rookie season at Siena College “will solidify 3B and be an immediate power threat in the middle of our line-up,” said Apicella.
As the season begins, the Pioneers are looking forward to what they hope will be a great season. “We treat every game the same, and we expect to win every time we step on the field,” Apicella said. The Pioneers will play the first 10 games of their season at the Rebel Games before returning home to play their home opener at 2:30 p.m. on March 15th, against Dominican College.

“Success,” LIU Post Women’s Lacrosse Head Coach Meghan McNamara said when asked to describe the team’s biggest goal for the 2012 season.
The team finished its 2011 campaign with a 13-4 record, which proved not enough to earn the team a playoff berth. This was the first time the team did not make the postseason since 2005. “We gained a lot from last year’s experience,” McNamara said. “We were left with unfinished business.”
The Pioneers were ranked third in a February 28th IWLCA poll, behind Le Moyne and perennial powerhouse and 2011 champion Adelphi. The team was also given the top position in the East Coast Conference’s preseason coaches’ polls, which also selected senior defender Chelsea Donaldson as the Preseason Defensive Player of the Year.
Although the team lost four seniors in 2011, McNamara says she is not concerned. “We lost a great class,” she said. “But, the returners worked really hard in the offseason.”
These returners include key players like Donaldson, senior midfielder Lauren Spagnoletta, and 2011 ECC Rookie of the Year attacker Jackie Sileo, each of who was named IWLCA All-American in 2011, and 2010 All-American attacker Ashley Olen, who missed the 2011 season due to injury. The team will rely heavily on every player on the team in 2012, McNamara said. “We have a very balanced team…Everyone is an asset,” she stated, adding that the team has a great senior class along with strength all over the field.
“We’re excited for a good year,” the fifth-year Head Coach said.  After dominating Saint Anselm 16-5 in the team’s home opener on Friday, March 2nd, the Pioneers look strong. Their next test will come on March 11th, when the women host Southern New Hampshire at home on Hickox Field at noon.
