Former U.S. Congressman Steve Israel will be joining the LIU campus as Chair of the new Global Institute as well as a writer in residence, working with students who are interested in careers in writing books and media. The Democrat, who retired as the U.S. Representative for N.Y.’s third congressional district, after serving for 16 years, always found LIU Post to be a special place, calling it the “jewel of the district” that he represented. On campus, he held college affordability town meetings throughout his term along with a symposium on cyber defense.
Originally from Brooklyn, Israel’s interest in politics began when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Though he was only in fourth grade, the assassination brought him to “the notion of standing up for what you believe in, even at great risk.”According to Ballotpedia Israel attended Nassau Community College and Syracuse University before earning his B.A. at George Washington University in 1982.  Before running for office, Israel had his own small marketing company for small businesses and charity known as the Steve Israel Association. He began his career as a Town Councilman in Huntington. While holding that position, Israel constantly wrote. His first novel, “The Global War on Morris,” a political satire of Washington that has potential for the big screen, was published in Dec. 2014.
Israel was elected to Congress in 2000. He served through 9/11, the financial meltdown in 2008, Obamacare and the Iran nuclear deal. “I was able to travel the world as a member of Congress, trying to understand the complexity of global events and its impact on my neighbors at home,” Israel said. “[Representing New York] was the greatest honor of my life.”
Switching energies from politics to students is going to be a smooth transition for Israel, as he has had experience interacting with students. Considering that his district included many campuses, including LIU Post, NYIT and SUNY Old Westbury, the former Congressman has been able to interact with college students. LIU administrators have talked with Israel about teaching next fall, which is something that sparks his interest. “I don’t presume to show up on campus and suddenly believe I am qualified to teach,” Israel said. “Two different things I am interested in teaching are ultimately, the process of book writing and how Congress drives foreign policy- how foreign affairs are developed.” Within that, one of the things he loved most about Congress was seeing student run programs in remote areas of the world change the lives of others. “I am excited about teaching in that area.”
As Israel joins LIU, he will not be keeping partisan ties with the democratic party. He asked former colleagues to come to LIU with him and had recently received commitment to their joining him. Former colleagues will bring LIU the opportunity to talk and learn about foreign policy and intelligence matters. Israel is also looking to bring in global leaders to give students a better understanding of international challenges we have. “We live in the most volatile, uncertain and complex world in decades. What I want to do is help people understand the trends that seem to be gripping us in so many places,” he said.
Israel jokingly stated that the Global Institute will be located, “wherever we can find parking.” Dr. Jeff Belnap, Dean of LIU Global, is delighted Israel has agreed to provide leadership in founding LIU’s new Global Institute. “The perspective he has gained through his nearly twenty years of foreign policy experience in Washington will assist us to shape new international programing,” Belnap said. “This will also help the greater LIU community foster meaningful international connections through access to global leaders and high level discussions on politics, culture and media.” Representatives of the Political Science Department stated that they were not involved in the discussions regarding Israel’s joining LIU or his new position.

Early in January, undergraduate students attempting to access their LIU email accounts were unable to do so. Abagail Van Vlerah, dean of students, sent an email to students on Jan. 2 cryptically explaining that because “a file with undergraduate student information was inadvertently emailed to some LIU undergraduate students,” the university responded by “disabling access to my.LIU and implemented a password reset for all undergraduate accounts.” All student email accounts were disabled and had to be reset.
Van Vlerah did not state who “inadvertently” sent the file with undergraduate student information, what the file contained or how many LIU undergraduate students received the file. In her email, Van Vlerah stated that “only a limited number of recipients opened the [erroneously sent] email” and “no password, social security, credit card or bank information was disclosed.” Students also received the same message from Van Vlerah in a letter mailed to their homes notifying them that they needed to reactivate their school email accounts.
The deactivation of the LIU email accounts left many students concerned as to why they couldn’t log in or were not sent an email warning before the accounts were disabled. “The system shouldn’t have been down and we don’t even know if our personal information got compromised,” junior nutrition major, Alexi Stiliadis said.
Alexa Romano, a junior English major who had trouble logging into her account, posted an inquiry on Facebook asking if other students were having trouble logging in. “I personally found it frustrating not knowing ahead of time that they were deactivating our accounts. They should have been more aware of leaking private information,” she said.
In an effort to understand how a file with undergraduate student information could be inadvertently emailed to students, or why the disabling of all student emails was required in response, the Pioneer contacted computer science professor, Christopher Malinowski. Malinowski stated that although he doesn’t know how LIU servers are implemented, “emails often may contain context which are used to spread malware. It may be the case that the hosting email server may have been compromised, in which case accounts may be disabled in order to reconstruct the server base. Much of the rationale behind disabling accounts depends on the nature of the incident or intrusion.”
The university’s Vice President for Information Technology, George Baroundi, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the emailing of the file with undergraduate information or the university’s response of disabling student emails. Instead, he said that since this was not a technology breach, all questions should be referred to the dean of students. Van Vlerah responded to the Pioneer’s inquiries by re-sending her Jan. 2 email.
For further assistance with technical issues or questions, students may contact the IT Help Desk at IT@LIU.edu.

Dear Readers,
I would like to start by introducing myself. I’m the new co-editor in chief, Caroline Ryan. I’m a junior journalism major and I’m very excited to be taking on this role.
I think it is important as college students that we have an active voice on campus. After all, we spend most of our time here; why not write about the things on campus that are important to us? My goal is to make the Pioneer more interactive and useful for students. We want the Pioneer to be something every student can relate to. This semester, we are introducing student surveys in our Features section on an array of topics of interest.
Along with student surveys, we also are going to open our “Letters to the Editor” page to student, faculty, alumni and friends who would like to voice an opinion related to our campus. (Of course, we reserve the right to publish or not publish all letters to the editor, due to space constraints.) We are also going to have a new Post alumni corner. We envision this space as a place where alumni can submit letters, pictures, illustrations and articles. Also, where we can feature an “alumni of the week.”
We are hoping that opening up the paper to everyone will broaden the Pioneer’s readership, and make students excited to pick up the Pioneer on campus every Wednesday or read it each week at                   www.liupostpioneer.com. We welcome all students to contribute to our award winning paper.

As the Features Editor of your school newspaper, I would find it severely unjust if I did not take the time out to express to you, the reader, my appreciation and simply say- thank you. Thank you for making my articles in news, features, opinions, and arts & entertainment, a small part of your day. It has truly been an absolute pleasure to write for you while being a part of an award-winning college newspaper. As a senior who anticipates graduation in May with a Bachelor’s Degree in Broadcast-Journalism, this semester truly feels like none other. It’s an eerie sensation; the circle we call life is slowly cycling me out of our education system and into the “real world.” What waits for me in the real world? That is a question I cannot provide an adequate answer to. At 21 years old, all I can say is that we’ll have to wait and see.
However, as a senior on his way out, I would like to give you some advice to stick in your back pocket.  Whatever you decide to do in life, give it your all and do it with a purpose. Never make an excuse for yourself; hard work and an unbeatable work ethic come second to none.  You have to study, you have to practice, you have to work and you have to work hard. There is no force too great or powerful that can get in the way of your dreams.
In closing, here’s to a great semester. Suggestions for story topics, as well as student submissions, are always welcome. After all, this is your newspaper.

Over the last month, three large storage pods have been outside the Little Theatre, in the faculty parking lot. Those pods have been used to store costumes from the Little Theatre costume shop during the renovations of the shop. The renovations were prompted towards the end of the fall semester during a routine inspection on campus by the Nassau County Fire Marshall. The Fire Marshall’s inspection found that the clearance space from the ceiling to the shelves in the shop and the shop’s stock room was not up to code.
Professor and Costume Shop Manager, Jen Rice, said that in the past, growing stock forced them to add more pipes and shelves to the stock room, which eventually resulted in the space no longer being in compliance with the Nassau County Code. Since the required changes were so extensive, Rice and her team decided to go through with a full renovation for both the stock room and costume shop. “This was an opportunity to take a look at the room as a whole, and how we could improve the way we use the space,” she said. “It was decided that since we were going have to reconfigure a portion of the room, it would be greatly beneficial to redesign the entire space.”
From the beginning of December to just last week, the costume shop, which has costumes for every theatre and dance production that LIU puts together, was completely redone, as well as the stock room. Heather Drastal, general manager of the Post Theatre Company, said that the rooms are now updated with new flooring and light fixtures, and are much less cramped.
Rice designed the entire new space herself, modeling it after the TDF Costume Collection store in Astoria, New York. “With the new design, we get the ceiling clearance, and will now have a space that is specifically set up for what our stock has become,” she said.
Renovations began in early December, coinciding with the dance company’s tech week, which began on Dec. 5. Senior dance major, Jen O’Neill, pointed out that tech week is one of the busiest times of the year for both dance majors and the crew. The week requires an extensive and exhaustive set-up for five shows over one weekend.
The renovations continued during tech week because “the preliminary work was completed more quickly than we had anticipated, and we were glad to be able to begin the main part of the project sooner,” Rice said. “It didn’t interfere with tech.”
Due to the construction, all of the costumes from the shop that were not being used during the shows that week, as well as other materials from the stockroom, were stored in the pods outside of the theater. “Every single article of clothing had to be moved from the shop to the pods,” O’Neill said. Rice discussed a time during a show when they considered replacing an item  because it wasn’t specifically a dance-related garment however, the item was already in the pod. Since it would’ve been difficult to get out, the dancer just kept the original garment.
Working around the renovations, the dance crew was able to have a successful tech week and avoid any problems. “It opened my eyes to how much of a team effort our shows are,” O’Neill said. “Our thanks goes to the people who work hard behind the scenes to make things happen. With the help of Jen Rice, it was truly smooth sailing.”
The renovations are now complete, and everything is back to normal. The swiftness in which the renovations were completed was a “pleasant surprise” for Drastal, who said that everything seemed to go smoothly.
The pods were just emptied on Wednesday, and theater and costume shop are now back to fully functioning  running smoothly again, just in time for the beginning of the spring semester.

As spring semester begins, the members of the class of 2017 have diplomas on their mind. Upon completing their studies, students will walk across a stage located under a white tent on the lawn in front of Humanities rain or shine according to an email sent on Jan. 5 to potential grads.
Until May 2014, following the campus-wide commencement ceremony, the graduation was broken up into smaller ceremonies for each of the different colleges and schools. Graduates accompanied by their families were separated and walked to smaller tents around campus to receive their diplomas from the deans of their schools.
The rain or shine conditions have potential graduates feeling indifferent about their once in a lifetime ceremony. “Having graduation outside is both a good and bad idea,” senior marketing major, Sharon Sextus said. “Good because we have a beautiful green campus to shoot pictures but bad because we’re shielded by a tent. Plus, the ground isn’t leveled in a way everyone can view the graduation ceremony.” The outdoor graduation may prevent Sextus’ brother from watching her walk the stage as he is in a wheelchair and may not be able to get a close enough seat.
Nicole Ulrich will also be graduating this May, obtaining a degree in accounting. The second semester senior finds a college graduation outdoors to be bizarre; considering graduations she has attended have always been held in indoor arenas. “I think being outside as early as it is in the day and the season can cause a huge problem. Not only may it rain, it may still be cold.”
In the past, graduates were allowed to have as many people as they wished attend the ceremony. There have been no indications of a limit being applied this year. Though graduates are allowed unlimited guests, there is limited guest seating under the tent. Abby Van Vlerah, the dean of students, said, “This year, we have seating for nearly 7,000 people so families and friends of our graduates can take part in their great achievements. We also  have additional room in the Tilles Center.”  According to past viewers, the livestream is apt to skip and lag. “We are working to create a special, seamless livestreamed viewing.” Sextus feels that the university should consider holding the ceremony in Tilles as “guests will feel uncomfortable [outside] and that is not what LIU represents.”. Unfortunately, with only 2,242 seats in Tilles, the space would not fit both graduates and guests.
A rumor circulated that both LIU campuses, Brooklyn and Post, would possibly combine ceremonies at the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn. Similarly, graduation was planned to be combined for the class of 2013. However, according to a previous Pioneer article by Rebecca Martelotti, former President David Steinberg moved the ceremony back to campus for Post students after “many expressed a sense of loss, fearing that the LIU Post identity would be swallowed up in the larger [university-wide graduation] event.”
“I think combining graduations would make the ceremony too long,” Ulrich said. “I feel whether or not you know someone personally at graduation, you know that you went to Post together and with that, brings a sense of unity at the ceremony.” An email sent by the Commencement Office on Jan. 5 stated that the ceremony will remain on the Post campus.” The effort to unite all Post students in one ceremony has created an important feeling of unity and family as we send our graduates off to exciting new adventures and careers.” Van Vlerah said. “Hosting the event on campus is part of a proud tradition that aims to remind students, that as they make the transition from student to alumni, they will always have a place at LIU.”
The undergraduate ceremony will begin at 10 a.m. followed by the graduate, doctoral and dual candidate ceremony at 3 p.m. Both will take place in front of Humanities. To apply for graduation students need to log into their LIU accounts, go to “My Center”, click the drop down list under the “Academics” header and choose “Apply for Graduation”. Upon doing so, students should check the status of their graduation application by going to “Self Service – Degree Progress/Graduation.” All must be complete by Feb. 10.
