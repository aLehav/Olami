On Friday, April 15, starting at 5 p.m. the school will host its third annual Relay For Life event at the Pratt Recreation Center. One hundred percent of the proceeds raised will go to the American Cancer Society. The event is open to the public and is run through a student committee with the assistance of the Office of Campus Life.
Relay For Life is a 12-hour event that raises money for cancer research and patients. It is also an event to spread cancer awareness, remember those who have lost their fight, celebrate the lives of those who have battled cancer, and unite the Pioneer community in the fight against cancer.
“Teams of students, faculty, and staff participate in the all night long event,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, dean of students. “It’s a great time for the community to come together and fight for a good cause.”
The first lap at the event is known as the “Survivor Lap.” During this lap, all cancer survivors at the event take the first lap around the track, celebrating their victory over cancer while cheered on by the other participants, who line the track.
Some of the other activities at the event will include an opening reception, community walk, survivor and caregiver speeches, food, games, and music. “The evening is a high-spirited event that brings together our entire community, ” said Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life.
The university has raised $100,000 for the American Cancer Society in past Relay For Life events. Last year there were 70 teams and Post raised $53,000, according to Berthel. This year Post has already surpassed last year’s total and has 27 teams with 110 participants.
Everyone can be a part of the movement to end cancer: start a team, donate, or join the committee. Students who wish to get involved can visit www. relayforlife.org/liupost. There is a registration fee when you sign up for the event and then participants are encouraged to fundraise to raise more money for the campaign.

Patricia Mygas, a senior double major in art therapy and psychology, has made it halfway through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program application process, and is one step closer to going to Malaysia. Mygas has applied for the Fulbright teaching grant. She has already been recommended by the Fulbright committee, which includes a number faculty members, and is now waiting on approval from the country.
The Fulbright U.S. Student Program is the largest U.S. exchange program offering opportunities for students and young professionals to undertake international graduate study, advanced research, university teaching, and primary and secondary school teaching worldwide, according to its website. The program currently awards approximately 1,900 grants annually in all fields of study, and operates in more than 140 countries that students have an option of choosing from. Mygas has chosen to teach in Malaysia, where she will have the opportunity to work with children and adolescents, if approved. She applied for the grant in September 2015, and will be notified by April.
Mygas applied for the grant because she believes, “The Fulbright program gives individuals opportunities to not only see the world, but to actively engage in it.” She thinks that this will give her an opportunity unobtainable otherwise, not just the teaching aspect, but living in a completely different environment. Mygas is hopeful to add this experience to her resume on her way to graduate school for at therapy and counseling.
Over the last decade, Post has sent at least two students to the program, according to Glynis Pereyra, assistant dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Pereyra, along with Administrative Assistant Joan Ruckel, are Post’s resident advisors for the Fulbright. They are available to help advice students, and properly prepare for successful applications. LIU receives a range from zero to four applicants every year.
The grant covers living expenses, health, and travel to the host country, which can be adjusted based on the cost of living in the country.
To be considered for a grant, students are recommended to have a GPA of 3.5 and well-rounded experience. This can include hands-on experience outside of the classroom in their field. In addition, letters of recommendation and past travel history will help to build a solid application.
Although Mygas has applied for the teaching grant, the Fulbright offers other opportunities as well. There is a study grant which covers tuition for a master’s degree in a foreign country. Another option
is the Fulbright-Mtv-U award, which allows applicants to research and then produce their own film or project. Currently, applications for the Fulbright-mtv-u award are not being accepted, but will re-open for the 2016-17 academic year, according to us.fulbrightonline.org.
On Jan. 26, Pereyra and Ruckel held an information session to inform students of the Fulbright opportunity. Approximately 20 students attended. Next information session will be held in Kahn, room 121 at 12:30 p.m. on March 24. Students of all majors are welcome to attend.

Starting Feb. 5, Post students are being given the tools to help the community through the LIU Cares initiative.
President Kimberly Cline announced and briefly previewed the initiative in November 2015, during a lecture intended to bring the LIU community closer together.
Despite the service and volunteer work that is already happening within the LIU community, LIU Cares promises to facilitate the work. According to Dean of Students Dr. Abagail Van Vlerah, LIU Cares will help provide a more cohesive and united effort towards community service.
Upon the imminent launch of the LIU Cares website, students will have the option to either create their own community service project, or join a preexisting university effort. There is a volunteer option available for students unsure of what type of project they want to work on. This option can place students on campus or in areas in need of assistance on Long Island.
If students wanted to help underprivileged kids in city schools, this idea would have to be approved through the university first.
Students have a great amount of flexibility as far as what types of programs or community service efforts they can create. There is not a strict criteria to adhere to. There is, however, a vetting process for ideas, to ensure that the organizations are legitimate.
Jesse Agbotse, a junior health and science major, as well as a member of the Men’s Innovation Organization, looks to be a part of the LIU Cares program, and give back to the homeless by giving them gift cards. “We want to do this to not only promote our club, but also we want to go outside of the campus community to represent the school so people know who this club is, and what school we’re from,” Agbotse said. “[LIU Cares] is not intended to burden anyone,” Van Vlerah said.
“It’s not intended to be another step. It’s intended to just be a great way for us all to come together and show what we’re doing. We want to make it as seamless and easy as possible.”
One of the goals of the LIU Cares program is to establish a bigger community presence on Long Island, and show the generosity and philanthropic efforts of students. More specifically, the university hopes to be awarded with the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, Van Vlerah said. The university was awarded this honor in 2015.
Once the website is launched, it will feature a Relay for Life countdown, and a history of how much was earned. The website will also feature details of the various university philanthropy efforts, and how to get involved. Currently the website says LIUCares.org is “coming soon.” Students are encouraged to submit ideas through the LIU Cares website.
There is currently no way for students to individually check their community service hours, through an LIU login page or something similar to that. However, this is being considered for the future of the LIU Cares program. Technical issues notwithstanding, Van Vlerah believes that the ultimate goal is to “show that we have this collective power [and spirit] of community engagement, volunteerism and philanthropy.”
