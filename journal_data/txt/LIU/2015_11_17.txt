How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

The holidays are approaching, the semester is winding down, and cooler weather is on the way. With all the things people have to complain about this time of year, it’s surprising the biggest problem people seem to have is a Starbucks disposable coffee cup. People are in an uproar over the choice Starbucks made to not have a Christmas themed cup. Instead they chose a neutral red color.
Debated often in the news, on talk shows and many Tumblr blogs, most people are familiar with political correctness. Whether Starbucks was right in their choice of cup design, they have inadvertently brought political correctness to the front page.
In years past, images of snowmen, igloos, reindeer, and other festive imagery decorated the Starbucks seasonal cups. The uproar against the new cups derives from many Christians who feel that Starbucks is trying to remove Christmas from the holiday season.
Perhaps most prominently representing this position is self-proclaimed social media personality and American Evangelist Joshua Feuerstein. In his viral video, he said “Do you realize Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups?” and “That’s why they’re just plain red. In fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn’t allowed to say Merry Christmas to customers?” In protest, he told a Starbucks barista his name was “Merry Christmas” to force her to write it on the cup then say it out loud.
Around campus, it was hard to find many students who shared a similar opinion to Feuerstein. Most students were more concerned over the contents of their cup rather than the cup itself.
“When I first saw [the cups], I thought it was a really cool artistic take on a plain red cup because it starts from a darker shade of red and fades upwards,” said Logan Dewih, sophomore music and theater major. “Then I saw online that people are offended by it.” As a practicing Christian she feels that “our goal is to help those in need and not petty about cups.”
Perhaps the most hypocritical part of the entire argument is the fact that the word “Christmas” has not appeared on a Starbucks cup for the past 10 years. If one is to make the argument that Starbucks is taking Christmas off their cups, it must also be true that Starbucks once had the word “Christmas” on its cups at one point in time.
If you are still unsatisfied, you can look just about anywhere else in a Starbucks shop and find Christmas. Christmas Coffee blends, Christmas gift cards, and other products with Christmas printed on them can be found inside any Starbucks. Even a Christmas Cookie Latte exists on the menu.
Because of this, many students believe the argument isn’t even worth discussing. There are other things going on in the world right now that are much more important than a Starbucks cup. Sophomore acting major, Tamer Bolin said, “The fact is, I don’t think [Starbucks is] doing anything to attack Christians,” and that there is “…more actual news to be covered.”
With all the reasons to not be offended by Starbucks, why is it true that so many people are outraged over its cups? Maybe the real problem is not Starbucks, but the flawed society we live in. Maybe, political correctness has gone too far. I may be wrong in saying so, but I feel that many more people are feeling offended, than there are people seeking out to hurt others.
For example, a professor at Yale university emailed students saying that they should use common sense in picking out their Halloween costumes and if someone felt offended by someone’s costume, they should use it to start a dialogue with that person about why they feel that way. This sounds like a good idea, be smart in picking out a costume, and enlighten others as to why they may be offending others. Though I do not believe this professor sought out to hurt anyone, hundreds of students broke out into protest, videos of which have gone viral over the Internet.
Another recent viral video shows Students at Claremont McKenna College in California who are demanding a racially segregated “safe space” for “marginalized identities.” During the rally, an Asian woman shared a story where she was told “go back to your country” by an African American individual. Her point was to show that anyone could be racist, even other minorities and that “we must look at everyone individually.” Amazingly, the crowd thought this was wrong and embarrassed and silenced her. I do not understand how that sort of logic also promotes his or her own cause.
I feel that as a society, we have overcompensated for the lack of political correctness that existed in the early 1900s. As a result, we have lost sight of reality. We live in a world where we can’t be told to use common sense in choosing Halloween costumes, or suggest other minorities can be racist too without offending someone. It has gotten so bad, that even a cup without a few snowflakes on it is enough to offend many people.
I honestly do believe that most people are good, don’t discriminate, and do not mean to hurt or offend anyone, yet so many people constantly complain that someone or something is attacking them. The Starbucks red cup itself is not the problem, nor do I think they set out to offend Christians. The problem is how people reacted and how that reflects upon our society. The same problems are present in many other recent controversial topics, and it is important that we discuss these issues to help us improve as a society.

One of the perks of living on Long Island is having four seasons, which may be something that students might overlook as they spend most of their days inside classrooms or in the library. This semester, it seems as if fall doesn’t want to part ways, still providing us with warm and mild temperatures.
Long Island’s climate is influenced by its location on the Atlantic Ocean, allowing a moderately sunny climate. Because of its location in a transition zone between a humid subtropical climate classification and a humid continental climate, Long Island has cold and snowy winters, and warm and humid summers; in between those seasons we have spring and fall to adjust between the two extremes.
What season do students at Post prefer? Is it the blooming spring, the humid air-conditioned summer, the colorful crisp fall or the winter filled recently with snow days?
“Fall is my favorite season because it offers such a nice scenery; anywhere you look there is a pop of colors,” said TaeJin Jeong, a senior economics major. “I like fall the most because the air is not dusty. I have allergies so during summer and spring I struggle. So when fall comes, it’s such a relief. I do like winter too, but in comparison to fall, winters are too harsh and cold.”
Hanit Gluck, a senior English major agreed. “Fall is my favorite season because it so beautiful when the leaves are colorful, which makes you want to go outside. It might rain and the temperature gets cooler during fall here in New York. I especially like that [because] it reminds me of winter in Israel, where I’m from.”
Yet, other students choose summer. “Summer is my favorite season, because I feel freer. It’s a break from school and obligations,” said Brooke Matza, a sophomore with an undecided major. “I associate it with more events happening and more leisure time. I especially like the fact that the days are longer during summer.”
No matter what your favorite season is, fall is slipping away. If it happens to be your favorite season, try to look up from that book in the library and enjoy it while you can, because before you know it we’re on to the next one.

Thanksgiving is next week and students are looking forward to a couple of days off from classes to spend time with family or friends, and great food. After completing 11 weeks of the academic semester, a well-earned mini-break is upon us. For the holiday, many students seem to be looking forward to the Thanksgiving dinner.
The amount of food consumed during this holiday is massive. According to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 51,150,000 turkeys are consumed on Thanksgiving Day. The total amount of expenses for Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S is $2,875,000,000 and the average household spends approximately $56.18 on Thanksgiving dinner.
With the variety of food options during Thanksgiving dinner, what is the winner on the table, according to students? Is it the turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, corn bread or something else?
“My favorite thing to eat during Thanksgiving dinner is the turkey,” said Megan Draghi, a senior childhood education major. “Because it’s a once a year thing, it makes it more special. Thanksgiving is such a special holiday. It is my favorite because my family hosts it at our house and we usually have 20-25 people come over.”
Melissa Grossa, a senior early childhood education major, disagreed about the turkey. “I’m not a turkey person,” she said. “My favorite is the brown sugar sweet potatoes. In my family, ever since I can remember we’ve had it on our Thanksgiving table; it’s always been my favorite.”
Erin Gallagher, a senior health science major, had mixed emotions on picking out a favorite. “It’s a close call between the stuffing and sweet potatoes,” Gallagher said. “I don’t eat a lot of turkey so that one is definitely out. But ultimately, if I had to choose, it would be the sweet potatoes.”
Eric Birmingham, a junior health science major agreed. “Definitely thesweet potatoes. Nothing beats that.” No pun intended, get it? It seems as if the sweet potatoes won this round.
No matter how much you spend on Thanksgiving dinner or what you look forward to eating the most, students sure look
forward to a break to focus on food rather than exams and to recharge for the last weeks of the fall semester.

Post attracts a vast number of international students each year, particularly from Asia and Europe. But, the vast majority of the cultures in which these students come from, clearly do not celebrate the American tradition of Thanksgiving. So what do they do?
Ian Johnson, junior international studies major, is from Stockholm, Sweden. I asked him whether he has ever celebrated the holiday with his family and friends when he was back in Sweden and he said, “I have never celebrated Thanksgiving in Sweden, and neither does anyone else. It isn’t a holiday that we partake in.”
I carried on to ask Johnson whether he had celebrated it in America when he moved to the East Coast last year, “I celebrated it last year with my five housemates in our house in Hicksville. It was such an amazing meal cooked by one of the boys and we sat down together and ate as a family, with all the traditional food which the Americans would usually have…apart from the red cake,” he said. “It was my job to make the stuffing, and, to be completely honest, I do not possess the culinary skills, which Gordon Ramsey may have, but I thought I had done a pretty good job—the boys weren’t as positive,” Johnson added.
Many Scandinavian and British students who are on sports teams and live in off campus housing, tend to cook for themselves with their house mates; however senior MBA student Sebastian Baxter, from Saffron Walden, Essex, England, spent his 2014 Thanksgiving with a friend who attends Boston University.
“I went to see a mate from home (England) who I have been friends with for years. He invited me up to spend it with him and his friends’ family, which was just lovely,” Baxter said. “My friends’ friend who also goes to BU, was American, so I really got a full American experience of Thanksgiving!”
Many students such a Baxter, who are from overseas countries, do the same, and spend Thanksgiving with an American: maybe with a professor, a friend or colleague, or someone else they have met since making the trip over the pond.
Students who stay on campus for Thanksgiving also have an option to not spend the beloved holiday by themselves. Last year, the school chapel offered a full thanksgiving meal for a small fee. However, this year, Father Ted, the front man for the whole operation has sadly left the university. Therefore, SGA have teamed up with campus life and the associate dean, Jean Anne Smith, to build upon the legacy he left
behind.On Thanksgiving this year, there will be a continental breakfast in the chapel from 10-12, for all students. At noon there will be a religious service ‘of thanks’, followed by Thanksgiving dinner in the Winnick Gold Coast Room.
To pay for the services throughout the day of Thanksgiving, the SGA and Campus Life split the funding with the Newman club, who helped fund the event last year, and is now spearheading the advertisement across campus.
“We are very proud of our involvement in planning these events,” said Adam Hornbuckle, vice president of the SGA, and sophomore political science major. “On behalf of the student government we would like to wish all Post students a happy Thanksgiving.”
 
Schedule:
Wednesday November 25, 2015:
Hillwood Commons Café – 8 am to 5 pm – All other retail operations will be closed.
Thursday November 26, 2015:

Math professor Sheldon Rothman looked around at the fundraiser plant sale at Parkway Elementary School in Plainview, N.Y. It was Valentine’s Day 1993, and Rothman told himself he had to buy a gift for his then 2-year-old daughter.
“And so I did, for 50 cents,” he said, describing a tiny cactus plant not reaching over an inch at the time. Over the past 22 years the cactus— “He” as his daughter, Alyssa, named it—grew taller and became more than just a dining room decoration. He was part of the Rothman household. But, in “He’s” teenage years complications started to arise.
“He” was growing uncontrollably; Rothman mentioned that he had to keep replanting the cactus “until ‘He’ began ruining my floor.” No windows in the house were tall enough for it to get sufficient sunlight, and so during summer time “He” was placed outside.
For some, that solution worked better. “My mom wasn’t thrilled with how ‘He’ looked in the living room,” Alyssa Rothman said, remembering the one time her mother decided to leave the cactus out as the colder fall breeze approached. “I kept asking her to please bring the cactus inside because I was worried about him not being able to survive the winter,” she added.
The request was granted; Rothman said this type of cactus isn’t to be left outside when the temperature falls below 50 degrees.
But, transporting a now 9-feet tall, hedgehog-like plant was easier said than done. “You know what this weighs? Like 200 plus [lbs]. And if you touch him…” Rothman left the rest to imagination. “I couldn’t even get him out the door anymore. So we wrapped him and wheeled him outside,” he said.
The family realized the house could no longer accommodate the plant, so Rothman declared the cactus a donation. Having worked in the mathematics department since 1979, Rothman pulled some strings, and found the perfect climate at the university greenhouse.
The greenhouse is used to run botany experiments as part of the Biology department, Rothman said. The greenhouse caretaker, Biology professor Kent Hatch, gladly accepted the donation, although transporting the cactus still required some innovation.
With some strong hands—among those a pair from the 210 lbs baseball team player, Dillon Burke—, a borrowed backboard, some plastic wrap, duct tape, and a hand truck, the 10-mile route from the Rothman’s in Plainview to the greenhouse at Post became successful a couple of months ago. “We wrapped him like a mummy, and lifted him into the car like a patient,” Rothman said. “[Kent Hatch], and my wife Kathleen, actually helped me to wheel the cactus from my car to the greenhouse,” Rothman said, “and then to help set it up inside.”
Once planted, however, the cactus no longer required much work. “Basically, well, he’s a cactus, give him a little water now and then, not too much, and he’s fine,” Rothman said.
He admits it has been a learning process since the very beginning. “I don’t know anything about it,” he said. “Apparently he’s a euphorbia cactus, but there are different varieties of it. I don’t know what we can do when it grows too tall.”
Yet, there seems to be a deeper sentimental importance to the vegetation other than just stunning those who come to visit.
“You know the kids don’t live at home now,” Rothman said. “My daughter graduated three years ago, still in school but doesn’t live home; my son is a senior in college but lives in Florida. It’s a memory; it has special value in a sense… this connection to my daughter.”
The plant might be gone, but the family has not fully let go of “He.” Rothman visited a plant place and was told how to cut off a piece, to replant an offshoot called “Baby Cactus,” a 4-month-old measuring about 16-inches, which he keeps at home.
“You see these arms sticking out here?” Rothman said, pointing at the 9-feet tall creation in the humid greenhouse. “Well, the new guy has got some bulges right on the sides. It seems to be getting its very first arm now.”
Nostalgic, Rothman admits the cactus has become like a person, and now the new kid needs nursing. “In 22 years, I’ll be kind of old,” he said. “But maybe my daughter will take him for a while and see hers going.”
To Alyssa Rothman, that plan already seems to be in the works, “Someday I want to bring baby cactus to visit cactus in the greenhouse.”

Head Copyeditor
“The Museum of Lost Things” is a film adaption of Dr. Dennis Pahl’s short story entitled, “The Museum of Lost Things,” which has not yet been published. Pahl, an English professor, along with multiple Post Alumni such as Gregory Cioffi, Rob LaRosa, Marc Riou, Sheere Campbell, and a couple of other crew members who did not attend LIU Post, contributed to the production of the film adaption. Gregory Cioffi, who graduated Post with a B.F.A. in elementary education as well as a M.S. in English education and a M.A. in theater acting, directed the film, in addition to writing the screenplay.
The original short story revolves around the main character that narrates his experiences after discovering a museum of lost things that contains pieces of his forgotten past. He not only enters a museum of his past, but approaches rooms that depict previous moments in his life from the room of lost umbrellas, the room of lost hair, and even a room of lost friends. The rooms contain the literal elements of what are in its titles.
Pahl toys with the idea that this museum of lost things does not only have to be the physical lost object in the character’s life. “I just imagined if all the things you’ve ever lost could be found, you begin to think of what if you imagined rooms that contain not only lost objects but lost circumstances, lost friendships, lost love, lost illusions,” he said. Thus, the character confronts a room of lost love, in addition to several other metaphorical moments of his past, designated to each specific room.
“The Museum of Lost Things,” was never originally supposed to be a film. Yet, because Cioffi kept a relationship with Pahl upon graduation, creations like this were inevitable. “He would often send me his writing; especially the published ones,” Cioffi said. “One day he sent me a story he wrote, ‘The Museum of Lost Things,’ I thought it was very original, very creative, and that I have never read anything like it. I saw cinematic potential in it.” Cioffi began to write the screenplay, which resulted in the development of the plot expanding, with the addition of new characters and themes, while maintaining the core of the story.
“Sometimes things need to change from one medium to another when doing an adaption,” Cioffi said. He then introduced his screenplay to a company called The Majors Production, which was cofounded by several Post Alumni including Rob LaRosa, who has a degree in film, in addition to Marc Riou.
“The script was brought to our attention by Greg to helm the production and post-production aspects and that’s how it all started,” LaRosa said. Similar to what Cioffi felt about the short story, LaRosa felt the script was enticing as well, “I thought the script was very original, which was what drew me to this project,” LaRosa said.
In addition to the medium change between the written story and the film, location also played a role in production, influencing different scenes and adding several details that were not originally in the short story or the screenplay. The scenes in the film were shot in several locations including parts of Long Island, New Jersey, and New York City. The diner scene was shot at a diner near the LIU Post campus, and was very welcoming once the owners learned that the crew members were affiliated with LIU Post, according to Cioffi.
Long Island University gave liberty to the production crew as well, and allowed them to film on several parts of the campus: The Winnick House, known as C.W. Post Mansion, and the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library. “We were very lucky, they were very accommodating at Post. Rita Langdon who is the Activities Coordinator, gave us free access to the Winnick House, the Great Hall, The Hunt Room, the Pratt Center, and the Library,” Pahl said.
In one specific scene, the protagonist is supposed to be deep underground; nevertheless, they felt that the shot would look best on the second floor of the Winnick House. They were unable to completely cover all of the windows on the second floor corridor, so one specific window that held the C.W. Post logo remained uncovered.
“He walks passed that group of display cases and he sees a window afterwards, and it’s supposed to be deep underground, how could there be a window with light shining in?” Pahl said. Cioffi decided to incorporate this factor into the movie to give it a sense of surrealism. The remaining window that shines light in this scene enhances the abstract qualities the protagonist undergoes and leaves a profound question of what is real and what is not.
The library on campus also influenced the plot in one particular scene. The premise of the scene is the protagonist walking down the street before stumbling upon a door that leads the character into the museum. The scene is shot in Hoboken, N.J., a place Pahl found to be a surreal image in itself. “it was a very surreal cobble stone street,” Pahl said.
From there, the protagonist finds himself in a building. That is when Cioffi decided to film inside the library on campus. “He is staring down this staircase, he looks into this abyss,” Pahl said. However, to continue the scene, Cioffi and Pahl, discovered that one of the staircases in the library led to a wall, due to change in construction plans when the library was built.
“This whole scene was not in this story at all; the location that you use forces you to change the story in order to enhance the atmosphere,” Pahl said. Cioffi utilized this wall to his advantage and incorporated a scene of nervousness that displays the protagonist desiring to retreat from the staircase. Ultimately he turns to leave and the wall on top of the staircase prevents him from doing so, evidently forcing him to continue his journey.

Ultimately he turns to leave and the wall on top of the staircase prevents him from doing so, evidently forcing him to continue his journey.
However, the availability of all of these locations formed a road block in the beginning of filming. “The issue of course became [that] some of the locations and what days [they were available] conflicted with the other days that we could do,” Cioffi said.
The cast and crew had to coordinate specific times for availability, due to their own personal schedules, in hopes that they would match the availability of the locations. “Between 20 people, the cast and crew, all
of these schedules had to coincide with the locations,” Cioffi said. Luckily, that problem became diluted once everything fell into place. “Once everything was set, I knew we were good to go, the production itself went so smoothly,” he said.
To help post-production move forward to the editing process, Pahl’s team decided to develop a Kickstarter campaign, a fundraising page that helps raise money for artists, filmmakers, and many more. Apart from the Kickstarter page, Dr. Pahl himself funded a large portion of the film. Moreover, the actors and actresses gave their services for free. “Actors donated their time and effort…they thought the story was so compelling, and they thought the screenplay that Greg wrote was so great.” Pahl said.
“The Museum of Lost Things,” received a lot of publicity due to it being the editors pick of the week. “Everyone on set has been involved in Kickstarters but this was the first time they experienced the film being the editors pick…I think the combination of us getting a nice hit in the beginning after the first few days made an impact money wise,” Cioffi said.
“The Museum of Lost Things,” is supposed to premiere in the late spring or summer on the LIU Post campus. Not only does the film contain comedy, there are hints of drama, love, and mystery that coincide with it in a harmonized manner. “The great thing about ‘The Museum of Lost Things’ is that it bridges a bunch of genres,” LaRosa said. “It’s one part a fantasy of a man’s journey, but its also a comedy at times, and a love story in another vein,” he added.
Pahl believes that it will attract “anyone who would like a zany comedy. A Wes Anderson type of audience, people who like cutting edge cinema.” Pahl’s goal is to enter the film in a local North Shore film festival as well as major film festivals such as Tribeca and Sundance. “People connected to this really think we have something very special on our hands,” Pahl said.
There are about 20 days left of the film’s Kickstarter campaign. All donations received will go towards the editing process of the film if the production reaches their goal of $7,000. Unless they reach their goal within this time frame, all the money raised will have to be refunded.

Academy-Award nominated “Supersize Me” filmmaker Morgan Spurlock visited LIU Post on Nov. 9 for “An Evening with Morgan Spurlock” – including a screening of his latest short documentary “Crafted” and a talk moderated by film critic, Bill McCuddy. The event was part of the Gold Coast International Film festival,
which collaborated with LIU Post to screen select events and present Spurlock with the 2015 Artist of Distinction Award in Film.
“Crafted” is a film about three separate groups of artisan: knife-makers, potters and restaurateurs whose passion for their craft guides their lives. This 25 minute short film fits amongst Spurlock’s large body of work, which includes, in addition to “Supersize Me,” CNN’s “Inside Man” and Showtime’s “7 Deadly Sins.” Spurlock discussed at length is philosophies as a filmmaker, taking photos and talking with students and filmgoers before and after the event.
The film was funded by Haagen Dazs, but Spurlock attests to the fact that it does not show the ice cream brand anywhere in the film, nor is it overtly promotional in that regard. Spurlock’s film “Pom Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold” lampooned the ways in which corporate sponsors rule our lives, yet he feels that big money can work hand in hand with artistry.
“I’m all for branded content if brands get out of the way, where there is an alignment of ideology, not to just hawk product,” he said. “It’s like the early days of television, let’s create content that is compelling. Then there is a place for brands.”
Given the amount of aspiring filmmakers and students in attendance, Spurlock was bound to provide advice regarding the craft, and what students could do to start their career. “Get an internship, work at a film festival,” said Spurlock.
“My first film [I worked on “Leon: The Professional”] with Natalie Portman (she was Natalie Hershlag then). Get an internship. When you get out di as many things as you can, when you’re in your twenties, try it all. Lighting, sound, boom op, grip. Find the place that makes you happiest, while you’re in schoolwork on others’ films. You want to work and love what you do. The minute it’s not fun, you shouldn’t be doing it. “
Spurlock is currently developing a new project – a documentary about, of all things, rats in New York City and urban areas. “I’m a horror fan,” he explained. “I wanted to do makeup special effects – make a guy’s head explode. I wanted to make a horror documentary, a documentary that is just as scary.”
Regarding his films that are already released, Spurlock is very lax with his viewers, as long as the films are seen. The important thing, to him, is to spread the message of the film. “As a doc movie maker, I am pro piracy,” Spurlock said, laughing and to applause. “If you are going to steal my documentary and show it to friends, God bless you. Steal them all. But see them first at a festival, then steal them.”

“Fallout 4,” which was released on Nov. 10, is the newest entry in the long-running video game series dating back to 1997. The games in the series include “Fallout,” “Fallout 2,” “Fallout 3,” “Fallout: New Vegas.” and now “Fallout 4.”
Each game takes place in post-apocalyptic America, where the world has been devastated by nuclear warfare. The country is one giant wasteland filled with both mutated creatures and normal, well… “normal” people. The series includes the existence of underground vaults and the style of 1950s America, permeated throughout the games with 1950s rock and roll songs and billboards advertising new technologies.
Each “Fallout” game is a role-playing game, or RPG. RPGs allow players to create their own character and play the game how they see fit. Each game since “Fallout 3” on, has been an open world game. Open world games take place across vast maps and allow players to do whatever they want, from completing every mission or just exploring the map. Every “Fallout” game also takes place in a different part of America. “Fallout 3” took players to the ruins of Washington D.C., while “Fallout: New Vegas” transported players to the Mojave Desert.
In “Fallout 4,” the action shifts back to the northeast in post-apocalyptic Boston. After a short prologue above ground where you create your character and assign skill points, nuclear war begins and your protago nist and family journey underground to Vault 111. After several events transpire, your character awakens 200 years in the future and has to journey out into the wasteland to search for your family.
Throughout the wasteland, players will encounter colorful characters and fearsome creatures. One of the first characters encountered is a dog that will become one of several companions players can recruit. Other companions include the robot Codsworth, the ghoul John Hancock, and the Super Mutant Strong. Some of the creatures that populate the ruins of Boston include Deathclaws, Radscorpions, and ghouls.
In “Fallout 4,” Bethesda Game Studios, who created and developed the game, has implemented many changes that push the game in new directions. One of the changes to “Fallout 4” is the ability to play as a male and female character. Previously, you could only play as a male, but this change allows players to experience the game in a different way. “Fallout 4” also adds a crafting component where hundreds of weapons and whole settlements can be crafted.
Despite the many changes, “Fallout 4” is not a perfect game. There are some glitches present, such as dialogue subtitles not changing, and an infinite money glitch. The game can lag at some points, which Bethesda has started to fix with several updates to the game in the form of online patches. The shooting also takes some getting used to since the shooting mechanics were revamped to feel more fast paced and accurate like most first-person shooters.
Despite these minor annoyances, “Fallout 4” is still a great game. If players can look passed these few flaws, they will find a rich world filled with hundreds of hours of game play and a great cast of characters. “Fallout 4” is for players who enjoy the “Fallout” series, RPGs, and action games. Players who do not like strong violence or RPGs may not enjoy “Fallout 4.”
“Fallout 4” is and is available now at any major electronic store and online for $60.

This past weekend, the Post Theater Company began it’s showing of William Shakespeare’s, “Twelfth Night.” Opening night took place on Friday, Nov. 13 in the Little Theater. Nicole A. Watson, a freelance director that likes to focus on new plays and devised work, directed the show.
“We’ve been preparing since the second week of October, which is actually a shorter process than normal,” said Hailey Mickulas, a senior musical theater major, who carried out the role of the dramaturg, which is a position within the creative team that deals with research and development of the play. “We had a three-day paper tech and then we put the show right up on its feet and we were able to go into the space right away, which was great,” she said.
Mickulas said that the cast was very well prepared and thanks to that, it was off book by the second week of their rehearsal time. “The show has so much energy and the cast is amazing and it’s a predominately senior cast,” she said. “There are only two people that aren’t seniors, so just that drive as that last show that they might possibly be in was totally present there and everyone brought all of their training with them and I couldn’t be more proud of them.”
To receive a role in the play, students had to go through an audition process that takes place during the semester, according to Kelsey D’Andrea, a senior in musical theater major who played Sir Andrew in the play. “For fall shows, we go in an audition process in the spring and then we find out the cast listing in the summer,” she said. “You get your scripts in the summer to start working on it for the fall.”
D’Andrea said that preparing for the show wasn’t too hard thanks to their director. “She is really great, she is kind of like a teacher more than a director so if we were ever confused she was really good at guiding us into what to do,” she said. “Also, it’s a bunch of seniors and a couple others so they have all been very supportive, so it’s been a pretty easy ride if we needed help they were always there.”
Regarding memorization of the lines from Shakespearean language, D’Andrea said that it wasn’t as hard as some people think. “It’s really like Shakespeare means what he says so if you just really say the words and know what you’re saying then the audience is going to know what they are saying too,” she said. “Just have fun with it, he is a funny dude.”
Paige Espinosa, a senior musical theater major, played Viola, one of the lead roles in the play. “It’s been such a fast process, that between memorizing lines and trying to actually make a show it’s been so quick that the opening night came and we were just standing backstage like ‘it’s here, this is actually happening’,” she said.
Espinosa had done a piece that involved a bit of Shakespeare before, but much like D’Andrea, this was her very first full length Shakespeare show to act in. “We haven’t done a Shakespeare [play] here in forever. I think we did one a year before our freshman year,” said D’Andrea. “So now it’s kind of like the right students at the right time so they went from that,” she added.
Espinosa claims that it took her some time for everything to start to make sense. “I feel like I didn’t really know what I was doing until I got the costume on and I was on the set,” she said. “I was like ‘ok things are making sense now’ but it took that too really kind of push it.”
“Twelfth Night” is, Espinosa’s favorite Shakespearian play, so she was pretty familiar with the show. “In reality this is my absolute dream role and I never thought I’d get to play it so soon,” she said. “So seeing how great the reception has been it feels quite amazing. I didn’t know what to expect, to be honest, but people have been so supportive it’s unreal.”
Opening night and the rest of the shows for the weekend have been quite a success for the cast. “I am really proud of everyone, it’s been really great and it’s been really great to do this with the senior class and with our other friends,” said D’Andrea. “It’s been a very successful and we think we overcame and obstacle that a lot of people probably thought we couldn’t do, but its been really great and its been really rewarding.”
The play will continue to play this weekend, at 8 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 18 and on Saturday, Nov. 21, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 22 in the Little Theater.

Seeking revenge after suffering a 30-28 loss one week ago to the same Bentley team, the Pioneers got the last laugh as they upended their opponent 34-20 in Bentley’s backyard on Saturday, Nov. 14. Two touchdowns by red-shirt junior wide out Shane Hubbard in the final quarter-plus, which included a 92-yarder, propelled the Green and Gold to their seventh win of the season.
The opening quarter, which saw three trips to the end zone, concluded with the Pioneers on top on the scoreboard, 14-7. Junior tailback David White crossed the goal line in both occasions, capping off drives of 73 and 72 yards respectively. White shredded the Bentley defense in the first quarter, totaling 78 yards on just four carries. The two White touchdowns were sandwiched between a Bentley score off a Pioneer turnover. With under five minutes in the first half, the Pioneers got that turnover back and capitalized when red- shirt freshman running back Malik Pierre rushed the ball in from three yards out, giving the visitors a 20-10 lead.
After the break, the Pioneers let their foot off the gas and Bentley got themselves back into the game. Back-to-back scoring possessions by Bentley evened up the score at 20, and also unleashed Hubbard, who turned out to be the game changer. Hubbard’s two touchdowns in the second half gave his team a 14-point lead, which they protected, in route to the hard fought victory.
Junior quarterback Jeff Kidd aired it out for 284 yards and two touchdowns, both to Hubbard, who totaled 150 yards exactly and two touchdowns. On the ground, White ran for 124 yards and two scores while Kidd added 60 yards himself. Defensively, junior linebacker Nate Feliz lead the squad in tackles with 16 while red-shirt junior defensive back Kareem Folkes pitched in with 12 tackles of his own and a tackle for a loss.
The Pioneers season has come to an end, but a majority of their starters on both sides of the ball are returning. Some seniors include Sean Binckes, Mike Sollenne, Jhaleel Oswald, and Brandon Cheney.

After a slow start to their season opener, the Pioneers suffered a loss to Pace University by a score of 71-56. In their Saturday, Nov. 14 matchup, the team got out of the gate sluggish and found itself in a double-digit hole in the first 10 minutes. Pace used that momentum from the opening minutes and carried it with them into the second quarter.
At halftime, LIU was staring at a 41-18 deficit. Needing some kind ofspark to ignite the offense, the jump shots began to fall as the Pioneers cut the 23-point lead down to 18. Their hot shooting continued into the fourth quarter and a 7-0 run early gave the Green and Gold a glimmer of hope; but it was all for not.
Pace settled down and made clutch shots to keep their lead safe. For the Pioneers, freshman guard Kyla Formey had a team-high 17 points to go along with eight rebounds while senior guard Quanisha Ratley added 14 points. Fellow senior, Nyasia Davis, added nine points and a presence in the paint with two blocks.
The Pioneers sought their first victory of the season against Adelphi University the next day. In that battle, the Pioneers suffered a similar fate, losing a tightly contested game 63-55. Adelphi, who had the lead
for a majority of the game, shot a higher percentage from the field, but kept LIU in the game thanks to turnovers. The Pioneers, who scored 17 points of those turnovers, got big help from their bench, which totaled 21
points. The game came down to the final minutes, but Adelphi was able to execute down the stretch and nail free throws to put the game away. The Pioneers were led in the scoring department by junior forward Janaysia James who poured in 18 and also grabbed seven boards. On the other side of the ball, junior forward Sierra Clark had a game-high 27 points along with three steals while graduate guard Ashley Gomez totaled 16 points and led the team in assists with five.
The Pioneers will search for their first win of the season when they travel to Philadelphia to play Holy Family University on Saturday, Nov. 21. Opening tip is scheduled for 2 p.m.

Looking to end their season on a high note in front of their fans at the Pratt Recreation Center, the Pioneers did so with three straight wins. They clinched an ECC Tournament spot on Thursday, Nov. 12, when they dismantled Mercy College 3-0.
In that match, senior setter Monica Amador and freshman outside hitter Rachel Londot led the attack with 10 kills apiece. Already having secured a bid to the tournament, the Green Machine wasn’t satisfied with just that. In their first match against Queens College on Saturday, Nov. 14, the Pioneers picked up where they left off and didn’t surrender a single set victory.
After sweeping away Queens College, the Pioneers had a short break and returned to the court a few hours later to play Southern Connecticut State. The combination of Londot and Amador teamed up again to lead their squad to another victory. Londot had a match-high 16 kills to go along with eight digs while Amador amassed 11 kills, five digs, and two blocks.
The Pioneers and Head Coach Shellane Ogoshi finished the regular season with the no. 4 seed and will face the University of Bridgeport, who are ranked no. 1, on Friday, Nov. 20, in Connecticut in the first round of the ECC Championship.

On Saturday, Nov. 14, the men’s basketball team (2-0) tipped off the 2015-16 campaign with a 71-55 triumph over the University of the Sciences in the Delaware Express Tip-off Tournament at the Jones College Center in Wilmington, De.
Junior forward Greg Dotson led the team in scoring and recorded a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds. Dotson also recorded three blocks and three steals to his stat-line. Senior guard Dillon Burns looked sharp in his 24 minutes off the bench, collecting 12 points, seven assists and three steals. Burns and Dotson also knocked down two treys apiece from downtown.
After surrendering 12 unanswered points heading into halftime, the Pioneers lost all momentum. The Devils extended their lead to 10 in the third quarter, 38-28, before the Pioneers finally came alive.
A 36- 12 onslaught put the Green and Gold in front for good as they cruised to their first victory of the season. During the stretch run, Dotson came up clutch, tallying eight points. Senior guard Akosa Maduegbunam also provided a spark off the bench during the run with a key three-pointer.
LIU was sharp from behind the three-point line throughout the game, shooting over 47 percent. Junior guard Jared Hall, Dotson and Burns each drained two three-pointers. The University of the Sciences struggled as they shot just 28 percent from the field and were outscored by the Pioneers in nearly every category.
LIU’s bench was outstanding; scoring 32 points with Burns’ 12 leading the pack. Senior forward Michael Phillip also chipped in with seven points, seven boards and a game- high five blocks in just 19 minutes of action.
Coach Smiles and his LIU squad returned to the floor in Wilm- ington on Sunday, Nov. 15, where they edged out Goldey Beacom College 79-72, improving their record to 2-0 on the season.
After leading 40-33 heading into the locker room, the Pioneers found themselves in a tightly contested game as the injury-plagued Lightning fought hard and gave the visitors a run for their money. Freshman guard Corey Taite canned a trey for the Lightning bringing them within one of the Pioneers. However, Hall threw a wrench in the hopes of a comeback for Goldey Beacom when he converted a four-point play after making a three and sinking the foul shot, giving LIU a 73-68 edge late in the contest.
On the following possession, Hall, the Tournament’s Most Valuable Player, dropped in two free throws putting the game to bed. Hall’s performance was highlighted with 26 points, six steals and five rebounds. Dotson earned another double-double scoring 16 points and grabbing 10 boards. Traite and junior guard Shakeem Wilson each posted 17 points for the Lightning, but it wasn’t enough as the Pioneers survived a late-game scare.
The Pioneers will host the LIU Post Thanksgiving Classic this weekend where they will open up play against Post University on Saturday at 3:15 p.m. This matchup is one of several being held over the weekend at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y.

The 12th ranked and second-seeded men’s soccer team defeated Wilmington University, who was ranked no. 6, by a score of 6-0 to advance to the third round of the NCAA Division II Championship. The Pioneers were led by a goal midway through the first half and a four goal half in the latter stanza.
In the 23rd minute, still with no goals for either team, junior back Joey Forgaard got the action going with a header off a corner kick from senior midfielder Matais Ruiz. That goal came just six minutes before the next tally from LIU. This time, the Pioneers were awarded a penalty kick and graduate midfielder Tom Bowen converted, giving his team a two-goal lead.
In the second half, it was more of the same from the Pioneers, as four more goals were added, compared to none for Wilmington. Goals via sophomore winger Oliver Hollingseater, sophomore midfielder Harry Pearse, junior forward Johann Kristjansson, and the aforementioned Ruiz made it a safe bet to put this match on the left side of the ledger for LIU.
The Green and Gold were the aggressors, outshooting their opponent at a clip higher than 4-1. Wilmington totaled just five shots against a stout Pioneer defense. Of those five shots, none
of them were on target, giving junior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom an easy day between the pipes. It was his 13th win of the season and his fifth shutout.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his team are back in action on Saturday, Nov. 21, when they play top-seeded Southern New Hampshire University. Their opponent, ranked third in the nation, suffered only one loss the entire season and hasn’t allowed a goal in five matches. The Pioneers, who are battle tested, are riding high though. They have notched 15 goals in their last three games to just two goals. And LIU also has only lost once since Sept. 11.
The two powerhouses will lay it all on the line on in West Virginia on Thursday, Nov. 19, in the third round of the NCAA Division II Tournament.

Trailing to fourth seeded Roberts Wesleyan College with less than 10 minutes left in the contest, senior forward Susanne Vistnes connected with freshman forward Andrea Huntzinger and Huntzinger tied the game in the 84th minute, saving the Pioneers season for the moment. With the score dead even at one, overtime would be needed and neither side was able to connect, so the match would be decided on penalty kicks.
In the shootout, the two sides traded goals in the first two rounds before junior midfielder Julia Backman converted and then Roberts Wesleyan missed wide right, giving LIU the upper hand. With a chance to win and send her team to the next round, senior midfielder Morgan Miller beat the keeper.
After their high against Roberts Wesleyan, the Pioneers had more business to take care of against top-seeded University of Bridgeport on Sunday, Nov. 15. A lone goal in the 89th minute by Ariana Weingrad sent the Pioneers home earlier than they had hoped. The sophomore midfielder fired a shot outside the box and found the back of net, sending her team to the next round.
The Pioneers were never really able to get their offense going, as they managed a measly three shots on goal. The Pioneers, who finished their season on Sunday, ended their 2015 campaign with a 14-4-3 record.

LIU Post is home to over 600 international students, according to the office of International Admissions. This makes Post ideal to be one of the many schools across the country to participate in International Education Week, which started on Monday, Nov. 16, and runs through Thursday, Nov. 19.
International Education Week is an annual initiative between the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education that provides an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide, according to the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. IEW began in 2000, and is celebrated in 100 countries.
Earlier in the week each residence hall represented a different culture, and reflected it with decorations, and corresponding food. On Tuesday, the office of Study Abroad organized an event in the End Zone, where students were able to inquire about study abroad courses.
On Wednesday, at 5 p.m., geography professor, Mark Pires will be discussing ecotourism in the Great Hall. Ecotourism is traveling responsibly to areas in a way that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.
Pires plans to use his student trips to Tanzania as an example. “I will focus on how safari tourism to places such as Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park affects the park’s natural environment, such as its flora and fauna(wild life), as well as the economic well-being of local communities living along the borders of the park,” he said.
Pires, who has been around the world for both academic and personal reasons, believes “International learning not only helps us to learn about other countries and cultures, [but also] about how our society is seen by other people outside the United States.” Pires has participated in several IEW events at Post over the years, and continues to do so because he believes it gives students a chance to celebrate our diverse campus.
On Thursday, IEW will conclude with a resume building and career branding workshop led by Assistant Dean of the College of Management, Ray Pullaro. The event will be held at the Patrons Lounge in the Tilles Center at 12:30 p.m. The focus of the event is for students who are either international students or have studied abroad, to learn how to use their experience an asset moving forward. In the atrium of Tilles Center, the campus cultural clubs will be in attendance promoting their clubs, for those who have not studied abroad.

On Friday, Nov. 13, the world came to a halt after watching the horror of eight ISIS terrorists, who coordinated multiple attacks throughout Paris, killing 129 people and wounding 352 other innocent civilians. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for this horrific act of terror.
François Hollande, the French President, declared the attack as “an act of war.” He also stated that France will use extreme force toward counter terrorism against ISIS and its component society in France and outside the country. France is currently targeting ISIS with the U.S. coalition, not only in Syria and Iraq but also against Islamic extremists.
This provoked attack may be related to 9/11, which George W. Bush similarly claimed was an “act of war.” This may be the scintilla that again immerses Western Civilization into a war against fundamentalists.
The attack was the deadliest atrocity to affect any Western European city since the previous attack in Madrid, Spain, that killed approximately 200 people in 2004. It represents a sequence of retaliations against those countries and allied forces that have taken initiative to combat ISIS.
This past Friday, the most destructive attack took place at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris where the attackers mercilessly killed approximately 90 people by aiming bullets directed into the crowd as a representation of “pagan spirits,” as reflected by the lyrics of these songs. These acts of violence result in instability, disruption, chaos, fear, and economical instability, affecting those millions of tourists who routinely travel to Paris, the French capitol.
It is important to realize that the terrorist group ISIS is also an internal organization with leadership to organized strings of attacks in France in cooperation and training by militants in Syria and Iraq. For many years, many underprivileged and deprived young men living in the suburbs of Paris have created the fertile soil for Islamic extremist fundamentalists training and recruiting. Many young Muslims, who felt alienated by unemployment, have joined Islamic extremists to coordinate local attacks on civilians. ISIS terrorist expansion has reached international recognition with an idealism of fundamentalism and aggression toward Western Civilization by imposing Sharia laws.
I feel that President Obama should have been more aggressive in decimating and destroying ISIS international terrorists organization as it started. There should be a collective effort of an international and European coalition contributing to the NATO International Security Force. To combat ISIS and its radical Islamic forces as it would continue to expand and commit terrorist acts against innocent civilians and those who do not believe in their idealism. I also believe that ISIS will continue to grow and ultimately culminating in attacking Americans on our soil as it has occurred in Paris.
LIU Post students were asked, ‘Is ISIS terrorists a lone wolf’? A nutrition major that doesn’t want to be named said, “ISIS terrorists work in cooperation with local and international leaders as a band of wolves attacking to destroy their enemy forces attempting to change Western Civilization.”
Students were then asked, “The real enemy we are facing is ISIS, but are Muslims in the U.S. condemning ISIS and radicalism?”
“The Qur’an teaching is about peace,” said Alexandra Christensen, a psychology major. “Therefore, there must be a distinction between those Muslims who believe in a peaceful society versus the exceptions who are the extremist fundamentalists hoping to change and create a new idealistic state”.
When Islamic terrorists are capable of committing such destructive, barbaric, crude and senseless crime to civilians, one must ask, is the next attack on the U.S.A.? Is this leading us to another war, as it was initiated by George W. Bush after Sept. 11, 2001?
President Obama stated, “This is an attack not just on Paris and not just on people of France, but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share.”

The IT department sent an email to students and faculty on Monday, Nov. 9 at 10:43 a.m. to notify them about an issue with the wireless network services from Post’s primary Internet service provider, Lightpath.
The email reported that Lightpath had an issue with their wireless network services, which was being looked
into, that affected LIU Post and University Center’s Wifi. The email stated that the IT department had re-routed the Internet service to their secondary provider, Cogent that serves as a backup. The IT Department did not respond to the Pioneer’s requests for comment about the email.
However, Gary L. Miller, the Director of the Computer Graphics Labs for the College of Arts, Communications and Design, commented. “The ISP address from the provider went down. Therefore, the wireless network had to be re-routed, and instead the wireless network was accessed from a backup,” he explained.
The Wifi re-routing did not affect Miller’s department because in the design labs, they have the capacity to both use the Ethernet wired network and the wireless network. “There was no effect in any shape or form in Humanities and our labs.” Miller confirmed that the wireless network is up and running again. “I received an email on Nov. 9 [stating] that the wireless network had been re-routed, meaning that it was up and running by the backup,” he said.
Students did not seem to be affected during the re-routing. However, Miller explained how students could improve their wireless access on their devices if they are experiencing difficulties accessing the network.
“The wireless connection can depend on many different things other than the provider,” Miller said. “The device used to access the network along with the router they connect to, affects the access to the network. If students are having trouble connecting to the wireless network on campus, I would suggest trying to restart their device, log off and on again to the network to update it. Further, the iOS on students’ iPads should also be updated frequently for better access.”
If the Wifi is running slow on a device, it could also depend on where your device is, in relation to the location of the routers on campus. “It’s not the IT department’s fault nor is the provider. It’s a miracle that the Wifi works at all,” Miller said.
Heidi Titko, a sophomore digital design major, said that she wasn’t affected. “I never use the Wifi on campus anyway, especially not in Humanities, because when I try to use it, my laptop keeps logging off. Instead I always use my own data since it works more efficiently. I have a data plan that is unlimited so I’d rather use that.”
If students are having difficulties connecting to the Wifi for any reason, they could contact the IT department by calling 516-299-3300 or by emailing IT@liu.edu.

December 23 marks the last day of the current semester. Finals week itself is scheduled from Dec. 16 to the 22. There are over 200 finals on Tuesday, Dec. 22. That means you better do your holiday shopping well before you take your finals.
Yet, Beth Wilkow, who works in the registrar office, said that nothing can be done to make final exams earlier. “There isn’t much decision-making regarding when to have final exams, as the calendar itself dictates when they will be,” she said.
“We are mindful of the challenges when traveling during holiday season, but there is little room in the fall calendar to modify when the exam period is held,” Wilkow said. The school calendar is posted before the semester begins in an attempt to give students time to plan travel arrangements and attempt to alleviate that burden. However, the schedule for finals week usually is not usually announced until several weeks into the semester.
As a school that has a lot of international students, (roughly 6% from 40 countries according to collegedata.com), this information is extremely valuable to them. According to hopper.com, the average price of a plane ticket will be about 75% more when flying during the weeks leading up to Christmas this year. That’s a significant amount of extra money that has to be paid for a ticket to travel home after finals week.
Philip Lundgren, a junior graphic design major from Sweden, thinks the semester goes a tad late. “It definitely puts a strain on what you have to do,” he said. “Finals week should be re-scheduled to accommodate traveling, most professors would understand.”
The late end to the semester doesn’t just affect those who are traveling once the semester ends; it also affects commuters who will be traveling in holiday traffic and weather that could be inclement. “It is a pain in the neck when I’m forced to drive here from a half an hour away and it’s snowing,” said Kahleel Bragg, a senior broadcasting major. “Especially if it’s just for one test.”
While the schedule cannot be changed for this semester, students have expressed their frustrations for future exam weeks during the fall semester. For this fall, students will have to just deal with an inconvenience.
