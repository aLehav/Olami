The Sustainability Committee at LIU Post may not be that well-known or talked about as of yet, but the goals and advancements that the organization has planned for the future are quite profound.
Founded by Dr. Scott Carlin in the spring of 2010, the Sustainability Committee strives to encourage students, faculty, and administrators to lead more sustainable lives. “Sustainability is about maintaining the qualities of the natural world that we value: clean air and water, biodiversity, and a functioning climate system,” Dr. Carlin said.
Some of the ways in which members of the campus community have taken up sustainability efforts is by using reusable water bottles, which means less waste, and by “printing double sided [assignments] only when necessary, which saves energy and resources, as well as conserves renewable energy in the form of solar panels and geothermal heat,” said Sarah Pomerenke, the committee’s coordinator.
“Sustainability is a way to live life, basically caring for future generations who will also live on this planet,” Pomerenke continued. “[O]ur current economy is set up [in a way] that we are using more stuff than nature can replenish. We are taking more oil out of the ground than nature can produce, we are using our clean water faster than nature can purify the dirty water, we are polluting the air faster than plants can clean the air, [and] we are cutting down trees faster than they can grow. Basically, we are depleting natural resources; we are living unsustainabl[y].”
The school’s website offers their definition of sustainability: “[It] is about drawing upon our campus community’s diverse strengths and talents to promote our vision of a healthy, beautiful, efficient, and just planet. Through special lectures, energy conservation, tree replacement programs, recycling, community workshops, and other initiatives, we work to ensure that our natural systems are healthy and can meet our needs as well as [the needs of] future generations.”
For those seriously interested in sustainability, there is a minor program to enroll in at LIU Post. If you are interested in making the campus a more sustainable one, you can start by avoiding printing paper whenever possible, and reusing water bottles.
To get involved, you can attend the committee’s next meeting on Monday, Dec. 8, in Hillwood room 218. The website is http://www.liu.edu/post/green, and there is a blog led by another committee coordinator, William Achnitz, which can be found at http://liucommpost.com.

On Tuesday, Dec. 9, Campus Life will be holding its first annual Student Leader Breakfast. The breakfast will be held in the Great Hall from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. 125 student leaders on campus, from club presidents to Resident Assistants, were invited to attend, and will be joined by several members of the school’s faculty. This is one of several events scheduled for Founders Day, which marks the 60- year anniversary of the campus.
If you are interested in celebrating Founders Day, students can attend the Post Cereal Buffet & Toast to Post from 8 p.m. – 10 p.m. in the fish bowl of Hillwood Commons. The day will conclude with Post’s 60th birthday party at 10:30 p.m. in the Long Island room. Admission will be $5. You can keep up with the Founders Day events on Twitter via #ToastToPost.
Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, said “I think it’s so important to celebrate LIU Post every year, but on an occasion like the 60th anniversary, it’s even more of an opportunity to stop and reflect on where we have come from.”

This semester, students have noticed motorcycles parked alongside, or often on, the sidewalk next to the parking lot between Hillwood, Humanities, and Tilles Center. The illegally parked motorcycles have raised concerns for some students.


John Pantaleone, a senior Computer Science major, said, “They shouldn’t be parked there. At least, I think they shouldn’t be parked there.” Pantaleone also mentioned that he often sees the bikes parked by Humanities Hall instead of parked in the Hillwood parking areas, which is where students should be parking their vehicles. “I’m surprised to see them parked there as often as I have.”
“Really? I haven’t even noticed them!” stated Janey Gimmell, a senior Broadcasting major, upon learning that riders park their motorcycles on the campus’ sidewalks. “Why aren’t they parked with the other cars in the student parking lot? Do they expect them to put them on the bike rack?”
According to Paul Rapess, director of Public Safety, “Motorcycles are not permitted to park on any campus sidewalk. The main hazards associated with parking on the sidewalk are the obstruction of pathways.” He continued, “People [who are] not paying attention may walk into them. In addition, the motorcycle itself could be damaged if it falls over after a collision.”
Currently, there are two student-registered motorcycles on campus, which is the typical amount of motorcycles on campus per semester, according to Rapess. While there is no current designated parking area for motorcycles or plans to zone parking for them in the future, “students [with motorcycles] are allowed to use all parking areas on campus, including handicapped spaces with the appropriate permit,” Rapess said. “Motorcycles are [required] to park in normal parking spaces alongside other motor vehicles.” Rapess stressed that students are not allowed to park in spaces “clearly defined as faculty and staff parking,” even if driving a motorcycle.

The Department of Health, Physical Education & Movement Science will add two new activity courses to their agenda of one-credit classes for the Spring 2015 semester—fencing and Pilates mat.
“We offer many activity courses really for the general population, devoted and directed toward lifetime fitness,” said Dr. Nana Koch, chairperson and associate professor in the department. However, the question remains whether students are aware that these courses exist.
Students already have the opportunity to participate in different activity classes, such as Kung Fu, horseback riding, fitness & conditioning, badminton, and swimming. There is also a two-credit scuba diving course on campus where students can earn a diving certificate. What they all have in common is personal enhancement, increased physical fitness, and in some courses even the socialization factor, Koch says. But it might also enrich your schoolwork. “A lot of research states that more fit students do better in school,” Koch added.
In fact, a vigorous amount of evidence suggests that physical education and better student results correlate, according to a 2011 Illinois Public Health Institute’s report. The research primarily examines cardio-respiratory fitness, which determines how well the body can transport oxygen to the muscles, and the resultant positive effects it has on optimizing tasks, academic achievements, and test performances.
The department’s new courses focus mainly on strength training and cardio fitness. In the Pilates class, students practice on a series of full body conditioning without any equipment, according to instructor Edna Gruvman. The exercise helps boost the core muscles, and the workout is flexible to do individually.
These same principles align with the fencing course. “Fencing is most definitely a cardio workout,” said Enid Friedman, associate professor at Hofstra University and instructor of the new fencing class. “It has been called ‘physical chess,’” Friedman added, describing the sport as a type of intensive dance with fast movement, which integrates body awareness, concentration, and the ability to strategize.
Both courses are only seven weeks long, but they are repeatable for credit. Fencing will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2 p.m. – 2.55 p.m.
Pilates mat has yet to be determined. The instructors hope the class time will induce a sense of individual continuance after class. “The students can try to bring the alignment principles into their everyday [lives in order] to improve their posture and general well-being,” Gruvman said.
Senior Physical Education major Jonathon Watkin has taken advantage of a handful of theses one-credit courses. “[The classes] were all small with some athletes, but mostly PE and Health students,” Watkin said. “I do think it’s an [important] issue because many people do not know the correct principles of training and fitness, and often disregard physical activity as a core rather than [as] a fun activity for social enjoyment.” Watkin believes the courses should be targeted towards those who are not already informed about health and fitness. “Typically, PE and Health students are knowledgeable in these areas, and understand when and how to train to enhance lifelong fitness.”
Dr. Koch agreed that the flyers all over the Pratt Recreation Center have not been enough to reach the student body as a whole. “It seems to be that so few of the students really know we have anything to offer,” Koch said. She believes this knowledge can be imparted to the general student body if they participate in the new or on-going courses.
“I think that advertising more around campus will encourage friends to join, and hopefully a snowball effect will happen,” Watkin agreed. “Without the knowledge or set of routine on how to stay in shape, many people do not have the motivation to work out or change their health habits.”
There is still time to sign up for these courses for the Spring semester. If interested in learning more about the different options, contact Dr. Nana Koch at nkoch@liu.edu.
Almost all of the activity courses offered are worth one credit, but most students do not take advantage of physical activity classes; they might find it hard to find room in their packed schedules. Watkin believes that motivation is the key. “Motivation needs to come from within oneself and one’s self-desire to become healthier,” he said. “Students should think of these simple words that Dr. Frank Brady [professor in the Department of Physical Education] once said: ‘aiming to improve cardio-respiratory fitness can’t [ensure additional] years to your life, but it can add life to your years.’”

Ten days is all you need to earn three credits during the winter semester. For students attempting to stay on track, or possibly make up ground for light semesters, winter sessions can be used as more than a break from school. The 129 credits required for an undergraduate degree can be difficult to complete over the course of eight semesters. The winter term offers an opportunity to catch up or get ahead.
The winter term runs from January 5-16, 2015. Most undergraduate classes during the winter term meet from Monday through Friday for four hours a day. The average class size is eight students, according to Registrar Administrator, Beth Wilkow. Last year, classes varied from an independent study course, to an introductory course in philosophy.
Plenty of core curriculum classes are offered as well, along with several electives and major requirements as well. Some of the courses offered include Introduction to Macroeconomics, to Introduction to Psychology, or Statistics. “Typically, the core courses have the greatest number of students enrolled,” Wilkow said. “PHI 8, PHI 13, ENG 2, HIS 3 and POL 2 were popular core courses. While ART 31(Ceramics), HE 43 (Substance Abuse) and CRJ 60 (Terrorism) were popular electives.” Wilkow believes students should take advantage of these classes because, “It often enables students to ‘catch up’ if they took a semester with a lighter load, had to withdraw from a class, or failed a class.”
Another advantage of taking winter courses is the lowered tuition rates. There is a 1/3 tuition discount on winter courses, so a three-credit undergraduate course would cost $2,061 plus a $100 University Fee. The regular rate for a three-credit course is $3,090. This is the main reason why Deandre Jordan, a junior Broadcasting major, is considering taking a winter class. “Because I am a transfer student, these classes would allow me the chance to make up for some credits that didn’t transfer.”
You do not have to be an LIU Post student to enroll in winter classes. Classes are open to any students interested in taking them. For more information about the winter semester, contact Academic and Career Planning at 516-299-2746.

On Nov. 30, 1979, Pink Floyd released “The Wall,” one of the most offbeat and imaginative concept albums in the history of rock and roll. Nearly 35 years later, people still channel their inner “Pink- Floydian” to revisit the life of a fictional protagonist, Pink Floyd, from his boyhood days in post-World War II England to his dismal rock stardom plagued by his self-imposed isolation.
Despite the isolating and subservient portrayal behind the mask that is “The Wall,” the album has unrelentingly clinched onto the outside world. To celebrate its 35th anniversary on Nov. 30, we explore the heart of “The Wall,” and why it’s such an artistic masterpiece as it challenges the idea of self from many angles.
Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” is a circular maze that resonates a constant internal struggle with no exit. Waters’ inspiration while writing the lyrical foundation of the album came from the utter disdain he had toward his audience, particularly during Floyd’s unprecedented stadium concerts. With the spotlight peering down on the band, fans would naturally scream in jubilation for the live experience they’ve been waiting for. However, the crowd’s celebrations didn’t resonate too well with Waters, as he often took vulgar action in response to it. “The Wall” primarily stems from Waters’ frustration, and the disconnection he felt musically with his audience, but appears to also take on a more personal narrative of the bassist’s life story and obsessions.
If Freud were still alive to conduct psychoanalyses, he probably would’ve offered Waters a consultation or two. The sixth song on the album, “Mother” provides a great example of the psychoanalytic work embodied in Freudian teachings. Losing his father during World War II, Waters was raised by his mother for the vast majority of his life, and often contended with her overprotective, smothering nature early in his childhood. In the case of Pink Floyd’s “Mother,” the song is split right down the middle, between Waters’ melancholy verse chords and Gilmour’s uplifting nursery rhyme chorus. The breakdown of the song summarizes the direction of a young boy’s curiosity as his mother build the metaphorical wall encasing his own individuality, along with his questions.
Immediately following “Mother,” is the song “Goodbye Blue Sky.” Pink embarks on a hopeless, intrepid journey to explore the brave new world as he leaves his constraining childhood behind. But with the aftermath of war, he walks into a world still transitioning and teetering in fear. The subsequent songs follow suit by testing the existential path of Pink as he quickly moves through new phases in his life. Toward the end of the album, Pink becomes the very essence of what his innocent self had feared – a tyrannical figure who takes pride in clouding the minds of his fans with despair and isolation.
The synthesis of “The Wall” extracts familiar thematic obsessions of Waters, observed in Pink Floyd’s earlier albums like “Animals,” “Dark Side of the Moon,” and “Wish You Were Here.” The bravado of “The Wall” is a hybrid of everything Waters desired in his music with the accompanying mystique of Wright, Gilmour, and drummer, Nick Mason that no other virtuoso force could ever duplicate – you could make the argument that “The Wall” ironically opened up a new wave of creative expression.
With its release, elaborate theatrical concerts — including one famous performance held in Berlin on July 21, 1990 to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall eight months earlier — have brought the album to life. This particular live performance featured guest artists, ranging from the folksy Joni Mitchell, to the edgy Sinead O’ Connor, in order to retell the lyrical narrative of the existential character, Pink.
Stretching even further, the album was also adapted into a 1982 feature film directed by Alan Parker, which visually encompasses the stark details of Pink’s life as he explores his self-defeating madness. The totality of lyricist and bass guitarist Waters’ fearful stifling words, backed by the soulful sounds of Gilmour’s guitar, and Wright’s virtuoso on piano in “The Wall” make melancholic works such as Greg Laswell’s “Comes and Goes” sound more Coldplay’s upbeat “A Sky Full of Stars,” at an astounding 125 beats per minute.

With the release of her first self-titled EP in July, Brooklyn-based singer-songstress Meghann Wright hopes to share her story with music enthusiasts all over the world.
Raised in Hawaii, Wright was always surrounded by a “melting pot” of cultures; some of which breathed new life into instant classic songs like Judy Garland’s “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” or Louis Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World.” In a family full of musical influences, from dad’s simple fandom to mom’s professional opera voice, her childhood was saturated with music from all different avenues – music became the Pacific Ocean to her island home.
During a recent interview conducted by The Pioneer, Wright explained how the move to New York challenged her both as an individual and a musician. With an eclectic metro scene, the “big apple” is a hard place to adapt and standout from large group of aspiring musicians coming from a sea of genres. Her soulful, gritty voice puts her on the hardcore punk rock platform one night, and the “freewheeling” folk scene the next. “People who restrict themselves are hurting themselves since they’re missing out on something that could be fun and exciting,” said Wright, referring to the importance of embracing a collage of musical styles.
One of her three EP songs, “Can’t Carry Water,” takes the listener on an overwhelming journey dampened by the sense of loss, and then remedied with empowerment and hope later on. Wright stresses the need to move forward, and accept issues that aren’t meant for safekeeping. Her second song, “Left My Heart in Brooklyn,” the same theme of hope in the midst of loneliness is reimagined, as Wright talks about leaving her adopted hometown behind to chase her dreams.
On the polarizing end, the third and final song on the EP, “Cocaine,” can put on more than one dress. Listening to the poppy, edgy instrumentals, you might think back to your very first Reel Big Fish concert, given its upbeat, “Skatanic-like” qualities. But, as Wright remarked, “Some people don’t necessarily realize it, but it’s a song about pain and loneliness.”
On the surface, her lyrics foster stories of vacant hearts and unembellished, rough courage. The innate rapture of Wright’s voice garners new meaning as it touches the soul from all angles. Wright expressed that she not only finds self-gratification in her own music, but also finds that her songs open the doors for other female singer-songwriters as well.
In the winter of 2012, Wright founded an organization called “The City & the Heart” dedicated to supporting these new artists who are looking for an outlet to showcase their talents. By building a sense of community and direction, she hopes to give artists the opportunity to explore their musical parameters without any distractions along the way. Last year, Wright organized a series of 14 showcases to raise money for its inaugural compilation record, which features an original song by each “TC&TH’s” 30 plus contributors. The record can now be listened to for free on BandCamp.
From behind the scenes to center of the stage, Wright plans to be invested in her musical travels for the long run. Whether it’s New York or Hawaii, Wright’s home resides within her music as she takes refuge in her songs. The stark reminder of Dolly Parton’s country grit or Dolores O’Riordan’s superb range is embodied in Wright’s hybrid of styles. Stripping the creative pulse felt in Wright’s songs could be like wiping away the soul from her existence – it’s just not possible.
Wright’s music can be found on her BandCamp page. She can also be found on Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Soundcloud, and on her website meghannbwright.com.6

Brothers Angus and Malcolm Young started AC/DC in 1973, and quickly gained recognition for their music with hits such as “TNT,” “It’s a Long Way to The Top,” and “Let There Be Rock.” On Dec. 2, they released their 16th studio album, “Rock or Bust.”
Australian hard rock band AC/DC is one of the few bands in the music industry that never seem to stop playing, and is never forgotten. They’re among the handful of musicians, including The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young that just keep churning. Well into their 60s and 70s, they’re still doing their thing, and doing it well.
The album is classic AC/DC, with Angus’ (age 59) iconic guitar solos and Brian Johnson’s (age 67) screaming voice, along with the constant beat of Phil Rudd’s drums and Cliff Williams’ thumping bass. The 11-track album starts off with the title track and single, “Rock or Bust,” and continues in steady form throughout. In comparison to earlier AC/DC, this one feels heavier and more laidback. Songs like “Hard Times” provide the downbeat-feel of the album, but not without contrast, as “Hard Times” is followed by “Baptism by Fire” reminiscing “Let There Be Rock” in the drive and feel of the track. With the obvious presence of the blues, the album is well rounded, and a solid addition to a legendary catalogue.
Lately, the band has gotten a lot of media attention, especially Phil Rudd. Rudd was arrested on Nov. 6 on four different charges: possession of methamphetamine and cannabis, threatening to kill, and attempting to procure a murderer (hire a hit-man). The latter charge has been dropped, due to “inconclusive evidence.” The band has commented that their drummer was acting strange during recording, and they are ready to move on without him. Rudd has not commented publicly.
“Rock or Bust” is the first album made without the band’s rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young. Young was diagnosed with dementia, with symptoms starting all the way back in 2008 during the recording of their last album, “Black Ice,” but didn’t retire until late September. Young has entered treatment in a special care home in Sydney. The band has stated in a press release that he will not come back as their guitarist. His nephew, Stevie Young, who has recorded with the band before, has replaced him.
Expect Angus to be running around on stage in his school uniform on a worldwide tour for the new album. Dates for the tour will be announced in 2015.

Walt Disney Pictures held a college conference call with actors Chris Pine and Anna Kendrick on Nov. 22, to promote their new musical fantasy film, “Into the Woods.”
Based on the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical of the same name, the film tells the story of a childless couple (Emily Blunt and James Corden) that is cursed by a witch (Meryl Streep). On the journey to end their plight, they encounter a slew of fairytale characters, like Cinderella (Kendrick) and her Prince (Pine). “Into the Woods” is directed by Rob Marshall, and adapted for the big screen by James Lapine, who originally collaborated with prestigious composer and lyricist, Stephen Sondheim, on the stage version in the 1980s.
“I think that thematically, the whole piece is really about parents, children, and the disappointments and failings of parents,” explained Kendrick. “It’s based on stories that parents have told children for generations. There’s the element where it’s pure fantasy [and] exciting for kids, and then there’s an element that is specifically centered towards parents, which is that we need to be careful of what we tell our children. [They] take lessons to heart. It’s sort of about understanding how they are listening to us, even if it doesn’t seem that way, and it’s our responsibility to prepare them for the reality of the world.”
Marshall won the Academy Award for Best Picture with “Chicago” in 2002, and is a five-time Tony Award nominee. The director brings his theatrical experience to this latest adaptation. “He’s a director who comes from the theater world; he recognized the importance and real luxury of having rehearsals a month before you have to show your wares to the public. He made sure to build that in,” said Pine. “Even though we didn’t get a chance to work with everyone, we did in that month get a chance to see one another, and to see what everyone was doing. I think that really helped infuse the project with a sense of community. You’ll hopefully feel that in the film.”
Pine described how the characters in this film go through complex journeys, but his prince still remains oafish and very self- centered, almost a parody of the Prince Charming character type. “My prince is just way more two-dimensional than [those other characters], and wonderfully self absorbed,” said Pine. “I had a lot of fun bringing some levity to the picture, or tried to, and there’s a bit of a buffoon in the prince. He realizes, I think finally and wonderfully, [that] Cinderella gives him a chance to really feel and connect with her. And I think he does for a brief second, but then does make the choice to go back and run off to relive over, and over, and over again this storybook life he is so accustomed to.”
According to Kendrick, Marshall opted for a modern, but character-centric take and sensibility for the film, be it the varied clothing (from leather jackets to corsets) to the way the major figures in the story interact. “Since these stories kind of belong to the ages, it makes sense that in some ways we update them every generation,” said Kendrick. “One thing that Bob [Marshall wanted me to do] was to sort of be an over-thinking, logical, neurotic princess. I think that modern women have a tendency to overthink everything, and they don’t trust their gut, and we have to look at things from every angle and make the right decision.”
Kendrick’s Cinderella has this mentality for the majority of the film, eventually realizing what is important (when her community is in crisis), and acting upon it. She meets her prince and is hesitant with her new disposition. “When the prince tells her to come back to the castle, she is very centered and calm, more so than any other moment in the piece,” she continued. “She says to the prince, ‘Can you understand me? Do we understand each other? Do we even live in the same emotional world?’ And when the answer is ‘no’ it’s very easy for her to say that she chooses the unknown. ‘Even though you represent security, I’m going to choose the unknown.’”
There was an underlying lightness to the conversation with Kendrick and Pine, along with moments of introspective character and story analysis. It seems fitting, given the duality of “Into the Woods” which is a story of fantasy, reality, satirizing fairytales and parenthood, while also on another level being simply enjoyable for children.
So, after describing her character arc, and digging deep into the changing existential state of her Cinderella, Kendrick, who was with Pine for the call, took an off-beat moment to point out: “I really appreciate Chris Pine’s use of the word ‘picture’ just now.” Pine said that he’s trying to bring the term back into fashion. They then launched into a series of impressions; as if they made this “picture” in the 1930s or 40s, and that it has classic stars like Fatty Arbuckle and Tellulah Bankhead in it. Kendrick then noted his hair. “You look like a toddler who just woke up,” she said, laughing.
“Into the Woods” will be released on Christmas Day, Dec. 25, 2014.

“The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness” is a documentary film by Mami Sunada that chronicles the year leading up to the 2013 release of “The Wind Rises,” by the then 72-year-old Hayao Miyazaki (“Spirited Away’’) of the prolific animation group Studio Ghibli.
Sunada, a newcomer with only one other feature under her belt, shows an inside look into Miyazaki’s private life and world, as well as his relationships with his fellow filmmakers at Ghibli. Such filmmakers include director Isao Takahata, and producer Toshio Suzuki. The documentarian was given access to Ghibli during her visits, with often candid footage harvested over the course of the year. This is the first feature-length theatrical film about the studio, and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September for its North American debut.
Studio Ghibli is portrayed in the film as a place of simultaneous work and play. Miyazaki is a perfectionist, and a pessimistic one at that; but his interactions with his fellow animators are filled with an underlying humor. He arrives at the studio every day at the same time, on the clock, and is almost always seen wearing a work apron. Early in the film, Miyazaki does his morning aerobics to music at work along with the majority of his team. Cut together with this imagery is a scene in which Suzuki discusses merchandizing and his work as producer—the business side of the studio parallels light-heartedness. Sunada’s choice of editing is wisely done, quickly establishing a calming tone and wholeness to the viewer.
“The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness” often feels like a narrative story, driven by the poetic language, observations, and banter of the Ghibli workers as they face new challenges during the making of “The Wind Rises”—the film Miyazaki states will be his last feature, and one that is deeply personal; Miyazaki is often caught ruminating on the state of the artistic world while smoking a cigarette, his casual words dusted in an odd melancholy that is thought provoking. He is caught speaking about family, his philosophical views, and his own films in a raw way.
Takahata is briefly seen in the film, taking a role in the background as he works on his own film, “The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,” at a different Ghibli location. The filmmaker, who was once a key mentor to Miyazaki early in their careers, is portrayed as a secretive man on the verge of retirement, having not made a feature film in more than a decade. The focus of this documentary is Miyazaki, but the somewhat strained relationship between the two filmmakers within Studio Ghibli is given special attention that implies a deep respect, and also a distance.
Sunada does not lay out the studio’s history in a linear, dull fashion, but instead delves into it when a modern problem has been similarly seen in the past. At these times, she uses choice archive footage of the filmmakers, allowing smoother access into the documented story. Shots of Japanese nature push the film along in a meditative way, reminiscent of the signature peaceful pauses and breaks in scenes found in Miyazaki’s work. This silence is key to the minimalistic tone of the documentary.
Miyazaki and the studio are contextualized in a worldly manner, with references to the 2008 Economic Recession, the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, and politics discussed freely. This touching base with current events creates a further feeling of realism within the documentary, humanizing the studio and its employees as not only workers, but as members of an imperfect society.
Just as silence is key to this documentary, so is the music. Masakatsu Takagi supplies a piano-heavy score reminiscent of the whimsical work of Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi, adding to the strong tonal ties this film has with the narrative films of the studio. There is this feeling that Sunada has taken cues from her subjects, and incorporated their minimalistic, yet illustrative styles into the documentary medium.
“The Kingdom of Madness” is not just a melancholic treat for Ghibli fans, but a fine study of the creative world and a master class in story-driven documentary filmmaking. The documentary released on Nov. 28 at the IFC Center in New York City.

Thousands of glowing, sparkling, dancing lights returned to Jones Beach State Park on Thursday, Nov. 20, for the 11th annual Long Island Lights Show and Parade. The drive-through event, hosted by Nikon, is about two-and-a-half miles long, and there are approximately 300,000 lights in the many animated, synchronized displays.
This holiday tradition has returned from its seven-year hiatus due to the efforts of Governor Andrew Cuomo’s “Jones Beach Revitalization Plan.” “The Holiday Lights Spectacular is a Long Island tradition that I am proud to help revive for the first time in seven years,” Cuomo said in an interview for ABC News 7 on Nov. 6. “This impressive display attracts visitors from all over, providing an important boost to Long Island’s economy. I encourage all New Yorkers to take a trip and see this spectacle for themselves this holiday season.”
Besides helping the economy, this event attracts many families, too. “It is one of my fondest memories from when I was younger,” said Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major. “Each Christmas, my family and I would look forward to visiting Jones Beach and drive through the light show. We would pack snacks and popcorn and we all loved it! I’m so excited that it will be returning after seven years.”
For the first time, a “Holiday Village” will be added to the Long Island Lights Show; it will attract children and adults where they can take a photo with Santa Claus, enjoy holiday-themed carols performed by school choirs, find their way out of a hay maze, and snack on hot chocolate and s’mores. The cost to enter the spectacular show is $20 per carload during the week and $25 on the weekends. By bringing a can of food for donation, you can get a discount on the admission fee. Each Tuesday, “Two for Tuesdays” allows visitors to drive through the show a second time, for free, to experience the magical lights all over again. This show will run every evening from 5:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. during the week, and 11:00 p.m. on weekends through Jan. 4.

Old Westbury Gardens, located at 71 Old Westbury Road, is a place where flowers bloom, trees grow, and birds sing. While the grounds offer seasonal displays, the gardens offer flowers of every sort. Located on a vast 160- acre plot of land, there are benches, walkways, statues, and fountains. Each year, the gardens holds events such as dog shows, classical and contemporary music concerts, and around Halloween, the gardens sponsors a haunted house and a display of jack-o-lanterns that are lit up at night.
In an effort to promote Old Westbury Gardens, Professor Judith Jedlicka’s Arts and Entertainment Promotion class will be organizing an event at the gardens on Saturday, Dec. 6, from 6:30 p.m. – 9 p.m. The name of the event is “First Night and Tree Lighting.” Old Westbury Gardens will provide light refreshments, a choir, and a festive tree lighting for the event. Admission will cost $10 for adults, $5 for children ages 3-7, and $9 for prepaid members.
Post students were asked if they had heard of Old Westbury Gardens, and what they knew about it.
Danielle Savarese, a senior Art Education major, explained that the gardens have sentimental value to her. “I used to go there with my family when I was younger and have picnics in the gardens,” Savarese said. “I would attend an event at the gardens.”
Natasha Ambria Henry, a junior Music Performance major, was interested in learning about the gardens. “I have never heard of it, but I think I’ll take a look into it because I like flowers,” she said. When asked if she would attend a campus event at Old Westbury Gardens, Henry responded, “If it was a campus event, then sure!” Old Westbury Gardens are open from late April through October. They are open Wednesday through Monday from 10:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. The gardens offer free parking for visitors. Old Westbury Gardens has a Facebook page for those interested in seeing photos of the famous acres. The gardens also feature a snack bar, and visitors are welcome to bring their own food and picnic on the grounds.

Donovan Bailey, the first Canadian to legally break the 10-second barrier in the 100 miles once said, “Follow your passion, be prepared to work hard and sacrifice above all, and don’t let anyone limit your dreams.” Nigina Khaitova is a freshman majoring in International Studies at LIU Post. Without wasting any time, Nigina has already started putting her dreams into action. She has recently started a club called “Model United Nations,” and plans its expansion.
Nigina Khaitova is an international student coming all the way from Republic of Uzbekistan. Coming alone to another country far from home, Khaitova described her first experience at Post as frustrating. She came to Post during the orientation sessions and had only a few people on campus to interact with and therefore felt alone. But this has eventually changed.
“Now I know I am at the right place and I love it here,” Khaitova said. “I don’t just have friends from only Russia or nearby countries but many international students from different places.” Khaitova is part of the C.H.A.T.S clubs and Student Government Association, apart from Model United Nations.
Debating is arguing in a formal manner, which many people enjoy doing. Khaitova is one of them. Back home, she worked as a translator for the United Nations’ Office in Uzbekistan, and as a producer of an audio and video podcast called, “UNews Weekly.” From her past experience, Khaitova loved working at the United Nations and knew that she wanted to join.
After continuously trying to get permission to start her own Model United Nations club at Post, Khaitova met Stacey Santiago, who shared the same interest as her. Both Khaitova and Santiago are now co- presidents of the club.
The first meeting was held on Oct. 23. Through this club, Khaitova plans on engaging the students with the United Nations. She wants to work on taking this club to a national level. Khaitova has already opened two clubs in her previous school, yet knew it would not be the same at Post. “I knew it would be far more ledger scales, and would be more complicated because, as a freshman, I didn’t know anyone here,” Khaitova said.
The members of Model United Nations meet weekly and they are taught how to compose position papers and debate on diplomatic levels. The meetings are held in a sequence that one week would be tutorials and the other week would be mock sessions where the members could practice the skills they have obtained.
“Our goal is to organize a Model United Nation Conference in our university,” Khaitova said. “Then we are planning on participating in the National Model United Nations Conference at [the] New York City Headquarters in March, and we would present our university on behalf of the country Moldova as we have already registered for it.” Model United Nations is one of those clubs that hold events on a large scale.
“It is my desire to build my career because I do plan on becoming a very successful person,” Khaitova said. “I dream to work with the United Nations and reach one of the highest positions there. So I decided as soon as possible to work on my future.” She mentioned what Russian quote she lives by, meaning, “First you work on your name and then your name works on you.” With strong beliefs in the quote, Khaitova is currently working hard so all her work qualities can pay off in the future.
Nigina Khaitova is an inspiring student who knows what path she must follow in order to reach her goals. Model United Nations is a club that will provide many opportunities for its members. “Don’t wait for people to come motivate you and change your life, do it yourself,” Khaitova said.
The Model United Nations Conference will be held at LIU Post on Dec. 3, at 5 p.m. in Hillwood Commons, room 218. The National Model United Nations Conference will be held at New York City Headquarters on March 22 to March 26. You can email the club for more information at Modelunpost@gmail.com.

Dr. Joan Digby is the current director of the Honors College at LIU Post. She is involved in the National Collegiate Honors Council (NCHC) and was the president in 2000. One of her greatest contributions to the council was the invention of the “Partners in the Parks” program. Dr. Digby never had children, and when an Honors student had this conversation with her, the student said the honors students are her children. Dr. Digby is proud to be the mother of LIU›s cats for the past 15 years, as well as Snowball the pony. She is also interested in traveling, cuisine of all kinds, art, and artifacts. She and her husband run a small press where they print limited editions of poetry and short stories, as well as literature written by LIU faculty and students.
What is your favorite thing about the Honors program?
The students because I get to teach and connect with very goal-oriented, motivated people who go on to do great things in this world.
What is the best thing that happened in Honors recently?
It’s being converted into a college! After 45 years, we are now going to be a freestanding college which will undoubtedly attract more students. Now we will be able to expand our student body and give them even more opportunities.
What is the biggest misconception about Honors?
That it’s elitist. All of the students in this program take most of their course load in the rest of the classes we offer at LIU. Honors is about 20 percent of the work, so my students who are journalists are friends with other journalists, actors are friends with other actors. Students in this college are incredibly well rounded people who don’t just cling together like a group of elite people at all.
Do you think more people should join Honors?
Yes, because people are not in the habit of pushing themselves as much as they can, and as a result they don’t accomplish as much as they can. Some of my favorite people are people who did not absolutely qualify for admissions to the program but really wanted to do it.
What are some of the unique things that only students in Honors get to do?
Partners in the Parks, study abroad, having some of the credit apply for honors advanced electives, art shows, musical performances, act, be athletes—everything that all other students can do while taking the highest undergraduate degree we have.
Why did you get involved in the Honors College?
There have been only three to four directors since 1963 and each did it for two to three years and got bored. A friend thought this job was boring and asked me if I wanted to do it. One person’s boredom is another one’s play.
Tell us about some cool advanced electives offered only to Honors students?
The one that people really love is Tango. There will be a class in the looting of art during the Nazi period and the art looting as a continued sort of elicit enterprise of war going on to Iraq and Afghanistan and the liking.
What is the best Partners in the Parks trip you went on with Honors students from LIU?
I think the Alaska one, Denali, where we were asked to catalogue for the park the number of wolves, grizzly bears, and longhorn sheep that we saw along the road. Because Alaska in the summer stays light almost 24 hours, we headed off on hikes at 11 p.m. The other one I really liked was Virgin Islands where I learned to snorkel.
What is your best memory with Honors students?
I have thousands! The best I had recently is the alumni party they ran a few weeks ago, and seeing 120 of my former students in the same room was overwhelming. There’s one, Liza Tedesco, who used to sit in the lounge and make Christmas ornaments from beads. She said, ‘You don’t remember me,’ and I said, ‘Liza, the red and white beads? How could I forget?’ Knowing them and seeing them now after some time was very exciting.
What is your favorite class you teach?
It has become Horse and Literature because I have developed a passion for these animals and being able to explore the literature attached to them brings me back to my Ph.D. studies on animal fables in the 18th century.
BONUS QUESTION: Do you have some advice for incoming and current students at LIU?
Do everything that interests you in moderation so that you can really perform well academically.
 
Stephanie Watt is a concert pianist and professor of music, sight-singing, music theory, keyboard harmony, chamber music & instrumental coaching, and piano. When she isn’t teaching or performing, Professor Watt is making jewelry inspired by other cultures and selling them in local stores on Long Island and at the Rubin Museum in NYC. Professor Watt is also an award winning competitive ballroom dancer. And finally, she is the proud owner of a 6’6” dollhouse originally built by the now deceased artist Gordon H. Hampel, which she will be finishing and exhibiting in museums across the country.
What’s the most exciting class you teach?
I thoroughly enjoy all of the classes I teach. There is something wonderfully exciting about each class this particular semester because I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know so many new faces.
Tell us a little about the Tango project.
I talk about the history of Argentina as a country and how its economic growth in the 1700s fueled the creation of this amazing dance. I also arrange for [students] to have four Tango lessons with a professional dance instructor. We [also] travel to Argentina and trace the steps of the origins of the tango.
What is your favorite thing about Honors?
It is a vessel in which not only students get to explore and learn about new things but it is an instrument that faculty can use to share their expertise, passions, hobbies, adventures, and new discoveries with a learning community that is not primarily from their particular school or discipline. I would like to thank Joan Digby for all the support she has given to me and our students throughout the years. She is a fantastic colleague and friend.
When you were in high school and college what did you think you would be doing after college?
When I was in high school I was planning to become a veterinarian or a geriatric doctor. I hadn’t planned on majoring in [music] because it was simply a way of life for me and I had no intentions of stopping. Because of my passion for music I knew I had to continue my musical studies on a much more intense and larger scale.
What fun trip or class do you have in mind for honors students?
Our trip to Argentina in May 2015 is going to be a fantastic trip where we get immersed in the Argentinean culture. I’m also planning to present a new course that involves another passion of mine: stones and minerals and their spiritual, religious, and medicinal impact on mankind and how they function as adornments.
What is your favorite holiday?
I LOVE HALLOWEEN! I love decorating and transforming the house into a haunted mansion! The best memory I have was scaring several people with a talking skeleton head in the bathroom. The mouth on the skeleton moved when you talked through a wired microphone (which we would have in a different room of course). I can’t tell you how many laughs we’ve had and still have.
What is your favorite season and what has become sort of a tradition during the season?
My favorite season is summer. I love to garden and it’s wonderful to see the yard turn into a flower paradise for the birds and insects. Summer is also my time to explore and discover new places, people, and “things.”
What is your favorite book and is it tied with a certain memory, or story?
How to read the Akashich Records by Linda Howe. It teaches you to connect to the universe and our spiritual masters. My grandmother, who was a Cherokee Indian, always pointed to the stars and talked about our spirit ancestors when I was a kid. Though this book is not about Native American traditions, the information it contains speaks to me because of my spiritual training by my family.
What is your best memory with Honors students?
I have several wonderful moments. First, I love looking at each student’s face when they have their first Tango lesson. The students begin to understand that the Tango is not just a dance, but truly a way of life! Second, at the end of the semester one of the students wanted to prepare an authentic Argentinean feast for the class as part of her final research paper.

The Griswold family Christmas tree, the fishnet leg lamp, and Cindy Lou-Who singing Where Are You Christmas? are just a few of the symbols of the holiday season most people are accustomed to. But what about the holiday traditions around the world? Does everyone celebrate the season of giving the same way?
The answer to that question is quite simple: No! As a little girl, I grew accustomed to a hybrid of holidays—celebrating Chanukah and Christmas. During the holiday season, we would light the candles, eat latkes, receive little gifts, watch Christmas movies, and decorate a Christmas tree, called “our lil Chanukah Bush.” Christmas Day, we would ski or snowshoe, and, at night, we would have a Thanksgiving feast all over again, roast marshmallows in our fireplace, and watch more Christmas movies.
Now that I’m older, our traditions have changed. I spend some Christmases with my friend in California.On Christmas Eve, the family dresses in gowns and tuxes, has dinner in a grand hotel’s private ballroom, rents out a suite donned with a 12-foot Christmas tree, and spends the night opening mountains of presents. That night, we drive through Candy Cane Lane in convertibles with the heat blasting. This neighborhood has gingerbread mansions overflowing with spectacular lights and abundant Santas—like the neighborhood in Christmas with the Kranks.
Holiday traditions are different wherever you go in the world. My American experience is hardly the same as every other American, just as my holiday traditions are the polar opposite of freshman Computer Science major Xinyu Sirie Zhang, an international student from China. “People in China usually don’t have Christmas,” Xinyu said. I was shocked.
However, Xinyu said that New Years is their big holiday. During New Years, people eat all the dumplings they can, wear new clothes, and venture to people’s homes to wish them a Happy New Year. “The first day of the New Year we stay at my dad’s parents’ home. The second day we stay at my mom’s parents’ home,” Xinyu explained. Families do this because on New Years there is a big TV show that the family always watches together, and it is also customary to spend New Years with all relatives.
In Norway, the traditions couldn’t be more different for senior Broadcasting major Karoline Onsrud. Norwegians celebrate Advent, the 24-day lead up to Christmas, and light a candle every Sunday in December.
“We call [Dec. 23] Little Christmas Eve,” Karoline said, as that is the day her family decorates the tree. In Norway, they broadcast a lot of Christmas shows and movies, and just like my family, Karoline’s always watches National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation. Karoline is also given the job of making a rich porridge. “I feel we only eat it because it’s tradition, seeing as no one in my family cares too much for it,” Karoline remarks about this porridge served with sugar, cinnamon, and a lump of butter in the center.
On Christmas Eve, the family gets dressed up and journeys to the aunt’s house where they eat stick meat, also known as lamb ribs. This mouthwatering meal is accompanied by aquavit, which helps with digestion so that you can keep eating. Christmas Eve is closed with the opening of gifts, and the days following Christmas are filled with dinner parties. Since most parts of Norway receive abundant snow, Karoline loves to spend the rest of the holiday skiing, ice skating, and sledding.
As you can see, holiday traditions are different all around the world. Each culture has remarkably different yet beautiful traditions that get passed on to all generations. It is the season to be jolly, so spend it well with your family and friends, following the traditions that have made past holiday seasons so wonderful!

Does it help to receive text and email alerts to your mobile device from LIU Post about campus-wide closings, delayed starts, power outages, and other pertinent information? According to the school’s website, the LIU Post Emergency Alert System is designated to inform students on their official website, via e-mail, text messages or social media sites in the moment of an emergency.
Smartphones are in almost every student’s hands nowadays, so it seems like it just makes sense to send a quick text message, notifying students when the LIU Post community needs to spread important news. I think that getting an automatic text message alert regarding the LIU Post campus is a great tool. Simplicity is key when people are busy, especially students in college. Rather than having to log onto the school website or local news station website and search for the page that might announce a school closing due to inclement weather, one can simply check their phone. This feature is not only compatible to students, but faculty and other employees within the LIU Post community, as well.
The other great aspect of text message alerts is the speed in which the information will get to the people who need it the most— students and faculty. Let’s face it; we are constantly checking our cell phones throughout the day. If the news was posted on the LIU Post website, it is unlikely everyone will check and see the vital information on a timely manner.
One possible downside some people might find with the automatic text alert system is that it may not pertain to them in certain situations. For example, if a commuter is at home and he or she receives an alert about a certain residence hall not having power, it would not matter to them. However, I believe disregarding a text and simply deleting it is way better than not receiving a message about an emergency event that does affect you. Also, timeliness is important when sending students texts about cancelled classes. For example, some commuter students might already be on their way to school when they receive the message.
Text message alerts are not the only way the campus will notify students and faculty of an emergency event. Sirens are another means to communicate that there might be a threat on campus. According to the school’s website, “The outdoor sirens and loudspeakers are activated during a potentially life-threatening event such as weather-related emergencies or a hazardous materials spill from a traffic accident. The system is designed to most effectively communicate with people who are outdoors such as students playing on our athletic fields or walking from one classroom building to another or visitors attending events at the campus.”
So, do you like getting a text message about possible emergencies that take place on campus? Or would you rather get the notification only via email or a social media website, such as Facebook and Twitter? Let us know; we want to hear your input! Email your thoughts and opinions on this issue to liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

The end of the year is fastly approaching. This is the time we get to sit back and reflect on what we have done throughout the year: things we’ve enjoyed, things we would like to change or even improve on, etc. Most importantly, we are appreciative and thankful for making it this far. What better way to give thanks than celebrating with loved ones and good food? We all know the holiday—Thanksgiving. The time of year catered to giving thanks for any and everything you are thankful for.
Post students reflected on the festivities, and the good food they encountered. “I am thankful for my parents pushing me to where I am,” said Amaury Narvaez, a junior Film major. “I’m also thankful for my new car seeing that I’ve been taking public transportation everywhere I’ve had to go.” Needless to say for most college students, they are thankful for the support of their family, friends, and loved ones. Those are the individuals considered their support system, who are needed to make through those trying four years. “For the Thanksgiving holiday, my family normally meets at a relative’s house and have dinner. We listen to music and then it just becomes a family party,” Narvaez continued.
Along with the materialistic things we possess, Post students are thankful for just being alive. There have been so many tragedies and deaths that have occurred this year involving the old as well as the young. Alena Seaman, a sophomore Forensic Science major, said, “I am thankful for everything; most importantly I’m thankful for life!”
The typical Thanksgiving dinner and party is not the way everyone celebrates the holiday. There are other activities that people engage in to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday. “We have a small family dinner and then we go to the movies to see any movie that came out on Thanksgiving.” Seaman continued. “No one is ever there.”
I am thankful, of course, for my family and friends, but at this moment of life I am thankful for the opportunity to further my education. I am also thankful for the drive and passion that keeps me going.

On Nov. 19, 2014, the university issued a new memorandum and policy statement against harassment and discrimination. The policy, issued by Lee Kelly, Interim Executive Director of Human Resources, was sent out via email to all members of LIU Post, including students, staff, and faculty alike, as a way to raise awareness and help prevent incidents from happening.
Stated in the memorandum are various rules and regulations, prohibiting the actions of certain behavior. The policy states that the university “is committed to maintaining a learning and working environment that is free of bias, prejudice, discrimination and harassment, and an environment that supports, nurtures, and rewards career and educational advancement purely on the basis of ability and performance.”
Is this policy statement a good way to prevent incidents of harassment and discrimination? What do Post students think of it?
Nicole Curcio, a sophomore Dance major, thinks this is a step in the right direction. “I think that it is something that will help enforce a safer environment for the student body,” Curcio said. “I think it is very necessary considering that as we move further into the future, new and more aggressive ways to engage in harassment are being formed,” Curcio added, emphasizing the importance of the university to provide its thoughts on issues that can directly affect the students—like harassment and discrimination.
Meanwhile, senior Broadcasting major Miguel Montalvo thinks that sending the policy out via email was a good move, but also thinks that different steps could have been taken for a more effective outcome. “I feel like this approach via email was effective, but not as effective as a message of this caliber should have been,” Montalvo said.
He believes that this is a good start, but having more alternatives in place could help increase student and faculty awareness. “Other things such as lectures, programs and town hall meetings could help to address the issue,” Montalvo expressed. He seconded with Curcio’s notion that harassment and discrimination should not be tolerated by anyone.
I personally agree with Montalvo and Curcio. I think that this is a great way for students and faculty alike to become more aware of their surroundings and what’s going on around them. I agree with Curcio’s opinion in the sense that it’s important to be constantly updated and reminded daily of the various dangers that we encounter. Although, I also agree with Montalvo’s notion that more can be done to further raise general awareness. However, like Montalvo and Curcio, I think this is a great first step in the right direction.
What do you think about this new policy? Let us know at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

On Saturday, Nov. 22, two overwhelming seasons came to an end for LIU Post. The football team, who had their best season in over a decade, advanced to the Division II Championship, and suffered a loss at the hands of Virginia State. The men’s soccer squad also ended their historic season on that same day, as they lost to Charleston College by a score of 1-0 in the NCAA Quarterfinals.
The football team finished the year 8-4, and outscored their opponents by over a touchdown for the entire season. The Pioneers dominated the football, running over 200 more plays than their opponents—leading to more points and victories on the playing field.
Red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino completed 60 percent of his passes for 3,500 yards and 29 touchdowns. On the ground, he led the Pioneers in rushing with 609 yards and 19 touchdowns. Red- shirt sophomore tailback Mike Williams accumulated over 600 yards and three touchdowns. Laurino found a total of seven different players for touchdowns this season, led by red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer, who hauled in 10 scores. Right behind him was red-shirt sophomore receiver Shane Hubbard, who intercepted nine touchdowns.
On the defensive side of the ball, red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti led the team with 62 tackles and four interceptions. The defensive line was powered by senior lineman David Sumter, who amassed team-leading 9.5 sacks, and 15 tackles for a loss over the season.
The men’s soccer team finished the season 16-5-2 after a loss in the NCAA D-II National Championship Quarterfinals and, at one point, went on a 10-game winning streak. Senior captain Eivind Austboe scored a team high of 17 goals, and totaled 38 points. The Pioneers had timely contributions from multiple players throughout the year, which made them very dangerous. Graduate forward Dale McDonald scored nine goals, while junior midfielder Per Forgaard netted eight. Forgaard also led the team in assists with nine. Freshman forward Jason Lampkin provided the energy the team needed, and was clutch down the stretch of games, as he scored six goals on the season, two of which went for game winners.
Junior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom went 15-4-2 on the season, marking a close to 80 percent saving rate on all shots on goal. He pitched eight shutouts on the season. Perhaps Malmstrom’s best performance came against Southern New Hampshire in the second round of the Division II Championship. He gave up two early goals, but rebounded as the Pioneers battled back from a two-goal deficit in the final two minutes of action. With penalty kicks being needed to decide a winner, and with their season on the line, Malmstrom stopped multiple kicks that could have ended the Pioneer season in an absolute heartbreak.

Trailing by a point with just seconds remain- ing, freshman forward Jasmine Bailey beat the buzzer with a layup that gave the women’s basketball team a 66-65 win over Merrimack on Saturday, Nov. 29, in North Andover, Mass. The Pioneers (3-1) are now on a three-game winning streak after suffering a season-opening loss to Adelphi.
Throughout the majority of the contest, the Green and Gold found themselves fighting an uphill battle against the Warriors, despite jumping out on an early 7-2 lead. After senior guard Chelsea Wil- liams hit a jumper with just over 15 minutes to go in the first half, Merrimack went on a 16-0 run to grab an 18-7 advantage with just over seven minutes to go in the half.
Later, Williams knocked down two free throws just before the half ended, and the Pioneers went into the break trailing 35-22. Williams and senior guard Ashley Castle led the way for LIU Post in the first half. Both guards scored six points apiece. Junior center Nyasia Davis recorded seven first-half rebounds. Senior guard Chloe Rothman paced the scoring for the Warriors with a team-best of 13 first- half points.
In the latter stanza, the Pioneers came out shooting as they tried to chip away at the deficit. Merrimack extended their lead to 14 (50-36) after Allison Wagner hit a three-pointer with 13:16 to go in regulation, but LIU Post would re- spond in a colossal way.
The Green and Gold answered with a 22-5 run to take a 58-55 lead with just over six minutes left in the contest. Bailey led the way during the spurt, scoring seven points. Junior guard Khea Gibbs add- ed five, while Williams netted four. Castle and junior guard Quanisha Ratley each added three points.
Both teams traded leads until Rothman gave Merrimack a 65-64 edge with just eight seconds remaining. Then, with time winding down, Castle missed a shot in the paint, but Bailey was there to gather the offensive board and sink the buzzer beater, giving the Pioneers the 66-65 win.
Castle led the Pioneers with 17 points, going 4-of-7 from the three-point range. Williams added 16 points, while Bailey contributed nine. Davis collected 10 rebounds, and amassed six points. Rothman led all scorers with 19. Aria Johnson contributed a double- double, scoring 13 points and bringing down 10 rebounds for the Warriors.
Head Coach Deirdre Moore and her squad will face University of Bridgeport from Connecticut this afternoon, Dec. 3. Tipoff is set for 5 p.m.
