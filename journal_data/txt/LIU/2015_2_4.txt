Classes were cancelled after noon on Monday, Jan. 26, and all day on Tuesday, Jan. 27, at the beginning of the second week of the spring semester, due to winter storm Juno, which accumulated 20 inches of snowfall in some parts of Long Island.
Although classes were cancelled, the campus was not entirely shut down. Several food locations, including Winnick Dining Hall, Hillwood Café, Starbucks, and the End Zone, were open on Monday and Tuesday, with modified hours. The Pratt Recreation Center was open as well, with shorter hours. The Gold Coast Cinema was open both days, and held screenings of “Big Hero 6” and “The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay Part I.” The campus shuttle service had additional pickups at noon on Monday, but was suspended after 1 p.m., and all day Tuesday.
According to Dr. Jackie Nealon, Vice President of Campus Life and Enrollment, the Facilities Department has a clear plan on how to handle snowstorms. “The facilities team focuses on keeping perimeter roads cleared first, then plowing inner roads, clearing paths, and salting building steps and walkways.”
Cleaning the campus after a snowstorm is an obvious priority, but notifying students prior to storm is equally as important. “The university will notify the community immediately if the campus is closed, or if classes are cancelled or delayed. Students can also call the LIU Emergency Hotline at 516- 299-EMER for weather-related updates,” Nealon said.
Gregory Vavrinec, a junior Broadcasting major, felt that this process worked well last Monday and Tuesday. Vavrinec
is a commuter form Massapequa Park, so a late notification can be harmful to him. “Even though the snowstorm was not bad at the time, it could’ve made travel for the commuters on campus more dangerous and unsafe the longer they were at Post,” he said.
Although a day and half of classes were canceled, snowstorm Juno didn’t have a huge effect on the campus. My WCWP continued their scheduled programing for both days. There were no delays or cancellations for any of the sports, except for the men’s and women’s lacrosse teams, which had to practice on the football field that was quickly cleared of snowfall.
Classes were delayed on Monday, Feb. 2, until 10 a.m., and Tuesday, Feb. 3, until 9:30 a.m. Commuter students complained that the notification was a little too late, as some had already began the commute through the snow and ice. On Tuesday morning, a pipe burst in Brookville Hall, causing flooding in a couple of the dorm rooms.
“Our Facilities Department works hard to clear paths and parking lots to maintain a safe and accessible campus. In addition, Campus Life remained open to assist students in the residence halls, coordinate meals, and host programs for students who are on campus,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life.

Approximately 181 employees who are members of the Office of Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 153 across all Long Island University campuses have been working without a union contract since their agreement with the university expired on March 1, 2012. Negotiations are ongoing between the union and the university for a new agreement, according to the union’s chief negotiator, Nick Galipeau.
“It’s not unusual for a contract to expire,” said Galipeau. However, “it is incredibly unusual to be out of contract for the amount of time that we have been, and it’s very disheartening as well.” Galipeau continued, “Under the National Labor Relations Act, the terms and conditions of the old contract remain unless they’re renegotiated.” Galipeau explained that because of this, secretaries haven’t received a wage increase in almost three years. He added that the bargaining unit also represents audio-visual technicians, mailroom employees, and clerks on campus.
“The university has made repeated efforts to arrive at a mutually workable solution, one that acknowledges our Local 153 employees for their hard work in a fiscally responsible way,” read a joint statement from Gale Haynes, President and Chief Operating Officer of the University Counsel, and Jackie Nealon, Vice President of Enrollment and Student Life. “Americans face challenges in keeping up with the cost of living these days. It is our job to address those very real needs in a way that doesn’t negatively affect our ability to fund the many other areas of university life. This is critical to providing a quality education to our students at an affordable tuition rate.”
Since negotiations for a new contract have not yet been finalized, OPEIU members have been forced to pay a portion of their health insurance premiums with their own health fund monies, according to an article published in LIU Brooklyn’s paper about the negotiations.
“I can’t imagine having to pay a large percentage of my salary towards a premium share,” said Anna Gallo, a secretary for the Political Science and History departments, and shop steward for Local 153. “[The university] wants us to contribute to our medical, and we’re not opposed to that. [But] they want premium shares to be exact for everyone, whether you’re a secretary or a faculty member, and we do not make what faculty members make.” She continued, “It’s too disproportionate to have an 18 percent premium share across the board. And I understand [the university] wants uniformity, but you can’t have uniformity when the salaries [are] not uniform.”
Haynes and Nealon, in their statement, said the union demanded, “Their members contribute less in healthcare than similarly situated university employees.” They continued, “Our offer gradually brings the union members in line with every other university employee, ‘stepping up’ their contribution over 4 years.”
However, Gallo, on behalf of the union, explained that if the university expects the union members to pay the premium share, they want it in conjunction with a raise that could offset the cost of the contribution. “Right now there is no offer on the table that seems fair to [the union]. It’s too much of a pay cut where people are going to really have to look to subsidize their income to survive,” she added.
Galipeau mentioned that because the secretaries are working without a contract as of now, both they and the university could exercise certain actions that would be barred if a renewed agreement were in place. “In all contracts, you’re going to have what are called ‘no strike, no lockout’ clauses. So, if we did have a contract effective currently, our members would be bound not to strike, and the university would be bound to not lock us out. Since we are working without a contract, either side could choose to take those respective actions.” Although Gallo did not wish to comment on the potentiality of a union strike, The Pioneer is unaware of any plans by either the union or the university to take such actions.
Although the secretaries union has never gone on strike at Post– OPEIU members went on strike at Adelphi in December 2000 – other unions at the university have. The union representing the full time faculty members went on strike in both 2003 and 2011, protesting what they called bad faith bargaining procedures during contract negotiations.
The faculty strike in 2003 dealt with salary increases for faculty members on both LIU campuses. According to the article “L.I.U. Faculty Vote to Strike At C.W. Post And Brooklyn” published in The New York Times on Sept. 3, 2003, union leaders on both campuses “[were] unhappy about the university’s proposed salary increases, its efforts to increase the teaching load for professors conducting research, and to have new faculty members pay half of the cost of health care coverage for their families. Union officials said the university also declined to consider their proposals for higher pay and better health benefits for longtime adjuncts.” The 2003 strike was amicably resolved after three weeks.
In 2011, the full time faculty went on strike again. According to “Full Time C.W. Post Faculty Goes on Strike” published in The Pioneer on Sept. 14, 2011, members of the C.W. Post Collegial Federation (CWPCF), then comprised of approximately 300 full-time faculty, “went on strike in response to a said ‘walk out’ on contract negotiations by the university’s administration. The disagreement between the two parties involve[d] a wage proposal” that did not meet the satisfaction of the union members. In response to the walk out, CWPCF faculty picketed the Post campus with signs “detail[ing] information regarding their cause and affiliations with labor unions. Other signage contained messages directed at the administration.”
The 2011 strike was amicably resolved a few months after the old contract expired, resulting in a ratification of a new five-year contract for full-time faculty. According to the school’s website update on the matter, “The ratification mark[ed] the end of the faculty strike.”
As a result of the ongoing bargaining between the university and Local 153, Galipeau and other members of the union have mobilized in an attempt to put pressure on the university to negotiate a fair agreement. One such example occurred on Oct. 18, 2014, during Homecoming Weekend, when union members distributed t-shirts stating, “Please ask Pres. Cline why LIU hates its own workers.”
Galipeau confirmed that the bargaining unit was responsible for the t-shirts, and added, “When negotiating doesn’t work, the people need to put pressure on the employer. And the only thing that we’ve seen that’s allowed us to gain any ground is when we’ve put pressure on them.”
The following is a memorandum that was issued to the University Community following the publication of the article “Secretaries without Union Contracts.”

In the original article, it was stated that “Approximately 225 Post employees who are members of the Office of Professional Employees International Union Local 153 have been working without a union contract since their agreement with the university expired on March 1, 2012.” The correct number is 181 union members across both LIU campuses.

LIU Post is participating in RecycleMania for a fourth time this semester. The competition, which runs from Feb. 1 to March 28, is among colleges of equal size competing in waste reduction activities. This year, approximately 400 schools from 47 states and one Canadian province have registered for the competition, which is divided into four categories; Recycle, Reuse, Reduce and Zero Waste.
For eight consecutive weeks, colleges across the United States and Canada will be ranked by RecycleMania, a non-profit organization, according to their weekly reports on the school’s amount of recycling and trash collected. The schools will be ranked according to which one recycles the most per capita, and the best recycling rate based on their total waste percentage.
The competition will last for two weeks. Recycle, the first category focuses on recycling cans, bottles, paper and compost, and started on Sunday, Feb. 1; it ends on Saturday, Feb. 14. The second category, Reuse, focuses on reusing items such as water bottles, and travel mugs. It will start on Sunday, Feb. 15 and end on Feb.28. The third category, Reduce, focuses on waste prevention such as using double sided printing, and starts on March 1 and ends on March 14. The fourth category, Zero Waste, focuses on a holistic understanding of conserving resources and reducing waste, based on the other three categories. It will start on March 15 and end on March 28.
The Sustainability Committee at LIU Post encourages students to participate in the competition by reporting their recycling activities. Post students are encouraged to take a selfie while doing a waste reduction action. Submit your selfie as a tweet, and make sure to use unique keywords such as “recycle”, “reduce” or “reuse,” related to the action in your selfie, and include three hashtags, #WeAreGreen, #RM2015 and #WeAreLIUPost. Selfies should be submitted to @RecycleManiacs or texted to 21212. By using the three hastags, Post gets points for their students’ actions. Another way to submit is to download and use the free Mobile App myActions.
There is no limit to how many actions students can submit, and the more submissions each school has collected using the hashtags connected to their school, the more points the school earns. Any recognized waste reduction action students contribute from Feb. 1 till March 28 will earn a point regardless of the category. For example, a student posting a selfie of themselves with a reusable mug will earn a point for their school during the entire eight-week period.
All schools enter each category with zero points, and earn one point for every reported action. Every two weeks, scores for each category are counted individually. On the website recyclemania.org, the total points each school has throughout the two-week period are displayed, and then start over when the next category starts. The winners of each category are based on total actions reported from students at each of the colleges that are participating. Then, the overall winners will be calculated based on the total of all four categories for their population group. Winners will be announced by the RecycleMania Committee in mid-April, and will receive a national RecycleMania championship title and an accompanying award.
In 2014, LIU Post finished in 192nd place out of 256 schools in their division, recycling 47,580 pounds of materials. A total of 460 schools competed last year.
Rachel Hass, a junior Design major, is excited about the event. “I think it’s a wonderful idea and I hope we win. Recycling is already pretty big at our school and it would be great to increase it even more, and put more emphasis on using reusable water bottles instead of buying new ones,” Hass said.
The LIU Post Sustainability Committee, which is overseeing the RecycleMania contest on campus, was established in 2010. It consists of administrators, faculty, and students with one goal in mind: to make LIU Post a more sustainable place. The committee welcomes input from everybody on campus, and its meetings are open to everyone.
The next scheduled meeting will be held on March 4, in Hillwood 115 at 12:30 p.m. The Sustainability Committee can be found on Twitter @LIUPostGreen, on the Facebook group LIUPostGreen, on Instagram @ LIUPostGreen, and on their website is at liu.edu/post/green.

Finding the correct phone number for professors and staff has frustrated some students, who have found that the online campus directory is not up to date with information about current faculty and staff members. Dated phone numbers and email addresses are listed on the website, and, in some cases, professors who no longer work at LIU Post are still listed under their former departments.
Lorraine Tejpal, a former staff member of the Disability Services department, is still listed as the Senior Assistant Director. A former professor, T.K. Blue, is still listed as an Assistant Professor of Music.
Anthony Chung, a junior English major, tried to find the phone number for Michael Berthel, the Director of the Campus Life department, and stated that his number was not listed at all. Some professors who do work at the university are not listed in the directory at all. Yet, some students have not had problems finding the information that they need.
Anthony Sforza, a senior English Literature major, has not had trouble finding contact information online. “The online directory is practical and serves its purpose,” said Sforza. “I only used it to look up people in the Foreign Language department and the study abroad office, and in my experience it worked fine.” The efficiency of the online directory seems to depend upon whose information a student is trying to access.
Cheuk Liu, Director of Technical Support in the IT Department confirmed that although the campus directory is not updated daily, it is updated, and the updates vary depending upon requests. Liu claims that the IT Department has good resources to update the directory.
The frustration that students have experienced seems to be the cure for an updated campus directory. As complaints reach Human Resources, the requests are then forwarded to the IT Department.
Juan Sengco, who works at systems in the IT Department at LIU Brooklyn, also confirmed that the campus directory is updated upon request and not by a set schedule; therefore, updates are incalculable. Sengco said that they receive update requests from Human Resources, and then the IT Department puts the requests in a queue. The IT department updates the information, “as soon as possible.” Sengco mentioned that LIU Brooklyn and LIU Post share a queue, and that it’s possible that mix-ups between the two occur.
Students who cannot find current information can contact Human Resources to inform them about missing information. Students can also call the school’s general phone number at 516-299-2000 to receive updated information. Alternatively, students can walk into the department of the person they are trying to find.

From Jan. 11 to the 14, the Office of Campus Life held a Student Leadership Retreat for the leaders of student organizations on campus. The goal was to better their interactions with their club members and the campus as a whole. Sixty-five students attended the three-day program at the YMCA Camp in Greenkill, N.Y., which included a series of speakers, team builders, and sessions on building an inclusive and fun campus.
Amal Zeidan, the President of Brothers and Sisters in Christ College Ministries (BASIC), attended the event, and felt that there was not a dull moment, describing the retreat as a “vacation.” BASIC became a club in spring 2014, and their goal is to help students grow, and expand their relationships with others and God.
A lesson taught at the retreat was that being a club leader is more than delegating roles, but building a deep bond with your club members. “The retreat reconfirmed that personal relationships are eternal and better than just job titles in a club,” Zeiden stated.
One of the highlights of the retreat was keynote speaker Tom Kreiglstein. Kreiglstein learned how to lead when he founded Discounted Depot, his first business, which he began while he was in college. He also founded Student Launcher, which was designed to help student leaders fundraise online. He informed the students on how to be better leaders in their own organizations, “by branching out and stretching an arm to someone who is less interested in campus activities,” Zeidan said.
Abagail Van Vlerah, LIU Post’s Dean of Students, felt that even though only 50 student organizations attended this retreat, the campus could feel the impact. “Events like the Student Leadership Retreat help build an informed campus community, and motivate our student leaders. In turn, these students bring that renewed spirit back to campus,” Van Vlerah said.
A similar event was held last year, according to Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life. Due to the event’s success, Berthel said that the retreat was reworked to include more student leaders and add a professional keynote speaker this year.
“The event was a complete success, and we are going to continue to offer the Student Leadership Retreat on an annual basis,” Berthel added. “These types of events give us an opportunity to work with all of our student leaders to make significant improvements to campus life.”
Next year, Campus Life will hold the retreat during the fall semester in hopes to have all 80 Post clubs in attendance. As for this spring, Campus Life plans to hold events exclusively for Greek leaders. This retreat will be a three-day program held on campus. “We want to continue the dialogue on how to improve the experience [in] our fraternities and sororities,” said Berthel.

On Feb. 10 and 11, a start-up company called SavvyRoo will be holding a free sign up for the beta launch of their new product SavvyRooU, an online program that helps students build data portfolios, for LIU Post students.
SavvyRooU is a program used to help teach students build data blogs, which consist of compelling data visuals and powerful language to create portfolios that differentiate themselves in their job search. Post students will be able to sign up for SavvyRooU for free – a product that is estimated to range from $89 to $399.
SavvyRoo is a social media platform that can be used for free; the forum was originally created in 2013. CEO Noah Blumenthal and co- founder and CTO Stephen Ostermiller’s original goal was to launch a social media website that delves into the facts behind dishonesty in the news through the concept of sharing visual data such as charts and graphs. SavvyRoo makes it easy to share, link, and find valuable data, providing a platform for communities to put their data together in one place, and for individuals with data to easily share this information on a site where people are specifically looking for data, according to SavvyRoo’s website.
“Our passion has always been in the political space. We primarily focus on climate change, state of the union, [and] LGBT issues,” said Blumenthal. SavvyRoo is also a platform for anybody to create their own profile and create the content that they want to build.
The SavvyRoo team began to notice that students who were using their platform were using the data portfolios and blogs they created on SavvyRoo in their job applications. “Time after time students were coming to us and saying that they had links to their portfolios in their job applications, and they were told by their hiring manager that they
either got an interview or got the job itself because of their portfolios on SavvyRoo,” said Blumenthal. “It creates such a window into a student’s ability to be proactive, [their] analytical ability, creativity and thoughtfulness.”
After hearing the success stories of students who were SavvyRoo users, SavvyRoo decided to create a product tailored specifically for helping students find career opportunities, as well as set them apart in a competitive job market. The product was dubbed SavvyRooU. “We’re teaching students how to data blog and how to differentiate [themselves in] the marketplace and get a job. We have some pretty effective techniques that completely change the nature of the job search. Lastly, we teach students how to be a star performer at their job and accelerate your career path,” Blumenthal said.
LIU Post has been approved by the state for StartUpNY funding. “StartUpNY is a state government program that helps businesses start, expand, or relocate to a tax-free zone,” explained Michael Glickman, LIU’s Chief of Strategic Partnerships and University Advancement. “LIU applied for a START-UP designation, and was recently chosen to participate in the program.” LIU Post is one of four colleges that are participating in the beta launch of SavvyRooU alongside Baruch College and the University of Virginia.
SavvyRoo is one of the start-up companies that have applied for office space in Bush Brown Hall at LIU’s University Center. “We were invited by [the university] to submit an application for the LIU StartUpNY program,” said Kathleen Reynolds, a partner of SavvyRoo. “We have had a number of meetings with Dr. Cline and members of [the] LIU faculty and administration about becoming a part of StartUpNY, and partnering with LIU. We are now waiting to hear from the LIU advisory committee if we’ve been approved.”

Since the fall 2014 semester, many of the school’s health services have been provided at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) campus on Northern Boulevard at the intersection of Valentines Lane, instead of on the LIU Post campus.
Those services include family medicine, breast health services, occupational therapy, and physical medicine and rehab. There is still a nurse who works in Pell Hall that can help students with basic issues, like taking temperatures, and who can advise them to go see a doctor at NYIT if necessary.
Students who wish to see a doctor or have tests, including blood tests, need to schedule an appointment at the NYIT Academic Health Care Center. According to NYIT’s website, the “Academic Health Care Center provides primary care services to the community at large,” which now includes Post students, since the campus no longer provides its own doctor.
There are several options for students who do not have cars on campus to get to NYIT. The off campus shuttle makes a stop at NYIT by the health center. The shuttle picks up students from the front of the chapel, which is the first stop, and then it makes drop offs and pickups at NYIT, Pathmark, and Moe’s. The shuttle runs Sunday to Saturday from noon to 4 p.m. Copies of the shuttle schedule are available at the Hillwood concierge desk.
Kirsten Manno, a sophomore Math major, has used the health services at NYIT. “I am going to the NYIT physical therapy center for my foot; it is a little inconvenient to have to drive over there, but the center is really nice and the staff is really sweet,” Manno said.
“The transition [to the NYIT health office], although it did take [a] little getting used to by the community, has been a smooth one, and up to this point it has been working beautifully,” said Jean Anne Smith, LIU Post’s Associate Dean of Students.
The center at NYIT has family physicians, which “are able to give referrals to various specialists for further diagnostic work-up while still caring for the patient on a regular basis,” according to their website. “Most students come to see the family practitioners, but our staff is prepared to handle most non-emergency medical issues or complications that students may have,” said Dr. Brian Harper, the medical director of the Academic Health Center.
According to NYIT’s website, the health services offered on their campus include “departments of Family Practice, Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, as well as physical, occupational, speech therapists and exercise physiologists.” Depending on a student’s insurance and their level of coverage, they may or may not have to pay for their visit. “We will bill the students insurance. If a student is without insurance, the cost of the first visit is $125 and any visit after that is
$75. This does not include any special testing,” such as lab work, said Dr. Harper.
Samantha Capofarri, a senior Early Child Education major, who has also used the NYIT health services, said, “I did like going over there for physical therapy, and all the doctors there were so nice, very professional, and really helped me a lot when I got hurt. You would be amazed at how much they can really do for you at NYIT.”
The center at NYIT also provides psychological services. “We have a psychologist on site Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and the cost without insurance is $125 per visit,” said Dr. Harper. For psychological services, LIU Post has also partnered “with the North Shore LIJ Behavioral Health College Partnership program,” according to Associate Dean Smith.
For more information about the partnership with North Shore students can visit, https://www.northshorelij.com/find-care/services- we-offer/behavioral-health-college-partnership or call 888-321-3627 with any questions regarding these services.
The LIU Post Center for Healthy Living is open Mondays through Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Pell Hall, rooms 154 and 155. “Students are encouraged to utilize the center for any of their health related needs. A registered nurse, social workers, and counselors are available, as always, to provide assistance,” said Adam Grohman, Associate Dean of Students. When students contact the Center for Healthy Living the staff can help them locate the services they need.
To schedule an appointment with available physician, or ask additional questions, students can call the Academic Health Care Center at NYIT, at 516-686-1300 or visit their website at, http://www.nyit.edu/ medicine/clinics/services_ahcc_OW.
In the event of an emergency that requires immediate medical attention, students should contact Public Safety at 516-299-2222.

Beginning Monday, Feb. 2, the Center for Healthy Living will offer “Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation” every Monday in the Hillwood Commons TV Room, from 1 to 1:30 p.m. for students and faculty. Mindfulness Meditation is an adaptation of Buddhist Vipassana meditation, in which an individual becomes mindful of themselves and their surroundings, thus unconditionally accepting the present.
Recently, organizations across America have been promoting Mindfulness Meditation programs. According to Anderson Cooper’s Dec. 14, interview on “60 Minutes” about his experience in meditation, the practice reaps bountiful benefits for the participant, including increased energy, improved sleep, less anxiety and depression, and a stronger immune system.
James D’Aconti, an intern in the Center for Healthy Living and second year graduate Social Work student at Adelphi, and fellow intern and second year graduate Social Work student at NYU Sadia Halim, decided to run a Mindfulness Meditation program at LIU Post this semester.
Three years ago, D’Aconti stumbled across a meditation video by Dr. Jon Kabat Zinn on YouTube. “The video resonated with me,” he said, and when Dr. Zinn invited the YouTube viewers to follow along in the meditation, D’Aconti felt “that this was a turning point in my life.” D’Aconti then took an eight-week course in Mindfulness stress reduction during which he meditated every day. At first, he took the course just for himself, but when Lynne Schwartz, Director of the Center for Healthy Living, saw how passionate he was about Mindfulness Meditation, she urged him to immerse students and faculty at LIU Post into the same practice.
Schwartz noted that the upcoming weekly meditations are good for relaxing students and faculty stressed with a rigorous schedule. During the meditations, D’Aconti will start with ringing a bell three times and having the participants feel the rings and clear their minds.
“You must pay attention to something other than what you are thinking of,” D’Aconti explained about reaching the meditative state. I was given the opportunity to try this Mindfulness Meditation, and by the guidance of D’Aconti, I felt like I was stepping out of time. When the bell rings, you feel all surrounding sounds mute and you feel drawn to focus on the oscillating sound waves of the bell. It is truly a remarkable experience, difficult to describe, but easy to feel; one that is definitely soothing for a busy mind.
Last semester, D’Aconti conducted the meditation sessions for three College 101 classes and a faculty group. Now, he and Schwartz are looking forward to bringing the meditation to an even wider audience. “We would love to have more student representation,” Schwartz said. The Monday sessions will be open to everyone on campus, faculty included.
Among some of the other programs offered by the Center for Healthy Living are the Red Flag and the BRAVE Campaign. The Red Flag Campaign is a public awareness campaign designed to address dating violence and promote the prevention of dating violence on college campuses. The BRAVE Campaign is aimed towards combatting bullying.
The Center for Healthy Living is located in the Life Science Building, in rooms 155 and 154. For more information about the Mindfulness Meditation and other programs offered by the Center for Healthy Living, students can contact Lynne Schwartz at 516- 299-3468.

The Corporation for National & Community Service (CNCS) has named LIU Post in the general community service category in the 2014 President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. This is the second consecutive year, but third overall year, that Post has received this honor.
The CNCS initiative states that, “The President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, launched in 2006, annually highlights the role colleges and universities play in solving community problems, and placing students on a lifelong path of civic engagement by recognizing institutions that achieve meaningful, measurable outcomes in the communities they serve.”
According to the school’s website, “students commit approximately 20,000 hours of community service every year.” Some of the ways Post students have demonstrated community service are by building homes in Mexico, developing fundraising strategies for local charities, organizing holiday toy drives, volunteering at local soup kitchens, working with disabled children, and raising awareness and funds for causes such Race for the Cure and Relay for Life.
“I, among many others, prepared meals for residents [at] a halfway house. It was a rewarding and fulfilling experience, and it gets you involved on campus in something that’s bigger than just yourself,” said Jawaan Smith, a junior Arts Management major.
“The Honor Roll’s Presidential Award is the highest federal recognition an institution can receive for its commitment to community, service-learning, and civic engagement,” according to the CNCS website. “Service and higher education go hand in hand,” said Wendy Spencer, CEO of CNCS.
“Being named to the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll is an achievement that highlights the myriad efforts completed by our campus in service to its community at large,” said Adam Grohman, associate dean of students. “I think our entire campus community should take pride in such a laurel, and allow it to serve as a benchmark for us to strive for annually.”
The CNCS collaborates with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as the American Council on Education, Campus Compact, and the Interfaith Youth Core to administer the awards.
The President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll application states, “Honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors, including the scope and innovation of service projects and measurable community outcomes as a result of the service,” and that “recognition will be given to institutions that demonstrate relevant and meaningful service and achieve measurable impacts in the community.”
“I volunteered for the SIBS Club, which is designed to help children with autism better interact with their siblings,” said Samantha Mangiaracina, a junior Speech-Language Pathology major. “Helping children learn critical skills that will last a lifetime is a feeling you can’t put into words.”
“I am extremely proud of our students at LIU Post for their well-known commitment to service and volunteerism in the Long Island community, [and] in the New York metropolitan region and around the world,” said President Cline. “The 2014 Presidential Honor Roll for Service provides another validation for LIU’s year of transformational emergence and recognition. Congratulations, and thanks to all of our students who shared their time and talents with others in need.”

The Browse technology store on the second floor of Hillwood Commons reopened on Jan. 5 for its second semester on campus, after being closed over the holidays. “Sales have increased since our launch last fall,” said George Baroudi, LIU’s vice president of Information Technology. “This past holiday season we experienced robust sales, and at the beginning of the spring 2015 semester we are seeing even stronger sales.”
The technology store opened on Oct. 10, 2014. It sells technological products, from laptops and PlayStations to phone chargers and earphones.
Ilana Moskowitz, a graduate student in School Counseling who also works at Browse, claims that the first couple of months of sales during the fall semester were a little bit slow, but once Browse had its grand opening event on Nov. 17, everything started to pick up. “The sales are picking up with this new semester and the store is getting busier. Currently this is the most traffic and sales it has received,” Dozier said. The store was closed from Dec. 24 to Jan. 5.
Browse sells IPhone chargers, Xbox consoles, MacBooks, GoPro cameras, Beats headphones, wireless earphones, portable phone chargers, and other products. “The best thing is if you can’t find what you want here, you can put it on the wish list and then we can try to order it for the store,” Dozier said. “We have such a big variety of products so that way we can cater to everybody’s interests.” Most of the products are coming directly from the company of their respective brands.
The store has hired 12 student employees this semester, from different years and majors. Lynne Gerde, an IT specialist, manages Browse. Gerde, who is currently the only non-student worker at the store, most recently worked as the lead genius at an Apple store, controlling the genius repair bar.
Browse, according to Gerde, is funded by the IT department and has big plans to expand in the near future. “There will be a training room designed to help professors utilize the latest instructional technology.
We are also planning to offer new products such as the Microsoft Surface and Google Chrome books,” Baroudi explained.
According to Baroudi, next month, students will also have the opportunity to receive tutoring and training. “We are going to start giving courses for people who are not too tech-savvy in the room [next to] us, which was emptied out for this purpose,” said Dozier. The classes will last for about 30 to 90 minutes, and will be technological workshop and personal enrichment classes for students. The classes will begin running next month, according to Moscuell. They are still finalizing the specific pricing for the workshops, but he believes that it will cost approximately $25 an hour.
Students are still welcome to use the help desk at the IT department in the library to ask questions. “I don’t think I would personally use the classes, just because I am not really interested in spending money on something like that,” said Marisa Kofmehl, a junior Public Relations major. “I do think it’s a good idea for students who are willing to pay to further their understandings in technology.”
Browse will also be adding repair services for students with broken devices next month, according to Gerde. There will be technicians who will repair the products, and the cost will depend on the type of damage of the product. She also stated that there will be a trading program where you can earn credit towards a new purchase. “The trading program should be fully running by next month,” Moscuell said. “The way it work[s] is that if you bring in your IPhone 4, you can trade it in and get about $150 for it and put it towards another purchase.”
Gerde believes that the fact that Browse’s inventory is based on student demand makes it a very unique tech store, which is conveniently located on campus. The LIU Brooklyn campus will also be opening its own version of Browse next month.
Browse is open Monday to Fridays from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The phone number is 516 -299-22500 and students can follow Browse on social media at facebook.com/ BrowseLIUPost.

With the start of the spring semester, seniors are buckling down and getting ready to embark into the world beyond LIU Post. So what do these seniors have to say about their experiences at college?
Music major Amanda Kloos is hoping that her last semester will never end, even though she will be doing a six-month internship at Walt Disney World after graduation. “I am [more sad] and stressed than anything,” she said.
Fine Arts major Susie Kelly, on the other hand, is excited. “I feel good about my last semester—like I finally did it,” Kelly said.
Dillon Idone, a Film major, agreed with Kloos and Kelly. “It’s one big bag of emotions,” he explained, “I can’t see the future, so it’s taking a leap of faith into the real world and hoping something sticks.”
Even Business Administration major Darnell Davy agreed, “It is bittersweet. However I am ready to move on with the next part of my life,” he said, excited to turn his internship as a financial representative at Northwestern Mutual into a full-time career upon graduation.
The individual experiences of these seniors at Post differed greatly. Idone, who is working on a thesis film in the vain of “American Psycho,” pegs his favorite class to be Production Lab. This course offered an abundance of creative freedom, which was combined with the opportunity to produce films in small groups of students.
On the other hand, Kelly said, “I don’t know if I have a favorite class, but more like a favorite place to be.” She noted that the printmaking studio is always full of art and creative energy, seeping from the walls. She felt at home in the studio, where, “for the first time in my life,” she said, “I felt like an artist.”
What did these seniors take away from their college experiences? “College is a time to better yourself as a whole, and take the moments to explore how your personality really works in the world,” Kloos said.
Others say they appreciated being treated as an individual. Kelly was given the opportunity to attend Post after her father worked here for many years. “I can finally thank him properly for all the things he has done for me…I came to create and explore…[and] I gained experience I wouldn’t get anywhere else, and memories I wouldn’t trade for anything,” she said. Idone agreed that, “having some fantastic experiences with [good friends] is my favorite part of going here, and I wouldn’t give it up for anything.”
For Davy, attending the recent Midnight Madness was one of his favorite experiences — especially since he won a TV. But overall, “whether it was students, administrators, or professors, everyone was helpful and easy to talk to,” Davy said.
Film major Ian Boswell held a similar opinion. “There were sleepless nights,” he admitted, “but there was a list of things I wanted to do and I accomplished all of that. So long as I was willing to put in the hours and the work, I was never met with a ‘no.’ ”
Kelly also had some advice for current and incoming students: “I would tell my younger self, ‘If you’re afraid to look stupid, then nothing good will ever happen to you.’ ” This is what pushed Kelly, and undoubtedly many other Post seniors, towards a future she is looking forward to upon graduation. Davy sheds other words of wisdom about the convenience of college life. “Enjoy the convenience and don’t rush to grow up,” he said. “You can only get older from today on.”
And finally, Boswell would leave you with some simple advice: if people try to pull you into their drama, simply look at them and say, “Not my circus, not my monkeys!”

It seems pretty guaranteed that almost every person in the world, let alone at the mighty college of LIU Post, set themselves a New Year’s resolution: “I need to get more fit,” “I am going to join a gym,” or my favorite, “I’m going to eat healthier this year.” We all know that these very farfetched and almost impossible tasks are completely ruled out after the first or second weekend, right? However, some of these goals and targets are reachable.
For example, I have set myself the target to get more fit for next soccer season. Being on a sports team where we have our own individual fitness programs, as well as being an athlete, simplifies the task. But the tough remains to stay disciplined and focused on the task you have set.
For many students (including myself), we set these resolutions on New Year’s Day when we are on our Christmas break at home. Generally the first week is great, we are feeling healthy, energetic, and proud of ourselves. But then comes the time to return to college, and all of the distractions and temptations begin to return into your everyday life.
We get asked questions like, “Hey, how was your holiday…Happy Hour on Friday?” This is one of the first questions I got asked when I was back. After this conversation, one of my promises not to drink too much began to rot away and never come back. This must have happened to nearly every student who likes to spend their Friday nights down at the Hofstra bars, and I know that they must have felt the same way.
Although I really do believe in “having a fresh start to a new year,” I still think we have to be rational and smart about how we make these resolutions. We have to make sure they stick and make sure they are realistic for ourselves at this particular time in our lives. For example, a college student making a resolution not to drink and to stop partying too hard is nuts! At this time and at this age, I feel we should enjoy ourselves, especially since= we are at college.
However, I also think that we should follow our goals we set on that hangover-morning of January 1. If this means going to the gym once or twice a week, followed by a “huge partying sesh” on Friday or Saturday, then so be it. Keep your healthy principles you’ve set yourselves ticking! Ask yourself the question: “Have I kept to my New Years resolution?” And even though most of us will say, “Nah, probably not.” We can try and get back on track.

It may not be last year’s ‘Polar Vortex,’ but nonetheless, this winter season is just as brutal as the last one. With winter break at its end, and January coming to a close, some students are returning to school along with the hopes that warmer weather will do the same.
“It is the coldest weather since the region was hit last year by a polar vortex, which is a mass of frigid air that typically only resides over the north pole,” according to Karl Plume, writer for CNBC, in his Jan. 7
article. “I’m not sure, but I think I can speak for every commuter on campus when I say the trip gets to be challenging when the weather turns sour,” Pat Conte, a junior Business Administration major, said. “Accidents happen on Northern Boulevard, and walking across campus at times when it’s blistering cold, can challenge your sanity,” Conte continued.
“It absolutely sucks going around campus when it’s cold,” sophomore Journalism major Alec Matuszak said. “Going outside feels like a never ending journey longer than the ‘Lord of the Rings’ Trilogy,” he added.
In light of recent weather severity, Post students find ways in battling the cold weather.
As for Conte, it’s all about time and preparation. “I dress in layers and make sure I come to campus early enough that I get a good parking spot; therefore, reducing my walk to the hall that my class is in,” she said.
“Thankfully, my newfound love of Starbucks’ hot chocolate has allowed me to get to and from class,” Matuszak said. “All the while, staying a little bit warmer.”

Greek Life’s spring semester recruitment began for sororities on Tuesday, Feb. 3, at 7:30 p.m. in The Tilles Center Atrium, and will begin for fraternities on Monday, Feb. 9, at 5:30 p.m. in Humanities room 119.
There are 16 Greek Life organizations on campus, including Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Phi Sorority, and Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity, just to name a few.
If you are questioning whether you should participate in Greek Life, attending recruitment might help make your decision. Katherine Wieme, Greek Life and Student Involvement Director, said that Greek organizations on campus are designed to reach the most amount of students and showcase how fraternities and sororities can benefit an individual. She also said that each organization is different, and their forms of recruitment vary. In addition to the existing Greek organizations on campus, Greek Life and the Office of Campus Life are working together to bring new fraternities and sororities to campus, giving students more options to be placed in a group where they want to belong.
Joining Greek Life is all about taking a risk, according to Jessica Feliciano, a junior Digital Arts and Design major. Feliciano, who is a member of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority, said that she was nervous of the responsibility to represent a group of girls. Breana Martinez, a junior English major who also belongs to Alpha Xi Delta, agreed, and said she was also worried about whether or not this group of girls was going to like her. For her, the stereotypes presented on TV were what kept her on the fence about pledging, but taking the initiative to attend recruitment and meetings was what helped making up her mind. “I realized that I met the best group of women I can surround myself with,” Martinez said.
“And since LIU Post is a non-hazing school, finding a group of women who never discouraged me, never forced me to do anything I didn’t want to, and welcomed me from the start made me feel comfortable with joining a sorority,” she said.
Martinez also said that finding a Greek organization that makes you comfortable requires you to desensitize yourself from all the bad things you have read, seen, or heard beforehand. “You have to rid yourself of the stigma because no one is going to be a better judge of character than you are,” she said.
Wieme reassured students that, at LIU Post, hazing during pledging won’t be an issue. “All members must attend an anti-hazing workshop each semester, review and submit risk management policies and plans to the [fraternity or sorority’s] national office and the University, submit a detailed new member education program and packet, and new members meet with University staff and student leaders throughout their program,” she said.
Sophomore Criminal Justice major Pavlos Pavlatos, of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, said that Greek Life is not just about the fun; joining his fraternity made him realize that Greek life creates bonds that last a lifetime. “Whether it’s just hanging out in a dorm or grabbing a bite to eat, we have one another’s backs,” Pavlatos said. ”If any one of us needs help with anything from schoolwork or anything else, there’s always someone there to help. You realize that when you spend all this time with your brothers, you make bonds that will never be broken.”
Martinez and Feliciano expressed the same feelings about their sorority. Martinez said that although they are a diverse group of women, the activities they participate in allow them to find out what makes them all similar. “No matter what we do, I can always find a sister who will support me in anything,” Feliciano said.
Some students worry that joining Greek Life would create a distraction from their other responsibilities. In the case of junior Psychology major Marianna Scalise, who attended recruitment last spring, she realized it would be hard to balance being part of a sorority with school and work.
“Some people have a bad view of Greek life,” Scalise said. ”But having friends who are a part of it, I know that they are also involved in a lot of positive programs. As much as I want to be a part of that, I knew it couldn’t fit my schedule,” she continued.
Martinez suggested otherwise, saying that being involved in a group of women who share the same mission makes school easier and more enjoyable. “If it wasn’t for Greek life, I wouldn’t be as organized as I am today. With my sorority, we have mandatory study hours where we all go to the library and study together,” she said
According to Wieme, the Office of Campus Life holds all fraternities and sororities to high standards. “We truly believe that they represent the very best of our student population. Greek organizations must meet minimum requirements to maintain their recognition, which include a minimum of five active members, submission of semester paperwork, maintenance of a minimum GPA per organization, and adherence to University and national policies and rules.
Feliciano, Martinez, and Pavlatos all believe that it’s important to be yourself if you want to be recognized into a Greek Life organization. Pavlatos also said there are many other aspects Greek Life groups look for when recruiting new members, particularly in his own fraternity.
“For one, teamwork is essential, especially when it comes to things such as community service or fundraising,” Feliciano said. ”Character, as well, the brothers of TKE are gentlemen.” Feliciano said that her sorority just wants to see girls who are outgoing and love expressing who they truly are. “Show us strong leadership, loyalty and commitment, and most likely you’ll get recruited,” she said.

Sweaty palms, nervous laughter, cheeks as red as a tomato — this is basically what happens when a student or even a professor gets embarrassed in the classroom. Students and professors spend so much time in these classrooms that, sooner or later, embarrassing moments are bound to occur. Here are some funny and entertaining stories of some of the most embarrassing moments of LIU Post students and professors.
Picture this: You are standing in front of everyone in class to give a presentation and five minutes in you realize that what you were presenting was in fact for another class. Quite embarrassing, right?
Well, this is something that did happen to Diana Zysk, a junior Business major. “I went up there ready to give my presentation and then I realized I had mixed up the presentation with one for another class,” Zysk said. “I almost died, I could not believe I actually embarrassed myself like that.”
But for Zysk, embarrassing herself in the classroom seems to be a regular thing. Although it has happened in college, she believes that she has been embarrassed in high school more often than now. Zysk said that it always happened during tests or serious moments in class. One day she had an important chemistry test, which she claims was really hard, therefore she wrote down the equations on a piece of paper. “So I had the paper in my hand and then the professor started to walk around the classroom and suddenly she walked by me and looked at me,” Zysk said. “I got really nervous so I ate the paper.”
Apparently, getting embarrassed for being caught cheating in high school is a common thing among students. Maria Walker, a sophomore Childhood Education major, had a very similar story to Zisk, but instead of eating the paper she was asked to sit on her one hand for the rest of the test. “I was presenting an Italian test and there was this one word that I could never remember, so I wrote it down on the palm of my hand,” said Walker. “During the middle of the test I went to look at it and my teacher walked up to me and asked to see my hand. When she saw the word written down she told me I had to spend the rest of the entire exam sitting on that hand. Everyone was just staring. It was terrible.”
Sometimes an embarrassing moment in the classroom can leave such an impact on a person that it might even lead them to change their major. Natasha Vaughn, a senior Spanish Education major, remembers a moment of her freshman year. Vaughn wasn’t always a Spanish Education major; when she first started her career, she began as a Chemistry Education major. “One day in Chem. 4, I raised my hand and asked a question pertaining to the likelihood of letters repeating
in an equation,” said Vaughn. “The professor responded with, ‘that is a question for the inquisitive mind, and the inquisitive mind has no business in the sciences.’” Vaughn recalls being terribly embarrassed after that incident, “Not only was I mortified but I also changed my major soon after.”
Who would have thought that a cold could make you feel embarrassed in the middle of class? Khadijah Swann, a junior Photography major, is living proof that it in fact can make your cheeks turn red and want to dig a whole to crawl into. During her English class, as the teacher was reading a piece of literature, Swann was caught in the middle of a coughing attack. She said she tried her best to keep the cough in, but that only made it worse, making her cough even more. “It was terrible, I felt like I was suffocating and then I just full on started to cough in the middle of her reading,” Swann said. “I had to leave the room quickly to get a drink of water and then I had to walk back in with everyone looking at me. I now make sure to bring a cough drop or take cough medicine before class.”
However, students aren’t the only ones to get embarrassed in the classroom. Teachers experience this same problem sometimes. Sandra Mardenfeld, the Director of the Journalism program, claims she has had moments that you could call embarrassing in the classroom. One time while she was pregnant, she was in the middle of a lecture when she suddenly started to get morning sickness and threw up in the middle of her lecture. “It happened so quickly that my students were just in shock,” Mardenfeld said.
Although many students and even professors have experienced some sort of embarrassment in the classroom, looking back, they are able to laugh at the memories.
Do you have any embarrassing moments you’d like to share with us? Who knows? They may even appear on our next issue of the Pioneer! Email us at liupostpioneer@gmail.com
