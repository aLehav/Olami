1. It would be cool if you guys can take pictures ofr random students around campus. I know  I would feel good seeing myself in the paperhave a good feeling to see myself in a paper. It creates some sort of a celeb/student status – . kinda like  make an on campus gossip section. I don’t know, it’s just an idea. The 1st edition was great, like all the rest and near future printed papers. Real professional!
Peace

2. Hi Pioneer staff,
If I could change things I’d have articles based more on world news, not just issues that effect the average frat boy. Many students aren’t aware of activities on campus, so doing articles on those clubs might be a good idea at the beginning of the year. However, more detailed articles on our government and current events would be great. Also, while I feel like it’s important that the arts section be expanded and worked upon, the combination of Loomings and the paper is a poor choice. The magazine was beautiful and the picture quality suffers when artwork is printed on newsprint. There is also even less attention on the arts on campus now that there is no publication. It’s too bad that Loomings is understaffed.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
E. Amaral
3. Hello,
I would like to see recaps of professional sports teams in the newspaper. Something about the Jets, Giants, N baseball teams, basketball teams, etc. I think it would be a nice touch to the paper and would grab a bigger audience.
Ps: Tthis is Ppaul from broadcast 25 and I told you I would e-mail you!
Sent via BlackBerry by AT&T
4. I would like to see more movie reviews in the paper!

5. To “The Pioneer”,
Hello. Recently I read the first the first issue of The Pioneer and saw the ad in the back about “what you’d like to see”; so here I go! I am a currently enrolled Art student at the C.W. Post campus. I would love to do a comic strip per issue of the newspaper on campus life, commuter life and general college life. I think readers would really enjoy “seeing” this in their campus paper. I plan on making it some-what humorous and personal to the school. Please let me know if this is a possibility and I will send some comic strip ideas. Also, if there is ever any need for illustrations or photographs I would love to get involved with that too. 
Thank you for your time!
P. Stewart
6. Im just worried that maybe im so late to send this email 😀
I like the Pioneer a lot. It gives me a lot of opportunities.
To be honest, I know the Pioneer recently because I am an international students and also I did not pay attention to what is going on to the school hahahaha
however, i had a change to be interviewed during the chuseok story.
It was the first time to be in an article and i was so happy with my friends hahaha and we all laughed at my picture.
As an international student, it is easier to read the Pioneer because it is easy to relate to in comparison to the new york times.
In addition, if the Pioneer will add articles about the International students, a lot of them will pay attention! at least I hope so!

C.W. Post looked to bounce back from their loss to Dowling and keep their hopes alive of winning the East Coast Conference. They helped themselves with a win versus Caldwell College at home, but later in the week had to go up against the ECC leader in the standings, Saint Thomas Aquinas College (11-1-1).
Caldwell College, who visited the Pioneers Wednesday Oct. 13th for an out-of-conference battle, Post looked determined to get back on the winning track. Right from the start, the Pioneers controlled the ball, as well as the tempo of the game. After 17 minutes, sophomore forward Betim Bajrami found the back of the net giving Post a quick 1-0 lead. Later in the game, Bajrami struck again as he beat his defender down the sideline and shot past the goalkeeper to double Post’s lead.
 Although Post won by a final score of 2-0, they had a many more opportunities as multiple shots hit the crossbar. The Pioneers dominated and overpowered Caldwell in all areas. The offense played excellent scoring two, and the defense as well as goalie Marco Jorgensen recorded a shutout.
 The real test occurred later in the week as Pioneers went on the road Saturday to take on the dangerous, first seeded Saint Thomas Aquinas College.
 For the first 75 minutes of play, it was a defensive battle until freshman back Joakim Ohlson scored on a header. This gave Post a much needed lead to put some points on the board. But that lead didn’t last for long.
 A few minutes later, Joseph Conolly scored for Saint Thomas Aquinas to tie the game in this intense battle of ECC rivals. For the remainder of regulation, neither team scored, sending the game into overtime.
 In the second minute of overtime, Saint Thomas Aquinas quickly took the lead off a goal from Daniel Davren, and Post could not recover falling to the Spartans 2-1.
 The Pioneers (5-6-1) next match up is away at Molloy College (2-10) on Thursday, October 21st at 3:30 p.m.

 It was the game that many of the Pioneers had circled on the calendar; Homecoming against the East Stroudsburg Warriors. The stands were full of alumni and current students who watched as Post won 28-17, and moved a step closer to advancing to the playoffs.
 The Warriors (1-6) attempted to crash the party, scoring first on a touchdown rush from Kendrick Williams to give themselves the early lead. But the Pioneers would strike right back on the next drive when Erik Anderwkavich connected to his favorite target Darnell Williams for the 19-yard touchdown. The Pioneers point after was blocked leaving the score 7-6.
The Pioneers (5-2) took the next quarter when once again Anderwkavich found Williams, this time for an 8-yard strike. The extra point was missed again this time sailing wide, yet the Pioneers went into the half leading 12-7.
Coming out the half, East Stroudsburg took an early lead in the third quarter, when Warriors quarterback Matt Marshall found an open Dusty Reed in the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown. The Pioneers trailed 14-12, but kicker Keith Hadnagy would kick a 39-yard field goal moments later to reclaim the lead.
In the fourth quarter, with Post up by one Anderwkavich gave his team some breathing room when he found Grayson Laurino open for a 9-yard touchdown that increased the lead to 22-14. The Warriors tried to strike back on the next possession, but settled for a field goal.
After a quick three-and-out possession by the Pioneers, East Stroudsburg looked to erase the five point deficit but Post defensive lineman Lou Scala had other ideas intercepting a pass from Marshall. Scala also had 11 tackles on the day.
As quick as the Pioneers got the ball, they gave it right back when Anderwkavich was picked. The Warriors attempted one last drive down the field, but it ended with freshman defensive back Donovan Edwards intercepting the ball and running it back to ice the Pioneers victory.
The defense has been steady all season for the Pioneers, and once again was the key to the game. Not only did the defense intercept two passes in the Homecoming game, but last week’s PSAC East Defensive Player of the Week Ronnie Modik recorded a team high 17 tackles along with a forced fumble. Abrom Shepard recorded two sacks, while Xavier Brown recorded one of his own.
The offensive stars of the game were Darnell Williams, who had 104 yards and a pair of touchdowns, and Erik Anderwkavich, who threw for 205 yards and three touchdowns. Anderwkavich also led the team in rushing with 59 yards.
The Pioneers only have one more home game this season at Hickox Field, but will be on the road next Saturday visiting the Kutztown Bears in Pennsylvania. Coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com begins at 5:30, with kick off slated at 6:05 pm.

NFL
The New York Giants squeaked by the Detroit Lions this past Sunday winning 28-20. Eli Manning completed 20 of 30 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns. Ahmad Bradshaw led the running game with 133 yards on 19 carries. The loss for Detroit ties an NFL record for consecutive road losses at 24.
The New York Jets worked around their first offensive turnovers of the season by defeating the Denver Broncos at INVESCO Field at 24-20. The Jets’ late drive in the 4th quarter, helped by a defensive pass interference play, left the New York football team at the 1-yard line with just a little over a minute to play. LaDainian Tomlinson punched in the short yardage for a score and gave the Jets the lead for good. Mark Sanchez, 17/30 for 198 yards throwing one touchdown and his first two interceptions of the season.
MLB
Pitcher, Roy Oswalt, rebounded for the Philadelphia Phillies in game 2 of the NLCS going 8 innings giving up only one run on three hits while striking out nine players. Jimmy Rollins drove in four runs on two hits. The series heads to San Francisco tied at 1.
The New York Yankees welcomed the Texas Rangers to the Bronx to duel it out for the American League Championship. Rangers ace Cliff Lee continued his dominance with another stellar outing Monday night, a two-hit shut out through 8 innings striking out 13. The Yankees now trail 2-1 in the best-of-seven series and have the combustible A.J Burnett slated to start in game 4 against Tommy Hunter.

“No, Billy. Stop f***ing that goat! You stop it!”
Yes, some comedians can’t handle a heckler. Others can. Bob Saget, however, not only handles them but brutally destroys them from the comfort of his mic stand. Mr. Saget responded to a Post student, an accounting major named “Billy” who repeatedly shouted at Bob during his act, by alluding to the fact that “Billy” has f***ed a goat and put a starfish on his c***. Some reading this article may be troubled by the fact that in only three sentences, we have already had to censor out three words. “There is no need for dirty language,” you may be inclined to say. Well, in fact, there is a need. To review Mr. Saget’s performance and not quote obscenities is like to review Pablo Neruda and use no Spanish. It can be done, but it will lack the flavor, and penis jokes are as essential to Mr. Saget’s craft as that little “n” with the squiggly line on top was to Neruda’s.
For those of you who don’t know, Bob Saget is a comedian, most famous for playing the squeaky-clean, loveable dad Danny Tanner on Full House. Whether he’s telling dirty jokes to 85-year-old Jerry for his birthday or singing about his extremely affectionate dog, upon viewing this show we all knew one thing for sure: if DJ’s dad could hear what that man on stage was saying, he’d fall right into the arms of Kimmy Gibbler, the character with whom Danny was having an affair, according to Saget’s rewording of “I Want It That Way” entitled “Danny Tanner Wasn’t Gay”.
It must be acknowledged that Mr. Saget’s show isn’t for the faint of heart. Indeed, quite often even I was close to blushing at some of the words spouted during the performance. Yet Saget isn’t a shock comedian, in the vein of Sam Kinison or Howard Stern. Rather, Saget weaves the obscenities into his bits to emphasize moments and jokes, with mastery at times along the lines with Lenny Bruce or Bill Hicks. Ok, maybe at times he goes off the rails, but if you had to deal with drunk (or so I hope, otherwise I fear for our future) audiences shouting out “Cambodia!” “I seen him!” and “My dog licked my b***s!”, you’d probably start indiscriminately swearing to.
From the stage, Saget asked Jerry, his 85 year old new buddy, whether he though Saget was funny on America’s Funniest Home Videos. Jerry responded with “You were then, I don’t know about now!” Well, I for one know about now. So, thank you for coming to our homecoming Mr. Saget. As you would say, you tore that motherf***er up.

“That’s my ‘c’ word.”  Now you stop that, he meant celebrity.  We all know what you were thinking, but the real Bob Saget is a pioneer (no pun intended) in Hollywood, who has emerged from sitcom to Broadway to absolute stardom.  Throughout his career, he has proved to be more than his most famous stereotype, Danny Tanner.  We grew up watching Full House eating dinner with our families and now we’re mixing drinks while watching Entourage on Sunday nights with our friends.  We’ve seen Saget evolve from the dust-busting, single father of three to a provocative, potty-mouthed perv. We even had the pleasure of sitting down with the man himself. 
Pioneer: How was your ride here?
Saget: Really effortless.  I was surprised.  We took the midtown tunnel. 
P: Is that a fortune [cookie]?
S: It is.  “Your sly nature will get you out of a tight spot.”  There it is. 
P: So what are you doing now? Traveling to colleges?
S: I’m on tour, where I perform at theatres and some colleges.  I also have a new series coming out on A&E, Decemeber 1st Wednesday nights at 10 p.m. They’re going to double run it because they dig it; it’s called Strange Days with Bob Saget. 
P: That sounds interesting.  What’s it about? 
S: I studied sub-cultures.  I did six shows so far. One of which I went on the road with a motorcycle club from Nashville to Daytona in a sidecar.  In another episode I look for Big Foot using infrared gear in the Pacific Northwest; I did Nacho Libre backyard wrestling I joined a frat at Cornell; I went to summer camp with 14-year olds – but that was just me personally.  It’s all subcultures that people don’t really know about. 
P: What kind of comedy show is it?
S: It’s documentary style comedy.  I’m not hosting or looking at the camera.  The dirty term I use for it is “c**kumentary.”  It’s a college paper; I can say that right?
P: Yup. 
S: But the tour I’m doing now will be going on until January or February. 
P: So, you’ve written, directed, acted, and produced.  What has been the most enjoyable?
S: Directing.  I like doing movies but that’s about a year of your life.  After Full House I directed for four years.  And then they offered me some off-Broadway stuff, a really cool play called Privilege.  Then I did Broadway a few years ago, a show called the Drowsy Chaperon. 
P: Now what would you like to do that you haven’t yet?
S: My texting is very good.  I get a lot of V.I.P texting.  Today’s John Mayer’s birthday actually.  But, yea, I am doing what I like to do now.  It’s like a privilege thing. 
P: Do you like performing at colleges?
S:  I love colleges.  I want to be here really bad.  No, no. Really bad. 
P: So would you say college students are your favorite audience?
S: Yea, definitely college students.  That’s my audience. They grew up watching the stuff I did and then followed the new stuff. 
P: The first time we saw you outside of Full House in Entourage and Half Baked, we were like “Whoa, is that Danny Tanner!”
S: Yes! Thank you!
P: So you liked working on Entourage?
S: Yea, they’re a great cast, a great group of people. I’m friends with all of them.
P: Would you say it’s a realistic plot?
S: Show business is worse. Way worse. They are so mean in show business.   Entourage is the soft version.
P: Where did you go to school?
S: Temple University. I was a film student and I actually won the Student Academy Award.
P: Wow! For what?
S: I made a documentary about my nephew who had reconstructive surgery, called Through Adam’s Eyes.  He narrated it; he was seven years old.  It was my junior project and the Academy flew me out to L.A.  I’ve always loved film.  That’s why I love the show I’m doing now.  Well you’ll see, because I’ll be a promo-hoe. 
P: So you always knew you wanted to be in film somehow?
S: I was nine when I picked up a camera. My dad was a meat guy, and the meat manager gave me an eight-millimeter camera so I shot film.
P: Do you Twitter a lot?
S: Yea I like Twitter.
P:  I feel like no one would follow me. You’re a celebrity; I’m not a celebrity. 
S: That’s always a bad word. To me, that’s the “c” word. It means the talent doesn’t come first.
P: What’s your next move?
S: I want to get into acting.  I think I’m good at it. 
P: We think so too. And, today, what do you consider yourself? An actor, a producer?
S: I’m a comedian.

Senator Kemp Hannon is urging all college students to exercise their right to vote this year in the mid-term elections –encouraging all to vote for the candidate who best represents their beliefs, whatever party that may be. Here is the critical information you should know:
On November 2nd, college students throughout New York will together have the power to influence the direction our government will take. Since the Obama wave that swept across college campuses from New York to California, college students were united in his message of hope and promises for the future. But were these promises fulfilled the wayas you envisioned?
Mid-term elections typically have a lower voter turn out, often resulting in a surprised win that may includeencompass the less qualified. This in itself is extremely dangerous, for we are lacking to fulfill in fulfilling our duty to exercise the right we were granted, which ultimately gives us the power to make a difference. We are college students who study, learn, research, analyze and debate every day. Being such well equipped and highly qualified individuals, why don’t we further our research and truly look into who is hoping to run our country, and who is best qualified to do so?.
Please take a moment to look at who is on the ballot this year. Discover which candidate not only fulfills your expectations of government, but who truly meets the standards of our forefathers, remaining consistent with the ideals of our nation. See which candidate is capable of taking our country back by creating jobs within our own country so we can feed and support our families, create our own merchandise, and earn the money to educate and better the youth of America.
What is the mid-term election?
Historically, mid-term elections always switch power. Typically the party in power is the party at greatest risk to lose seats.
Right now the New York State Senate has Democratic majority by two seats. We are currently controlled by one party rule due to the Democratic Governor, Democrat controlled Assembly and Democrat controlled Senate. If Republicans pick up the two seats in the New York State Senate, the dynamics of the current governing process in Albany will completely change –causing a huge transition that will affect us all in some way or another, for better or for worse.
With the immense population of our student body here at C.W. Post, we together can essentially determine the outcome of an election. College students are known to be opinionated, independent, and extremely involved with contemporary politics and how it directly affects our lives. We have strong voices that need to be heard, but no matter how loud we scream, nothing will make a difference until we vote.
For those who registered: The elections will be held on November 2nd. For more information and locations, please contact your local Assemblymen or State Senator.

It was 3:20, ten minutes before one of the last classes of the day.  There was a group of Swedish students sitting together in their Public Relations class.  They were discussing, in their native tongue, their summer vacations in a very bubbly, happy manner when someone unexpected walked into the room.  They all turned to look and see one of their own walk through the metal doors in the basement of Humanities Hall.  It was a girl who wasn’t supposed to return for the fall semester.  Her plan was to only study for one year and then return home to Sweden.  However, Ulrika Berg had her own plan in mind.
 Ulrika is a 19-year old sophomore at C.W. Post.  She first came to Long Island University in Fall 2009.  Undecided on what major to choose, Ulrika enrolled in courses of various disciplines, ranging from English to Theater and Acting and even to Macroeconomics.  She took Introduction to Public Relations and became intrigued.  “It was the first time I actually wanted to read a textbook,” admitted Ulrika.  “And then I discovered that I was pretty good at it [Public Relations].”
 From then on, Ulrika seemed hooked.  “It was like I just fell into it.  I read the course outline and it seemed fun and easy,” she said.  “I just didn’t know it’d be this fun and this easy!”
 In Sweden, Ulrika says Public Relations is more theoretical.  According to her, they do not use the term PR, they call it “Media and Communications Science.” There’s a scarcity of jobs, and it’s more like a marketing job than a Public Relations job, Ulrika recalls.  In America it’s very straightforward; each agency is designed to create a message and deliver it to the correct audience in the most effective way.
 “It was because of PR that I continued my second semester here,” said Ulrika.  The only problem was that she did have another, very different life at home in Stockholm.  Her entire family, and even her horse, Chameur, was anticipating her return home.  Ulrika competitively rode horses since she was five years old, but it wasn’t until Chameur got hurt two years ago that Ulrika saw the opportunity to travel and study abroad.  “If I couldn’t ride my horse anymore, I figured, why not take this chance?” Ulrika recalled.  “So one day I was talking about it with my mom and then the next week I was here at Post!”
 But it was only supposed to be for a year. “When I was home in Sweden this summer, I was thinking about it, and there’s not going to be another time when I get the chance to do this,” she remembered.  “When else am I going to be able to finish and get my bachelor’s degree in a profession that is interesting and fun for me?”
 From that moment on, Ulrika had made up her mind.  She plans to finish her schooling at Post and hopefully work for a PR firm here.  “After a year of working, I don’t know what I’ll do,” she says.  “Maybe I’ll stay in the states and continue to work or maybe I’ll go home and try to bring this type of PR to Sweden!”
 Like Ulrika, there are many other international students here.  Actually there are over 750 of them, representing 53 different countries.  Some are recruited from the office of International Admissions, while others simply find C.W. Post all on their own, which is what happened in Ulrika’s case.  However, it is once these foreign students make it to Post that they can truly experience America.  International Student Union (ISU) helps the incoming foreigners adjust to the area.  “We do workshops for students to help them learn how to get their drivers license or apply to an on or off-campus job,” says the vice president of ISU, Sarah Mendoza.  “Every year we take the students on a circle-line cruise around New York City, which is one of the many featured trips during the international student orientation.”  Ulrika enjoyed seeing the Statue of Liberty and downtown Manhattan while on this trip.  “This was my first visit to NYC and it made me realize I chose the right place,” she recalls.  “This is where I want to be.”
 It seems there are quite a few Swedish students who have the desire to study in America, as there was an influx of 12 new Swedes in Fall 2010, which enlarged the group to about 52 Swedish students altogether.  A majority of this group are business majors, according to the director of International Admissions Ian Wright.  However he also states that each year there is a handful of them who choose PR as their major.
 For now, Ulrika will continue to enjoy her time here.  Who knows maybe while she’s in her PR class she’ll devise a new plan, one to stay in the U.S. for good.

Republican Party 
Daniel M. Donovan Jr. is a Republican from Staten Island currently serving as the District Attorney for Richmond County, New York (Staten Island.)
Earning his jury’s doctorate in 1988 from Fordham University, Donovan went on to become an assistant district attorney in the office of Robert M. Morgenthau until 1996.
In 2003, Donovan won the Chief Assistant District Attorney race against David Lehr, earning 53% of the votes. One of the key parts of his platform was to start the county’s first witness protection program.  His office also led the city’s prosecutors with the highest felony conviction rate in many of the years since he took office.
Donovan was re-elected in 2007 with over 68% of the vote, defeating local Democratic attorney, Michael Ryan.  On May 17th, 2010, Donovan announced he would be running for New York State Attorney General.  With 60 percent of the delegates votes at the convention and no primary opponent, Donovan became the obvious nominee of the Republican Party. A week prior he received the endorsement of the Conservative Party of New York.
 
Democrat Party
 
As for the Democratic Party, they have a bit of a different race. There are actually five people running for this office and there has yet to be an announcement for the primary candidate.
The first name on the ballot is State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, who was involved in the creation of the School Tax Relief Program (STAR) which became a law in 1996. He was also the co-sponsor of state legislation intended to eliminate the state tax on clothing.
There is also state Senator Eric Schneiderman who graduated with honors from Harvard.  He went on to become chief sponsor of the Rockefeller Drug Law reforms, which were passed and signed into law in 2009. His legislative priorities include enacting meaningful ethics reform in Albany, transforming the criminal justice system to make it more fair and safe, and cracking down on the perpetrators of consumer fraud.
A third candidate is Sean Coffey, a retired Navy Captain and former federal prosecutor.  Coffey’s campaign goals include minimizing political corruption and finding a way to advocate for veterans.
There is also former New York State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo.  His campaign pitch is that he is already familiar with the office, having served under then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.  However, Dinallo says he intends to remake the office so that it reallocates resources to “focus on consumer — and investor-based cases that go to people’s everyday financial lives — their phone bills, their credits cards, their mortgages.”
Finally, there is Nassau County District Attorney, Kathleen Rice. In 2007, Rice became the first local District Attorney in New York history to form a Medicaid Fraud Unit.  Not to mention, in 2009 she ranked third most powerful person on Long Island by the Long island Press.

The C.W. Post Poetry Center began this year’s series with a reading from Patrick Rosal. The reading took place in the Hillwood Museum, October 14th, where Rosal read some of his original pieces. Rosal has also written two books, “My American Kundiman,” and “Uprock Headspin Scramble and Dive..”
Rosal never planned on becoming a poet saying, . “I wanted to be a musician, but my father wanted me to be a lawyer.” He says it was a college professor who challenged him to look to his creative side and give poetry a try.
Beginning his reading with a piece called “Freddie,” he was able to take his audience back in time, to when he was a young boy learning how to break dance. Mixing in conversation, dance moves, and Spanish songs,  Rosal was able to paint a vivid picture of an important time in his childhood.
The reading continued with poems about his life; Rosal was able to keep the audience hooked with his lyrical way of speaking, which he attributed to his musical background. He told stories of strengthening his relationship with his father through a new language, teaching a friend the love of music, and the story behind his name.
Inspired by an exhibit of World War I posters on display in the Hillwood Museum, Rosal shared his new project with the audience, poems about the American-Filipino War.  He read poems written in the voices of an American solider, a Filipino woman in love with an American, and a young Filipino solider. Rosal was able to portray the raw emotions and struggles of the characters he created.
Following the reading, he took the time to explain to the audience his process for writing. “I’m inspired when I have a lot of responsibilities; when it’s time to grade papers, I procrastinate with writing.” He discussed the common struggle of creativity with questions like, “is my work good enough? Should I share it with others?” Rosal also talked about the impact of music in his pieces; he even performed improv to show how to use the language of music.
Throughout the reading Rosal was able to take his audience on a journey, and inspire them to find their own creativity.
“It was interesting to hear the music in his words, and the story behind the poem,” said junior Nivischi Northover.
Professor Dulcie Stoepker also enjoyed how Rosal was able to add his ethnicity and personal experience into his poems, “The explanation added to the understanding of the poem and his motivation to write it.” She added that students should take advantages of such artistic opportunitiesy on campus.
Rosal teaches creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College and is currently working on a third book.

C.W. Post’s Department of Music held its first Hillwood Recital Series last Wednesday with stellar performances from the soon-to-be graduated seniors.  The Recital Series, which occurs twice each semester, allows for students to showcase their final performance pieces they will have perfected come their final semester.
Chelsea Winter, a violinist who is studying under Dale Stuckenbruck, played two pieces, which included energetic Sonata No. 22 in A Major, K. 305.  Winter is actively engaged in Post’s music ensembles, and is currently the co-concertmaster of the C.W. Post Orchestra as well as the String Ensemble.
The voice of Emily Klonowiski, a mezzo-soprano who is now studying under Thomas Goodheart, filled the chapel during her performance. Klonowiski sang Que Fais-tu Blanche Tourterelle (What Are You Doing, White Turtledove?), from Charles Gounod’s opera Roméo et Juliet, which depicts a scene where the Montagues taunt the Capulets because Juliet will soon leave them to marry Romeo.
Klonowiski also stays very involved with the school’s music department acting as co-principle of the LIU Orchestra and String Ensemble, and she has been in as many as five ensembles since her freshman year.
The final performer of last week’s recital was Samantha Komaroff, a flutist under the direction of Karla Moe. Her performance included Aaron Copland’s Duo for Flute and Piano. The final movement concluded with excitement, yet she played the piece with masterful ease.
Komaroff, who graduated in 2008 from Nassau Community College with an Associates degree in Music performance, is finishing her music education degree while teaching at East Rockaway Music and instructing the Mineola Marching Band.  She also had the opportunity to tour France this past summer for the 50th Jazz A Juan.

 Crisp weather and high winds were not enough to keep away the hundredsthousands of people who came out Saturday to watch the Pioneers Football team coast to victory.  Despite the unusually chilly temperatures, C.W. Post students, alumni, and friends poured into Hickox Field to see the Pioneers play the Warriors of East Stroudsberg University.  However, there may have been more people tailgating in the parking lots.
 Every year students look forward to Homecoming, usually more than any other day of the year.  “Oh wow,” senior Political Science major Henry Szamota said,.  “I love everything about Homecoming.  Hanging out with everybody is great, catching the game is great; it’s really just a good time all around.”  Sophomore Dana Block agreed, saying, “Iit’s awesome, you really get to feel a sense of school spirit.”
 The morning began with a number of alumni games played by various CW Post teams, including the baseball team, the field hockey team, and the volleyball team.  These kinds of events go a long way in getting Post Athletics alumni back and involved in their alma mater, said junior Field Hockey player Kathryn Godshalk.  “It’s always so nice to see the alumni,” said Godshalk.  “You go from spending almost every waking moment together on the team to basically never seeing them after they graduate so it’s fun to reunite.”
 As pictures of celebrations are uploaded to Facebook and fun times are relived through stories told, the countdown to Homecoming 2011 begins.

Dear readers,
October is coming to an end and that usually means two things: serious brainstorming for an outstanding Halloween costume, and (brace yourselves) midterm week!  Midterm exams creep up on you faster than the teenager in the Freddy mask at that haunted house you went to last weekend.  They are probably scarier too, not to mention, just a pain in the ass.  We finally get situated in our classes and our professor’s slyly reveal the midterm date, adding that it also counts as 50% of your grade.  No pressure.  Luckily, we are senior Journalism majors and have no written tests.  We are not bragging; we are trying to recruit you.
Anyway, when you find time out of your busy schedules of shopping and studying, take some time to unwind and read the sixth issue of the Pioneer.  This is the annual Homecoming issue and we’ve filled it with a variety of different topics.  One of the most titillating was our one-on-one with Mr. Bob Saget.
Despite his reputation, he was as charming as ever and so tall!  Check it out on pages 10 and 11.  Our review editor also captured Saget at his best during his show Saturday night in the Tilles Center.
Our news section reports on many events here on campus. One of the most exhilarating that happened this past week was Homecoming!  Check out the collage of photos taken during the most anticipated event of the year. There were also a few other events that happened last week, including a Music Recital and Poetry Reading, which two of our writers got to attend and report on.
Also, Loomings is still looking for any review writers, cartoonists, etc. So be sure to email the editor, Mike Natale at  HYPERLINK “mailto:loomingscwp@gmail.com” loomingscwp@gmail.com if you are interested!
Like we always say, we love hearing feedback from our readers.  So please, even if you don’t have time to pick up a copy of the newspaper, just log onto our website and check it out.
Good luck on all of your midterms and be sure to look out for next week’s special Halloween issue!
