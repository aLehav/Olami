Music students signed a petition against a proposed policy that would prevent them from taking lessons in multiple instruments. However, “No decisions have been made regarding a change in policy,” said Noel Zahler, Dean of the School of Vi- sual and Performing Arts.
The proposed lesson policy would allow students to take a lesson each semester on their applied instrument. Students may also take a lesson in composition or conducting, should they wish. However, this would be restricted to one instrument at a time.
According to Jennifer Miceli, chairperson of the Music Department and the director of Music Education and Vocal Jazz, the policy has not been instituted and the administration is taking under advisement the lesson policy.
“We are looking at best practices at colleges and universities similar to LIU Post, as well as colleges and universities that we aspire to be like,” said Zahler.
Samantha Komaroff, who graduated LIU Post in 2011 and is now a graduate student studying Music Performance with a concentration in Woodwind Studies, created the petition against the proposed policy. “Putting a restriction on the number of lessons students can take sets us up for failure,” said Komaroff. “The lesson program is meant for students to further their education and obtain the skills to work in music. In order to obtain a job, we must know how to play multiple instruments.”
Undergraduate students in the Music Department are able to major in Music, Instrumental, Vocal Performance, or Music Education. Both undergraduates and graduate students are able to choose from seven areas of specialization: brass, guitar, jazz, percussion, piano, string, or woodwind studies.
According to Miceli, “Each student has a major applied instrument such as clarinet, piano, voice, etc. It is expected [under the proposed policy] that students will take a lesson each semester on their applied instrument and may also take a lesson in composition or conducting, should they wish,” she said. “Traditionally students have been able to take additional lessons of their choice.”
Several Music professors declined to speak with The Pioneer about the proposed lesson policy.
Music Department students have freely expressed their opin- ions. “It’s a real shame for all of us. Our career largely entails the ability to play and teach multiple instruments, but with this cut it
stops us from fulfilling this requirement,” said Joe Donnolo, a freshman Music major. “As a performance major, I will be put at a disadvantage when I audition for performance groups (that require the capability of playing multiple instruments). This program cut will ultimately be a setback in the job market and I feel may stop me from getting a job,” he added.
“What the current adminis- tration is doing is absolutely abhorrent,” said Shekinah MacMillian, a 2007 undergraduate and 2009 graduate alumnus of LIU Post. “Undergraduates being limited to their main instrument and one additional choice of conducting or composition will in no way prepare them for the competitive job market.”
All music students, according to Komaroff, are not only com- peting against each other, but as well with others who have years of experience and the capability of playing multiple instruments. “Without the lesson program, I wouldn’t be the musician I am today,” said Alexander Sherry, a senior Music Performance major. “Touring the country and being hired by Juillard School would have been impossible.”
“For musicians who desire to go beyond their craft and explore the world of other instruments, the lesson program is a gateway to that desire,” said Scott Genovese, a 2011 LIU Post alumnus and current graduate student in Music Theory and Composition. “By limiting the lesson program, that exploration or desire is nothing short of lost.”
“With the talk of lessons being pulled, it makes me have to look into other colleges that are striving to make their music program better, not destroy it,” said Christian Olive, a freshman Music Education major. “LIU Post is where I would truly want to stay because of the caring atmosphere and professors who want to help you grow as a musician.”
“All we want is to learn music,” said Komaroff. “The Department of Music is a part of this school and we represent our school in a positive way in our concerts and our recitals.” The students of the Music Department always play at the LIU Post Com- mencement Ceremony in May and have played at top venues such as Carnegie Hall.
The written petition was created on April 8 and already has more than 95 signatures. The electronic version has 44 signatures. Students have also created a Facebook page, “Save the lesson program of LIU Post Department of Music” as well. “I am planning a meeting where I will speak about what is happening to the Music Department and discuss how administration is not being com- municative with the students,” said Komaroff.
The meeting will be held on April 17 at 5 p.m. in the in Hillwood Commons on the third floor. According to the Facebook page, 380 students have been invited to the meeting, and 47 have already indicated that they plan to attend. “We need as many supporters to attend this meeting as possible,” said Komaroff. “We need to save the music department.”

Students, faculty, and staff joined together for the LIU Post Recycling program’s third annual Sustainability Luncheon, in order to highlight the importance of sustainability to reduce the climate change in addition to recycling and “green” efforts.
The luncheon has become an annual event since 2011. Billy Achnitz, a graduate student in the new MS for Environmental Sustainability program, presented Sustainable Pioneer awards to clubs, organizations, students and faculty, who advocate sustainable living.
The two clubs that were honored were TWIce as Nice and The Runway. The identical twin Copresidents, BriaLetã Greene and Tia-Mona Greene, accepted on behalf of their club and president Samantha Vega accepted the award for The Runway.
According to Achnitz, Twice as Nice and The Runway were both chosen to be honored with a Sustainable Pioneer Award because they have both promoted sustainable behaviors within their club. Along with also being very active clubs within Student Life, they have added environmental and sustainability components within their programming.
The Runway held a program called Fashion For Less, which aimed to show students that you could create fashion with reused or recycled materials. This year’s fashion shows also featured the eco-fashion designer Joanna Del Giudice, who crochets dresses, ties, and other clothing out of VCR and cassette tape and plastic bags.
TWIce As Nice most recently did a Flea Market program where students sold items in Hillwood during common hour. Other clubs could sign up for a table to participate in the flea market. The Recycling Program was one of them. The majority of the items sold at the flea market were recycled items or items that were being reused. This program model will also be implemented in future flea market-type programs where students can sell their unwanted belongings as an alternative to throwing them out.
Two students who actively participated in the LIU Post Recycling Program, Environmental Educator, Rechelle Abalos, and Environmental Assis- tant, Kevin Perez, were also honored with Sustain- able Pioneer Awards.
The three faculty and staff winners were Dr. Margaret Boorstein, chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Science, and Eric Bauer and Amy Rojek of Facilities Services. Each award, pigmented green, was made from recyclable glass.
After an hour of presentation, food was served to those in attendance. During the lunch break, the recycling program reintroduced the Blender- Bike. Just a few days prior to the luncheon, students were invited to make their own smoothies for one dollar, through pedal-powering the blender attached to the bike.
LIU Post is the first university on Long Island to have a blender-bike on campus. Aramark Dining Director, Shawn Carvajal, said, “The idea derived from two admissions officers who thought of powering a light bulb through the power of exercise.”
Somehow the idea changed from a light bulb to a blender. “The Blender-Bike is definitely my greatest accomplishment as part of the Recycling Program; the amount of happiness I receive from seeing people exceeds far past my expectations” said Achnitz. Carvajal and Achnitz hope to sell smoothies and use the profits to donate to recy- cling based organizations.
Scott A. Mandia, Assistant Chair of Physical Sciences and Professor at Suffolk Community Col- lege, ran a twenty minute long presentation about how the super storm Sandy led to a “wake-up call” for action toward reducing climate change. Mandia said that “global warming at the hands of humans caused a one foot increase at sea level.”
Freshman Pre-med major, Jackeline Jurado, said the event was “very informative and educa- tional. It made [her] want to get more involved and make a difference.”
In addition to the Pioneer Awards, recycling scholarships were given. In previous years, the awards amounted to $250 and $600. With the col- lection of over 20,000 bottles the Recycling program was able to produce over $1000 in scholarships.
The Creative Sustainable Expressions schol- arship had three winners. Samantha Vega won the third place, $125 award; Amal Zeidan’s poem won the $250 second place scholarship. The first prize winner of $1000 was Graduate Masters of Art student, Nancy Wong, for her painting of a carbon foot-print embedded with flags of multiple coun- tries pressed into the earth.
“Everyone in the U.S. and other countries try to make a difference by leaving their footprint in the efforts of sustainability,” said Wong. “I felt that depicting my art in this way was best as to representing everyone, even those not painted, in the process of saving the earth.”

There is something significant about days when great disasters happen. Regardless if the disaster was caused by terrorists crashing airplanes into skyscrapers, or mother nature sweeping people off shore in a gigantic wave, we all seem to remember where we were that moment when the disaster oc- curred. It is as if time stopped.
A few days ago, on April 15, I remember where I was when CNN announced breaking news. I was sitting by a computer, slightly annoyed at my brother who sat next to me, for some nonsense that makes no sense now. The news channel revealed that bombs had exploded by the Boston Marathon finish line, leaving three people dead and more than a hundred injured. “An- other act of terrorism” was my first thought, and suddenly, I stopped being annoyed. Life is certainly fragile.
The bombs went off in Boston, not very far from New York, during a public event. It could very well have been the New York Marathon, which by the way takes place close to where I live, (God forbid that I will ever cheer in the crowd this coming fall).
But, no matter where in the world an act of terrorism occurs, it is just as horrible. It stops time, because the world is full of reasonable people that cannot figure out how someone could commit a crime of this kind. The majority of us are incapable of understanding what goes through a person’s head when they intentionally take someone else’s life. Somewhere, that person crossed a line that is impossible for the rest of us to get over.
The person that kills someone is not only robbing the world from a human being and all of that person’s thoughts, memories, experiences and unique contributions. That person also deprives someone of a mother, father, sibling, best friend, colleague or love. It will break hearts forever, create incurable emptiness, and leave life-long wounds.
One can also question why we should live through so many disasters? In 23 years (minus a couple of baby ones where I was not really “in the know” of what went on in the world), I have worried anxiously for a friend and her family that were in London during the summer that the Al Qaeda bombed the subway. A neighbor of mine returned home alone on the airplane at the age of ten after losing his whole family in the tsunami in Thailand, 2004. Two years ago, the largest mall in Scandinavia, located close to my apartment in Sweden, was put under bomb threat (luckily only a threat). Who knows what could happen if a cer- tain young dictator soon starts playing with his nuclear toys.
It hurts that there are a bunch of nutcases existing in a world that could be so brilliant, filled with citizens striving for peace, happiness and mutual understanding. It probably hurts even more that these cases are hard to get rid of. If every known murderer and terrorist would be put behind bars, would not new murderers and terrorists emerge? Is there really enough room for only kind people? It appears that the world needs a slice of bad to compensate for all the good, and that stinks.
One would wish that intelligently phrased words would be enough to change these people’s minds, but so far, time and history have proved that they form a species that seem almost impossible to extinct.
Just keep in mind that life is fragile.

For those visiting New York City, or locals looking for a day in creative, free spirited surroundings out of the neon, concrete jungle, Williamsburg, Brooklyn is an option worthy of your time.
When you hop on the L train going east towards Brooklyn, you may find yourself surrounded by people dressed in plaid shirts, stonewashed denim jackets, army pattern, spikes, trendy sunglasses or optic yellow Carhartt beanies.
Many will exit along with you in Williamsburg, more specifically at the Bedford Avenue subway stop. The carelessly stacked 60’s style bicycles, walls covered in colorful graffiti, and trendy street style dress code makes it hard to believe that this is the first stop past the more chic Manhattan.
When standing on top of the subway stairs, you will see Konditori, a small, Swedish espresso bar between Bedford and Driggs Ave. They serve a variety of coffee and pas- tries. There are croissants, bagels and of course, it wouldn’t be Brooklyn without something gluten-free, like their muffins, good for either breakfast or lunch.
On Bedford Ave, there is just as much to observe out on the streets as inside the shops. Street vendors sell everything imag- inable; and even some things you couldn’t imagine. Piles of classic books that you can buy for five dollars, vintage clothing, jewelry and artwork made out of obscure materials are some of the things you might find. There are creations for sale that are hard to wrap your head around; portraits of sock puppets, hand knitted attire for cats and dogs. Cans for sale, which are tipped over and seem to have soda spilling out of them, are suggested to be used for scaring your mom, or reserv- ing a spot. Because who wants a chair with soda all over it?
There are many old-school record shops in the area, as well as unique clothing boutiques in both ends of the price range. If you are looking for old-fashioned anything, you have come to the right place.
The perhaps best-known vintage store in the area is Beacon’s closet. You will get there by following Bedford Ave north and then turning west on 11th street. Beacon’s is a thrift shop where you can buy and sell old or new clothing. It has two departments, one for each gender. The sections are packed with such a huge quantity of clothing that it’s hard to pass through some places. Ralph Lauren shirts, fur coats, clothing made by brands you have never heard of and denim anything. Almost everything is in the price range of five and 60 dollars. Sixty dollars will get you a nice, previously expensive coat, but most things are only about 20 dollars.
Continue walking west, until you hit Kent Street, and you may see a lot of powerful, thoughtful, creative and even politically inspired graffiti. Dan Hewins, a photographer from Brooklyn said the industrial, edgy surroundings make for great pictures.
If you are looking for a real treat, Fabbrica, an Italian restaurant and bar, is on the corner of Kent and 6th. Fabbrica has a very open and spacious atmosphere, but if you are hoping to be outside while enjoying one of their desserts, like a pastel colored French macaroon with a hint of golden shimmer, or a delightful lemon pie, East Ferry Park is just a few feet away. The park has a picture-perfect, clear skyline view of Manhattan.
At this point, it is easy to walk back to the subway stop along 6th street. If you choose to explore Brooklyn further, a ferry can take you to the base of the scenic Brooklyn Bridge for only four dollars. You can take a leisurely stroll across the bridge, but beware – it’s at your own risk of getting trampled by a cyclist.
The photo opportunities from the ferry are vast, with Manhattan’s skyline in the background.
Lastly, you can either take the subway home from High Street, or walk across and enjoy the timeless view.
LIU Post student, Talia Charlton, said she has not been there yet, but since she is very interested in fashion and has read good things about the restaurants, it’s about time.
Williamsburg has options for everyone, and is definitely a place where you can truly be yourself whether you want to blend in or stand out.

“Evil Dead” is a remake (almost) of the cult horror classic 1981 film, The Evil Dead, by director Sam Raimi. This reboot, directed by relative newcomer Fede Alvarez, has gathered a great deal of hype surrounding its release. For one, the already established cult fan base exploded, more or less, when the film was announced. Some were en- thused and anxious while others felt disgruntled and betrayed. So, does this remake live up to the standards of diehard fans and gore enthusiasts? Yes and no.
As a fan of the original film and its sequels myself, I was excited when they announced the rebirth of the franchise. The trailers seemed gory and extreme like the original, but what I was really looking for was the comedic aspect that made the original stand out. Watching Ash, the lead character, tear through deadites (the psychotic undead of the franchise) after reciting a ridicu- lous cliché was part of the experi-
ence that is The Evil Dead. For some reason, this new version seemed to lack this charm, instead opting for over-the-top gory moments stan- dard of today’s horror films.
Of course, there are a few moments of general silliness in the movie, but they seldom seemed to be created on purpose or as refer- ence to the original. With this said, it would be unfair to judge this film solely on its similarity to its inspira- tion. In regards to plot and charac- ters, a few changes are worth mentioning without spoiling too much. First, there is no Ash. This is a large change from the original as Ash, previously played by Bruce Camp- bell, is in many ways a fan favorite. The filmmakers could have easily replaced him with an equally compel- ling and likable character. However, the team behind the film seemed to place its efforts elsewhere, like the re-written story that tries to be more “believable.”
The film’s main character Mia, played by Jane Levy, is a recovering drug addict who is going through withdrawal at an old family cabin, with the support of a bunch of friends. This, amongst other changes, represents part of the attempt to make the possession and demonization of the characters more believable. To me it just seemed like a planned attribute put in place to make the some viewers under- stand why the film’s characters did not suspect supernatural activity when things went a-rye. It was a bit insulting to see a simple plot full of ambiguities remade to be simpler with less to guess about.
As for the gore, they did a great job. The use of practical effects was a nice touch, especially in the over digitalized cinema we now are forced to endure. As soon as the blood starts to pour it does not stop until it rains. After letting the initial excitement of Evil Dead wear off, it is hard to fully hate or fully love it. There are moments that shine and others that are fall short. While this is not the ideal remake, I can definitely recommend it for fans and newcomers looking for a good time. It may not be perfect, but it is a lot of fun in the theater, especially with a group of friends.

Whether it is in a competition or contributing to a local rescue, LIU Post’s equestrian team has demonstrated the ability to put its best foot forward.
Recently, the team participated in Project Sage Horse Rescue, which is a non-profit organization that rescues horses from going to slaughter. The team has helped with Project Sage efforts dating back to last fall and continued pitching in during this semester on March 10. The team donated over five hundred dollars worth of merchandise with items such as horse blankets and wraps that the rescue can use or sell to receive additional money to save more horses from going to slaughter. According to its website, “Project Sage Horse Rescue attends horse auctions and goes to feedlots to purchase horses that would oth- erwise be sent to slaughter.”
After choosing to help Project Sage, senior captain Elizabeth Johnston has had great memories from assisting with this effort the past two times with the team. “This year the captains, Ashley [Staib] and I, wanted to put a strong focus on community service,” said Johnston. “Project Sage is stable with the goal to rescue horses, rehabilitate them, and adopt them out, so for a team full of people who share a love for horses this was the perfect outlet.”
Holly Lynn Leffhalm is a sophomore on the team who has enjoyed participating in the Project Sage efforts. “We groomed the horses, mucked the stalls and turnouts, cleaned the barn and cleaned the water buckets among other things,” said Leffhalm, who is also the fundraising officer of the equestrian team.
Johnston revealed one of her personal favorite stories as a result of getting involved with Project Sage: “A rescued horse, who had lost her foal, was paired with a foal that was in no way related to her. Almost immediately the foal began nursing off of the adopted mother. Although adoption is a frequent occurrence with people, it is not with horses, so the success was not only rare but incredible.”
two alumni riders, Chelsea Soldner and Laura Powell, all participated at Regionals. Soldner and Powell qualified for the Zone 2 Championship Show which happened on April 7.
The competition that followed Regionals is called “Zones.” The way it works is that if you place first or second in your event at Regionals, then you advance to Zones. If you place in first or second at Zones, you then advance to Nationals. Fifty three different schools in New York State compete against each other in Zones.
Although the equestrian team is making strides in events, it is not considered a NCAA sport at LIU Post. There are several qualifications required to move from a club/recreational sport. Leffhalm believes that not being considered a NCAA sport can pos- sibly be looked at as a good thing because right now the make-up of the equestrian team is full of possibilities. “If it were an NCAA team, not anyone could just join. This setup is so open and welcoming,” said Leffhalm.
The team allows anyone to join even if they have never been on a horse before. Riders of all levels have the ability to be a part of the team. If you are interested in joining and trying out for the team, you can contact the team through email: equestrian@cwpost.liu.edu, or check out the LIU Post Eques- trian Team’s page on Facebook.
–Did you ever realize how much the word “horse” is used in everyday terms/language? Look:
Stud, healthy as a horse, hungry as a horse, backing the wrong horse, dark horse, go the distance, hold your horses, horse laugh, horse play, horse power, horsing around, neck and neck, ponytail, stallion, straight from the horse’s mouth, you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.
In addition to raising money for the horse rescue, Leffhalm believes that activities such as
Project Sage have allowed the equestrian team to become closer. “Even though it’s such an individ- ualized sport, the team has be- come very close. There is a lot of team bonding with these events,” said Leffhalm.
The team has also made strides in competition. Five rid- ers for the team qualified for the Region 4 Championship which took place on March 23 in New Jersey. Captain Elizabeth John- ston, Leffhalm, Tina Alvarez, and

With last week’s rising temperatures, it truly felt like spring. LIU Post students spent their common hour on the Great Lawn and Riggs Lawn, relaxing and talking with the sun beating down upon them. A little sun exposure is never a bad thing, but what happens if you have too much?
According to ResearchDevelopment.gov, which is an organization that releases different information for the safety and knowledge of the United States public, research has shown that, “Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers, with more than one million cases diagnosed every year. More diagnosed skin cancers are related to sun exposure.”
Skin cancer is easier to get than people realize. Though the public is educated about the disease through books, media reports, and health classes, it is still a slightly foreign concept for some.
LIU Post students were asked what they felt about the sun and its effects, including the risk of skin cancer, as well as whether or not the constant exposure was a good thing. Anthony Mendez, a freshman Business major, said, “It’s common sense that skin cancer is caused by the sun. Hopefully people will remember to take that to heart and be aware of it.”
Sara Nami, a senior Art Therapy major, said, “Now that it’s spring, it’s great that more students are outside. Skin cancer is a big deal though and that’s why I try to be careful when I go out on the Great Lawn or Riggs Lawn.”
ResearchDevelopment.gov mentions some symptoms of skin cancer to look out for, such as: “Changes in the skin, including the size or color of a mole, or a new growth; scaliness, oozing, bleeding, or a change in the appearance of a bump or nodule on the skin; the spread of darker pigmentation beyond the edges of a mole; and a change in sensation, itchiness, tenderness, or pain.”
With these known symptoms, it is best to do a self-full body check every couple of months to make sure that you are cancer free.
If you do not know what exactly to look for, ask the LIU Post health office or other medical professionals.
I believe that it is completely normal to want a tan. Instead of going for tanning oil, grab the sunblock. You can still easily be tan and you will save yourself from skin cancer, sunburn, and future wrinkles. Especially if you have fair skin like me, sunblock is a must. For anyone, it can become a matter of life or death.

Robert Bresson is an unknown to most, an enigma to others and a genius to the rest. The French filmmaker devised his own approach and methodology for making films. He stripped away the façade, and tried to disassociate film from the theater art from which it evolved. His concepts and theories on film as an art form influenced many during the French new wave and his impact is still visible in films of today.
Au Hassard Balthazar is often hailed as Bresson’s greatest work, a masterpiece some say, but after my first viewing, I found myself baffled as to why. It seems to be a schizophrenic story about a young girl, a sociopath and, most importantly, a tortured donkey named Balthazar. However, when one comes to understand Bresson’s style and abandons pre-conceived conceptions on what a motion picture should be, the beauty begins to manifest itself. Balthazar like all of Bresson’ films really requires multiple viewings. Upon my second viewing, the film became comprehensible and, during my third, something extraordinary.
The filmmaker is quoted as saying, “Nothing too much, nothing deficient.” This sums up any good Bresson film whether it is Mouchette, Pickpock- et or in this case Balthazar. Bresson is extremely deliberate in what is and is not shown in his films. It may seem that he is withholding details pertaining to the narrative, but that is never the case. Bresson does not show the audience what it never needed to see. He wants to keep viewers on their toes, searching for what is hidden beneath the images and sounds. Following the narrative is secondary to the understanding of any of his films, contrary to most traditional Hol- lywood pictures.
Bresson’s sense of balance goes beyond narrative exposition. He is conscious of the marriage of sound and visuals, careful not to bombard the audience as directors like Rainer Werner Fassbinder or Spike Lee do all too often. In Balthazar, one scene in particular stands out when Balthazar pulls an out of control cart ending in a wreck. During the scene, only close ups of the wagons spinning wheels, Balthazar’s feet and the broken brake are seen. The visuals are lim- ited; however, the audio is rich and intense. We hear the ever-quickening pace of Balthazar’s gait and the clattering of the wagon accelerating downhill, then an unseen but heard crash. In the final scene of his film Mouchette, Bresson uses the same technique of balance and visual omission, letting the viewer hear the action rather than see it, when a young girl rolls down a hill and into a pond.
Bresson’s main goal was to give rise to film that was free of the influences of the theater. His concept of the Model rather than an actor is one of the most notice- able attempts at stripping away theatrics.
Whether he is successful is up for debate. It certainly does eliminate any attempt at being convincing. The characters are flat, completely devoid of physical emo- tion, almost in a trance. Werner Herzog’s Heart of Glass, in which the actors were put under hypnosis prior to their performances, is one of the few films that resemble a Bressonian acting style. Although revolutionary, Bresson’s Model concept never seems to have taken hold in any cinematic movement. Acting remains a familiar and almost universal piece of the narra- tive film viewing experience.
Puzzling yet captivating, Bresson remains one of the most enigmatic filmmakers in history. His approach to filmmaking was truly unique. Never concerned with being marketable, he instead attempted to make film a unique and independent art form. Bresson remained pure to his philosophies and ideals throughout his body of work. He is undeniably one of the great artists of the 20th century.

The Pioneers men’s lacrosse team took the number one ranked Mercyhurst Lakers to the edge, but could not pull out a win on Saturday, April 13. LIU Post lead 13-10 going into the final ten minutes of the fourth quarter, but the Lakers mounted a comeback eventually winning 14-13.
The Lakers took control of the lead early, scoring less than a minute after the opening face-off. Senior midfielder Zac Reid was the goal scorer and moment’s later, senior midfielder James Chayka gave the Lakers a two-goal advantage.
Freshman attacker Matty Beccaris tied the game up in a span of a minute, but Chayka put Mercyhurst back ahead with nine seconds left in the quarter.
The Lakers made it a two goal game again seconds into the second quarter off a goal by senior attacker Brian Scheetz, and in similar fash- ion as in the first, they scored again minutes later.
The Pioneers found a way to pull back within one, off goals by graduate attacker/midfielder Joe Costello and senior midfielder Chris Ruhlig, but the Lakers answered right back a minute later to make it 6-4. On the man advantage, fresh- man attacker Ryan Slane cut the deficit to one.
Costello tied the game 10 seconds into the second half and freshman midfielder Anthony Bera- dis gave the pioneers their first lead of the game at the 10:16 mark. The lead was short lived, as the Lakers scored goals ten seconds apart to retake the lead.
Costello, again, led the offensive charge for the Pioneers, tying the game at 5:59. Beradis followed suite with another goal less than a minute later and Costello made it 10-8. The Pioneers and Lakers each scored one more time before the third quarter came to a close.
Junior attacker Jack McAndrew opened up the scoring in the game’s final quarter, making it an 11-10 game in favor of the Pioneers. Ruhlig and Beradis would get their names on the score sheet once again, putting their team up by three.
But the Lakes found the drive to overcome the late game deficit. Chayka scored first at the 8:59 mark. Junior attacker Brady Heseltine scored roughly four minutes later to cut the Pioneer lead to two. McAndrew tied it up on a man-up opportunity at 3:20 and Reid completed the comeback, scoring with 1:51 left to play while on the man advantage.
The Pioneers held the advantage in shots on goal, 29-23, over the Lakers; as well as had a 57-49 advantage in ground balls. Senior goaltender Tim Bradley made nine saves for the Pioneers in the loss.
LIU Post moves to 8-2 on the season and 4-1 in East Coast Conference play. Their next game is on Saturday, April 20, when the Pioneers travel to Oakdale, New York to take on the Dowling Golden Lions at 1 p.m.

Warmer months have finally arrived and you can no longer blame bad weather for not put- ting on your running shoes and going for a jog outside. If April gives us cold, rainy days, there
is really nothing stopping you from getting on the treadmill at the gym instead. But, in order to avoid injuries and stay mo- tivated without getting bored after two weeks, you need qual- ity shoes that suit your feet. This season, both women and men’s running shoes come in countless colors too! Here are outdoor and indoor alternatives in all price categories.
Outdoor for Her
If you are planning extensive outdoor running this season, it might be smart to invest in a pair of shoes that will not break after a few months. You should also look for running shoes that combine function with perfect fit. The ASICS Gel-Kinseys are $189 at Lady Foot Locker and constructed with a heel clutching system that provides a secure fit for your heels and propels you forward during toe-off. The shoe is multicolored, and comes in two cheaper versions called Nimbus and Noosa. If you are not a daily runner, consider budget-option Noosa; on sale for $99 at foot- locker.com right now. At Roosevelt Field Mall, many shoes are on sale now in the Finish Line store, like the breathing Nike Dual Fusion ST 2 that cost $55.
Outdoor for Him
If you are looking to invest in a really advanced pair of run- ning shoes that suit skilled to medium-level runners, the Mizuno Wave Prophecy 2 is a good alternative, and you will find them at footlocker.com for $179. It has taken seven years of research to develop the shoe that breathes and is built up with a full-length wave plate. On the official website, the Mizuno team describes
that they have, “Searched for the optimum amount of forefoot flex without compromising a rigid platform for pushing off,” and the shoes are supposed to give you a rocking-chair-like motion when feet hit the ground. The popular Nike Free Run 5.0+, which gives a barefoot-running feeling, is a budget option on sale at footlock- er.com for $89 right now. The price in stores is $99. The Free Runs have the great benefit of functioning both in and outdoors, so use them where you prefer, just make sure to wash them off before you hit the gym.
Indoor for Her
The Nike Free Run 5.0 + women’s edition are ideal shoes for both road and indoor running and give that barefoot-running feeling. They are offered in multiple colors, and pink, purple and coral red are among the most popular. If you get tired of the color, simply spice them up by adding different-colored shoelaces. The shoes can be purchased at Lady Foot Locker or the Nike Store, at Roosevelt Field Mall, for the price of $99. For $79 at the Nike Store, you can purchase the Nike Dual Fusion Run in red, that matches cushioning with a smooth ride and are ideal for indoor running.
Indoor for Him
The ASICS Gel Kayano 18 are now on sale at Foot Locker’s online store for $120, and they can be used both indoors and outdoors but work great for running on an indoor track. The shoes are designed in colors such as blue, black, grey and orange,
and give maximum support with a cushioning feeling. Just like the women’s ASICS gel shoes, the Kayano’s support the heel and reduces friction. In Finish Line stores, many Nike and Reebok options are on sale right now if looking for budget options under $60. Adidas Clima Cool Regulate in Black or Metallic/Silver is very light and has 360 degree-ventilation systems that keeps your feet cool when running and cost $59.98 at Finish Line.
Before you decide to hit the paths, trails and roads this season, make sure to get yourself a pair of shoes that are good for your entire body, not just the feet. When making the choice, go for comfort, support and style. And remember, every uphill will feel slightly more achievable in the right pair of shoes.

Have you ever been stuck in a seemingly never-ending class that droned on and on? Perhaps you felt the need to break up time with something to keep you entertained. One’s attention span only lasts for so long in a class that spans for an hour and twenty minutes or even longer. Different students break up class in different ways.
Some students choose to send text messages to their friends on their cell phones against the professor’s wishes. Others may stare at the clock, take water fountain breaks, or look out the window in between taking notes. While this may be true for some, others prefer remaining fully attentive for the duration of the entire class.
Sometimes, professors can keep class fun and interesting. “I like professors who keep the class lively and engaged. When they make some jokes here and there it brings the class back to life and keeps everyone more focused,” said Alex Marreo, a sophomore Criminal Justice major. Merreo shared a humorous anecdote that took place with one of his professors. Once, his professor was in the middle of a lec- ture and his phone went off with an extremely high pitch ring. The ringtone scared him and he screamed a loud obscenity.
Another student also commented on entertaining tales from sitting in some of these long, drawn out lectures. Emily Smith, a freshman Sociology major, told of a humorous event in her sociology class. “At least half of the guys were wearing diamond stud earrings. For the entire class our professor referred to the men as people who raided their mother’s jewelry boxes.”
Justin Romano, a freshman Radiology major, said, “One of my professors sat on a desk and fell over. Thankfully she was not hurt, but everyone including the professor had a good laugh over it.”
While certain students had comical classroom accounts to speak of, others did not. Alexa Dunetz, a junior Political Science major said, “It’s been a really uneventful semester. Nothing all that funny has happened. I have been so preoccupied with my studies and my work as a political coordinator that I haven’t had time to pay attention to many other areas.”
One comical moment I recall during my time at LIU Post is an intersession class I enrolled in several semesters ago. The professor left the room for a brief moment to grab several assignments to return to the class. Upon her leaving the room, I played ‘One More Time’ by Daft Punk at full volume, which resulted in song and laughter.
Not all students take note of their surroundings during a class period. However, it is important to keep it fun. A lively class is a productive class, as Maerro stated.

Ok, so recently I have noticed something incredibly disturbing about guys. They stare, quite creepily and frequently! Looking at a girl and smil- ing nicely is one thing. But no, that’s not what modern “men” seem to think is appropriate.
When my co-Editor-in-Chief and I have been walking around lately with our friends, we’ve noticed it. It’s not always us being stared at either; we are under no impression that we are reminiscent of Ava Gardner. But in all honesty, staring for any longer then a quick glance is super creepy. If you feel the need to take a second look, do NOT make it so obvious!
Ogling a girl does not make her feel any inclination to come say hello, it really just makes us think, “EW f*** off, creeper.” I witnessed a man at Roosevelt Field Mall yesterday, literally do a 360 and start walking backwards to stare at another woman. I was absolutely disgusted because not only was he staring; he was making a disgusting face like he wanted to go all Hannibal Lector on her.
It’s men like that, that are the epitome of “creep.” They are also the reason why a fair amount of females carry maze in their bags. I don’t think you guys realize that after we catch you looking at us like that, we laugh at you. Not only do we laugh, we usually make fun of you as well. I’m obvi- ously not a man but I highly doubt that is the desired response.
It’s almost as bad, if not worse, then strange and random Facebook messages. Why do you men feel the need to be so utterly bizarre? This is why you are all single. You freak us out more often then turn us on. I really can’t see why it’s such an insane notion, that if you think a girl is pretty, to go up to her and say hi. Maybe even ask her name. What’s the worst she can say? Go away, I’m not interested. Well, she certainly has no interest when you stare at like her like she’s a juicy steak or something.
I know you men think females are these mystical beings that you need the help of Einstein to figure out. Sometimes that’s true, but in this case it’s really quite simple. Don’t act like a freak or a psycho creeper and you will find more success in your ventures. Chances are she was looking at you too and wants you to introduce yourself. Any easy sign of this is if she makes direct eye contact with you. Just do me a personal favor, stop staring, it’s weird.

The Pioneer recently spoke with singer-songwriter Keaton Simons who is releasing his second full-length album, Beautiful Pain, on April 30. Keaton has had his music featured in several television shows and feature films including Private Practice and NCIS: Los Angeles. He is a longtime friend of David Duchovny, of Californication, who also often plays and writes with Simons. You can follow Simons on Twitter @ KeatonSimons.
The Pioneer (TP): Your sophomore album “Beautiful Pain” releases April 30. What can you tell us about your writing process for this album?
Keaton Simons (KS): For this album, I went into the studio with a few songs written that I knew I wanted to record, including “Beautiful Pain” as well as “Is There Any Other Way,” which I wrote with Jason Mraz. I also spent a few weeks writing at Revolver Studios, Mikal Blue’s gorgeous spot, with some amazing people like Shari Short, Josh Zegan and Glen Phillips (Toad The Wet Sprocket).
(TP): Which of the new tracks is your favorite and why? 
(KS): I have a terribly difficult time choosing favorites. If I were forced to choose, I’d probably have to go with “Beautiful Pain” because it’s extremely close to my heart and represents many of my deeper beliefs about love and life.
(TP): The album includes co-writes with friends and peers Jason Mraz, Jason Reeves, Glen Phillips and Mikal Blue. What was the collaboration like?
(KS): Every collaboration is different and that’s what I love about it. Collaborating provides an opportu- nity to create something that neither party would create on their own.
(TP): Where do you find your inspiration? 
(KS): Inspiration is everywhere. I just allow myself to be open to it and it finds me.
(TP): Your music has been featured on shows such as “Sons of Anarchy,” “Private Practice” and “NCIS: Los Angeles.” How does it feel to hear your work on the small screen?
(KS): It feels amazing. Music and cinema bring things out in each other that I find absolutely fascinating and exciting.
(TP): This season, you are guest staring in the season finale of Showtimes’s “Californication.” Tell us about your role and experience on set.
(KS): I play the role of “Rocker Dude,” a stretch, I know. They had me shirtless with fake nipple rings and a leather vest. We filmed the episode at The Greek Theatre and I got to perform in front of thousands of people. It was awesome.
(TP): What advice do you have for college students who want to get ahead or break into the business? 
(KS): The best advice I can give anyone is to follow your heart and do what you love to do. Remember why you do it and don’t allow yourself to get caught up in all the crap.
(TP): If you were not performing, what would you be doing professionally and why? 
(KS): I’m sure I’d be doing something artistic or scientific. Not sure exactly what. It’s really hard for me to imagine doing anything else.
(TP): As a send off, tell us about one of your YOLO moments. 
(KS): I was recently on tour in Taos, New Mexico, and had the opportunity to check out some natural hot springs right next to the Rio Grande. The springs were lovely, warm and placid while the Rio Grande was freezing and roaring. So what did I do? I jumped out of the spring and took a dip in the deep freeze. My heart almost stopped, but it was well worth it. YOLO.

Little League baseball is probably great for young kids, but for a more thrilling experience for your son; sign him up for mutton busting.
Country singer Merle Haggard gives you good advice in the song, “Mama, Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys,” but if you put your three-year-old on the back of a sheep, they might be lost to it at a young age.
Mutton busting is something as simple as Sheep Rodeo for younger children. The objective is the same as in regular bull rodeo; the rider must stay on the sheep for as long as possible. An adult handler holds the sheep still while the child is placed on top, in riding position. As soon as the child is in position, the sheep is released and usually starts to run in an attempt to get the child off, while the kid tries to stay on for as long as possible.
There are no set rules for mutton busting, nor any national organization. Still, there is a weight limit for the rider to help protect the sheep. Most of the events are organized at a local lever, or in connection to larger bull riding events. Former rodeo queen Nancy Stockdale Cervi sponsored the National Western Stock Show in 1980, where the first evidence of the competition has been document- ed. There is no statistics available of the popularity of the sport, but based on the media coverage and anecdotal reports, I think it’s safe to say thousands of children participate every year in the U.S.
How do they ride them? Well, as in all of sports there is different ways of approaching mutton busting. Some choose to ride the sheep like adults ride bulls; sitting and holding the sheep close to the neck. Still the most efficient way to ride the sheep has proven to be to lie down on the back of the sheep. In that way they are more likely to slide off, rather than fall. The winners in each competition are often able to hang on for around eight seconds. An important side note is that girls tend to better at this age, as their coordination is further developed.
Not all mutton riders grow up to be cowboys or cowgirls, but seven-time all round cowboy World Champion Ty Mur- ray started out riding sheep, so you could be giving your child a good career start.
All participants in mutton busting are required to wear a helmet and a pad- ded vest, and the parents naturally sign liability slips. Falls, tumbles and scratches are all a part of the sport. Many supporters of mutton busting say that it teaches them to pick them selves up, when thrown to the grown, a valuable life lesson.
Unsurprisingly, there is no mutton busting in New York, and very few on the east coast in general. The Washington In- ternational Horse Show that starts Tuesday October 23, 2013 is hosting a mutton busting event for the youngest in the family. If you want your kid to grow up to be a cowboy, you should consider moving further south. If you, for any reason, can not move from New York I have a few tips for you to help prepare your child for its first mutton busting event: plan all vacations as a road trip in the south; or buy a BIG dog, so your child could start riding that.

Everyone loves Beyoncé, right? Well, you can add Drake to the list. In the late hours of Monday night, Drake released a single entitled “Girls Love Beyoncé” featuring James Fauntleroy. The new song covers a portion Destiny’s Child’s hit song from 1999, “Say My Name.”
The Toronto rapper starts off the song saying: “Look, I know girls love Beyoncé,” which leads to Drake discussing how girls love to mess with your conscience.
Drake switches the style up, as he raps slow and quiet. He diverts away from his last couple of fast-paced singles “Started From the Bottom” and “5 AM in Toronto.” This Beyoncé song avoids the “angry-Drake” that was heard in “5 AM in Toronto” which was essentially a diss-track.
This song resembles slower songs from the past such as “Marvin’s Room” and “Shot for Me” off his last album, Take Care. Some people dislike when Drake is emotional. Other rappers feel he’s soft and just appealing to the ladies with these types of songs. However, others can relate to some of the things he talks about when he isn’t flying through a track rapping for more than three straight minutes, such as in “9 AM in Dallas.”
At one point, Drake opens up about his personal life and says: “These days it’s hard to meet woman. Feel like my love life is finished. I’ve been avoiding commitment.”
The climax of the song is nearly one minute in, when Fauntleroy jumps in and covers a song Beyoncé made famous with Destiny’s Child nearly 14 years ago: “Say My Name.”
Drake lays it up for Fauntleroy as he says: “You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone. But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name…” Fauntleroy dunks it home with a smooth cover bringing you back
to the 90s. On the same night of “Girls Love Beyonce,” Drake was also part of another song that was released. “No New Friends” by DJ Khaled featuring Drake along with Rick Ross and Lil Wayne. Khaled assembled the same crew as he did from two summers ago with “I’m On One.” That song was a summer anthem, so don’t be surprised if you hear this song blasting non-stop in a couple months.
“No New Friends” was originally a remix of “Started From the Bottom” and Drake kills it with his slick rhymes and clever references.
Any verse that mentions James Harden is off to a good start. Drizzy says “H-Town my second hame like I’m James Harden.” Harden is a professional basketball player that plays for the Houston Rockets.
A fun and confusing end to the song is Future’s outro which consists of two sentences. He is not featured throughout the rest of the song, and talks for only a couple seconds.

In less than four weeks, the spring semester will end. If you feel like getting a jump-start on your college studies, going to summer school might be the right thing for you. Post offers more than 900 undergraduate and graduate classes on campus that can help you fulfill your degree requirements.
TK Wu, a senior Film major, enjoys summer classes because it’s an opportunity to concentrate on only one or two classes, whereas during the spring and fall semesters you may be taking up to six classes. Wu said, “Summer classes are nice because they’re short and concentrated.” However, because of the short time period, according to Wu, the classes are hard work. “There are [exams] every week, so that means if you miss more than one day, you’re done.”
Even though Wu sees some of the benefits of summer school, he believes that there are some negative aspects too. The problem with classes over the summer, according to Wu, is that students don’t get to know a lot of people because the experience of making friends dur- ing the regular school year is easier.
Jordyn Leder, a sophomore Physical Education major, said she would not be taking summer classes because it’ll be too expensive since she does not live on Long Island. “I live in New Jersey and it is too far for me to [get to] Post, and it’s inconvenient to spend the summer there when I work at home,” she added. Even though she is not taking summer classes this year, she has considered enrolling in a summer session because it would help her graduate earlier.
Nicole Urbs, a junior International Business major, has taken summer classes for the past two years at Post. “It is nice to take summer classes because you do not have the pressure of the other classes like during the school year,” she said. “It is also a chance to get a head start for the next year so you do not have to take as many credits during the fall and spring semesters.”
According to Nicholas Ramer, associate dean of College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, all summer classes can be taken during the regular semester too. ”Most of the classes in the summer are in the core with some electives.”
If you would like to enroll in summer classes, head on over to your MyLIU account and register today. According to the Post website, tuition is $974, per semester hour, for undergraduate classes and $1,068, per semester hour, for graduate classes. Classes run in three, five weeklong summer sessions, from May to August, and range from one to four credits. For more information please contact Academic Advising Office at 516-299-2746.
