There are currently two authorized and recommended vaccines for the COVID-19 virus: Pzifer BioNTech and Moderna. New York State is doing a phased distribution of the vaccine and is the currency in phase 1a and 1b. Phase 1a and 1b include high-risk hospital workers, healthcare workers, and individuals that are age 65 and older.
Nursing students at Post have been keeping up with the virus through news sources.
“There are two kinds, Pfizer and Moderna,” sophomore nursing major Daniella Connor said. “Both vaccines require a follow-up or second vaccine to complete the dosage.
Connor explained how the coronavirus vaccine is different from most others.
“These vaccines aren’t like normal vaccines that release a weakened version of the virus into your body, they use mRna that essentially “teach” the cells in our body to make a protein that will trigger an immune response to the virus,” she said. 
Junior nursing major Antonette Dalfino has also been keeping up with the vaccine and is hopeful about its progress.
“It seems to be working well so far and has similar side effects to the flu vaccine which people around the world have gotten for years,” Dalfino said. “I am very hopeful about the vaccine and that it will hopefully let everything return back to normal.”
Connor is also optimistic about the vaccine.
“So long as everyone keeps doing their part to stay socially distant and wearing their masks I’m very hopeful,” she said. “If the vaccine becomes available to a majority of the US population it’s possible the pandemic that has been dragging on and escalating for so long might finally start to see numbers decline.”
Both Connor and Dalfino know people who have received the vaccine, and say that they will take it once the vaccine is available to them. 
“Both of my parents have been vaccinated because they are considered essential and healthcare workers. We haven’t seen any adverse effects in either of them, so hopefully, [it] all turns out well,” Connor said “I definitely would take the vaccine if given the opportunity to. I’m trying my best to keep myself and everyone around me safe.”
Sophomore nursing major Nicole Carano has had family members receive the vaccine but is still hesitant to take it herself.
“I personally wouldn’t take the vaccine just yet. I will probably wait until they know more about the long term side effects,” Carano said. “Plus, I’m in no rush to get it being that I don’t start my clinicals until September. I would rather give people who need it more than me the opportunity to go first.” 
The pandemic has affected Connor’s thoughts about the healthcare system, but overall hasn’t changed her path to nursing. 
“COVID has made me a little more skeptical of the US healthcare system than I was before,” Connor said. “Seeing doctors and nurses putting their own lives at risk because the US could not provide enough PPE for healthcare workers to work safely definitely rubbed me the wrong way, but hopefully with time and reform the healthcare system will become better equipped for employees and more accessible for patients.”
Dalfino agreed with Connor.
“COVID has made me nervous to go into the medical field because it is so little we know about the virus,” Dalfino said. “However, with the proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and continuous handwashing and sanitation, I still feel very excited every time I have a clinical day so I could help people who are suffering.”
Carano said COVID hasn’t worried her for herself, but for her family.
 “Honestly, I’m not nervous for myself, especially knowing the survival rate for my age group,” Carano said. “I would only be nervous to give it to my family.”
Most college students aren’t likely to get the vaccine until April when the vaccine is projected to be available to everyone.

Social media website Reddit and Wall Street went head to head for one of the craziest circumstances the stock market had ever seen on Jan.26. After GameStop stock(GME) saw massive gains through the start of last summer going into this year, major hedge funds and institutional investors shorted GME shares. 
To short a stock means to open sell positions on a stock you do not currently own, and bet that it will be a lower price at a later date of your choosing for a profit. The difference in value between the stock price at the time of execution and expiration is your profit/loss. These dates cannot be changed once set. 
After GameStop announced they would be putting e-commerce friendly people on their executive board, their stock surged from $4 to nearly $40 per share at the middle of last month. With the drastic overvalued stock price in such a short time, hedge funds like Citadel were very confident that their short positions would be very successful, as typical trends would show a pullback almost inevitable. 
A Reddit page listed as r/wallstreetbets had other plans. A relatively large page of about half a million young investors ranging predominantly from 16 to 25, decided to take it upon themselves to challenge Wall Street. 
These investors on Wall Street Bets, were able to drive the price of GameStop all the way to the 300s, which cost the hedge funds billions on their shorts, particularly Melville Capital who due to their losses had to reposition their entire portfolio. 
The stock market did see huge losses overall for a few days, as institutions had to liquidate their assets to cover for some losses, but this was short lived and the market has been growing positively since. 
This situation does not come without controversy. On Jan. 28, Robinhood, a popular online brokerage with over 13 million users, shut down the ability to buy GameStop and other shares manipulated by the Reddit users. By making the only option available to sell, the only way price could have moved is down, which would save the hedge funds from any more potential losses, and costing the retail investors who bought in. 
There have been class action lawsuits taken against Robinhood and other brokerages who shut down trading, and investigations are in place to see who exactly was involved, and who’s call it was. 
Brandon Kaim, a freshman computer science major, started investing around the time this all started. Kaim thinks this was an unprecedented circumstance, which will not happen again.
“I think what happened was pretty once in a lifetime. Stock prices shifting thousands of percentages up in price because of a group of people online is just insane,” he said. 
Kaim is in favor of the Reddit investors in this situation. 
“I think WSB was in the right. Wall Street has been playing the same game for years, but when a group of individual investors join in on the game it’s somehow different,” he said. 
Kaim would like to see more accountability on brokerages and people in charge of shutting down the trading of GME and others. 
“I do think some regulation should be made, but more on the part of apps like Robinhood and others on if or when they are allowed to refuse users to buy certain shares,” he said. “They were absolutely not in the right.”
Kaim believes the hedge funds will learn from this situation, and that their eyes opened to all the potentials of new players within market movement. 
“Hedge funds learned that times are changing and that if they want to be competitive in Wall Street they have to expect more individual traders to challenge them,” he said. 
Kaim is certain that this is not something that should be tried if you are looking to be a successful trader/investor throughout your life, but having an edge when you can spot it is not something you should avoid taking advantage of either. 
“Individual traders learned that yes it is possible to make big gains from bubbles like this, but it is very volatile and you could go from millionaire one minute back to broke in the next,” he said. “Don’t rely on short term plays like this if you’re going to invest, it’s a gamble but sometimes it does pay off.”
There’s a few factors here that make this situation unique and specific to the times. You have the smallest group in terms of market equity, (young people), taking on the largest financial powers and winning. This was only made possible through social media, you needed a platform to bring all these people together to talk and plan it out, which is why it had never happened before. 
Wall Street had always been the movers within the market due to the amount of money they play with. To be toppled by people with net worths mostly all under five figures, and only using a few hundred to a few thousand in their gambles, shows that when enough people come together, it is possible to beat Wall Street at its own game. 
To have Robinhood make decisions that primarily hurt their own customers, shows that Wall Street will use any means necessary to save themselves, while unethical, and possibly illegal. It is unclear if any civil or legal charges will be taken against anyone involved.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has gone viral many times during his campaign to be president in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.
During the 2021 inauguration for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, a photo of Sanders sitting in a chair wearing a face mask and mittens became a ‘meme’ on the internet. Millions of people posted memes about the relatability of Sanders and his mittens on platforms such as Twitter, Tiktok and Instagram.
Students found Sanders’ clothing ensemble to be comical.
“I think his mittens went viral because in comparison to [all of] the meticulously coordinated ensembles of the other attendees, they were incredibly casual,” sophomore musical theatre major BrayLynn Willis said. “It was funny to see Bernie’s beige parka and patterned mittens among everyone else’s classy outfits.” 
In an interview with Seth Meyers on Jan. 21, Sanders did not have much to say about his outfit.
“I was just sitting there trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on,” Sanders said.
The mittens were made by a teacher from Vermont named Jane Ellis, who made them out of repurposed wool sweaters and lined with fleece made from recycled plastic bottles. She gave them to Sanders over two years ago, and he was spotted wearing them at the Seacoast Women’s March in 2020.
After Bernie went viral during the inauguration, his team began making merchandise to sell for charities. 
“Not only are we having fun but what we are doing here in Vermont is we’re going to be selling around the country sweatshirts and t-shirts,” Sanders told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
“And with all the money that we’re going to be raising, which I expected is going to be a couple of million dollars, will be going to programs like Meals on Wheels and Feed [for] low-income seniors,” he said.
While Sanders’ reaction to his viral appearance is admirable to students, the premise of many of Sanders’ actions being applauded and meme-d by millennials says a lot about the generation.
“I believe Millennials could be drawn to Bernie because he champions wealth distribution issues,” Willis said. “A lot of the culture surrounding millennials has to do with debt and limited class mobility, which are both issues Bernie discusses a lot.”
Sanders’ beliefs in a higher minimum wage, redistribution of wealth through tax reform, and a distaste for the rich who keep getting richer has gained him huge popularity among younger voters.
Willis claims that the internet craze over Sanders’ outfit also has a lot to do with the overarching stress and fear that many people had over the inauguration.
“I think Bernie’s mittens going viral says something about our stress levels,” she said. “In a time of so much uncertainty and upheaval, I know I was worried about how the inauguration would go. The fact that our society clung to something so silly during such a contentious moment says a lot about the way we’re coping at the moment.”
The mittens Sanders frequently wears may just be an article of clothing that cluttered the internet for a brief time, but they show the importance of supporting local businesses, improving the environment, and making the government more accessible to the common people. Goals that many millenials and younger voters hope to achieve during the next few elections.

When the 2020 fall sports season got canceled, athletes and coaches alike did not know what the future held. This all changed on Feb.1, when the Northeast Conference(NEC) announced that fall & spring sports would be competing at the same time during spring season play. 
Every sport will be playing shortened seasons, consisting of only Conference matchups. Field Hockey, Men’s Soccer and Women’s soccer will all look to capitalize on this new format. 
Field Hockey head coach Raenee Savin is excited to finally be able to compete this year after the back and forth all offseason. 
“Getting back on the field has been a long time coming,” she said. “We’re very excited to welcome our freshmen from Virginia, Argentina and Spain, and think that the team we’ve built on paper can do some great things.”
Coach Savin feels the shortened season, as well breaks in between games will be beneficial. 
“Playing a six-game season is one third of what it would normally be, but we’re looking forward to it,” she said. “Having games only once a week will give the student-athletes who are here time to allow their bodies to recover between games. This also gives us time to prepare.” 
Savin is not concerned with the different weather patterns the spring holds as compared to the fall. 
“We’re used to coming into preseason and melting on the turf.  Our first few training sessions have already had to be adjusted due to snow,” she said. “Over the years we’ve gotten very good at changing on the fly, we’ll make it work!”
Coach Savin has very high expectations for the team this season. Despite having some international students unable to come back for the spring, she is confident in what the Sharks will bring. 
“I am confident that we will make a strong showing.  The top two teams will contend [in the NEC Championship game], with the winner competing in an NCAA play-in-game,” Savin said.  “I anticipate that team being LIU.”
Senior Goalkeeper, Rachel Vellis, is looking forward to playing in her final season. 
“I look forward to getting back into it and feeling like a college athlete again. It has been a while since we have been together as a team,” she said. “I am very excited to compete alongside my best friends again.”
Vellis is looking to enjoy her last season, but also be a fierce competitor. 
“Throughout this season my goals are to have fun and remain mentally resilient,” she said. Despite the roster shortages, Vellis remains committed to pulling through behind the net. “I intend to deal with adversity with a strong head and a smile on my face. Hopefully, my teammates will follow my lead as well.”
Vellis has been the starting goalkeeper every year she has been at LIU, going back to her first two seasons with the Pioneers.
Senior forward, Sammy Bell, is grateful for the opportunity to finally play again after all the doubt over the past year. 
It’s a great feeling knowing that I’ll be able to play with my teammates and best friends one last time,” she said. “I was trying not to get my hopes up about having a season which makes this opportunity even more exciting.”
Bell is looking for immense success both collectively and as an individual this season. She feels the team will pull through despite the scheduling obstacles. 
“It will be difficult starting our conference play without having played any non-conference games, however, this will only fuel us to practice even harder leading up to our first game against Rider,” Bell said. 
Sammy Bell has been one of the best scorers for LIU. Last year, In only her first season playing Division I field hockey for the Sharks, she finished third in the conference in goals and shots. Bell will look to build on the production she has proven to display. 
“I hope to be an influential player on the field this season and lead my team to victory. As a senior and a successful offensive player, I am someone that my teammates look up to as a role model”, she said.  Therefore I must work to be my best version of myself, both on and off the field.”
Last year, The Sharks went 7-10 overall, while going 4-2 in conference play. That was enough to secure the third seed in the NEC. They fell short in the first game of the conference tournament 3-0 to 2nd seed Rider University. The first game of the season will take place on Thursday, Mar.18 vs Rider.

Out-of-state students who planned to attend classes in-person the spring 2021 semester were required by New York State to quarantine for at least four days. On the fourth day, students could receive a coronavirus test and potentially move into their dorms prior to the two-week quarantine period that was required the fall 2020 semester.
Students were informed via an email from Promise to report to the Chapel to receive their quarantine room assignment. The email stated that students would not have access to their dorms prior to quarantining, and recommended that students should bring items that are normally in their dorms such as a Wi-Fi router, shower shoes and cleaning supplies.
While most students had a quarantine room on campus, some students were placed in The Roslyn hotel. Students who stayed on campus were given a small towel, linens, a comforter and a pillow in their room. Post also provided three meals a day to be delivered to the quarantine rooms.
Students felt that the quarantine was generally well-executed by Promise.
“I think [that]overall, Promise did a great job keeping us informed and safe,” sophomore health sciences major Miranda Ruiz said. “We were [usually] given meals on time, informed about safety protocols fairly regularly, were provided with a COVID-19 test, and were provided transportation to said test.”
Students reported spending a lot of time using technology to watch streaming services and play video games during their free-time.
“I got stir-crazy pretty quickly because I was bored,” sophomore musical theatre major Hannah Winston said. “I spent a lot of time waiting for meals, or just watching movies.”
Ruiz agrees with Winston. 
“I mainly worked and watched YouTube videos. A couple of times I played video games with friends via discord.”
While the experience was generally pleasant, both Winston and Ruiz had some suggestions for improvement.
“I think Promise needs to be more in touch with those quarantining since every case is different,” Winston said. “It feels like once we are in quarantine, Promise goes under the radar when we have questions about our status in quarantine and other logistics like food, water, and moving out etc. I also had some confusion with getting medical accommodations.”
Winston also suggests that Promise could allow more accomodation to dietary restrictions. 
“One of my friends had to order food a few times solely because Promise served her food that she stated she cannot eat,” she said.
Ruiz states that Post forgot to give her sheets.
“[The administration] promised bedding for us and all I really got was a blanket and a pillow,” she said. “I’m not saying that wasn’t appreciated, but they could’ve at least provided sheets. Sleeping on a bare mattress is kind of weird.”
Overall, having to quarantine on campus was not a terrible experience for students, but communication and care could be improved.

With the spring semester beginning on campus, clubs and organizations have begun gearing up for what will be an eventful few months. One such organization, Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA), recently announced their spring season: a jam-packed collection of shows featuring a large variety of styles and genres.
“We have a great lineup of shows this semester,” senior musical theatre major and ESTA co-president Jaclyn Holliday said. “We are doing a ‘24 Hour Play Festival,’ ‘Into the Woods,’ ‘Phineas and Ferb,’ ‘a Cabaret Celebrating Artists of Color,’ ‘Anonymous Legally Blonde’ and ‘Tick, Tick.. BOOM!’ We will also have shows done throughout the semester by our incredible improv troupe, No Control.” The season selection was announced on Jan. 30, and shows will take place virtually throughout the semester.
ESTA shows are entirely student directed and produced; students can propose shows to be a part of ESTA’s season, and the final show selections are made by ESTA’s e-board. 
“There are many factors that go into selecting the ESTA season. We look at what type of show it is, the duration of the performance, the budget, and who is a part of the team,” Holliday said. 
ESTA does an entirely new lineup of shows every semester, so the e-board is very careful in their decision making process to ensure quality, nuanced material is picked. “
We want to make sure that the season has variety and diversity, we also try to pick new directors to give equal opportunities to everyone,” Holliday said.
With this rigorous selection process, having a show selected to be a part of the season can be incredibly exciting for budding student directors. 
“I was so grateful that my proposal was picked,” said sophomore musical theatre major and “Into the Woods” director Patrick Blanner said.“This season is going to be legendary, and I am absolutely honored to be a part of it.” 
Student directors get full creative freedom with their productions, allowing ample artistic opportunity for the student body. 
“This production is going to be hyper focused on each of the individual characters,” Blanner said, explaining the concept for his show.
“Expect to see ‘Into the Woods’ like you have never seen it before,” he said.
Students in the ESTA community have become increasingly excited about what’s to come this spring with their shows.
“I am so stoked to see how creative people are this semester,” freshman musical theatre major Laura Degraw said.
“Honestly, I’m excited for all of it. I can’t wait to see what this group of directors and organizers have in store,” Holliday said. 
For students looking to be involved in this semester’s season, auditions are due by the end of the day on Feb. 10. Students can also reach out to the e-board for further involvement inquiries at any time.
“Follow us on instagram @esta.liupost and twitter @LIUpostESTA for information on auditions, performances, and how to get involved with ESTA, and follow No Control’s instagram as well to keep up with what our improv troupe is doing @nocontrolimprov,” Holliday said.
Any student on campus is welcome to be involved with ESTA and take advantage of the ample opportunities offered to perform in, direct, create, choreograph, and produce their own shows. Beyond that however, ESTA also fosters a community of students who are able to build bonds with one another through the creation of art.
“I love the ESTA community because it truly is full of so many different kinds of people,” Blanner said. “It was a place that I was able to safely and comfortably discover more about myself while doing what I love.”
Blanner’s sentiments were echoed by Degraw in her experience with the club as a freshman.
“ESTA has let me meet and form better relationships with not only my peers but upperclassmen. I feel really lucky to have had the chance to form those relationships,” she said.
Even in the height of a global endemic, the ESTA community has been able to offer some reprieve for its members.
“During this time of COVID, when everything feels so ‘bla,’ it’s great to be able to come together and watch your friends put on a show that they’ve passionately been working on for weeks,” Holliday said. “I am amazed at the quality of shows and dedication that our members have to making every event memorable.”
With an audition due date fast approaching, and an exciting season of shows right around the corner, directors, e-board members, and students alike are all thrilled for this semester of ESTA to be underway.
“This season is going to be legendary, and I am absolutely honored to be a part of it,” Blanner said.
