It had been snowing all morning in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, but that wasn’t enough to stop the C.W. Post football team from handing the Bloomsburg Huskies their first loss of the season, winning 24-21. The loss was the Huskies’ first loss in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference eastern division since 2009 and the first time the Pioneers have ever beaten Bloomsburg.
The Huskies got on the board first, when running back Franklin Quiteh rushed 70 yards into the end zone to give them a 7-0 lead. Despite the snowy conditions, freshman kicker Marc Montana was able to get the Pioneers right back into the game, kicking a 27-yard field goal.
Steven Laurino did a nice job with the ball all day despite the tough throwing conditions. Laurino completed 12 of 27 passes for 194 yards and a touchdown. Laurino also rushed for 75 yards on the ground. He gave the Pioneers a short lead with a touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Ryan Derham to start the second, giving the Pioneers a 10-7 lead.
Bloomsburg then struck back to take the lead 14-10 when Quiteh rushed in his second touchdown of the day from five yards out. In the second half, the Huskies looked to gain some momentum when they scored their third touchdown of the day to give them an 11 point lead 21-10.
Jeff Mack had a huge game, rushing for 183 yards, but his biggest contributions were his two touchdowns when the team was down in the second half. Late in the third, Mack rushed it in for a six-yard score, cutting the lead to 21-17. In the fourth, Mack struck again, this time scoring from three yards out after a 13-play drive that spanned 80 yards to give Post a 24-21 lead with 6:54 remaining in the game.
The Huskies gave the Pioneers a scare as they held the ball with 1:27 remaining in the game, but junior defensive back Antonio Powell-Fields picked off Pat Carey to seal the victory for the Pioneers.
The heavy snow and a game-time temperature of 32 degrees had an effect on both teams as five of the seven scores in the game came on the ground. Huskies quarterback Pat Carey completed just 4 of 15 pass attempts, getting intercepted twice.  The Pioneers rushed the ball for a combined 58 times for 265 yards.
On defense, Lou Scala had a huge game with 10 tackles and 1.5 sacks, and Michael Burton and Tuqwan Ashley forced fumbles while Casey Baisi intercepted a pass.
The Pioneers are now 5-1 in the conference and 5-4 overall, and they have a chance to go to the postseason.  They play Cheyney at home for the final conference game of the season on Saturday, November 5th. Coverage on 88.1 FM begins at 11:30 a.m. with kickoff slated at high noon.

Two wins in the last week have given the Pioneers a 15-1-1 record for the ECC regular season. The Pioneers secured their trophy for the ECC regular season after beating Queens College on October 22nd – a game that the Pioneers started off slow in but rebounded for the win against American International College.  On Sunday, October 30th, the Pioneers honored seniors William Lindberg, Chris King, and Dave Borysewicz with a 2-0 victory against Molloy College.
On October 22nd, the Yellow Jackets took a 1-0 lead with an odd shot attempt, confusing sophomore goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen, early in the first half. But, the Pioneers were determined to not have another loss, and freshman forward Eivind Austboe evened out the score with a header, assisted by team captain Eirik Bjornoe.
After a rocky start, the game turned into C.W. Post’s favor.  Junior midfielder Andreas Olsen continued his habit of scoring and gave the team a 2-1 lead after the break. The Pioneers maintained their effective play, and Austboe scored his second goal of the day making it a 3-1 lead in favor of the Pioneers. The score was settled when Olsen made a long run on the right side, assisting sophomore Jonathon Watkin with a pass, topping off a 4-1 win.
The Pioneers gave the crowd of spectators what they came to see: another win and several goals, showing effective play and good individual performances.
“It was a great team effort. We played together and produced chances, and, most importantly, we continued to score goals,” said Bjornoe.
Seniors William Lindberg, Chris King, and David Borysewicz were honored before the last ECC regular season game on Sunday, October 30th, against Molloy College. With a 2-0 win, the Pioneers finished with style, improving their record to 15-1-1.
After a slow start, a couple of adjustments to the starting 11 put the Pioneers in control of the match, culminating in an ending with a goal at the end of the first half. Graduate midfielder Kevin Miny scored on an assist from Olsen, which put the Pioneers up by one.
The Pioneers came out with another slow start after the break with poor pressure and not many chances. However, adjustments were made, and C.W. Post was back in control. Thirty seconds after sophomore forward Cemil Turan entered the game in the second half, he found the back of the net, securing the Pioneers with a 2-0 win.
“Today was senior day, so today it is their win,” said sophomore captain Eirik Bjornoe. Ready for new challenges, the Pioneer captain is looking forward to the ECC semifinal against Queens College on Wednesday, November 2nd, with a hope to reach the final, which would be played on Friday, November 4th.

After making Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference playoffs for the first time since joining the conference in 2008, the C.W. Post field hockey team saw its season end on Friday, at the hands of the second-ranked Shippensburg University Red Raiders. The 4-1 loss came in the semifinal round of the tournament and dropped the team’s final record to 10-8, the team’s first winning record in three years. The Red Raiders will now continue into the PSAC championship to face Bloomsburg University on Monday, October 31st.
Shippensburg took control of the pace of the game from the start, scoring in the 16th minute of play on a tip from Taylor Jones to take the lead 1-0. The Pioneers fought back after the Shippensburg’s goal, challenging the Red Raiders in their own defensive zone. The team couldn’t find the back of the net, though, and the score remained at 1-0 going into halftime.
Shippensburg turned up the offense in the final half. A 48th-minute goal, followed by another goal two minutes later, put the Red Raiders on top 3-0. The Pioneers were finally able to get on the board in the 57th minute when sophomore forward Carlee Dragon, who currently leads the nation in goals scored, scored on a penalty stroke. With eight minutes left to play, the Red Raiders scored one more goal to solidify the final score at 4-1 and end the Pioneers’ season.
Senior goalkeeper Devon Trenkle made six saves in goal for the Pioneers, who were outshot 7-25 on the day.

            You can sense “bad news” from someone the moment you meet them. We’ll take this from my perspective; just about the instant a guy walks up to me, it’s like a billboard over his head that reads, “I am bad news. I will absolutely hurt you.” You try as hard as you can to resist his impeccable charm. Eventually, you find yourself captivated by it; you cannot withstand it. Girls are not the only ones susceptible to it, my male friends have affirmed that they can sense it too.
So why do we do it? If you can sense harm, even emotional harm, from another person just as you meet him or her, why don’t you run for the hills? Trust me, I wish I had the answer for you. I think every girl has to survive one ignoramus before she really learns her lesson; as much as we can give out advice about relationships, we can never seem to take our own.
You start out strong. At first, your instinct tells you to do the right thing and you can withstand their wit. Eventually, it becomes so difficult that you give in and go out with them. I’ve found that people that have big egos do not take well to being turned down, so they are very persistent. At this point, it’s all over. Their charm takes hold and you’re a goner; wave goodbye to any and all sense of reason.
It only seems to get worse after that. You will put up with whatever craziness these people begin to throw at you. There are times when they show you that they are capable of being these amazing boyfriends/girlfriends and that’s what you begin to hold on for dear life. No matter what they do or say, it won’t matter, because in the back of your mind, you know that this person is able to be better. But honestly, how much is too much? Where do you draw the line?
We are inclined to want to fix people. Is that a part of it? We want to stay with this person under the allusion that we will turn them into this magnificent person that we want them to be. At this stage in our lives, we should all be aware that we can’t change people; they are who they are. However, I am confident in the fact that a lot of people will not take this advice until they are literally at their wits’ end with their significant other, myself included.

Kotobuki
86 Deer Park Avenue
Babylon, NY 11702-2802
(631)            321-8387
For someone who has had a long and trying journey with raw seafood, I bring to you a restaurant that I choose time and time again when asked where I want to dine. Sushi is not for everyone, but if you are one of those people who are willing to try something new, then Kotobuki will turn you into a believer. The secret with sushi is the freshness, which is appreciated in all food but becomes a necessity in raw foods. And, that is something that is guaranteed when you go to Kotobuki.
Located in the chic village of Babylon in the South Shore, it is the perfect place to go on a date with a lover or just with a group of friends. I tend to go there with the latter at least once a month. The atmosphere is very city-like in that it is an awfully small place with crammed tables. However, it just wouldn’t be the same without that. You can expect a wait on almost any given night at any given time, so I would recommend heading there about 15 minutes before you actually want to be seated.
The dress code is not a fancy one, but it is more formal than casual. Since Babylon is a place where you can find a wide range of bars, Kotobuki is a great place to go before actually going out. The staff here is friendly and always welcoming. As far as Japanese food goes, Kotobuki offers a range of traditional as well as contemporary. Their seasonal menu is always my favorite; you’ll love it, especially if you’re open to trying a new dish every time. I have yet to be disappointed. Did I mention that I could barely fathom the thought of Sushi before discovering this tiny piece of heaven?
After being seated you will be greeted with a warm hand towel to cleanse with. This is the time when I recommend ordering a Banzai, which is “plum wine & chilled saké, stirred & on-the-rocks”. You won’t find a more refreshing drink to complement your Sushi anywhere else.
As far as appetizers go, they’re all fabulous! Starting off with a small green salad and miso soup is something that I simply always do, and then, bring on the sautéed oysters. They simply melt in your mouth, and you’ll be dreaming of the light and sweet butter sauce for days to come. Oh, yeah, don’t forget you have those delicious, petite, spicy noodles at the table, too. And, we are only talking appetizers. If you were to go to an Italian or Mexican restaurant, perhaps, you would be stuffed and unbuttoning your pants by the time the actual dish arrived – not at Kotobuki though. The portions are just right, and the food is actually good for you – body and soul, so you’ll have just enough room in that belly for dinner and maybe even for some fried cheesecake (I mean, you did save all those calories by eating raw fish right?).
The entrée choices are never-ending. They have something to accompany every mood and craving in Japanese food history. Or, at least, I think so. The best part is that a large portion of their rolls is so affordable it almost doesn’t sound believable. $5.50 for the jumping shrimp roll? I’ll take it. Of course, getting more than one roll is required since they are all so divine, but the prices really make that allowable. For those of you who are still struggling with the “raw” aspect of Sushi, I present to you the teriyaki menu: Beef, Chicken and Shrimp among others. If I didn’t know better, I would always get that, for the teriyaki sauce here is the perfect composition of sweet and tangy with that honey-like texture.
So, next time you are in the area and are facing the wrath of your hunger, I advise and hope that you will try Kotobuki, for you will be pleasantly surprised.

If you enjoy fairytales, then ABC’s new television series, Once Upon A Time, may be your next favorite show. It premiered on Sunday, October 23rd, at 8 p.m. The show is about how all the fairytale characters we know and love are actually cursed to be real people and live horrible lives in a town called Storybrooke, all because the Evil Queen from the Snow White fairytale tries to ruin their happy endings. What’s worse is that none of the characters remember who they really are. To break the curse, the Evil Queen must be stopped. However, the one who can stop the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla) is the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas): Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison). Emma is dragged into this mysterious town by the son she supposedly gave up for adoption, Henry (Jared Gilmore), who tries to convince her about the town residents being fairytale characters. There is a lot going on in the plot; not only are we getting glimpses at the story book characters but also at the residents in the town who are basically them but in another world. We are also seeing a relationship between Emma and Henry forming as he tries to convince her about the people in town being fairytale characters. The show has only just aired, but I already want to see more. It not only brings you in with the fairytale and fantasy theme, but it also has a bit of mystery twisted in it to keep you guessing. The cast’s acting is also very good. It has the potential to be a really good new series and one of the best shows for the fall. The show airs on ABC on Sundays at 8 p.m.

Paranormal Activity brought a whole new form of scary when it debuted in 2009. The low-budget film, directed and produced by Oren Peli in 2006, went on to become a box office smash. This, of course, led to its sequel in 2010, which was actually used as a prequel and contained events that occurred before the first film.
Paranormal Activity 3 takes place 18 years before both films, set in 1988, following Katie and Kristi, the main characters from the first films, as children. After some interesting phenomena begins, much like its predecessor films, the male character sets up cameras all over the house. This time, Julie, the girls’ mother, has a boyfriend, Dennis, who is a wedding videographer, conveniently enough. Kristi, the youngest sister, begins speaking to her imaginary friend, Toby, in the middle of the night. While reviewing the tapes, Dennis brings this to Julie’s attention, who passes it off as “just a phase.”
As the nights pass, the audience begins to realize that Toby is not so imaginary as he begins terrorizing the family.  As furniture flies, things mysteriously move, and, babysitters are scared off, the terror and jolts come at full force.
There is not much change to the plot. The film still brings the same premise the third time around but is much faster paced. You won’t have to wait long to be jumping out of your seat. I recommend this if you have already seen the first two films, even if you haven’t enjoyed them. This one is a vast improvement from the first two and much scarier. For those of you who love a good scare, definitely give it a try!

With what can be known as a cult following of some sort, NFL Sunday Football has been the most-watched program on television on Sundays, and the Super Bowl has been the most-watched annual program in history since its inception in 1967.
With thirty-two teams in the league- sixteen in the American Football Conference and sixteen in the National Football Conference- there are 22 states with football teams. In recent years, teams like the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers have been dominant, teams that in years past weren’t nearly as successful. New teams becoming bigger threats to play, such as the Buffalo Bills, don’t leave room for an “easy game” for any team and draw more viewers from different states to watch.
Fans paint faces and wear crazy outfits to games, with Minnesota Vikings’ fans wearing Viking helmets to games and Giants fans wearing all-blue spandex suits showing pride for their team, but the real question is why? Why do fans feel the need to do things like this for football when they wouldn’t do this for sporting events such as baseball or basketball? Sure, people carry along their gloves to baseball games, but that’s to catch a baseball, whereas in football you can’t bring home a piece of the game. Although football may not be “America’s Pastime,” the fans are definitely the craziest, and the reason is simple: it’s hard hitting, fast, and gives you something to cheer about. You can sit at a baseball game for three hours and see no score and definitely no contact, whereas in football you see hard hits, and good trick plays.
With only sixteen games in the regular season, and only one game a week, football fans crave to watch their team for six days every week. The buildup from game to game, and big rivalries promote the passion for the game that fans have when they go to a game with painted faces and costumes. And of course, being on the big screen pushes fans to act as crazy as they do.

Given the current economic climate, it has become increasingly on trend to search for affordable yet fashionable clothes to keep not only you, but also your back account content. Bargain hunting is essentially the art of getting more bang for your buck by using many tools at your disposal. I have discovered five main ways to save yourself time, aggravation, and most of all, your hard-earned money.
Discount Designer Stores such as Marshall’s, Century 21, and T.J. Maxx are great places to stumble upon a plethora of amazing deals on brands such as Betsey Johnson, Michael Kors, and Marc Jacobs. For example, I found a chic Michael Kors winter coat that usually retails for $495 for over 50 percent off at Century 21. Stores like these are typically off-price buyers, which means they purchase apparel from mainstream retailers and designers who have over-ordered, or over-produced items.
Discount Designer Websites such as HauteLook (www.hautelook.com), Bluefly (www.bluefly.com), and Gilt (www.gilt.com) are all awesome websites to find reasonably priced designer goodies. These reputable websites allow users to sign up and instantaneously receive discounts on a variety of different things from clothing, to make-up,to vacations. According to senior PR major Billie Cinelli: “I would suggest buyers search online to find discounted or wholesale items for way cheaper than they are in stores. On sites like Rue La La and HauteLook, you can find deals up to 70% off.”
Coupons are a tried and true method to save money when shopping. I live by the notion that you should never go shopping unless you have a coupon. Most stores allow you to sign up for emails where you can obtain the latest discounts and coupons right on your smartphone. Take a cue from TLC’s show, Extreme Couponing, and try your hand at shopping with a coupon because, after all, every little bit helps. Moreover, many stores give a certain percent off when using their rewards card or even for filling out a quick survey online.
Outlets and thrift shops are another great way to save money. Most store outlets, such as those located in Tanger Outlets in Riverhead and Deer Park, provide a certain percentage off regular prices. For instance, users can expect to see astounding discounts in stores like Juicy Couture, where wallets can be found for around $60. Thrift stores are another way to usually find one-of-a-kind, inexpensive designer goodies because, as the saying goes, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.
Shopping in between seasons is my final tip to save money while still being fashion forward. The majority of stores have a certain portion of either their website or their store dedicated to items going out of season. This is the best time to find extreme discounts on clothing to use in the future. In stores such as Old Navy, it is common to find items that normally cost around $40 being marked down to $7 in the clearance section.
Junior PR major Lindsay Quinn says: “The thing is I’m a college student who works and interns so I don’t make a lot of money.  Therefore if I can find great clothes at reasonable prices, I feel so good about it. Why spend $200 on a pair of jeans when I can find a similar pair for only $20?”
Not all of us are lucky enough to have disposable incomes so that we can spend all our money on expensive, designer items. However, there are alternatives to let your inner bargain hunter save money and remain fashionable at the same time. So clip some coupons, scour Marshall’s for a little black dress, or take a trip to the outlets and see how exhilarating it can be to see how much money you can actually save.

Ten to twenty years ago at parks and on college campuses, it was common to see a majority of the people with newspapers in their hands.  In the last five or more years, we now see people with their heads buried in some portable form of technology. Many newspaper companies have caught on to the trend and have adapted.  Print forms of their work are still available but they now also have alternative access to the internet, such as via applications for phones, iPads, tablets, or computers.
The New York Times is an example of a major publication that has “kept up with the Jones”. In September of 2010, Diane McNulty a spokeswoman for The New York Times was interviewed by Bill Krueger for Poynter.org. In that interview, she said that “31 percent of college students read the printed or online versions of the Times. “More college students do read us online than in print,” McNulty told the Pioneer in a recent e-mail. “We encourage them to read the Times content on any platform.”
So what format do C.W. Post students prefer? And what news organization do they follow? What do they think of newspapers?  And do they think they are adequately informed?
Many digital formats don’t always give people the full article, so do Post students think there are any draw-backs to using a digital format?  Pascal Germain, a Senior Physical Education and Health major, said ““I read the BBC World News from my phone. It seems to be the most unbiased form of news for me right now. I also look at CNN every once in a while but it turns me off because they focus on the most irrelevant things.  I use my phone because newspapers are too big for me to carry around. With my phone I don’t need to worry about throwing it away, or flipping through pages. The story is right there; all I have to do is click. “I don’t think I have any drawback using a digital format because the app I have on my phone provides me with the entire article at no cost (BBC news app for android). I think newspapers are good for the older generation. I suppose its vintage to them but, for the younger generation, they don’t seem to serve any purpose. Why pay for something you can get free through an app, or online? Also the majority of young people are so caught up in their superficial lives that they lack the patience to flip through paper. No, no one in our society is as well informed as we can be, and should be, because we only get what the Government wants us to know. The media serves as a tool to give us the things they allow us to know, not the things we need and deserve to know.”
William Lindburg, Swedish Grad student said “I read The New York Times on my laptop every day. The most important news is on the internet because it is always being updated and there are only things in print from the day before. It’s more convenient to use my laptop because the paper is big and takes up a lot of room. Personally I think it would be better if everything were digital. I always use my computer. In Sweden it is still popular to read and buy a printed copy. There is more content in the print, and online you have to pay a fee to find a specific article.”
Several students interviewed by the Pioneer preferred accessing the news from their phones, various Apple products, or their computers.  However, there are a few of us remaining, like me, who like the old fashion print. Andrew Albrechtsen, Junior Computer Science major, said, “I read The New York Times online mostly, but it’s convenient to pick up a free hard copy in Hillwood before class. Sometimes I read CNN online too, but mostly The New York Times.”  When asked what he thought he would gain by reading print instead of using the digital apps of The New York Times, he replied, “It’s easier to concentrate on the print edition. There aren’t a lot of annoying ads like online but it’s also easier to discover interesting articles in print because they’re right in front of you, you don’t have to click on one to gloss over it and see if you find it interesting.”  When asked if he would like to see more of his fellow students reading print and why he thought people gravitate to digital forms, Albrechtsen replied, “I think people find it more convenient to pull news up on the computer than carry around a newspaper with them. Online news is also constantly updated. It would be nice if more students read the printed copies we have on campus because I’m sure a lot of them are recycled.  I think that I’m pretty well informed – I’m a bit of a news junkie”
Of course, we will always give ourselves the benefit of the doubt and say we are well informed, but our teachers are often the ones who can best judge how well informed we really are.  Sociology professor Dr. Heather Parrott said, “I love NPR and NBC Nightly News, and The New York Times. I love how diverse NPR is, so it is my main news source. I don’t think many of my students are adequately informed.  I like when there are the few that are, but that is unfortunately uncommon.  For example, when I talked about the uprisings in the Middle East and Occupy Wall Street, few students knew about them.  I think one simple thing students can do to make themselves more informed would be to occasionally go to The New York Times headlines and read them so there is some idea of what is going on.  Students can listen to NPR while driving, or making dinner.  They can get a brief overview of what is going on in the world. What the school should try and do is obtain a discounted subscription for online. Overall I would want students to be more informed.”
We live in a world that is rapidly changing; we are in a political and economic climate where we cannot afford to be ignorant about what is going on around us. Students should be aware of the economic crisis that has made it hard for students to pay for school; loans are harder to come by, and banks are bundling student loans instead of home loans and mortgages (this is what contributed to the economic collapse at the end of the Bush Administration.)  The policies of the next President could help or hurt students. Regardless of whether you take advantage of the free copies of The New York Times that are available in every academic building and Hillwood Commons, or if you use your Apple or android products to seek out news, find out what is going on in the world around you, not just what’s in the headlines and what is popular. Find something that interests you, something that you can be passionate about.

At the C.W. Post Homecoming Pep Rally on October 21st, two senior students were selected to receive the Post Pride Award.  Public Relations major, Arielle Thomas, 21 and Early Childhood Education major Jared Ciborowski, 24, went through an extensive process, which included an essay, interview, as well as a speech at the Homecoming Ball to show why they deserved the award.  The Pioneer interviewed the Post Pride winners.
Arielle Thomas
What clubs/organizations/positions have you been involved in at Post?
I was SNAPS (Student Networking to Advocate a Positive Poetic Society) Vice-President for a year and President for two years, along with being Vice-President of NAACP for two years.  I was also an Orientation Leader for two years, a model for The Runway, a Resident Assistant for three years, and a Building Manager at Pratt for three years. I have also helped out on multiple occasions around campus as a keynote speaker at different events.
How do you feel about winning the Post Pride Award?
I was thrilled. I was happy to be recognized for all the work I’ve put in over the years.
What is your best memory in your years at Post?
My best memory had to be doing Freshmen Orientation. As a leader, I loved welcoming the incoming freshmen and always being a familiar face to them when they got to school.
What were your biggest accomplishments at Post? 
My biggest accomplishments would have to be winning the Emerging Student Leader Award in my freshman year and becoming an RA (Resident Assistant) and Building Manager as a sophomore.
What is some advice you have for current and future Post students? 
GET INVOLVED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!
Who is someone that has helped shape you into who you are as a student at Post? 
Mary Nigro and Alerie Tirsch. They both have helped guide me in more ways than one. (laughs)
Now that you are graduating, what are your next plans?  
Hopefully get into Music Public Relations, either work at a music label or for the entertainment section at a public relations firm.
Jared Ciborowski
What clubs/organizations/positions have you been involved with at Post?
I was an RA (Resident Assistant) for one year, SRA (Senior Resident Assistant) for one year, OL (Orientation Leader) for one year, OC (Orientation Coordinator) for two years, SGA (Student Government Association) Chairperson for food committee for one year, and SGA President for two years.
How do you feel about winning the Post Pride award?
I was overwhelmed with excitement when I won the award.  I feel that I was recognized for all the time and dedication I put into making this campus better for everyone.
What is your best memory in your years at Post?
I don’t really have a favorite memory. Attending C.W. Post will be one my favorite memories of my entire life.
What is some advice you have for current and future Post students?
I suggest for all students to live every moment at college as if it is your last. College is what you make of it. If you don’t get out of your room or home and experience it, it will just come and go.
Who is someone that has helped shape you into who you are as a student at Post?
I feel that Alerie Tirsch, Fernando Mendoza, Eric Zirlinger, Jennifer Fuoco, Jessica Hayes, and Lucille Fisher are a few of the individuals who have helped shape the person I am now,. One individual, however, that has had the largest impact in my life is my grandmother. She is the reason why I wake up every day and want to make the world a better place than I found it.
Now that you are graduating, what are your next plans?  
I am going to Grad school for Higher Education Administration. I want to, eventually, be a dean of students or provost for a university.

Internet outages in the dorms at C.W. Post are a result of students using personal wireless routers in the residence halls according to the Director of Resident Life Carlyle Hicks.
“The outages are a result of residents using personal wireless routers within the residence halls,” Hicks said via email. “The routers interfere with the University’s internet.”
Students, like Linda Amarante, have been victims of the Internet outages in the dorms. “We lose internet service at least once every two or three days,” Amarante said. “Sometimes, it’s only for a few minutes, and then, sometimes, there are full days when we have no Internet at all.”
The loss of the Internet in the dorms has created a hassle for students, who not only want to check email, Facebook or Twitter, but who also need it for academic purposes. The use of Blackboard requires students to log on to a website to submit homework via the Internet.
“Lately, I’ve just been going to the library to use the computers there to complete any Internet-related classwork,” Amarante said. “It’s greatly affected my ability to not only do class work but also to check my email and communicate with others. Seeing that internet is necessary for Blackboard, MY LIU, and other sites I use for my homework, its a pretty huge roadblock when I sit down to get my work done and the internet isn’t working for no known reason.”
However, not all students have had problems with their Internet. Carlos Clemente, who resides in the suites, hasn’t experience any real problems with his Internet.
“Not really no,” Clemente responded when asked if he had experienced any Internet troubles. “The Internet seems to be working pretty good.”
Residence Life is taking steps to mitigate the problem with the Internet. According to Hicks, the Office of Residence Life asked residents to disconnect personal routers. Hicks also added that they have conducted health and safety inspections to locate routers that continue to be connected.

On October 28th, the Honors Program held its annual Merit Fellowship Academic Conference, “Follow Your Passion.” Professionals, students, and professors shared information from their everyday lives, experiences, or professional insight.
Guest speakers included Dr. Raymond Damadian of the FONAR Corporation, located in Melville. Damadian invented the technology and method to safely and accurately scan the human body by creating the MRI machine (magnetic resonance imaging machine). In 1978, he was the first to perform a full-body scan of a human diagnosed with cancer.
“With an antenna outside the sample, I was able to pick up and measure potassium without ever going inside the sample,” said Damadian. “If we could do the same thing on a human body, we would be able to detect disease anywhere in the body and get its chemistry non-invasively. It’s gratifying to know that I am able to help a lot of people.”
Honors students are required to attend five lectures, which expose them to new ideas and ways of thinking. “When I put the conference theme out, his granddaughter, who is in the honors program, said I bet my grandfather would love to talk. He is the inventor of the MRI,” said Dr. Joan Digby, the director of the Honors Program and Merit Fellowship. “It’s rare for us to have an opportunity to talk to an inventor – somebody whose contributions to science, in this case, really almost impact everybody.”
Damadian spoke about “modern medical imaging technology: how it works and its role in the development in the MRI,” which explored the origins, development, and applications of Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
“When I asked him to speak at C.W. Post, he immediately and happily agreed,” said senior Brianna Damadian. “He has given many lectures and travels worldwide to give talks, but he seemed particularly excited about this one.”
In 1970, Damadian discovered that there is a difference in the magnetic resonance (MR) scanning of relaxation times between normal and abnormal body tissues. This was the foundation for the MRI industry.
“I knew that cancer tissue has an abnormal amount of potassium and sodium in it,” said Damadian. “I’ve never seen a situation where there was an abnormal about of potassium and sodium level not accompanied by an abnormal amount of water. Water has got hydrogen in it, and that was something we could easily measure by NMR (MRI).”
The Indomitable, the first MR scanner, produced the first human image. With the help of post-graduate assistants, Doctors Lawrence Minkoff and Michael Goldsmith, Damadian rendered Minkoff’s chest on July 3, 1977. In 1974, Damadian received the first patent in the field of MRI.
“We had some really technical Himalayas to overcome,” said Damadian. “All of a sudden, instead of having that antenna sticking right close to the sample, the antenna was far, far away. The signal to begin with was very weak. The second concern was how uniform the magnetic field was across the sample. If I had signals coming from inside that body coil and all of them were different frequencies, the frequencies destroy each other.”
In 1978, FONAR was incorporated. It is the oldest MR manufacturer in the industry. The world’s first commercial MRI was released in 1980. Since 1980, 300 OPEN MRIs and 150 UPRIGHT Multi-Position MRI scanners have been installed worldwide.
“The last problem was even if there was an abnormality to the cancer signal, it was not going to be satisfactory to tell the patient you have got a cancer in you somewhere,” said Damadian. “I now had the obligation to tell them where.”
In 1988, Damadian was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President Ronald Reagan. It was jointly shared with Dr. Lauterbur. Lauterbur’s gradient approach took off, while Damadian’s “focused field” technology failed to sell. FONAR abandoned Damadian’s technique in favor of the new methods.
“Lauterbur used it, but it was not original to him,” said Damadian. “He was just employing the technology that was already well-known.”
In 1996, FONAR introduced the Stand-Up MRI, a whole-body MRI scanner. In this model, patients don’t feel closed-in; they can sit and watch TV.
“I am a Bible reader,” said Damadian. “I take scriptures that I read seriously, and I was tickled to see that there was a scripture saying ‘God hath made man upright.’ Why don’t we scan man they way he is made – scan him upright, -so we did.”
In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered G.E. to pay FONAR $128,705,766 for the infringement of the patents.
“The arguments from one of the giant companies were that it detects cancer tissue, but it also detects other diseases,” said Damadian. “Our lawyers came back and said are you going to punish the guy because in his original discovery it detects more than we ever imagined. It detects everything.”
In 2003, the Nobel Prize was awarded to Paul Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for their discoveries related to MRI. Damadian was not credited due to the controversy over who played what part in the development.
“It was a very excellent, informative presentation and an honor to meet the man who developed the MRI,” said senior Steven Singer.
FONAR’s works-in-progress, OR-360º, a room-size MRI, will allow surgeons, assistants, and equipment to operate without obstruction inside the scanner’s magnet. It allows for unrestricted 360-degreee access to the patient
“We have one installed in England,” said Damadian. “They are doing some research; they are mainly doing imaging on it, but I am continuing to hope that we are going to be able to do MRI image-guided surgery.”
On October 5th, FONAR announced the major diagnostic breakthrough in multiple sclerosis achieved with advanced UPRIGHT MRI.
“Growing up around my grandfather was a blessing,” said Brianna Damadian. “He has been somebody that I look up to as a role model my entire life. He helped me with science fair projects, attended every school event of mine from the time I was in kindergarten until now, and always encouraged my academic endeavors.”

On October 25th and 26th, anyone who passed through Hillwood Commons may have noticed a large table set up and a divider separating half of the seating areas. This was due to the blood drive, which took place right behind the curtains. Anyone who wanted to participate in the event only had to fill out a short questionnaire and do a quick finger prick test.  Then, they went into the donating area. According to the American Red Cross website, for every one pint collected, three lives are saved.
Aneudy Emiliano, a junior accounting major, donated during the drive. “It was nice to be part of it. It was nice to help out,” she said.   This was the feeling of most of those who donated.
In charge of the event was the Assistant Director of the Office of Student Life and Leadership Development Fernando Mendoza. “We collected 237 pints during the two-day drive, which brings our 2011 total to 605 pints collected.  This is an all time high. We had well over 50 student volunteers come out to the blood drive, representing student clubs, greek organizations, RAs, resident students and commuter students. This same drive in October 2010 collected 195 pints, so we had a pretty significant increase. In 2010, we collected only 485 pints of blood, so our jump in pints-collected this year is staggering. This is all due to the commitment of the captains, student volunteers, staff and administrators on campus. We also added a few smaller drives over the past summer.”
Along with the satisfaction of saving lives, donors received their choice of a t-shirt or a voucher for a free six-inch foot-long sandwich at the Hillwood Subway. Along with these two gifts, new systems have been put into place.  Anyone who has donated four times in a year will receive a water bottle from Student Life and Leadership Development. A brand new system that is also in place to help bring in donors is called the Gallons Card. This is something new for all freshmen on campus.  If they donate eight times during their four years at Post and get the card punched each time, the donor is invited to a banquet to thank them for their donations.
The success of the first blood drive of this semester will hopefully continue at the upcoming one on December 7th, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. in the Hillwood Pioneer Room. There are typically two or three a semester, so if you would like to donate, keep an eye out for upcoming events.

The Board of Trustees has voted and approved a rebranding initiative that will unify all the Long Island University campuses. The rebranding initiative will include a new website and also a new name for our 56-year-old campus. Early next spring, L.I.U. – C.W. Post will go by L.I.U.- Post.
On October 24th, a presentation about the rebranding initiative was held in Hillwood Commons during the common hour. The presenter was John Ferrell, a consultant affiliated with the marketing and communication company, Young and Rubicam.
Ferrell covered topics like complex advertisement placing, with the opportunity to reach 2 million people daily, including ads placed in areas like Times Square and in New York City Subways. Another topic covered was the updated University website.
English Professor Dr. Edmund Miller attended the presentation and was concerned with the accessibility of academic programs on the website: “Department and academic program pages have been cut back to minimum curriculum facts, although they used to contain a wealth of material about the quality of the faculty and the activities of departments and graduates. At the moment, the academic information is not even current, and the online bulletin is also out of date,” he said.
According to the presentation, which the Pioneer was invited to attend by a University faculty member, the website will also present a unified online school system.
Assistant Vice President for Public Relation for Long Island University Kim Volpe-Casalino said in an email, “The initiative will not have any impact on tuition prices, and there will not be a new website. New logos will be introduced, and additional student and alumni success stories will be posted on top-level pages.” She added, “these changes will not affect the site’s existing functionality.”
One of the major topics covered was the new logo.  According to Volpe-Casalino, due to clearance issues, the new logo is not available to the students at this time. However, the new logo was shown at presentation.  On June 27, 2011, University President Steinberg released a memo, which discussed the rebranding initiative.  According to the memo, which is available on the website, the University trustees “have given the officers a mandate to develop a singular, unifying brand for Long Island University. Increased competition and a shrinking pool of high school students require us to clarify who we are and why our value proposition is clear and compelling.” Also, the memo states that one purpose of the rebranding initiative is to increase admissions.
After the presentation, Ferrell took questions from the members in the audience. One member was concerned that C.W. Post will lose its uniqueness under the unifying brand.  Professor Miller didn’t see this as a major issue; however, he said, “The nine L.I.U. sites of the new ad campaign are so different; I think this is less of a problem than that potential students may get lost in trying to find Post.”
Dean Noel Zahler, the Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, doesn’t think that the rebranding initiative will take anything away from the individual campuses.  He said, “It simply makes it easier for people interested in us all to identify our brand and seek the information they need. I think that the rebranding will help the University recruit and strengthen our presence in a complex marketplace.”
Senior journalism major Zoila Rodriguez thinks the unifying brand is a good idea.        “Students tend to criticize and compare other campuses.  This change will offer a sense of equality and unison,” she said.
Part of the rebranding initiative means C.W. Post will drop the “C.W.” and become L.I.U.-Post in favor of unifying the campuses. “I don’t think it’s necessary. The name was given to this institution to honor C.W. Post, and Post sounds very informal and not like a private institution of education,” Rodriguez said.  The University was named after Charles William Post, the American breakfast cereal inventor. His daughter, heiress to the Post fortune, Marjorie Merriweather Post, sold the estate to Long Island University for $200,000.
Senior music education major Joel Lewis doesn’t see the point in the name change, although he has no real issues with it. “As long as it doesn’t change anything academically, then, by all means, call the school what you want,” he said, adding, “Outside of school, if I say I go to “Post” at least more than half the people I say this to know what I’m talking about.  All I had to say was “Post,” and people know.”
However, freshman pre-pharmacy major Alex Sigel said, “It’s funny how they try to justify the change by giving the school system a “sense of unity,” but the fact of the matter is that the Brooklyn campus is far away, and there’s really nothing tying the two together besides administration.”
During the question portion of the presentation, Ferrell was asked how much the rebranding will cost.  Ferrell averted the question. “The answer was that the advertising budget would remain the same but would be distributed differently,” Miller said.
The Pioneer requested further information regarding the rebranding initiative from the administration. Volpe-Casalino provided a few paragraphs from Dr. Steinberg’s upcoming University Update email.  According to Dr. Steinberg, the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to authorize the rebranding and recruitment initiative in order to increase enrollment and retain existing students. He wrote, “The goal is to increase our enrollment by establishing a unified L.I.U. identity that distinguishes our University in an over-saturated marketplace while capturing elegantly and succinctly our student-centric mission of Access and Excellence.”

C.W. Post’s annual Honors Conference took place on Friday, October 28th, with several events throughout the day. This year’s theme was “Follow Your Passion.” Students had the opportunity to attend over 32 workshops, discussions, and lectures. They were also able to participate in discussions with professors and guest speakers.
All students in the Honors Program were required to attend this conference to obtain five merit fellowship credits.  The Merit Fellowship program is a component in the C.W. Post Honors Program. On Sunday, October 30th, students were invited to attend the Broadway musical performance, “In the Heights,” at the Tilles Center, at 7 p.m., to receive one additional credit. Family and friends of Honors Program students were invited to join and participate in the conference.
Samantha Osgood, a junior sociology major and political science minor said, “I liked that the theme was ‘Follow Your Passion’ because that is what we are all trying to do in life. My favorite lecture was with Dr. Lothsteins, which was about decoding your dreams because, sometimes, that’s where our passions reveal themselves.”
Chelsea Serra, a sophomore environmental science major said, “I attended a lecture where I was able to learn about the invention of the MRI. I thought this was amazing.” Love Ahuja, a graduate student and political science major added, “The conference focused on something that tends to get lost in the day-to-day grind. We’re here to discover what our passions are and what makes us tick.”
Tracey Christy, Assistant Director of the Honors Program said, “The conference was a success.  Many of the Honors students enjoyed this year’s theme of passion and felt there were so many more interesting presentations from which to choose.  I was also happy to see that professors from St. Joseph’s College and Suffolk County Community College joined our own C.W. Post faculty in giving the lectures.  It is the faculty who help to make our conferences successful year after year.”

Being a college student, paying a hefty tuition, it is very likely that the thought about where exactly your money goes has crossed your mind at least once. Here at C.W. Post, the average student dishes out more than $40,000 a year towards classes and other fees. One of the fees includes the “Student Activities Fee”. It is required by all students, whether they are a resident or a commuter. The Student Activities Fee is $110 per semester. According to Fernando Mendoza, Student Life and Leadership Development Associate Director, “the Student Activities Fee is put to good use. It goes to fund all the student clubs and organizations on our campus.” At Post, we are the home to more than 60 clubs and organizations that all hold general member meetings, as well as all different types of events such as bake sales and parties on campus.
All on-campus clubs are given a set budget at the beginning of each school year and they are able to use the money however they see fit in order to fund the club’s activities whether it is to hold an event, go on an off-campus trip, or make items to represent the club, such as t-shirts or an official club banner. The two clubs on campus that have the largest budgets are Student Government Association (SGA) and Association of Campus Programming (ACP). These clubs are well known for hosting and funding campus-wide programs such as C.W. Post Welcome Week, C.W. Post Homecoming, C.W. Post Spring Fling, Be Seen in Green tables, Blood Drives and more. If necessary, clubs and organizations often go to SGA and ACP for help to fund an event or project that it is beyond their budget. SGA and ACP are clubs on campus that approve and allocate all expenditures as well as handle the Budget and Appropriations forms before any money is given to a club or an organization. The process is daunting but it is all to make sure that no one’s money is put to waste.
Since you are paying a fee for student activities, you as a student should be taking advantage of every activity on campus that interests you! There is something for everyone at Post. Become a member of a club or organization, and be active in campus life. If you feel that C.W. Post is missing something, start your own club by bringing your idea to SGA. The sense of being a part of a group will definitely enhance your time spent as a student, as well as give you plenty of memories to look back on once you have graduated!
If you would like to join any club or organization, check out the school’s website, liu.edu/cwpost for a brief description each group under “Student Activities”. You can also visit the Office of Student Life and Leadership Development located in Hillwood Commons to find out a club’s meeting times as well as the club’s contact information.

This weekend’s freak-out snowstorm made me realize that I have done no preparation for winter at all. I had the snow brush in my car, but that’s about all.  I didn’t have a de-froster spray, and my car was still switched on air conditioning, not heat. But driving was worse; the roads were slippery and wet.  I’m pretty lucky. I survived out there, no dramatic sequence needed.  With more bad weather sure to come, what can we do, as drivers, to make driving in winter weather safe and bearable?
The most-needed piece of equipment for your car during the snow is a scraper/brush for your windshield.  This will always come in handy on those snowy days, unless there’s a foot of snow on your car.
Blankets are also essential.  I actually do keep a blanket in my car, just in case I’m freezing, or I’m wet from the rain so I can sit on it and warm up more easily. Along with the blanket, you should have an emergency car kit, which should include a flashlight, an emergency light flasher, a tire pressure meter, and a first-aid kit. If you can’t drive for any reason during a snowstorm, this kit could come in handy. You can use the emergency light to let any passing emergency vehicle know that you need help. The first-aid kit can just come in handy for any emergency you may have at any time on the road.
It’s important to make sure that you have had your car’s brakes, battery, and oil checked before the winter even starts. Always check your gas meter to make sure that you have enough gas.  When driving while it is snowing, keep ample room between your car and the car in front of you, in case of any skidding. Drive slowly; driving fast could be the worst mistake you make. Speeding in icy conditions could cause you to lose control of your car, and then where would you be?
Keep your eyes on the road and pay attention to the cars around you and in front of you, because cars could skid right into you.  Be aware and take precautions when moving out of the way. When your car skids, don’t turn your wheel the other way, but turn it the way the skid is going. Accelerate the car; don’t stop.  Keep the car going.  When skidding occurs, stopping seems like a good idea, but stay calm and just keep going in the direction that your car is already going.
Many of us don’t feel comfortable driving in the snow.  If this is the case, stay indoors or if you really need to go out, have somebody drive you.  If you’re not familiar with driving in the snow and ice, just don’t do it or take it slowly. Living in New York, we all have to deal with the fact that it snows every winter and usually pretty heavily. I hope we don’t see more snow for another two or three months, but if that’s not the case, take these driving tips into account, and as always, safe driving to all!

We’ve all seen it; heck some of you reading this are probably even guilty of doing it: plastering your life all over your Facebook wall.  We’re not talking pictures and “notes,” it’s the excessive check-ins to every store you go in to; your house; your friend’s house; your boyfriend or girlfriend’s house; add that to the statuses filled with, “going to the bathroom, then eating, taking a nap, then seeing my boy/girl/besties later…hit me up!” Tired just from reading that?  Does any of it sound annoyingly familiar?  Then you, or some people you know, are what I affectionately call “over-sharers.”
This proliferation of information fills up Facebook newsfeeds (and Twitter timelines for that matter) every second of every single day.  Do these chronic “over-sharers” ever stop to wonder, “Who really cares how many times I breathe a day, let alone how many times my significant other and I break up per week?”  Because if they don’t, they should probably start.
Truth be told, I do find some humor in the over saturation.  It may sound horrible, but sometimes it’s funny to laugh at other people’s ridiculous stupidity and/or misfortunes.  Take for example my own Aunt.  Today she broadcast all over Facebook that while visiting an elderly relative at a nursing home, she realized that a 90-year old woman was wearing the same shirt as she was wearing.  Time to start shopping at a new store?  I think so.  Don’t judge, you know you’ve scanned and laughed at others too.
So then when does posting things for all your friends, family, and sometimes almost complete strangers, to see, become too much?  Is this an addiction for people?  You may think that statement is a complete joke, but obviously, for some, it’s not.
Kristina Fristch, a junior art therapy major at Post, has actually had her friends put her through an intervention of sorts.  “I used to post everything, and then I had my friends confront me about it and I was like, ‘Alrite, I’ll chill out about it’.”  Interventions.  That’s when you know things are getting bad.
If this epidemic has gotten to that point of no return, where people see the cliff and just push the gas to the floor, then why do they keep going?  “People do it just to feel important about themselves,” says Crystal Lopez, a senior education major at Post.  She went on to add, “Some people don’t know how to be social and express themselves in that way, so they do it through Facebook.”
For those who do use Facebook newsfeeds as a “creative outlet,” more power to you, I’ll just be sure to click the “unsubscribe” button at the top of my homepage.  Everyone else, proceed with caution, and don’t be afraid to tell someone you love when they’re loving their Facebook just a little too much.

Two weeks ago, we posed the following question to students at C.W. Post: “Did high school prepare you for college?”  This week, the Pioneer is posing the question “Does college prepare you for your future?”  Students attend college to attain a degree in a chosen field that they hope to one day establish a career in.  Typically, a college student takes four to six years to graduate, and after receiving their golden ticket that they have vigorously worked for, they encounter the real world.  Indeed, many already have jobs during college in order to support themselves and/or others but at the same time, there are many who have jobs unrelated to their major, or no job at all.  After just four years of college, “the real world” can seem daunting to some, especially with the economy the way it is.  For others, they feel more than ready and are eager to get their careers started.
One of the major aspects of life that college can have a profound impact on, both inside and outside of the classroom, is socializing.  At first, you may think of socializing as Facebook or talking with your friend over a cup of coffee at Starbucks.  While all of this is true, socializing is also the ability to communicate with one another.  No matter what your major is, communication will play a significant role in your career.  In fact, in order to even begin your career, you will more than likely have an interview that could be looked at as a test of your communication skills.  When asked her opinion on whether college prepares one for life, senior Management major, Emily Brenseke responded, “College teaches you how to socialize with people you don’t know, or wouldn’t normally go out of your way to talk to.  But academically, it’s just school.”  C.W. Post Criminal Justice graduate student, RJ Kuhn, voiced a similar view.  He said, “College prepared me for life by showing me how to be responsible by preparing for class and football on my own.  It also showed and taught me to network with people to broaden my horizons.”  Both Brenseke and Kuhn emphasized the importance of acquiring good communication skills for networking.  Although it is a sad truth, obtaining a job is often about who you know.  By communicating with others, you are expanding your connections, which can be very helpful in the future.   As they say, you should “never burn your bridges.”
Maria Jose is a graduate student at Post and also a Middle School Spanish teacher.  José holds a much different view.  She said, “After taking so many classes in Education and Spanish, when I started to work, it was mostly common sense and asking co-workers how to deal with student behavior.  Also, I wish I had taken low-level Spanish classes because in teaching Spanish to middle school students, I really did not need so many Spanish literature classes.  Did it prepare me?  Not really.”  José raises a valid point about the practicality of the classes that we are required to take.  Are most of our courses truly preparing us for our future careers?  In José’s case, the most basic of classes could have possibly prepared her for her career.  However, this is not to say many advanced courses are meaningless.  While it is true that in college we are expected to think at higher levels and we should be well versed in our field, perhaps we should not overlook the importance of practical skills such as communication or the fundamentals of our fields.
There is not one definition of what it means to be prepared for your future, or for your career.  Like everything, you will learn as you go.  The best advice is to take everything you learn in college, and apply it to your career.  College can only do so much in order to prepare you for the real world.  Sitting in class and listening passively to your professor lecture will most likely not benefit you.  Each class, in some way, can undeniably provide new insight that can be somehow applied to your future.  Although it may not be the most practical class for your career, it is up to the students to make the most of their classes.  With the unpleasant job market the way it currently is, we should take advantage of everything that college offers us to make ourselves more marketable.

First and foremost, on behalf of Jackie and me, I would like to thank the entire C.W. Post Campus for making the Pioneer such a huge success! It is great to see so many students reading and talking about issues reported in the Pioneer. Thanks to a fantastic staff; we are producing a professional and objective newspaper.
Many readers have written about our relationship column, which is written by our very own Online and Opinions Editor Alex Parker. This column is written from Alex’s point of view. For those of you who disagree or can share a different view on relationships, we encourage you to come to our meetings or write a letter to the editor! Gentlemen, if you are not the man Alex Parker is talking about, please write for us! We would love to hear the other point of view!
This semester our staff has done everything possible to report objective and unbiased news and so far, we have succeeded.  Our job as journalists is to provide you with the events and issues on campus. Sometimes that is met with controversy.
When administration, faculty, staff or even students decline to comment on an issue, it becomes part of the story.  Sometimes the news we report is not the most flattering, but it is news.
Journalists often, unfortunately, have difficulty in obtaining quotes or information from certain sources.  Those sources worry about the repercussions a quote in the paper can bring them.  This is something our reporters have come to accept on our campus. However, it makes it difficult, if not impossible, to report both sides of the story when one side declines to comment.  We are never looking to attack any organization or person. We are looking to report the issues, fully and fairly.  We are confident to say that we have worked hard to do that so far this semester, and we hope our readers agree.
I encourage all of you to keep reading this year.  We will continue to provide you with all the news on campus, and we give you our promise that we will remain unbiased in our reporting.

Every year more and more people ask the same question; does my vote really matter? Or should I even bother voting? To be honest, the answer is yes you should. I hear a lot of people talking about not voting on November 8th because it isn’t a presidential election.
Well my question is what’s the difference? Even though it is a local election they count just as much. These smaller elections are what help to shape your towns, cities, and your state. Without these local governments nothing could get accomplished. No garbage pickup, no streets cleared after snow storms, no repairs to roadways when pot-holes become an issue. Ok, so someone has to do the job, so just check off a name and call it a day right? Ah, if it were only that easy. These local governments also control who can build what and where, what certain taxes are going to be higher or lower, and they can even tell you what school district you belong to. So now it runs just like the presidential election, everyone puts up their signs and campaigns all over town. If you really want things changed in your town, maybe you want a street light fixed or maybe taxes are too high. Well which candidate is running around saying they will make the difference for your issues? Just writing a name on a piece of paper could potentially cause mayhem. Not many people would just vote for a presidential candidate because they like their suit or lived near them, so why should local elections be this way.
It is necessary to listen to these local debates and pick candidates who can make a difference in your town. Not just to get the street light fixed but for more than that. But because change starts at home, one local election could change policy in your town, could influence the state, and with a bit of luck and work, could make a difference for our country in the 2012 election.
So please, don’t just shrug it off, go out and make a difference on November 8th and fight for what you believe in.

On Tuesday, October 25th, the C.W. Post men’s basketball team faced Saint John’s on the road at Carnesecca Arena, having the chance to face a legendary, Big East school that has produced multiple NBA players throughout the years. In this exhibition game however, the Pioneers fell to the Red Storm by a final score of 110-80.
At the half, the Pioneers were within striking distance of the Red Storm, as the score was 51-40. But once the second half got underway, the Red Storm could not be stopped. Saint John’s went on a 10-2 run to open the second half of play, and never looked back. Saint John’s shot the lights out, shooting over 65% from the field and six players scored in double-digits. The Red Storm at one point led by as much as 36 points, due to their efficient fast-paced offense.
The Red Storm had a bevy of weapons on the floor, including center, God’s gift, Achiuwa, who showed he has the ability to run the floor well and has great hands around the rim. Standing at 6’9’’ tall, Achiuwa was too much for the Pioneers’ defenders as he finished with 21 points (10-13 shooting) and nine rebounds.
Although the Pioneers came out on the losing side of the game, the team as a whole shot 47% from the floor. On the other hand, the Pioneers struggled from behind the arc as they were only 3-15 shooting.
Senior guard and preseason All-American Stefan Bonneau scored a game-high 28 points on 10-19 shooting for the Pioneers, while junior guard Tobin Carberry also played well scoring 17 points and grabbing seven rebounds. Freshman forward Charles McCann had an impressive debut for C.W. Post as he finished with 15 points and six rebounds.
The Pioneers will now look forward to their next matchup against the defending NCAA Champions: the University of Connecticut Huskies. That matchup will take place in Storrs, Connecticut on Sunday, November 6th at 1 p.m.
“I think these games benefit us in terms of giving us an opportunity to play against the best and give us a chance to go and execute our stuff,” said Pioneers head coach Chris Casey. “It’s going to be a battle because they’re very, very high level teams and players, and they’re very talented.”
UConn is the defending NCAA Division I Champion and boast one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all-time in Jim Calhoun. Calhoun has a career record of 852-366, and is a three-time NCAA Tournament Champion. In addition, he has coached several players that have moved onto the NBA including Ray Allen, Rip Hamilton, Ben Gordon, Emeka Okafor, Rudy Gay, and Kemba Walker.
“There’s not many better ones out there, he (Calhoun) could be the best, and I have a great respect for what he did. But I don’t look at it as facing off against him,” said Casey. “I’m looking at it as putting my team on the floor and trying to execute what we do as best we can, and try to continue to get better throughout the year and use it as a learning experience. And hopefully, we compete well against a very good team and program.”
Although Kemba Walker has moved onto the professional level, the Huskies still have an incredible amount of talent. Crucial players to last year’s championship, sophomore guard Jeremy Lamb and junior forward Alex Oriakhi are returning to the team. In addition, UConn reportedly has an incoming freshman center named Andre Drummond, who has a tremendous amount of potential.
Opening the season against Saint John’s and UConn are two very difficult and challenging games for any team in the country to begin a new season. “It feels like an unbelievable experience to play against two top Division I schools even though we’re Division II,” said Pioneers sophomore forward Vaughn Allen. “It’s a good opportunity for us to see where we’re at and tell us where our season is going to end up.”
