Students were notified of a possible norovirus outbreak on campus via an email from the Center for Healthy Living on Nov. 18. Several students reported experiences of food poisoning-like illness after eating the food served at the Winnick Student Center. As the Pioneer reported in its Nov. 28 issue, some students called the Nassau County Health Department, which launched an investigation.
Mary Ellen Laurain, a representative from the Nassau County Health Department’s PR team, confirmed that a handful of students reported illness. The number of ill students, she stated, “was not clear as some were hear- say and others were calling in concerned.” The Health Department’s investigation was “not conclusive [as to] what the illness was.”
A spokesperson for the corporate leadership of Aramark responded to The Pioneer’s inquiries via email:
“Serving safe, nutritious and quality food is our top priority. We continue to have ongoing, rigorous training and quality assurance processes to ensure we meet very high standards. Consistent with our rigorous practices, the issues noted in the inspection reports were all immediately addressed and corrected. We have rigorous quality assurance and food safety processes and we are committed to continuously enhancing them. As stewards of food safety, our employees and managers: are trained to actively promote and maintain food safety; review proper food preparation and safety procedures during regular meetings that occur before each service; prepare food according to recipes and production processes that specify safe preparation, handling and service; use quality control processes that govern food safety practices; monitor their locations’ temperature logs, sanitation schedules and employee hygiene standards during each service, ensure their locations comply with all federal, state and local health codes.”
Despite the precautions being taken by Aramark, many students who live on campus have stopped eating at Winnick.
Dominique Williams, a junior health sciences major who lives on campus, is one of those students. “My team (women’s basketball) used to go to Winnick during common hour and after practices. But no one on my team has been back because we don’t wanna get sick,” she said. Williams also hasn’t been to Subway or Twisted Taco because she is concerned about the quality.
Kayla McCullough, a senior musical theater major and resident, expressed similar sentiments. “I was never really fond of it [Winnick],” she said. “I found that it didn’t really meet up to the standards of food that tastes good. Nor did it meet up to the health standards; a few times I found raw meat. I don’t eat red meat or pork, but the chicken was always chewy and kinda chunky which chicken shouldn’t be chunky. The salad bar was always soggy and kind of old and it looked a little expired to me. It made me sick; actually I don’t eat there anymore because I got a little sick from it,” McCullough said.
McCullough is excited about the health inspection at Winnick. McCullough feels that if they conducted health inspections on a regular basis, “maybe I would have not been taken off the meal plan because the food would have met health standards and I wouldn’t have gotten sick in the first place.”
Other students have continued to eat at Winnick. Jim Defalco, a graduate student in clinical lab science, continues to dine at Winnick although he doesn’t dorm on campus. “It’s pretty good,” he said. “I’ve been to a couple of college campuses over the years and I’d say it’s definitely above average. I have had better especially in the pizza department. But in general their cold foods and their hot foods are actually really good,” Defalco said.
Defalco has never gotten sick from food at Winnick. “I heard there was something going around, [so] I took precautions to not really eat open food,” Defalco explained. He thinks the facility is clean and isn’t worried about Aramark failing the health inspection, but also recommends yearly inspections.

As a service to the campus community, the Pioneer periodically publishes a Crime Blotter. These are the crimes Public Safety reported for the last three months of the semester.
Auto Damage Complaint
On Friday, Oct. 19, Public Safety was notified about damage to a car in the Post parking lot near the South Residence Complex. The victim reported that she last saw her car on Friday, Oct. 12. When she returned to her car on Thursday, Oct. 18, she noticed that her driver’s side mirror was broken and hanging off of her car. The victim reported that she saw a footprint on the mirror and stated that she observed additional damage to other cars parked nearby. Photos of the damage were taken.
Property Damage
On Sunday, Oct. 14, at 7:30 a.m., Public Safety was notified by a custodian about damage to the women’s bathroom in Post Hall. A responding officer observed toilet paper dispensers ripped off the wall and shower curtains ripped off the top rail. There was also garbage dispersed on the east wing hallway. The damage is estimated to have occurred between Saturday, Oct. 13 at 10:30 p.m. and the time of the report.
Fire Alarm
On Monday, Sep. 10,a fire alarm inside Lorber Hall went off at 5:46 a.m. The building was unoccupied at the time and the cause for the alarm is unknown. The Roslyn fire chief approved the reset of the alarm at 5:51 a.m.
Property Damage
On Friday, Sep. 7, a Public Safety officer, while on a routine patrol of dormitory areas, observed damage to two tapestry flags on the light posts near the north east side of Kings Hall. The flags appeared to be shredded. The officer further noticed the same type of damage on the south east side of Suffolk residence hall. All other flags in the nearby area were intact without any damage. At the time of the original report, it was unclear whether the damage was a result of malicious misconduct or weather. Security cameras on the quad revealed that the damage was due to a storm that came through the area.

Dear Editors:
As a former student journalist, I wish to applaud The Pioneer for its fearless work this semester. Few student newspapers across the country would have handled a seemingly endless stream of hard news with more sensitivity, humanity, and professionalism. Every week, The Pioneer models the critical reading, writing, and thinking skills that our liberal arts institution values and serves as an exciting center of experiential learning for students. The print and online versions are a must-read for anyone who is concerned about the future of the university.
In an era when reporting is dismissed as “fake news,” Pioneer students are holding power accountable despite open intimidation and hostility to their work. Even as administrators at Post and elsewhere are retaliating against student newspapers to protect the university “brand” and silence dissent, Pioneer editors and reporters are finding creative ways to uphold the First Amendment and keep readers informed.
Beginning with the September article on a Post professor’s viral Forbes column on privatizing public libraries, the Pioneer headlines just kept coming—poaching allegations against the new Vice President of Academic Affairs, the One LIU athletics merger, the students’ subversive “Common Sense” pamphlets and Instagram accounts, campus food quality, Queen Mab’s and King Mab’s poetic resistance, the firing of a popular Hutton House director, the George W. Bush speech, cutbacks to the campus shuttle schedule, the Midnight Madness players’ boycott, the norovirus outbreak, and on and on and on.
Just when it seemed that decisions at the top could no longer surprise us, the administration found a way. Last week’s accounts of the treatment of Pioneer co-editor Jada Butler by three administrators were astonishing. Students and faculty remain indignant about this act of intimidation, especially at the university that presents the annual George Polk Awards for journalistic excellence.
Across the country, journalism schools are seeing a resurgence in applications amid attacks on the very idea of truth. A recent Washington Post article put it this way: “The Trump era, overflowing with news, and the emergence of new ways to tell stories appear to be giving a jolt to journalism schools that in recent years struggled to cope with industry contractions.” Indeed, “there’s evidence of growing demand for journalism degrees as applications and enrollment rebound and investigative reporting classes fill up.”
Post should recognize its print and broadcasting strengths and signal to prospective students that they can learn and master news reporting and innovative storytelling across all media on our campus. I hope the College of Arts, Communication, and Design has taken note of The Pioneer’s outstanding performance and does everything in its power to protect the journalism degree so Post can continue to lead this ever-important field of study.
Thank you.
Willie Hiatt
Associate Professor of Latin American History Long Island University, Post Campus

Dear Dean (Rita) Langdon,
We are writing to inform you that we will not be attending the Hutton House Advisory Board meeting scheduled for December 5th. We object to the many actions which have been taken with regard to Hutton House over the past seven weeks and to the fact that there has been no communication with us about them.
The minutes of the Advisory Board meeting of September 21st are incomplete and exclude many important issues raised at that meeting. We can attend another Advisory Board meeting only if we have assurance that the minutes of that meeting and all future meetings accurately reflect our discussions. We have numerous serious concerns and wish them to be on the record.
Attached herewith is a copy of our letter to the LIU Board of Trustees dated October 22nd about Hutton House. To date we have received no response. This lack of communication with the members of our Advisory Board is unprofessional to say the least. As persons who have given hundreds of hours of volunteer service and thousands of dollars of contributions we have earned the right to a more respectful hearing of our very substantial concerns. To date we have been completely ignored.
There have been numerous changes to the Hutton House Lectures offerings for the Winter 2019 semester without consultation with the Advisory Board. Please note that the By-Laws state that the mission of the Advisory Board includes
Many of the courses and lecturers listed for Winter 2019 are not in the fields of liberal arts and sciences nor have the lecturers or their subjects been discussed by the Advisory Board. Imagine our surprise when we saw our names attached to this course listing as if we had approved these. In fact, we were never consulted.
We have no objection to a School of Professional Studies being developed at LIU Post. What we do not understand is why the Hutton House Lectures needs to be disemboweled in order for this to happen. Why can’t professional courses and programs be developed in a new unit? Are the other components of the SPS like the Program for Gifted Youth or the Global Institute being radically altered? Have their directors been terminated?
Had we been consulted, we could have told you that the students attracted to and nurtured by the Hutton House Lectures do not have any expectation of professional study. Rather they are interested in the delight and rewards of the liberal arts and life-long learning. Many are retired professionals who are now reaching beyond their work-life experiences to enrich themselves with the diversity of material that has been developed under Dr. Sato’s leadership of 23 years. Among the goals cited in recently distributed PR materials you mention “building upon Hutton House’s solid foundation by expanding programming to create a nationally recognized initiative”. Dr. Sato was Hutton House’s solid foundation and the program has indeed already received national recognition and awards.
Dr. Sato developed a cadre of gifted lecturers whose loyal followers clamored to register for their classes each semester. For years requests for additional space, funding, and staffing have gone unheeded and resulted in the most popular classes having waiting lists for seats. Now suddenly there is funding for weekly full color mailers, increased salaries, and additional high-ranking administrators for HH.
The uproar on campus from students, faculty and administrators about Dr. Sato’s abrupt termination illustrates the high regard in which she is held. Dr. Sato made Hutton House a resource where people felt welcome to participate and contribute. She connected it to the college and the community. Her warmth and intelligence permeated the program. We cannot overstate our objection to her ouster nor how inappropriate we feel was the manner in which it was done. We have lost a unique and talented leader. In addition, many fine lecturers and students have left the program to protest her firing. Perhaps you have seen the letters to local papers and to the Trustees objecting to her termination.
In closing, we wish to go on the record as being concerned about the status of the endowed scholarship we have funded and give each year and also of the rooms in Lorber Hall which were renovated with contributions from HH students. For people to continue to support LIU Post and Hutton House, we need to be transparent and respectful about these donations.
We know that plans for a School of Professional Studies must have been in the works for some time. Although you attended our June meeting and both you and Denise Dick attended our September meeting, we were kept in the dark about the changes to the basic mission of the Hutton House Lectures that were being planned. Furthermore, we were completely blindsided by the dismissal of our beloved Director with whom some of us have worked closely for decades.
The trust between the University and the Advisory Board has been broken by these actions. We await your reply to this communication informing us about future plans to rebuild this trust and restore Hutton House to it’s former award-winning glory.
Very truly yours,
Members of the Hutton House Advisory Board
Robert Riedy, Chair

To President Kimberly Cline,
The LIU Post Student Government Association has recently been made aware of the situation involving Dean Michael Berthel, Public Relations Director Gordon Tepper, and University Attorney Michael Best and their meeting with Pioneer Editor Jada Butler. The SGA has watched this semester as this administration has strangled its staff and abused its faculty. It sat silent as this administration trampled on the careers of its athletes with the One LIU announcement. It stood as a passive observer when this administration used Ad Astra to wreak havoc on the academic lives of its students. Summoning students under false pretenses only to berate, interrogate, and threaten them is something that we cannot remain silent about. These egregious abuses have forced our hand into action.
Free speech is the pinnacle of Western society. The free exchange of ideas is what has transformed the United States from a hodgepodge of farmers and refugees to the beacon of freedom that leads the world today. More importantly, it is freedom of expression that makes our education so successful. The ability of students and faculty to openly discuss ideas, no matter how controversial or seditious your administration might find those ideas, is the key to unlocking students’ understanding of the world around them. It is what leads to independent thinkers and gives them the creativity and ingenuity to become the benevolent, well- developed leaders and shapers of the world. Our society was created for the purpose of free expression and our society depends on free expression to keep it going. To deny free speech is to oppose the very foundation of the liberal arts education that LIU Post so proudly proclaims to provide its students. To deny free speech is to reject the principles upon which our society is founded. To deny free speech is to condemn the values that people have laid down their lives for throughout centuries of human conflict and continue to die for every day. To deny free speech is to admonish students against every ounce of progress our society has made. Yet your administration has done this over a few critical articles in a student newspaper.
Such injustices against the student body cannot be ignored. The Student Government Association is calling for your administration be held accountable for its actions. To begin to make amends, we demand that Michael Berthel, Gordon Tepper, and Michael Best all make written, public apologies for their actions against Jada Butler. We demand that you also make a written, public apology both to Jada Butler and the LIU student body on behalf of yourself and your administration for what happened and for allowing such abuses to happen at our university. Finally, we demand a written statement from yourself and the Board of Trustees guaranteeing free speech throughout the university for all students, staff, and faculty. We expect these statements both in emails to all students as well as published in the Pioneer for all to see by the last day of Fall semester classes, December 10, 2018.
Should sufficient apologies not be made as we have requested and a guarantee of free speech not made, it will be this Student Government Association’s responsibility to use the LIU Post network of students to make the entire country aware of your administration’s abuses. We will write letters to news outlets everywhere from New York to California to let them know what is going on at LIU Post. We will contact politicians, celebrities, and business people across the nation to inform them of how your administration is stifling free thought. Every social media outlet will let high school students everywhere know that LIU Post is the place to come only if you do not like thinking for yourself. We will arm ourselves with the First Amendment to bring the scrutiny of the nation down on LIU Post until we are guaranteed freedom of expression and freedom from your administration’s bullying and suppression tactics.
The Student Government Association dearly hopes that you will see the error in your administration’s ways and come around to advocating for the students and not against them, defending your students and not attacking them, and making LIU Post a university that we can feel safe at and not afraid.
We love our university and we will see that it is protected.
Signed,
The Members of the LIU Post Student Government Association
Published in Letters

Keep fighting the good fight
The administration at this school have rarely had our best interest at heart. I would love to develop and maintain positive relationships with them, but they are not open to this invitation! Sometimes you have to do what is best for your current students and not the future of the institution. Every university must be familiar with compromise, but even after kind pressure they refuse to consider many ideas (especially in reference to the 18 credit policy which is hindering to excelling students who want to make the most of their education.)

A new online timesheet system for on campus jobs created at the start of the fall 2018 semester left student workers weeks without compensation for their work.
Kaiyi Lei, a junior broadcasting major, said he was not paid from his on-campus summer job until three months after he stopped working.
“I started working for the College of Management from the beginning of August to the end of August,” Lei said. “[In] total, I should have received like $2,000.” Lei was paid for his work on Nov. 15., three months after he finished his job in August.
Lei reached out to the College of Management to see why he hasn’t been paid, even calling multiple times and visiting the office to ask about the processing of his payment. “They told me the school personnel was doing the paperwork very slow,” he said. “I know [payment] is not right away, but I didn’t think it was going to be spending two months [waiting].”
Lei said four of his coworkers from the job have also not been paid.“The reason why it is so late is because the school changed the system,” he said. “We usually do a paper [timesheet] but the school changed it to the online one.”
On Oct. 18, a campus-wide email from Lisa S. Araujo, resources officer for Post’s office of Human Resources, was sent to students regarding “the process and procedures of student employment.”
“We acknowledge that this [new system] caused some challenges, and the intent to enhance the student employment experience created unanticipated delays,” the email reads. The email continues on to say that all students had been compensated at that point.
“We have evaluated the process and streamlined it further so that the job application, to hire, to timesheet access will be more timely,” it reads. “We have also reconciled records and issued checks (including manual checks for the off-cycle payroll) to all students who were approved for hire and who have completed their new hire paperwork, if applicable.”
But the new system of uploading time sheets wasn’t easy for some students to adapt to. Another student, who is a senior and wished to stay anonymous for fear of losing her job, said that she had issues accessing the online system.
“I was working for three and a half weeks before I got paid,” she said. “They told me that they don’t accept paper time sheets, and I told them my online timesheet wasn’t showing up on MyLIU.”
The student was told that the timesheet would not work on a Mac computer, and to try on a PC and then wait for the next pay cycle. She was paid after finding a computer on which the online time sheet system worked.
According to the New York State Department of Labor, any worker in New York can claim their unpaid wages if not paid for all hours worked. Alyson Mathews, an attorney at Lamb and Barnoksy, said that student workers are protected under Department of Labor laws.
“For private sector employees, NY Labor Law Section 191 governs the frequency of wage payments. The rules depend on the category of employment,” Matthews said. “The biggest category is “clerical or other workers,” [who] must be paid semi-monthly on regular pay days designated in advance by the employer.”
According to Mathews, speaking up is the best way to resolve a late pay issue.
“Someone who has not been correctly paid should follow-up with their employer. They may also seek assistance from the Department of Labor,” she said.

Co-Editor-In-Chief
Whether you’re waking up early to start your work day, or staying up late to finish that essay, you can’t go without a cup, or two or three, of coffee to keep you energized. With a Keurig machine, it’s easy to just pop in a pod of your favorite brew and have a fresh cup in seconds; but as time goes on, pods pile up. Millions of single serve plastic coffee pods, though recyclable, end up in landfills each year, according to several articles in The New York Times, The Atlantic, and others – enough to wrap around Earth over 10 times.
There is a new 100 percent compostable pod designed for a more sustainable approach to the fastest growing brewed drink in the U.S. The pods, which are 100 percent compliant with Keurig machines and are made from renewable and plant-based materials, were created by the company Tayst Coffee, founded by Post (‘96) alumni Gregory Byrnes and Craig Handleman.
While Keurig and other companies have moved towards creating more eco-friendly coffee cups, the creators of Tayst Coffee wanted to create a product that came as close to leaving a zero carbon footprint as possible.
The goal at Tayst Coffee is to eliminate 20 million plastic pods by 2020. “We’ve replaced over three million plastic pods [so far],” Byrnes said. Tayst works with more than 100 universities across the U.S. like Notre Dame, Hofstra, UCLA and the University of Michigan to name a few, to implement sustainable change in their offices by using their environmentally friendly coffee pods. They offer a free sample box to offices interested in trying their products.
“We get amazing feedback,” Byrnes said. “Customers thank us for allowing them to not feel guilty using their Keurig machines. When you give people an opportunity to do something positive, they go for it.”

The BPI certified sustainable pods are decomposable and break down “swiftly and safely” within 41 days and leave zero waste, according to Tayst’s director of sustainability programs and Post alumna Kristen Royal (‘18). The coffee is sourced from Rainforest Alliance farmers, where each cup supports the soil the coffee is grown in, the farmers and their communities. People who use Tayst pods “get better flavor coffee because our mesh is more porous than the plastic,” Byrnes said.
Royal attended Post as a graduate working towards her masters in environmental sustainability and science. Through her research on sustainability with Dr. Scott Carlin, professor of Geography, Royal met Byrnes and Handleman at AASHE, the association for the advancement of sustainability in higher education, a sustainability convention in Pittsburgh, Penn. in October 2018. In conversation, the Tayst owners were impressed with her knowledge on the global supply chain and her sustainability research, and later offered her a position as director of sustainability programs for Tayst.
“It was the perfect example of preparation meets opportunity,” Royal said. “It wouldn’t have been possible if I wasn’t prepared for the [sustainability] program and had the assistance from Dr. Carlin.”
As director, Royal talks to, educates, and works with university departments (usually sustainability departments) about the company. She also helps develop case studies and provides insight to university students and staff to motivate offices around campus to switch to Tayst pods and why it’s important.
“We are working with individual offices and those universities and developing procurement relationships with some as well,” she said.
Outside of universities, she also develops and integrates programs in the business by building relationships with composting facilities, ocean clean up projects and working on developing benchmarks for the company in sustainability as they move forward.
Royal worked as a graduate assistant for Carlin in the spring 2018 semester as she worked on her masters, developing programs that aligned with the United Nations 17 sustainable development goals (SGDs); these goals included a plan for progressive change in climate change, health, gender equality, access to quality education, environmental issues and more in several countries by the year 2030.
“Kristen helped write a white paper available on the [LIU] digital commons, titled ‘Green Tech,’” Carlin said. Members of the Center for Sustainability on campus “want faculty and students to have powerful and effective digital tools for bringing sustainability frameworks into classrooms, campus research, and learning experiences,” the paper states. “GreenTech LIU (GTLIU) will provide an integrated digital platform for faculty and students to collaborate on global citizenship research and education projects.”
According to the paper, GTLIU is a collaborative platform that is local and global; it mirrors our own LIU community. The platform strengthens a variety of analytical, creative and communication skills using online learning modalities and it pushes students toward experiential, service and action- oriented learning. “I was very pleased with the results,” Carlin said.
Royal credits some of the success of getting her job to her time at Post. Carlin agreed, saying the key to getting a job is networking, internships, attending local and regional conferences, learning about what companies are out there. “The face to face opportunities are invaluable,” he said.
“One of the things Kristen has is an optimistic personality; it’s very helpful for students to be aware that how they present themselves is important. It’s really advantageous to research and study the company you are interviewing with,” Carlin advised.
Royal has been working for Tayst for almost two months. In that time, she has visited colleges to educate and inform students and staff on sustainability, offer guidance and create programs around sustainable initiatives, starting with changing the amount of plastic waste due to single serve coffee pods in university offices. She wants to bring her work to Post.
“[When] reaching out to LIU, I discovered that a lot of departments and offices purchase their own coffee and supplies individually,” Royal said, which makes talking about and implementing Tayst coffee pods difficult. She wants to come back to Post and encourage the students and staff to start more sustainable initiatives campus wide.

Stay Healthy
Staying healthy is vital to finals week success. Make sure that even when you are cramming for finals, you are remembering to eat throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night. Also, avoid getting
sick by washing your hands frequently. Finals week is stressful enough without adding a cold on top of it.
Plan time to relax
Many students feel that every free moment of finals week should be spent cramming for exams. Instead of filling up all of your time making flash cards, you should set aside some time to relax. Set aside at least an hour a day to read for leisure, take a walk, or even watch your favorite film. Planning relaxation time during finals week will ensure that you aren’t overwhelmed with stress throughout the week.
Utilize the Library
The library is a great place to study without distraction, and during finals week, the main level of the library is open 24 hours a day. If you need a quiet place to concentrate, take your textbooks to the library and sit for a few hours.
Unplug
One distraction to studying is technology. Students can find themselves spending hours that could be used to study scrolling through Instagram or binge-watching Netflix. While you are studying, turn off your phone or put it on airplane mode to avoid distraction. If you need your laptop to study and know that it will lead to distraction, computer applications such as SelfControl allow you to block certain websites over a period of time that you specify.
Study in Advance
Cramming for finals is often a cause of stress for students. Instead of procrastinating and studying only the night before a test, start studying a few days in advance. For a bigger test or assignment, start your preparation five days in advance, so that you have enough time to finish the assignment stress free.
Create a schedule
In order to balance library time, relaxation time, meals, and sleep, create a daily schedule and stick to it. A good tip for scheduling is to plan out your week on Sunday night before finals begin, so that you don’t have to spend additional needed time during the week planning your days.

The holiday season comes equipped with a whole new menu of foods that some of us look forward to all year. Turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and seasonal veggies somehow find their way to our dinner plates and eventually into the refrigerators and freezers of our dorm rooms. However, the worst feeling in the world for some of us is when we keep that last slice of pumpkin pie from Thanksgiving dinner in the fridge, saving it for the perfect moment, only to find out in that perfect moment that its gone bad and smells like some form of penicillin. The same stands true for other cherished holiday food items.

To help keep those beloved dishes edible for more than a week, below are a few hacks that may help:
1) Invest in mason jars: mason jars have a suction seal cap that keeps most air from getting inside. Before leaving home, put whatever kind of food or drink you want such as fruits, meats, veggies, or cocoa into a clean mason jar and get it into a refrigerator ASAP.
2) Store leftovers on the top shelf: often times we throw things on the doors of the fridge because it’s easy, however this is the warmest part of the fridge and also the part where bacteria are most likely to grow. The top shelf is coldest and will prevent bacteria from colonizing.
3) Squeeze some lemon or drizzle apple cider vinegar on top of dishes: these two products are natural antibacterials and will help keep your beloved dishes fresh. Beware, though, the last thing you want is the strong taste of apple cider vinegar mixing with your pumpkin pie, so pick and choose which natural preservative to drizzle over dishes wisely. This can extend the shelf life of food for up to two weeks if done properly.
4) Freeze it: The colder the better. Freezing foods halt the aging process and ensures freshness. It’s best to consume frozen dishes within three months. When reheating, be sure to sprinkle some water on top to prevent foods from getting too dry. DO NOT freeze in glass. Due to its natural makeup, glass is more likely to break once frozen then thawed. Choose freezer bags instead and try to pack them tight with little air inside for best results.
5) Size it right: When storing any kind leftovers in either the refrigerator or freezer it’s best to put them in small containers so there’s less air to dry it out and promote bacteria growth.
6) Timing: The sooner the better. If you know that you want to take some of mom’s mashed potatoes back to your dorm room, scoop some right out of the pot and into a ziplock bag as soon as possible and into the fridge. This will minimize exposure to air and ensure maximum freshness.
I hope this helps all you foodies out there keep some of your most cherished dishes edible for a few weeks longer. Happy holidays, everyone!

What you’ll need:

 
First, use the permanent marker to draw a snowman face onto your tea lights. For the first snowman, place the red washi tape on the top of the head, as if it were a headband. Then, use the crazy glue to glue on the two red pom- poms on the side of the snowman’s head. You have now given your snowman cute earmuffs.
 
 
 
For the next snowman, use a piece of ribbon and form a scarf by placing one side of the ribbon over the other and gluing it into place. Create the hat for the snowman by gluing a thicker width piece of construction paper on top of a thinner width piece, and then glue a different colored piece of construction paper onto the rim to represent a hat band. Finally, glue the hat on to your snowman’s forehead, directly above the eyes.
 
For the last snowman, use washi tape to make a corn cob pipe. Place the washi tape directly next to the snowman’s mouth.
After you have completed these steps, you will have three adorable snowman that can be used as holiday decorations are even ornaments for the tree!

Excitement filled the S.A.L. Gallery on Nov. 28, as the students of Professor Justin Capalbo’s photo 7 class celebrated the opening night of their exhibition “Arcane.”
The exhibit’s title means understood by few, mysterious or secret; a translation that gave the show an underlying theme. Each student chose four photographs to represent their unique interpretation of the word’s definition.
The class came up with “Arcane” together, according to Capalbo. “For their first three years in the photo program, they were really working independently on their work,” he said. “This exhibit is just to figure out how to kind of put egos aside, work together, and create a cohesive body of work all around one topic.”
Senior photography major, Ashley Wilson, called her series “Unknown” which captured the notion that it’s really what’s inside a person that counts. The photos are portraits of model’s faces covered with paper towels soaked in water. A hidden face makes it difficult to determine who someone is. “Nowadays, everyone is so focused on what people look like; and in typical portraits you have to look pretty,” she said. “I figured cover the face, and really, you have to decide if you like the person through other features, instead of paying attention to their makeup or something on their face.”
Also focused on obscureness of the human body was junior photography major, Jessica Ciminelli. Her untitled series left it to the observer to guess which part of the body is used in each print. Creating the mystery she emitted was her use of light.
Drew Esposito, Ciminelli’s cousin, admired the second photo for its darkness and light. “It’s kind of mysterious if you didn’t know it was a person’s back,” he said. “The background in contrast to the rest of the picture, and the color is really nice. And the spaces on the body that are darker naturally are really cool,” Cecelia Filriello, a friend of Ciminelli’s, said.
Her last photo showed the curve of the body where the back of the neck meets the spine. It left viewers questioning what they were looking at. Even Cara Giannetto, the model featured in the photo, was uncertain herself during the shoot. “When I was bent over, I was just trying to figure out how she was going to make it into a picture, but it came out really cool,” she said.
Senior fine arts major, Jeffrey Gomez, took the idea of obscuring and restricting to another level. He worked with a favorite sculpture of his by French artist, Auguste Rodin, displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “I go to the MET religiously, I go almost every Sunday just to write, and view and admire work,” Gomez said.
It took over twenty rolls of film, as well as several trips to the museum, to get the 15 shots that make up his series. Gomez moved around the sculpture taking photos with a long exposure to create “rich black tones and movement.”
The photos are shot on black & white film and developed in a dark room. “That’s kind of just my thing. I like keeping things analogue cause there is just a feel; there’s a grit to it; there’s grain that you can’t really achieve that well in digital [photography],” Gomez said. “I really wanted to just capture light, shadow, and black; like really dark pieces. Generally, when I do a lot of paintings, they’re a more darker tone; there is a more nihilistic feel to them; and I try to achieve that in photos when photographing a subject with long exposures.”
Senior photography major, Chloe Rosario, worked with long exposures as well. She titles her series, “La Ilusion También Se Vive” which means “The Illusion Also Lives.”
At first, Rosario was confused how to demonstrate her understanding of arcane. “I actually looked up the word, and looked at images, and I saw this woman. It was a random photo, and she had a white sheet hanging over her, but not on her. It had her shadow; her silhouette,” Rosario said. “I wanted to do something just like that, but make it look more deep. I wanted it to have more of a meaning.”
In her four photos she used plexiglass instead of a sheet because it was more mobile. Using it to hide her model’s faces made it easier to get her point across. “I had my model lean the plexiglass against the table, but tried to show she was trying to reach out,” she said. Her four photos captured outlines and silhouettes that gave the viewer a feeling of obstruction.
Offering a less intricate impression with her photos was senior photography major, Crystal Gonzalez. She concentrated on the restriction aspect of arcane. When the class was told they could restrict their vision to a part of something, she began her project at the beach.
“After a couple of windy days I started getting like a splash effect. So, then I focused on just the wave and cropped in,” Gonzalez said. “It’s restricting the viewer to only this. You know? There’s a whole beach but I’m making them look at this.”
Gonzalez chose the ocean because many people go there to escape or reflect on life. She wanted observers to take a breather from the heavy focus her classmates were working with. “At the same time though, I also wanted to make it fit in with their emotion. Everybody else’s has movement, and I have movement. You know? The water moves and it splashes,” she said.
MFA student, Lauren Bourguet, a conceptual artist who is more interested in presenting an idea rather than a physical piece of art, worked intensely with movement. She also used a slow shutter speed which allowed the lens to remain open longer; therefore, creating the look of movement in the model’s motions.
Over 500 photos were shot in Lorber Hall, which she narrowed down to four prints for the exhibit. The location gave her series an “organic feel” since the show was also presented on campus, according to Bourguet.
As viewers stopped at her remaining three photos, the model appeared to be paging through a book, which Bourguet said, was meant to be a metaphor for a solution. “She [the model] wants to be fully enveloped in the pages and transform them into her life. You can sort of translate this book in a religious term. You can translate it in a medical term. [It’s] that idea of finding a solution when you’re in a dark place,” side said.
Each photographer successfully portrayed what “arcane” means to them in an abstract form. During the creative process, the students critique each other’s prints, which allowed them as a group, to make decisions and changes to their prints.
“When students eventually take photo 7, they have already developed their own styles. This show required a collaborative effort which obligated them to lose full control over their photos,” Capalbo said.

“The Princess Switch” is a fun, romantic Christmas comedy that will put any viewer into the holiday spirit.

The story begins with Stacey, a professional baker. Stacey is a stickler for the rules, scheduling every moment of her day. She is also heartbroken after a bad break up earlier in the year, and fears that love won’t ever come her way.
Without her knowledge, Stacey’s best friend and sous chef, Kevin, enters the two into a baking competition in the little country of Belgravia. Despite her apprehension, Stacey agrees to attend. While in Belgravia, Stacey meets Duchess Margaret Delacourt, who somehow looks identical to her.
The two decide to switch places, with Stacey taking on Margaret’s role as soon- to-be-queen of Belgravia, and Margaret trying to take on Stacey’s life. What follows is a story that proves true love will always transcend class boundaries and prevail in the end.
With its snowy landscapes, Christmas decorations, and spirit of holiday giving, “The Princess Switch” is the perfect movie to welcome in the holiday season and can currently be screened on Netflix.

The holidays, that time of the year when we start playing Christmas music that we “like” and wait for the big man in the red suit to stick presents under a tree. I know Christmas is still a good amount of time away, but I’ve compiled a list of movies to help the time pass.
“Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer”
“Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer” is a classic, there’s no other way to put it. Originally airing on December 6, 1964, the story is about a young reindeer who is different because of his nose and is mocked by his fellow stag because of it, but it’s not until the end where Rudolph defies the odds.
“National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation”
This one is an absolute masterpiece in terms of Christmas movies, because the humor is so relatable. The film, “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation” is a story about the father, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase), doing his very best to make Christmas perfect. Unfortunately for Griswold, on his way to making the perfect Christmas, he ends up doing things like stapling the sleeve of his shirt to the gutter instead of Christmas lights and locking himself in the attic.
“Home Alone”
Before Macaulay Culkin became what he is now, he was actually a child star, especially in the movie “Home Alone.” The story of “Home Alone” is about a kid named Kevin McCallister being left home alone after sleeping in past his family’s flight. While alone, McCallister has to fend for his young self by thinking of clever ways to defend his home from two robbers looking to rob the McCallister household.
“Elf”
The older I get, the more odd it feels to see Will Ferrell in a children’s movie. However, the movie “Elf” is one of those movies where you can say, “It just works.” The story of “Elf” is about an elf on a mission to find his biological father in New York City and throughout the movie he finds himself having a hard time adjusting to reality and earning his father’s respect.
“The Nightmare Before Christmas”
I wanted to save the best for last here as for my fifth and final pick for the top five best holiday movies being “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” Imagine doing the same thing day after day until one day you step out of your comfort zone. That’s the story of “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” The main character, Jack Skellington, (Danny Elfman) is bored of living as a god-like figure in Halloween Town and accidentally opens up a portal to another world called Christmas Town. As Skellington explores Christmas Town, the plot unfolds and brings two almost polar opposite holidays into one.

“Overwatch”, the popular competitive first-person-shooter, released its 29th hero, Ashe, a gun-slinging bandit and the leader of the notorious Deadlock Gang. The hero was recently released on competitive play and has already made an impact on the meta.

Ashe is the hitscan character that players need. With the game falling into tank based compositions, things were starting to look a little bland. Ashe’s primary weapon is a semi-automatic rifle, with a scope making it effective at all ranges. This allows her to contest other snipers in the game and as well as fend off flankers. Her secondary weapon is a close range shotgun with incredible knockback, allowing players to control the fight and create space for teamfights.
What makes Ashe unique is her ability to attack with dynamite, which can be lobbed a short distance and detonate after a few seconds. However, players can detonate it sooner by shooting it with their rifle.
The tank meta has already seen some changes. Popular streamer, now ranked the best Ashe in the world, Kephrii, has made an impact on hero picks. Ashe is able to disrupt enemy tactics with ease while still maintaining a safe distance.
Ashe is far from an easy hero to master. Players will have to get used to her primary weapon, which takes long to reload. Aim is the name of the game when you’re running Ashe, because of her reload time it is imperative that you clip enemies as soon as possible. She is one of the least forgiving heroes in the game, without a stun as well as having a large hitbox, you can spend most of the game respawning.
Ashe is an excellent edition to the roster that will for sure shake up team compositions. Most players are skeptical about the new hero. However with a new kit and a lot of explosions it will be hard to resist playing as her.

Most people have heard the terms ‘acid’ and ‘base’ at some point in their lives. For many, however, the closest frame of reference we have is high school chemistry, and let’s face it, unless you’re a chemistry major, who really remembers the intrinsics? The fact of the matter is we should pay mind to what substances are acids and bases since we consume many of both daily.

You may remember something called the pH scale. This scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in any given substance in relation to the amount of hydrogen ions in water, which is neutral with a pH of seven. Since hydrogen ions are naturally acidic to the body, when a substance has lots of them, it’s said to be acidic. On the flip side, substances that are basic have a low concentration of hydrogen ions. The scale goes from zero to 14 and is centered around water. Acidic substances have a pH less than seven while basic ones have a pH greater than seven.
Believe it or not, the foods and drinks we consume each day have a specific pH that affects our metabolisms, immune systems and overall health. In America, we mostly consume a diet filled with acidic substances; soda, dairy, red meat, sugar and coffee are all semi strong acids that have a potent effect on our systems. If consume in excess or without the proper
balance of basic foods, acids create an unfavorable balance in the digestive system by hinder- ing the growth of beneficial bacteria that aid in metabolism. Over time, this can lead to weight gain, indigestion and even porous, unstable bones, known as osteoporosis. In fact, osteoporosis being a side effect of an acidic diet is a hot and controversial theory floating around in the scientific community today.
Since bones are made up of alkaline materials like phosphorus and calcium, when people constantly consume a highly acidic diet the body turns to these minerals to serve as buffers to neutralize the acidity. Encyclopaedia Britannica says more research has to be done on this theory, but the science behind it is sound and promising.
Basic foods include vegetables, fruits and nuts. These foods bring the body’s pH up and discourage indigestion. While it may seem blatantly obvious that the basic foods are those that we commonly deem as healthy, too much of a good thing can be bad for you too. Studies done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information suggest basic environments are harmful to certain bacteria in the digestive system and can lead to an inability to fight infections that would have otherwise been killed by protective acidic microorganisms.
Much of the information listed above can be conflicting. Are acidic foods bad and basic foods good, or vice versa? Unfortunately, the scientific literature is unclear, although we do know that too much of anything is never good; a varied diet is ideal. It seems safest to consume both nutritional acids and bases so we provide our bodies with all the essential vita- mins, minerals, and nutritional components it needs to keep us well.

“Abby Carnelia’s One and Only Magical Power” by David Pogue is a fantasy novel, written in the form of a biography. The story follows Abby Carnelia as she tries to learn about her magical power, the ability to spin a hardboiled egg by tugging her earlobes. With her seemingly useless and extremely specific power, Abby’s travels to a magic summer camp with hope to find answers. What first appeared to be a camp specifically for teaching magic tricks is soon revealed to be part of a bigger plot.

Along the way, Abby meets a few more kids with useless powers, a young magician who tricks the camp into thinking he has a power, and some suspicious camp counselors. As Abby continues her journey, some of her questions about her power are answered. But as she digs deeper, Abby and her new friends discover a conspiracy that threatens the wellbeing of the campers with powers.
Perhaps one of the more unusual things about “Abby Carnelia’s One and Only Magical Power” is that we never find out the origins of the characters’ powers. Although Abby does come up with a theory, it is never officially proven. This is disappointing, as Abby spends so much time trying to learn about these little magic powers. Despite the fascination people eventually have with trying to find their own power, it still seems like the readers were cheated out of the truth.
“Abby Carnelia’s One and Only Magical Power” is an interesting story for readers who love magic, tricks and powers. With a unique take on magical powers, a compelling mystery and some things remaining unsolved, this novel is certainly a different kind of fantasy story.

“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” These words comprise the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868, and its’ original purpose was to grant citizenship to freed slaves after the Civil War. There has been significant controversy, however, as to whether or not every person who is born in the United States is automatically granted citizenship. Let’s take a look at the actual language of the amendment.
In an article by Michael Anton for The Washington Post, “All persons born or naturalized” refers to people who are born in the U.S. as well as people who lawfully immigrate to the U.S. and eventually become citizens. People who have immigrated to our country—both legally and illegally— but have not become citizens are not, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of our country: they are subject to the jurisdiction of their home countries. According to the same article, the author of the citizenship clause, Republican senator Jacob Howard of Michigan, said, “The Amendment will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers…” In other words, people born in the U.S. whose parents are non-citizens are themselves non-citizens.
According to an October 2018 report by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), approximately 300,000 births were to illegal aliens every year from 2012 to 2016. Children who are born to illegal immigrants are also commonly known as “anchor babies.”
Birth tourism refers to the practice of foreigners coming to the United States and giving birth to children, which automatically grants their children U.S. citizenship. But how exactly does this help the United States? According to an article in The Washington Examiner by Paul Bedard, around 300,000 children were born to illegal aliens in 2014, putting the cost of childrearing at approximately $2.4 billion. According to a PBS.
org article by Phil Galewitz, around one-third of all births in the Bethesda Healthcare System in Boynton Beach, Florida, are paid for by emergency Medicaid, which is used almost exclusively by illegal aliens. A 2015 report by CIS shows most welfare that is received by immigrant households benefits the children of immigrants who, if they are born in the United States, are granted citizenship at birth.
American citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Why, then, would it be wise to give the children of people who are not citizens of the United States, especially people who enter our country illegally, with citizenship? Birthright citizenship is still an open legal question to be determined by the courts, and perhaps it is time for a new debate around the meaning of American citizenship.

CIS is an SPLC-designated hate group, known for its promotion of white supremacist and antisemitic literature. I wouldn’t cite them as a credible source on immigration statistics.

I agree with the column by Christopher Trick published by the Pioneer on Nov. 28 about the opening of Amazon’s new headquarters in Long Island City. Our infrastructure, especially the Long Island Rail Road system, is not capable of supporting an influx of new commuters. I also don’t believe in subsidizing a corporation as a large as Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos has the highest estimated net worth in the world, according to Forbes, especially given what many employees say are grim working conditions, and the fact that Amazon raised its lowest salary to $15 an hour, only to take away other benefits (as confirmed to CNBC via email from Amazon).
I also agree that there is nothing new about corporations forming alliances with politicians for mutual gains. However, this is not a one-party problem. Although the Right “has defended” large corporations for years, according to Trick, he has it wrong that corporations are simply the backbone of the Democratic Party.
Since the 2016 election cycle, we have seen a wave of Democratic candidates swear off Political Action Committee (or PAC) donations. For example, during this past election, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand swore off accepting donations from PACs of for-profit companies. New Jersey Senator Corey Booker did as well. California Senator Kamila Harris also stopped taking corporate PAC donations. Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D, NY) also rejected all corporate PAC money, and won. This is a short list of politicians in the Democratic Party who see the problem, and strive to do better and get big money out of politics.
If you were to check the donor lists of Republican presidential candidates, you would see that Morgan Stanley’s PAC donated over $600,000 to George W. Bush during the 2004 election cycle, and also donated over $470,000 to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the 2016 cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org.
Neither political party has been immune to corporate donations. But how are politicians on the Right and Left now deciding to handle fundraising?
Because the Democratic Party base is becoming more liberal, they are beginning to hold their candidates to a higher standard. In fact, presumed next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Cali) announced that the first thing on the Democratic agenda for the House would, in fact, be campaign finance reform legislation. I will be very surprised to see conservatives in either the House or Senate work in a bipartisan manner with the Democrats on this goal; the Republicans also rely heavily on corporate PAC money for their campaigns but have generally been much less outspoken on the issue.
As the candidate who raises the most money is often the winner of their election, it is important to curtail corporate donations, and return more of the electoral power to the people. This does not have to be and should not be a partisan issue. The Left is starting to take notice… Is the Right? The invitation for collaboration on campaign finance reform has been open for some time.

Many people have strong, thoughtful opinions about birthright citizenship. Although it may anger some, I want to be clear that my statement is NOT to take a winning side nor make anyone change their views. I want to present a personal perspective about the importance of the issue, not a liberal or a conservative viewpoint. I want to share the experience of those who are undocumented and their journeys through the education system and life in general, because they are just like us, those who were lucky enough to be born with parents who have all the documentation aligned for them.
Immigrants who have come to the U.S. illegally to seek a better life, shelter, better work and wages, should be allowed to stay under conditions that our elected officials can develop to accommodate for them. This country was built by immigrants who came from all over the world, all parts of the world that you can think of. The fact that our government officials are restricting asylum seekers and immigrants from troubled nations is disappointing and disturbing to watch. What happened to America the beautiful? Has this lost all meaning? What about “humanity”?
Since we’re talking about declarations from the past, what about, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness”? Where does “all,” including immigrants, stand now? Our teachers are immigrants, our politicians are immigrants, our founding fathers were immigrants, and the people who have birthed you and the people who have birthed them were immigrants. We are all immigrants.
When some look at immigration, they think of criminals entering the country or others ready to take their jobs. They perceive these individuals as monstrous and underclass. But these are the people who mow your lawns in Garden City at the crack of dawn, reconstruct your roof, build and clean your houses. Many of them do not have the proper documentation. But, is this their fault? Immigrants, especially those of Hispanic descent, are not privileged enough to receive documentation, because their parents were not qualified to give that to them.
Inheritance is one reason why those from the upper class have financial stability. Many immigrants continue to live below the poverty level. Why can’t we help those who should be helped? I understand those who earned their wealth want to keep it, but what about those who worked hard, but can’t receive the equal rights and work? Immigrants work as hard as citizens do. They often work hard to receive their visa, green card and pay lawyers, just to allow their families to stay.
Let’s look at one particular student, who is an immigrant and is in school.
Bairon Reyes Luna is currently enrolled in the class of 2022 at Yale University. Reyes was born in Honduras, but spent his whole life living in Hempstead. “In 2005, my parents decided to leave the violence and poverty of our home country and immigrated to the United States,” Reyes said. He was limited by his undocumented status because he couldn’t legally work or vote when he wanted to, but his dreams weren’t crushed. “It was not until I achieved DACA status, that the dream of becoming a doctor became a realizable reality,” Reyes said.
“I do believe that providing a certain status to those who were brought as children here and [who have] grown to call America their home is a must. Furthermore, the immigration system is in dire need of reform,” he said.
Look at the issue we are seeing on the Mexican border. Would it be nice to witness first hand children and their parents being sprayed with tear gas? Is there a way officials can grant visas and green cards to those without criminal backgrounds, who are seeking work, who have children, who need food and shelter? Why does violence have to be the solution?
The color of our skin, the different ways we speak and look, make up the fabric of our multicultural society. Whites, blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Mexicans, Africans, you name it, all have the same goal in this life: to reach a level of stability and happiness, that is what matters. And no, we are not illegal aliens; we are only humans living and working hard, day in and day out.
Again I am NOT here to tell you that you are wrong for your views. I am NOT here to convert you to beliefs you do not want. I am sharing the truth about how arrogance and supremacy of certain races throughout history bites us. We are all equal at LIU Post. We should embrace the uniqueness of other students and how they can impact our lives. Learn compassion for those around you, even when they don’t have as much as you do.
And yes, my parents are immigrants and I am proud.

Casey Schermick, the sports information director, talks about the latest week in Pioneer sports. Schermick gives a recap for the fall sport season and the expectations for the next season after the One LIU merger, and also delves into the winter season with men’s basketball. This interview was originally done through the WCWP sports department and shortened for publication.
Mattina: They (men’s soccer team) lost in the East Regional Final against Adelphi University on that snowstorm of a day. It really changed the tempo of that game. So, how does the men’s soccer team put this game in the past and look towards next season?
Schermick: I think there is a lot of solid pieces that are gonna be coming back next year. I think it’s going to be interesting to see the dynamic, obviously with the combining of the two squads, between us and Brooklyn. Brooklyn had another very successful year this year, just like Post did. So, I think that is going to be a very strong program next year. It’s gonna do a lot to compete in the NEC (North East Conference). It’s gonna take a couple weeks to get over that loss, so, obviously it’s a tough way to end your season. But I think looking forward they’re definitely going to be excited for next year.
Mattina: Graduate student, Lukas Ostermann added more to his postseason resume, earning the United Soccer Coaches First Team All-Region. This season he also earned the Division 2 CCA East Region Player of the Year, the Google Cloud Academic All-District team and Offensive Player of the Year in the East Coast Confer- ence. I think we can agree that Ostermann has definitely left a legacy here.
Schermick: By the time we talk about this again, he’ll be an All-American for both Division 2 CCA and the United Soccer Coaches Association. It was one heck of a year for him. Obviously coming one goal away from the school record and finishing with 23 goals, second in the country, it was fun to watch him.
Mattina: Four members of the women’s soccer team earned recognition on Monday, Oct. 26, when the United Soccer Coaches Association named them to the All East Region team. Senior Hillevi Eklow, junior Gabrielle Clark, and sophomore Samantha Gordon earned First Team Accolades, and junior Julia Duffey earned Second Team. Now three of these four will be returning next year; how important are these players to the team?
Schermick: They’re gonna be very important. It’s great to have the recognition and the publicity for these programs. But, I think sometimes things get lost in translation when you go from so many awards that are voted on by SID’s compared to the coaches and I think you see that with the United Soccer Coaches Association. Four All Region players. Definitely some players that don’t show up in the stat sheets but are key members of this team, especially on the defensive end allowing less than a goal per game this year, I think it was outstanding. I think both Gabby and Sam were big reasons in front of Hillevi in goal, and obviously Hillevi in goal had another outstanding season. With the first team recognition, I think there is going to be some key pieces that they are going to look for coming next year to lead the Division 1 team.
Mattina: So, let’s switch to football. They suffered an unfortunate loss in the first round of the NCAA Division 2 Tournament against Slippery Rock University. But, they came out with some awards: four major awards and
18 All-NE10 Honorees. Head Coach, Bryan Collins, who got Coach of the Year, red-shirt senior Jake Carlock, won Defensive Player of the Year, Graduate student, Kevin Petit-Frere, won Defensive Lineman of the Year, Red-Shirt senior, Chris Coles, won Offensive Lineman of the Year, and 18 other players won All-NE10 Honorees. Just talk a little bit about the team and all 18 All-NE10 Honorees.
Schermick: Well, I think just looking at some of those major awards, it was a year that may have surprised some people for football, because if you look at recent years, the defense is the strength of this team. It was a shootout in some games where, you know, the offense was putting up 40 to 50 points a game, that’s how they were coming away with some wins. But, I mean this year was really the defense that carried them to that undefeated regular season and the conference title. I think it’s well deserved that Jake Carlock and Kevin Petit- Frere got the recognition that they definitely earned, and I think in about week six or seven, there were three or four options on the defense that you could have put up for Defensive Player of the Year this year and it’s a well deserved recognition.
The rest of the All-NE10 Honorees can be found on liupostpioneers.com.
Mattina: The men’s basketball regular season is underway, they have not played a conference game yet. They added a new player to the roster, the walk on red-shirt senior, Neil Feminella, from the men’s soccer team. Sophomore, Alonzo Ortiz-Traylor was named the ECC Defensive Player of the Week and freshman Kendell Ogilvie was named Rookie of the Week.
For Ogilvie, he had a career high 20 points and seven rebounds against the College of Saint Rose, four to six in three pointers and four steals. With all these problems going on right now with the men’s basketball team (several players forfeited the season), these two guys have really been stepping up to the plate and playing their hearts out. What is it like to have a guy who has some experience from last year and a rookie making an impact like this already?
Schermick: I think it’s exciting to see the leadership that Alonzo has shown especially on the floor this year, kind of trying to rally those freshman around him along with someone like Jackson Jordan (sophomore guard), who has also played very well early on this year. I think they’re still going through the feeling out process phase of trying to learn how to play with each other on the offensive end.
I think they’re going to get better looks and start to create some easier buckets for them- selves and I think they are going to compete throughout the year. Obviously, it’s a difficult time and it’s an unfortunate situation but I definitely think it’s exciting to see someone like Alonzo put that leadership out there. It’s definitely something that stands out in the department.

As a result of the One LIU announcement made in early October, the men’s basketball team’s season changed almost instantly. A majority of players decided against playing this year in protest of the merger, and instead chose to sit out the year and transfer away from Post to continue their collegiate basketball careers elsewhere. The team now consists of only nine players.

In his sixth season at the helm of the team, head coach Erik Smiles was immediately faced with a tough situation. However, he has since put together a stable roster and could potentially add more depth to his team as the season continues to go underway.
The biggest name remaining on the roster after the announcement of the merger is sophomore forward Alonzo Ortiz-Traylor. As a freshman, Ortiz-Traylor appeared in 24 games with 15 starts and averaged six points and four rebounds in 16 minutes per game. The six foot four sophomore out of Woodside has seen a huge increase in his production since stepping into his new role as a veteran leader for the team. In three games, Ortiz-Traylor is averaging just under 22 points and eight rebounds in 37 minutes per game. When asked about how he feels leading a young core of teammates, he said, “I just want to leave a positive impact on their lives and show them that this game is all about learning, not about wins or losses.”
Alongside Ortiz-Traylor, freshman starting guard Kendell Ogilvie has settled in nicely. In just over 30 minutes per game, the Woodmere native is scoring 13 points per game to go along with seven rebounds. Ogilvie was named East Coast Conference rookie of the week after scoring a career high 20 points against the College of Saint Rose on Nov. 24.
Of the nine men on the Pioneers roster, seven are newcomers to the program, but being labeled a newcomer doesn’t necessarily mean they are members of the freshman class. Redshirt senior Neil Feminella joined the men’s basketball team as the ninth member of the roster. A four-year Islip High School varsity basketball player, Feminella spent his collegiate career as a member of the men’s soccer team at Post, but is beginning his transition from the soccer pitch back to the hardwood.
“The transition hasn’t been too bad,” Feminella said. “The rest of the team has made it very easy for me, and I hope some of our success from soccer season can carry over to this winter.”
Despite losing their first three games of the season, the Pioneers are set to begin their East Coast Conference schedule Wednesday, Dec. 5 against the Molloy College Lions at 7 p.m. in the Pratt Recreation Center, immediately following the conclusion of the women’s basketball game.
