In the middle of the spring semester, right before the rehiring pro- cess began, the Residence Assistants working in each of the dormitories were notified that they will no longer receive stipends for their work as
RAs. Jamie Boswell, a senior Musical Theatre major and RA in Post Hall, explains, “The work requirements have gone down.” RAs previous- ly worked from 5 – 12 p.m., but will now be required to work from 7 – 11 p.m. “While on duty I sit in the RA/CLC Office in my residence hall and make rounds every other hour to check and make sure the building is safe and secure for the residents. I’m also there to handle any situations or incidents that may occur from 7 p.m. to 9 a.m. the next morning. The paperwork we fill out whenever we’re on duty includes fire and safety logs and duty logs. Both document the building’s security. We also make door-tags, bulletin boards, post flyers, and other notifications in the hall to keep our residents aware of what’s happening on campus,” Boswell added.
Despite the elimination of the stipends, RAs will still receive room and board for their efforts. Boswell also believes that since the RAs have become a closer-knit group, residents will have an easier time adjusting to dorm life.
The Office of Residence Life underwent other changes over the summer, as well. The staff moved from the basement of Post Hall to the 2nd floor of Hillwood Commons. The office merged with the Office of Student Activities, and the combined entity is now known as the Office of Campus Life.
According to the new Director of Campus Life, Michael Berthel, there are now 30 RAs, with a ratio of one RA per 40 residents. The ratio has stayed the same from last year, but there are fewer RAs in total after some rearranging in the usage of residence halls. Among the 30 RAs, there are only three to four new ones, and the rest are returning staff. In addition, there are five Campus Life Coordinators (CLC) that took over for the Residence Hall Director (RHD); one CLC is assigned to each of the residence halls.
The CLCs are university employees who work in the office of Campus life, and their tasks are broader than that of the old RHDs, who were previously located in offices in the residence halls. Among the CLCs, there is one former RHD, and the rest are newly employed.
Matt Blanar, CLC for Brookville Hall, said that he feels the new model makes it easier for students to connect with both the CLCs, and form better communities on campus. Along with their hall duties, CLCs are also tasked to attend programs and activities around campus, such as orientation and homecoming. Blanar added that the move of the offices to Hillwood Commons will allow students easier access to the services of the CLCs.
Berthel said the changes so far have been good, “but we’re only on week one.” Boswell agrees: “I can confidently say that I’m super excited for this year; it’s all been changed for the better.”

Construction is underway on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, in the location of the former student computer lab, for a new technology store on campus. The store, tentatively named Browse, will open by early October, according to Tamir Dayya, the Special Projects Coordinator for the student-run businesses on campus. Browse will join The Student Body, The Post Treat Shoppe, and The End Zone that were opened in Hillwood Commons during the 2013-2014 academic school year.
The store will sell laptops, tablets, gaming consoles, and accessories, and will have an open floor design similar to an Apple store, with four stations with different merchandise, according to Jackie Nealon, LIU’s Chief of Staff. Nealon added that the store will offer current Post students, faculty, and staff discounts on varied products. In addition, Browse will offer a “‘Genius Bar’ level of technical support [typically] found in Apple stores,” said Nealon.
Although Browse is a store, Nealon views this business venture as a learning opportunity as well. She believes that this will help students learn about retail management, supply-chain management, inventory control, and much more.
“In the future, we plan to integrate teaching experiences at Browse into the College of Management to develop a unique academic curriculum,” said Nealon. Browse will not only teach students, but professors as well; it will feature a training room that aims to keep professors up to date on the latest technology.
“[Browse] will be a place on campus [students] can go to for technological needs,” Dayya said. Dayya also believes this store helps to reiterate the university’s initiative to get as many students involved as possible, due to the fact that Browse will employ 16 part-time students. Lucie Chrastecka, a junior Pre-Medicine Biology major, believes that student-run businesses are much more than a way to get involved on campus. As a foreign exchange student, she is not allowed to get a job off campus or on campus, unless it is a campus budget job. She currently works at The Student Body, Post’s student-run clothing boutique, and is in favor of student-run businesses. “The main reason I like the stores is because the profits go back into the school,” Chrastecka added. Half of the profits from student-run businesses go back into the business itself, while the other half is used for scholarships for students, according to Nealon.
There are three businesses scheduled to open on campus this semester, including Browse. A branch of Bethpage Federal Credit Union will open on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, and will be geared towards the finances of college students. The bank will offer discounted loan rates and lower minimum account balances, according to Kevin McKenna, the Manager of Business Development for Bethpage Federal Credit Union. The other store planned to open is a student art gallery, where students can sell their artwork. The gallery is set to open where the current Student Art Gallery League is on the first floor of Hillwood Commons, across from Starbucks.
These three new businesses bump up the number of student-run stores in Hillwood Commons to six. “Since Hillwood is the social hub of LIU Post, it makes sense to house our new student-run ventures within this prime location [in order] to maximize exposure as well as to provide convenience,” Nealon said.

This fall marks the second school year for LIU Promise, a program that pairs freshmen students with Success Coaches who aim to make the college experience easier. These coaches provide career counseling, as well as assistance with enrollment, major selection, scholarships, financial planning, internships, and encouragement of assigned students to becoming active members of the campus community.
The 10 Success Coaches are Ali DiBona, Daniel Lauterman, Greg Schimmel, Katelin Townsend, Kaitlin Jensen, Leslie Baim, Samantha Gottlieb, Saadia Rafiq, Daniel Carlos, and Alissa Karcz. Their offices were relocated over the summer from Winnick House to the 2nd floor
of Hillwood Commons, in room 270. LIU Promise started in the spring of this year. Junior and senior students still receive advisement from a separate team at Enrollment Services in Kumble Hall.
“LIU Promise was very successful in its first year,” said DiBona, Senior Associate Director of the program. “Although we didn’t start the program at the beginning of the Fall 2013 semester, all of the Success Coaches have had the opportunity to get to know their students on a whole different level.”
According to DiBona, not only do the coaches help their students academically, but they also assist with career development, financial aid, and suggestions for getting involved on campus. The coaches received workshop training to build their knowledge of all majors at LIU Post.
“I am grateful that I have [DiBona] as my LIU Post Promise Coach,” said Nick Butcher, a sophomore Biomedical Sciences major. Butcher had to switch his major in the closing weeks of the summer, when most of his new required classes had already been filled. DiBona assisted in getting him back on track by sorting out which classes this semester would allow him to continue on as a Radiology major next year.
“I have the highest praise for her,” Butcher continued. “Having someone like her on your side is the greatest asset and weapon you have in getting through much of the red tape that might block you.”
Melanie Coffey, a sophomore Film major, who is now studying abroad in London, England, was still able to receive assistance from the LIU Promise program in the latter part of summer through online counseling. “[My success coach and I] talked about internships for next summer, and how to go about making a résumé and portfolio for both film and class work,” she said.
“Success Coaches are encouraged to support their students outside of the office by attending their athletic games, club events, and activities on campus,” DiBona added. “The design of the LIU Promise model is that all students remain with their coaches throughout their entire time at LIU.”
One may wonder how a team of 10 coaches can handle such a large group of students and their individual problems. LIU Post admitted roughly 500 new first year students this year. DiBona, however, was confident in her team, and their involvement with assigned students. Students can make an appointment with their Success Coaches, or stop by during the day. “We try to be as flexible and accessible as possible. We have students in and out of our office all day long,” DiBona said.
This year will be a test to see how successful the program is, in light of many other recent changes on campus, including the closing of Kings and Queens Hall, the merger between Student Life and the Office of Residence Life, and a shuffling of administrative leadership.

LIU Post’s Campus Bookstore was established in the late 1970s, and has been operated by the renowned Barnes and Nobles since
its commencement. The store sells an array of student necessities: academic books, stationery, dorm decorations and gifts, toiletries and cosmetics, LIU sports gear and apparel, and more recently, technology, such as laptops and tablets.
Although the store sells books to cater for all of the courses offered at Post, the university has found that students tend to purchase their texts from online companies, such as Amazon and Chegg, due to a significant price difference between the books sold online and on campus. Freshman Biology major Jackie Mauri explained, “The books on Amazon that I rent are over 50 percent cheaper than the books at the bookstore. It’s so overpriced and quite frankly, I can’t afford them.” Some of the books students (more so freshmen and sophomores) are required to purchase for their classes aren’t even used towards their major. “I may as well rent an English literature book and return it than purchase one. It’s not like I’ll use it again after the semester, so why should I pay $180 on a book that I’ll never use but I can keep, instead of renting one for $40?” Mauri continued.
Jorge Lanas, the bookstore manager, admitted that cheaper prices can be found elsewhere, but the store is attempting to win the students back. “Students look for the best value for money, which isn’t always on campus,” Lanas admitted. “However, pricing has dropped in the store due to the different
categories of books [we] have to offer; rent, new and used, [as well as] the new feature of digital e-books, which are user friendly and up to 60 percent cheaper than the other categories.”
The bookstore doesn’t calculate its sales based on percentage of students buying books at the store, but based on the number of units it sells. “As this semester is just under way, I don’t have that number readily available, but by the beginning of October we would have a better idea of what percentage of books have sold in store,” Lanas said. “On average it’s between 65-67 percent in the fall semester.”
Additionally, professors are looking at alternative ways to help students save money by using open source books that are free for all to use. Some have also used their own personal notes to create digital content on Blackboard for students to reference and for general assistance.
LIU Post’s Campus Bookstore is located opposite the Winnick Mansion, and is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays, and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays. You can also contact the store by phone at (516) 299-2639.

For the 2014-2015 academic year, LIU Post is implementing 22 new minors in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, the College of Education, Information, and Technology, and the School of Visual and Performing Arts — a move that Dr. Jeffrey Kane, the Vice President for Academic Affairs since 2002, believes will increase enrollment and student satisfaction.
The selection of a minor can enrich a student’s academic career and career prospects after graduation, while simultaneously allowing a student to explore his/her passion and personal interests. Selecting a minor can aid in broadening a student’s skills, expanding his/her area of expertise, and diversifying the resume.
“I think that LIU desperately needs to add not only new minors, but new majors,” said Jenny Edgengard, a junior English major. “Nevertheless, I’m glad that we are expanding. Hopefully, people will take notice and it will entice more students to enroll because without enrollment, there will be little revenue.”
Edgengard conveys a concern that many LIU students can relate to after Post was listed in Forbes’ Aug. 13, 2013 issue, “Is Your College Going Broke?,” as being one of the least financially fit schools in America. With low enrollment, how will Post be able to financially support its existing clubs, sports teams, and academic pursuits?
Kane believes that adding these new minors will provide students with the variety and exploration that they need to feel fulfilled in their academic pursuits, as well as assist with enrollment. “To build a successful career, today’s graduates need a breadth and depth of experiences and education. By adding the option of minors for LIU Post students, we are hoping to give our students the chance to explore complementary educational areas that will render them [as] more marketable and better-rounded professionals,” said Kane.
In the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences: the Forensic Chemistry, Forensics Genetics, Forensic Phycology, Criminalistics, Environmental Sustainability, Global Climate Change, French Area Studies, Italian Area Studies, Hispanic Area Studies, Health Care Administration, Financial Engineering, Gender & Society, Race, Ethnicity & Society, and Social Change & Social Inequalities minors have been added.
In the College of Education: Information & Technology, the Sports Management, Equine Studies, Game Development, Information Management, Information Technology, and Programming minors have been added.
In the School of Visual and Performing Arts: Communications and Fashion Merchandising minors have been added.
Kane believes that these additions will prove to be positive
for students because “they create new and varied opportunities for specialized study, in accordance with student interests and career aspirations.” However, while most students believe that this change is positive, some students believe that the university still has a long way to go.
“When I first was applying to colleges, I overlooked LIU
Post because they didn’t even have my major, let alone minor,” said Edgengard. “LIU Post promises students that they will show us ‘how good we really are’, and the implementation of new minors is a good way to start accomplishing that.”

The bi-campus retreat, an annual event that brings together stu- dent club leaders from both LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn, was cancelled in late August. The retreat is geared towards student leaders who will try and find ways to improve their clubs and organizations on campus.
The rescheduling occurred because there were “some new initiatives and practices on each campus, and we felt like it would be more beneficial for us to meet with our own respective campuses [in order] to conduct train- ing that was more campus specific,” according to Michael J. Berthel, the Director of Campus Life at LIU Post. Berthel went on to say that the LIU Post club training will be held in mid-September.
The event, which combines student-leaders from both schools, typically draws about 200 students. Senior Broadcasting major Natalie Villanueva, who is the President of the Cultural Group as well as the News Director for Post TV (PTV), has attended the retreat for the past two years. “The retreat has been interesting with excellent keynote speakers,” Villanueva said. “I really felt like I made a connection with students on the Brooklyn campus. We still keep in contact with one another.”
The purpose of the retreat is to “provide student leaders with an opportunity to exchange ideas and collaborate university-wide,” according to Berthel. In addition to trying to build leaders out of students, the retreat also devotes time to specific issues such as goal- setting, time management, self-esteem, and alcohol abuse.
The event is coordinated by the student life organizations of both campuses. There is no word yet on when or if a bi-campus retreat will be held, or whether there will be guest speakers. Typically, keynote speakers and members of the administration participate and cover topics from teambuilding and conflict resolution to leadership styles and ethics.
In years past, the retreat has attracted the attention of nationally acclaimed presenters such as Tanya Odom and Arel Moodie. Odom is a Global Consultant and executive coach, while Moodie is a motivational speaker who focuses on student success and leadership skills in her lectures.
Berthel stated that he hopes to have the annual retreat rescheduled sometime in early 2015. The planning of the event will be ongoing during the first semester of 2014.

The College Republicans is a new club on campus that aims to bridge the gap between politicians and college students. The club, which was approved by the Office of Student Activities during Spring 2014, is designed for college students who identify with the political platforms of the Republican Party.
Although the president of the club, Jacob Schmotzer, a sophomore English and Secondary Education major, does not have any political aspirations, he still believes this club can be beneficial to him and his peers. “The club was started for several reasons: one, to give Republicans our age a chance to meet one another; [and] two, to help Republicans our age have their voices heard,” Schmotzer said.
The club’s first meeting was held on Sept. 10, in Hillwood Commons room 106 during common hour. Eight people attended the first meeting, which began with the members introducing themselves to each other before the guest speaker, Grant Lally, arrived.
Lally is the managing partner of Lally & Misir, LLP. He has decades of experience in politics, and is currently running for U.S. Congress in New York’s Third Congressional District. Lally told the club members about some of his trials and tribulations while working for President Bush, such as his experiences as Bush’s manager during the critical Miami, Florida Recount. He also wrote President Bush’s foreign policy towards Ireland, when he kept the Irish Peace Process on top of the U.S. Foreign Policy.
According to grantlallyforcongress.com, “Grant has appeared before the United States Supreme Court – the only lawyer from
New York State – to oppose Obamacare.” This case is known as the Obamacare case.
Wolf German, a senior Sociology major, believed that the speaker “definitely brought momentum to the [club’s first] meeting.” German stressed that the club needed to make an impact on campus. “We want to help build up motivation and get the word out on campus to have a strong club.”
Schmotzer discussed his plans for the College Republicans. “We hope to hold various informative events such as debates, discussions, and speeches by elected officials in the Republican Party,” he said. “Of course, there’s always room for less formal events, as well. We’re hoping to host a party on election night. We’ll have to see where this semester takes us. We’re open to any ideas our members may have.”
“I’m a Republican,” Schmotzer said, “because I do not believe big government is the solution: rather, it’s the problem. I believe in supply- side economics, states’ rights, lower taxes, lower spending levels, and self-sufficiency,” he added.
The club’s next meeting is on Sept. 17 during common hour. As of right now, there is not a Democratic club at Post, nor any other political club.

There are a myriad of arts-related clubs and organizations on campus to suit the needs of any student with a creative spark. The clubs, which provide a way for students to network and make friends with like-minded people, are open to all students. As we commence the fall semester, these clubs have began meeting and planning their activities.
Emerging Student Theatre Artists, or ESTA, is the leading theatre club on campus. The club aims to produce and foster challenging theatre, and converge creative minds. Meetings are held at 8:30 p.m. on Sundays on the Little Theatre Mainstage.
The ESTA recently merged with the Say Anything Improv over the summer, a stage group that performs sketch comedy on campus, influenced by professionals like the Upright Citizens Brigade in NYC. Members from these clubs realized that they had a similar group of attendees, and that a merger would be beneficial. The result: less conflict of scheduling and a more unified network of theatre students. Their advisor is Heather Drastal, the General Manager of the Post Theatre Company.
“I first became involved with ESTA at the beginning of my freshman year,” said senior Musical Theatre major Anna Bitteridge, president of ESTA. “It was a newly reinstated club [that] was trying to get back up on its feet. I became the club president my sophomore year, and I am proud to say I have seen the club grow in so many ways. ESTA has a long history as a part of LIU and I really want to keep that alive to give people the chance to create theatre and experience it.”
Members of ESTA plan on putting on a show this fall that will be produced and star solely the female members of the Theatre department. “We also plan on doing a Second Annual New Play Festival, where we will have a night of student written plays,” continued Bitteridge. “This was a huge hit last semester and it’s definitely a tradition we’d like to keep going.”
Bitteridge took a trip to Edinburgh, Scotland over the summer to perform the show “Conditions of Love” with other Theater students at the Fringe Arts Festival. There, she and other ESTA members had a new realization inspired by the variety of art being created and about the role of the club. “ESTA is not just for actors, or acting majors,” she said. “It is for anyone at all who has something they want to try out or create. If you write plays, sing, dance, or just love to watch theatre, ESTA is the place to do it. We are constantly encouraging new members to stop in.”
PTV is the local, student-run television station on campus. The PTV club holds meetings in their studio on the second floor of the Humanities building. These facilities are used to create original programing, shows, and events. They include cameras, recording devices and mixing boards, lights, and other professional equipment. Their first meeting will be held Sept. 25 during common hour. The club is planning an awards show this year, which will feature video projects by media students.
WCWP (88.1 FM) is the campus radio station, located behind Hillwood Commons. The station has their own radio tower and equipment, and broadcasts are student-programed, some of which have their own talk and music shows. WCWP began presenting live radio play performances in the spring, with the Play Troupe of Port Washington. On Saturday, Sept. 27, “The Philadelphia Story” will be performed for the radio live by the troupe, at 1 p.m. in the Hillwood Recital Hall. For ticketing information, and to learn more about how to get involved with the station, visit wcwp.org. On Wednesday, Sept. 24 at 12:30 p.m., the station is holding a campus-wide promo event on the Hillwood Commons rooftop. The event is free and open to all students, staff, and faculty.
Although technically not a club, WCWP, which is part of the Media Arts Department in the School of Visual and Performing Arts, welcomes new members of all majors. General staff meetings are not consistently on a weekly basis, and are held in Humanities room 020.
The Art and Art History club serves as another resource for the arts: events, films, exhibitions, and lectures. Club members meet Wednesdays during common hour in Hillwood Commons, room 214.
In the past, this club has held informative and interactive events, such as Haxus last April. The Haxus event was on the Great Lawn in front of Hillwood Commons, and featured a lecture about 1960s performance art called Happenings and Fluxus, by advisor and Art Department professor Aileen Wang. The lecture was followed by a demonstration of the techniques by club members and passersby, focusing on freedom of expression.
“You don’t have to be a Picasso, just bring an open mind and let your creativity take the lead. That’s what matters because we hope to appeal to any and all students,” said president Stacie Zucker, a junior Digital Arts and Design major. “This club tries to appeal to all aspects and kinds of art; art history, painting, drawing, performance art, careers in the art industry, and getting involved in the art community. You name it, we try to cover it all. We’re all very friendly and open to new ideas and ways to express ourselves.”
“Networking is one of the most important tools in today’s professional world and the Art and Art History Club does a fantastic job networking,” said senior Art History major Joseph DeLeon, treasurer of the club. DeLeon was one of the founding members of the club in Fall 2013, and watched it expand under other members such as Zucker, while he was studying abroad. His job as treasurer is key, helping to create
the club budget, request funds, and take care of other expenses. This year, DeLeon hopes to raise funds on a larger scale in order to host more events to benefit the club and the university.
“I feel that the most difficult challenge a university club faces is gaining funds,” said DeLeon. “While small events, such as a bake sale, are ways of raising money, it is really a small amount. Our club members do not need to pay dues the way a sorority or a fraternity does, and therefore [our budget] truly relies on fundraising.”
The Art and Art History Club has held panel discussions with professionals in the art world, aided by professors and club advisors who have connections within the industry. Recent graduates return to provide insight on their job search and employment experiences. Additionally, museum trips are standard.
Wang, who formerly worked at the art auction house of Christie’s in NYC, plans trips every semester; the students experience a live auction and attend a private lecture by a Christie’s educator. There will be a professional panel on Thursday, Oct. 9, featuring Sharon Matt Atkins, Managing Curator of Exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum during common hour in the Steinberg Museum of Art.
Another artist network on campus is the Student Art League. The SAL has a gallery on the first floor of Hillwood Commons, where Art students often display new works. Meetings are currently being held Wednesdays at 1:30 p.m. in Hillwood Commons near the Student Art League Gallery, until a room can be secured. SAL activities include gallery visits, involvement with the American Cancer Society Relay for Life, art technique demonstrations, and hosting a booth at the LIU Post homecoming. Winn Rea, an art professor at LIU Post, advises the club.
“So far there are no set plans, but there will be gallery trips to the city and some other fun events happening this fall,” said senior Art Education major Danielle Savarese, president of SAL. “Like in years past, homecoming will be super fun as students and fans throw paint filled water balloons at the SAL members to raise money and create art.”
Tuesday, Sept. 23 is the grand opening of the Art Gallery Store attached to the SAL gallery in Hillwood Commons. The store will house merchandise and creative wares made by students, which will aim to be sold on consignment. This is just one of several student businesses that has recently been opened up on campus, joining The Body Shop clothing boutique and The Post Treat Shoppe in Hillwood Commons.

The Steinberg Museum of Art, located on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, has several interesting exhibits planned for the fall semester, ranging from paintings by abstract painter Roy Newell to the works of faculty members of Post’s Art Department.
The current exhibitions (up from Sept. 8 – Nov. 15) are called “Changing New York: Photographs by Berenice Abbott, 1935-1938,” and “Color and Time: Paintings by Roy Newell, 1956-2000.”
Barbara Applegate, the Director of the museum, spoke enthusi- astically about these exhibitions. “There is no connection between the two except that Abbott’s [works] are part of the museum’s collection and one of the Newell paintings is, too. They are together because it was good timing for both; the Newell exhibition had just been at the Pollock-Kras- ner House and Study center,” Applegate said. Abbott’s photographs are from the Great Depression era, when she took pictures of New York City in a rapidly changing time for both the city and the country as a whole.
“When she came back from Paris where she interned and worked with a modernist artist, Man Ray, she saw huge change in the city, and she wanted to document it,” Applegate continued. The photos document a lot of architecture, buildings, streets, signs, and people, all with the modernist flair Abbott picked up under Ray during her Parisian intern- ship. She didn’t want the pictures to be pretty, but rather wanted to see the huge contrasts between old and new.
The second exhibition, “Color and Time,” is a big contrast in itself with the use black and white documentation of Abbott’s photography. “Newell painted several huge paintings,” said Applegate. “He was very indecisive, as he later destroyed all these big paintings himself, before starting this collection.”
Applegate explained how Newell’s wife told him to write a book about, “How not to sell paintings. He never sold [them]. Just kept them And then he changed his mind on how he wanted them to look, and then he took the old ones and repainted them, layer by layer. They can look like layers of felt or fabric, and some of them can be works of up to 1,000 hours.” The paintings are cubic and geometric in design, and if you pick up the book about the exhibition with the same name, you can see the progressions of the layering.
From Nov. 24 through Dec. 14, the museum will display the “Annual Faculty Exhibition,” featuring works by professors in the Post Art Department. “Each year, the faculty exhibition is an open invitation for our faculty members to exhibit their most current works. There will be photographs, paintings, and works on paper. This year will highlight the work of Rick Mills in honor of his retirement from the university,” Applegate said.
“It’s fun to see the professors’ work,” said senior Art major Sofie Hoff. “They often help you, and you [get to] see a glimpse of what they can do. You get more insight [with] what they’re up to. You get more confidence in them, and it’s nice to see for yourself how talented they are. Also, it’s a very diverse art faculty.”
For more information about the Steinberg Museum of Art re- garding events, hours, and upcoming and current shows, go to their Facebook page or visit www.liu.edu/museum. On Sept. 23, the museum will hold an opening reception for the Newell and Abbott exhibitions called “Iced Coffee Common Hour Reception,” from 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. The event is free and open to all students.

After a long summer vacation full of relaxation, stress free nights and parties, it’s that time of the year again to re-adjust ourselves to classes and late night assignments. Two weeks into the fall semester, the Pioneers are getting organized and prepared for their new courses and the semester ahead.
For freshmen, this is the start of a new journey in life, and for many it’s the first time they have ever been away from their families. Senior Psychology major Awais Choudhary believes in finding your identity in college. “I would tell every freshman to participate in as many extracurricular activities as they can, and to join all the clubs that inter- est them because college is the time to discover yourself and to find [out] who you really are,” he said.
Michael W Ellison, an entrepreneur, said “The only way you will find out what truly matters to you is by viewing your college experience as [an] opportunity to take risks, put yourself in uncomfortable situa- tions, and diverge from your peers with the goal to identify the areas of life that you want your life to be about.” Take this advice and make good use of it during your time at Post.
In these first couple of weeks of classes, you will learn more and more about your professors and find where you stand in class. Always try approaching your professors if you need help. Ask them about anything that seems a little off track to you. It always helps to ask rather than just sit back and watch things happen. Many professors love when students come to interact with them. This shows them how interested you are in their class, as well as your willingness to achieve. Try visiting your profes- sors during their office hours, or ask them when they are available to meet with you. Take notes and compare them with a classmate to see if you have got everything down.
Remember, there is always tutoring available if you need help with any class. Ask your professor or the dean of your school so they can let you know when tutoring is available. You can also visit the Writing Center, which is located on the second floor of Humanities across from the Honors Office, to get help with writing a paper.
Having a different roommate each year sometimes becomes a problem, as it’s never easy to share a room with a complete stranger. But, according to senior Business Management major Viren Khuller, this is an opportunity that not many people receive. “I look at having
a new roommate as an opportunity for me to learn about their culture, background, and religion,” he said. “It’s always exciting for me to meet someone new,” Khuller added.
While the journey at Post has just started for many, it is also the beginning of the end for the seniors. Many seniors are emotional about beginning their last year of college. For them, Post has become a second home, and moving away from a home they’ve had for four years will be a big change for them, as they have made many memories.
Adjusting back to school is never easy; it always takes time and effort to get used to new routines and schedules. As the old saying goes, “Nothing worthwhile is easy.” Remember that in the end you will be rewarded for all the hard work, dedication, and sacrifices you have made in college. Don’t make a mistake of waiting until your senior year to start an internship. Start looking up companies that interest you now, and see how you can get an internship there. Just keep in mind to never let your doubts defeat your strength.

As school starts, students from all over the world come to this picturesque and modern campus, LIU Post. I’ve seen Chinese, Japanese, English, Welsh, Indian, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Spanish, Italian students and a student from Australia. This shows the diversification of students at Post, allowing a multi-cultured vibe and atmosphere anywhere you go on campus. I am from London, England and have recently joined this ship of adventure, which is going to sail me through college life in the USA.
In this issue of The Pioneer, I am going to discuss the changes and sacrifices that international students, such as myself, have made in order to pursue this dream of studying in the huge and fascinating country known as America.
First things first: the flight. Flying to America from England is a long journey. This country feel’s humongous, and a six-hour plane journey, which is what my travel time was when I left London Heathrow for JFK, is an extremely tedious process.
During that plane journey, as well as the numb bum and tired legs, the thoughts and feelings I had were extremely mixed. For five minutes I was buzzing with excitement. The transition of this venture is crazy. I look at myself and think, you’re confident, you’ll get to grips with the change easy; and many people that know me would think the same. However, I have actually – believe it or not – found it difficult to settle into the change of moving countries, and I can only imagine how other international students who aren’t as self-assured as I am must feel, and I admire their courage and ability to cope with such hard feelings.
If you are an international student that’s reading this and is actually contemplating throwing in the towel, think again – because I won’t let you. There are so many other people, such as myself, who are going through the same phase, and it is just a phase.
Since I have made the journey “over the pond,” I have spoken to a lot of my teammates on the Pioneers men’s soccer team. Our team is full of international students, who have all had to sacrifice or experience the tough feelings of such big change, in one way or another. One player who I have spoken to quite a lot about the move is 23-year-old Tom Bowen, a graduate student and a pivotal figure in the men’s soccer team success in the 2013 ECC championship campaign. Bowen is from Aberdovey, Wales, and had a tough time at the beginning of his international student life. I found speaking to someone who was on the same “boat” as me last year has helped me feel more settled in, and is helping me to feel more at home in my new surrogate country.
Your comment to what I have just said would be: “But Harry, I haven’t got a team or squad who can help me. Who can I talk to?!” My answer to that would be “yes, you do.” LIU Post has thousands of international students who feel the same exact way as you do, and they need you to share your fears and trepidations of this terrifying and exciting journey through college.
Sororities and fraternities, as well as all the other various clubs, are at your disposal. The front desk at Hillwood has every bit of information available for you. Just ask! Success Coaches are also great, as they’ve been through the college experience already and are ready and willing to help in any way that they can. So make some new friends, and let’s enjoy this electrifying experience together.

Blackboard is a growing platform for colleges and universities in today’s academic world. It is a website where professors and students can unite online in one spot, and creates a central location for homework and assignments. Grades are often posted on blackboard as well as upcoming deadlines for papers. If the professor requires the use of Blackboard for their coursework, it is crucial that their students know how to utilize the site.
The question is do students here at Post find this site useful
or difficult to navigate? Do professors really like using the site to communicate with their students, or do they only use it because the university requires grades to be posted on the site? I personally think Blackboard is useful, and centralizes information for students without confusion.
A number of students and a few professors were asked questions on their feelings about the site. 20 of the 35 students said that they
do, in fact, use Blackboard often, like it, and explained why. Meagan Kolakowski, a senior Dance major, had positive feelings about the
site. “I use it everyday. I feel that it helps me stay organized with my schoolwork,” Kolakowski stated.
Freshmen admitted that they were not entirely familiar with how the site operates yet, but said their professors had mentioned it, and will use it throughout the semester. Upperclassman all have experience with
the website since the majority of teachers do in fact have them use it. “I only use it if my professor makes me [use it] for homework,” said Sarah Hecht, a junior Health Care major.
Though the majority of students seemed to have no issue with Blackboard, a few others have had negative experiences. Jamie Boswell, a senior Musical Theatre major, feels very strongly about the site’s downfalls. Boswell explained, “It’s way too convoluted. I like being told assignments in person, not via Internet. I had to use it once and I really didn’t like it.” A few other Post students felt the same way, and believe that Blackboard makes academic life more difficult.
Dr. Cara Gargano, head of the Theatre, Film and Dance School, had a lot to say: “I don’t use Blackboard at all. The courses I teach
are primarily in-person lessons. They’re very hands-on and require information that can only be taught and learned in person, bodily. It’s inappropriate for my work.”
Though there are mixed feelings about the quickly growing site, it seems as if the majority of our students embrace Blackboard, and use it as a tool to further their academic success. I think once a student is taught how to use the site, there should be no confusion. Blackboard also helps foster a united feeling towards coursework between faculty and students.

The Pioneers (2-2) got some good news last week, as senior forward Eivind Austboe was named East Coast Conference’s Offensive Player of the Week. Austboe scored four goals and added an assist to his stat line in LIU’s dominating 5-0 victory over Adelphi University. With their confidence high, the Pioneers went into Bridgeport, Conn. on Thursday, Sept. 11, to take part in the Purple Knight Classic where they faced off against the Warriors of Merrimack College (4-0). The match needed two overtimes to decide a winner.
The Pioneers struck late in the first half, as freshman forward Jason Lampkin sent a pass to Austboe who found the back of the net, continuing his stellar play. Going into the break, the Pioneers were up 1-0 and held several advantages in shots and corner kicks. The lead and momentum would not last long for the Pioneers, as the Warriors tied the match in the 62nd minute off a Post turnover. Less than three minutes after the Merrimack goal, the Green and Gold had a great scoring opportunity. Lampkin sent another pass, this time to junior midfielder Per Forgaard, who scored a goal, giving the visitors a 2-1 advantage.
Both teams played aggressively, resulting in yellow cards for both sides, and a crucial red card for the Pioneers. After the red card, junior defender Julio Leon Garcia was awarded a free kick, and was able to net a shot, tying the game at two apiece.
The scoring halted for the rest of regulation and the first overtime. A second overtime was needed, and in the extra time, the Warriors were able to capitalize. Senior midfielder Ignacio Farias scored the game winning goal in the 105th minute to send the Warriors home with the victory.
The Pioneers dominated the game early with leads in shots, shots on goal, and corner kicks. As the game continued, the Warriors limited the Pioneer opportunities by not allowing a single shot in either overtime period, putting a stranglehold on the game. The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Sept. 13, when they took the field against the Bears of Bloomfield College (0-3).
The Pioneers started to build momentum early, and scored the first goal of the game at the 1:38 mark. Graduate student forward Dale McDonald weaved his way from midfield through the Bear defense, and netted the goal to start the scoring. The Pioneers dominated the ball in the first half, getting triple the shots and beating the Bears on 50/50 opportunities. The Green and Gold added to their lead late in the first half when freshman midfielder Harry Pearse found Forgaard off a corner kick. The Pioneers took their 2-0 lead into halftime.
Early in the second half, the Pioneers were keeping the pressure on the Bears with five shots in the first 10 minutes. One of those shots came from Forgaard, who picked up the loose ball off a corner kick and found the back of the net for his second goal of the match. The Pioneers went up 3-0.
The result on the scoreboard was a direct correlation to the shots for each side. The Pioneers totaled 26 shots while the Bears totaled
just four. Head coach Andreas Lindberg and his team return to action on Wednesday, Sept. 17 when they take on the Marauders from the University of Pennsylvania at Millersville. Kickoff is set for 4 p.m.

On Fri. Sept. 12, the LIU Post women’s volleyball team emerged victorious, as they fought hard on day one of the Wheeling Jesuit Invitational, in Wheeling, West Virginia. At the end of the day, the Pioneers managed to win both matches, in four sets against the Dolphins from Le Moyne College, and in five sets against the Rams of Shepherd University.
Freshman middle blocker Heather Ball gave the Pioneers a great start to the match against Le Moyne, with five kills and three blocks. Determined not to let their guard down after Ball’s entry, the Pioneers took the first set with a count of 25-18. However, in the second set, the Dolphins managed a comeback, and won the set by a score of 27-29. In the third set, both teams were knotted at four apiece, until the Green and Gold went on a run of 21-3 to claim the crucial set. The Pioneers only needed one more set for the win to move on, and despite the early score of 10-8, they came out victorious with a final tally of 25-12.
In their second match against the Rams, the Pioneers did not achieve a first set victory like they did earlier that day. Instead, the Pioneers lost the opening set 21-25, before regaining their composure to win the next two, with scores of 25-22 and 25-11. With back and forth results and the Rams taking the fourth set, both teams were tied at two sets apiece. Back-to-back kills from senior middle blocker Heather Adams and junior middle hitter Melissa Hansen kept the pressure on the Rams and helped lift the Pioneers to a five set victory.
Next on the schedule for the Green and Gold were the Eagles from Lock Haven University on Sat. Sept. 13, where the Pioneers claimed the first set with a five-point lead. In the following sets, the Pioneers suffered a two-point-set loss, before rebounding to overpower their opponent, and win the final two sets of the match. In the final game, the Pioneers tried to keep it close with the Cardinals from Wheeling Jesuit University, but lost the match in three sets, losing each set by at least 10 points.
Head Coach Shellane Ogoshi and the girls will be back in action on Sept. 16, where they will face their Northern Boulevard rival, NYIT, at the East Coast Conference. The game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.

In the LIU Post women’s field hockey team season opener, on the back of a 6-0 thrashing of local rivals, Dowling College, the team dished up another huge defeat; this time to the Penmen of Southern New Hampshire. The contest in Manchester, N.H., on Saturday saw junior forward Keliann Margiotta follow up her three goal performance versus Dowling, with an even more impressive four goal haul, her first after just 4:46 in the first half. After Margiotta’s early goal, the Pioneers dominated, assisting the junior forward with three more chances, which she would convert.
The Green and Gold went into the break 4-0 with their opponents yet to have a shot on goal. The second half was much of the same, as sophomores Melissa Quintanilla, Lauren Adamusik, and Steph Mocerino also got in on the action, notching another three points. Despite the large score-line, the Penmen were lucky to finish the day with only a seven- goal deficit, as the Pioneers finished the contest with 38 shots, 19 on target, making it a busy afternoon for Penman goalkeepers Cassandra Nickerson and Jill Piacitelli.
Margiotta reflected on the win saying, “It was great to score four and help the team to our second win of the season.” With 13 goals in two games and two clean sheets, it looks as though the Pioneers are going to continue their success from last season, and be a force to be reckoned with in the quest for an NCAA Division II title.
When asked about the Pioneers’ thundering start to the 2014 season, Margiotta said, “We couldn’t have asked for a better start and our team is strong. We have a strong core from last season, and our recruits have improved us even more. I believe we can keep up this pace and show how much we want the [championship] title this year.”
The Pioneers are in action again on Friday, Sept. 19. Another trip up to New Hampshire will have them go toe-to-toe with Saint Anslem at 2 p.m.

After the cancelled contest at Holy Trinity Univeristy in Penn., due to inclement weather on Thursday, Sept. 11, the women’s soccer team was eager to secure a win when they visited Nyack over the weekend. Since the Philadelphia route was not scheduled as a conference game, no make-up date has yet been set, and the game is likely not to be played at all. “It’s bad, because we probably would have won that game,” sophomore goalkeeper Hrafnhildur Agnarsdóttir said.
At Nyack, the Pioneers came out strong and outshot their opponents 31-1; however, with 12 consecutive saves recorded, the Nyack keeper kept the game tied for a long while. Pioneer junior forward Susanne Vistnes fired away 12 shots, but could not find the net that afternoon. The Post side started to get frustrated, but kept attacking. Finally, with eight minutes left on the board, Vistnes stepped forward in the playmaker role and found the feet of freshman forward Sarah Kang. With a one-touch-goal, Kang put the Green and Gold in the lead and scored the first ever goal of her college career.
Between the two posts on the other side of the field, Agnarsdóttir only had to react once, as the Warriors from Nyack did not fight well enough to get through the disciplined Pioneer defense. As a result, Agnarsdóttir recorded her second clean sheet of the season and the Pioneers won 1-0.
Head Coach Mark Dawson and his team will hit the road again on Wednesday, Sept. 17, for a 3 p.m. clash in Manchester, N.H., to take on Southern New Hampshire University. After that, the East Coast Conference is scheduled to begin. The Pioneers will face Saint Thomas Aquinas College on Saturday, Sept. 20, with a kick-off slated for noon on the new Pioneer soccer park.

The Pioneers found themselves trailing
the New Haven Chargers 33-31 with only 1:46 remaining in the game. The fans were on the edge of their seats, as the Green and Gold were moving the ball down the field at a quick pace. After getting the ball down to the one-yard line, red- shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino crossed the goal-line for the game-winning touchdown as the LIU Post Pioneers (1-1) survived New Haven (0-2) 38-33 on Sat. Sept. 13th, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
Earlier in the possession, the Green and Gold faced 4th-and-5 with the game on the line, but Laurino pulled off some fourth quarter magic as he found junior tight end Sean Binckes, which was followed up by a one-yard touchdown five plays later to complete the comeback.
On the Pioneers second possession of the contest, Laurino docked a 13-play, 66-yard drive, leading to a game-tying two-yard scramble by the senior quarterback. Earlier in the drive, Laurino broke the record for most passing yards in school history. He surpassed Rob Blunt (2002-2005; 6,631) to become the all-time leader.
The Pioneers gained control of the game after red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti got an interception to set up the offense for another touchdown, as Laurino hooked up with red-shirt sophomore wideout Kamron Palmer on a 20-yard strike to set a 17-7 lead. It didn’t take long for New Haven to respond as they piled up 20 unanswered points to regain the lead 27-17, thanks to a couple of Pioneers miscues. However, LIU narrowed the deficit to three with a 10-yard rushing touchdown by Laurino, making it a 27-24 game heading into the 4th quarter.
After the Chargers added to their lead, making the score 30-24, they had the opportunity to make it a two possession game until kicker Anthony Greenfield had his 26-yard field goal kick hit off the left upright. The offense came back out fired up, as the Green and Gold consistently moved down the field after three Laurino completions got the Pioneers into Charger territory.
Moments later, red-shirt sophomore receiver Shane Hubbard hauled in a 20-yard touchdown, giving the Pioneers a slim 31-30 advantage. New Haven followed up with a field goal at the 1:46 mark, giving them the lead right back, going up 33-31. However, the defense did their job, preventing the Chargers from finding the end-zone.
Laurino finished the game going 32-of-50 for 296 yards and two touchdowns. Laurino was also smooth on the ground, rushing for 59 yards to go with three scores. He finished the game with five touchdowns total.
Red-shirt sophomore Michael Williams had another solid day on the ground with 13 rushes for 66 yards. Williams also tied for the team-high in catches with nine for 55 yards. Hubbard also racked up nine receptions for 90 yards and a touchdown. Junior defensive back Jhaleel Oswald led the squad with 11 tackles.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers will commence a three game road trip as NE- 10 rival Merrimack awaits next Sat. Sept. 20, in North Andover, Mass. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m.
