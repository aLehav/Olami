Raphaelina Marti, a senior English and Psychology major, held a fundraiser collecting money for Together We Rise, a non-profit organization based in California, which aims to improve the lives of foster care children across America, On Wednesday, Feb. 26, during common hour.

Marti, a student in the Honors Program, is an intern this semester with Together We Rise. The organization is managing the Sweet Cases Project, which will provide duffel bags and/or suitcases to foster youth when they first enter the system. This will replace the two trash bags that they now receive to move their possessions.
In providing foster children with duffel bags filled with various items (including toiletries and stuffed animals), Together We Rise hopes it will allow foster children to build selfesteem and have something to call their own.
More information on Together We Rise and the Sweet Cases Project can be found on www.togetherwerise.org or projects.kindsnacks.com/project/sweet-cases.
Additionally, a donation box is located in the Honors Program offices of Humanities Hall, and anyone who donates will be entered into a raffle to receive a Together We Rise t-shirt.
“I’m sympathetic with these kids, and even though I’ve had my share of troubles, I’ve persisted, and now I’m an honors student in college. I want to use that power to help [those in need],” Marti said.
Marti emphasized why this cause is important for college students. “We live in a society where most of us get whatever we want, and we rarely stop and realize that there are people in need. We need to develop an understanding of this issue now, as young adults, in order to create a foundation for the future.”
“We’re trying to raise $500 by the end of March to contribute to the Sweet Cases Project. We’re asking people to help however they can, and get involved and spread the word in order for this goal to be achieved,” Marti said.
“The idea for this project came from my internship with the organization,” she explained. “They give me assignments to carry out here at school, and I work with Dr. Katherine Ahern of the English department to brainstorm potential events to raise funds.”
“What I love about this organization’s mission is that they are dedicated to providing foster children tangibly with one small thing a piece of luggage,” said Ahern, who is Marti’s internship advisor. “However, the underlying notion is that in giving a foster child a piece of luggage, they are also providing that child with a sense of self, dignity as an individual, and perhaps greater confidence.”
Marti is still in the process of raising $500. The last fundraiser will be held on Monday, March 17, in Hillwood, during common hour. Marti will be set-up in the commons with a donation box for students to contribute.
“All children deserve a happy life,” said Dr. Joan Digby, director of the LIU Post Honors Program and Merit Fellowship. “Raphaelina’s effort on behalf of children in foster care is compassionate work for an excellent organization that will give children a bright future. Everyone should support this effort. We can all afford to help children who are most in need. I am proud of her efforts.”

In Nov. 2013, the Village of Old Brookville’s zoning board approved the construction permit to start building LIU Post’s new stadium facility. The permit approval process has delayed the building of Post’s new stadium since Aug. 2012, when the school planned to start the renovation. The zoning board is no longer skeptical about the height requirements and the noise factor, according to Bryan Collins, the director of Athletics & Recreation and head Football coach of the Pioneers.

Before the official renovations started, a concept needed to be illustrated. “There is a conceptual phase that you go through to get a sense of what your goals are. You then go through a process of selecting an architect, then the detail design process, the bidding process and finally the construction phase,” said William Kirker, director of LIU Post’s Facilities department.
The first stage of construction began on Nov. 18. “The first phase was to tear down this side of the bleachers, [home side, closest to Pratt],” Collins said. “It will seat about 3,600 on the home side.”
The new seating renovations on the home side will be completed by the end of April through the first week of May, according to Collins. Soon after the home side is finished, construction will begin on the fencing and landscaping. In addition, the press box will contain two areas for filming and VIP seating. With work starting in the summer months, the walkway and press box will be completed by Fall 2014. Although the whole stadium will not be completed by the fall, spectators will be able to sit in the newly renovated home seating area for the 2014 football season.
Collins and the Athletic department started a fundraising campaign in order to meet the estimated stadium price of slightly more than four million dollars. The fundraiser is called the Pioneer Spirit Campaign, and has attracted alumni and corporate support. “We have raised over two and a half million dollars,” Collins said. “The majority of the funds raised were through our alumni.”
In November, the university promised it would cover the rest of the estimated expenses, and discussions took place about the possibility that the naming rights could be sold to a corporate entity. “Right now, we’re currently in the process of securing a corporate sponsorship in order to meet that final mark,” Collins added. An announcement, according to Collins, will be made on March 26 with regard to a corporate sponsorship being secured. However, Collins stated he has no knowledge of the specific sponsor.
The old stadium that was built in 1960 was falling apart, according to Collins. “The condition of the stadium is not up to code. There are areas where you can slip through with the rusting, and that was a main concern for the university,” he added.
“Stony Brook built a beautiful stadium, Hofstra built a beautiful stadium, Adelphi built a new stadium; it’s about keeping up,” he said.
“The new stadium has been a long time coming, when you think back on when we started discussions, and all the work our student athletes did to get the administration on board and move forward,” he added.
“It’s nice to see changes on campus, not only here, but to walk into Hillwood Commons and to walk into the library and see all the change,” Collins said.

This spring semester, LIU Post has been hosting new events for students on campus. The goal is to increase school participation for on-campus activities. Students should expect to see more new programs and initiatives in the upcoming semester, according to Michael Berthel, associate director at the Office of Student Life and Leadership Development. “We are constantly evaluating how to improve the campus life experience,” he said.
In addition, there has been a lot of effort to increase weekend life on campus. “Our ultimate goal is always to provide students with a diverse and vibrant selection of programs and activities to participate in on campus,” said Berthel.
Upcoming events are posted on the LIU website and on various flyers throughout campus. According to Berthel, each week, a schedule is published with a comprehensive list of all programs and events happening on the weekend. In addition, weekly events, club meetings, activities, and movies playing in the cinema are always posted on the bulletin board located in Hillwood Commons. The board is updated every week. Many students do not realize that there is a university calendar that lists all campus events that can be viewed at www.liu.edu/ post/campusevents.
“I have never been to an event on campus,” said Savera Kumar, a junior Accounting major. “Honestly, I don’t really hear about things that happen here on campus and I don’t know anyone who goes to the events. I commute so I wouldn’t come back to school on a weekend,” she added.
“My freshman year I went to the fashion show at the Tilles Center and really enjoyed it,” said Ashley Gordon, a junior undeclared major. “I would go to something with my friends that I thought would be fun, I think homecoming is probably everyone’s favorite event on campus.”
LIU Post has been planning new and different events this semester in order to increase student involvement, and help students support the school more. “We have heard a lot of positive feedback from students about the new programs and we are also seeing that reflected in an increase in the amount of students attending events on campus,” said Berthel. “The renovation of the Gold Coast Cinema, and the addition of the sports bar, The End Zone, has created new opportunities for creative programs both on the weekends and during the week,” Berthel said.
Karonline Onsrud, a junior Broadcasting major, is an international student who dorms on campus. “I don’t attend every event, but I frequently go to certain ones that I like,” she said. “I’ve been to the movie nights which are pretty good.”
It seems that the likelihood of a student attending an event depends on whether they are a commuter student or dorm on campus. The commuters seem to be less likely to attend on-campus events, especially those that occur on weekends. Some students expressed interest in attending on-campus events, or activities they thought would be fun.
“We think it’s a really exciting time to be on campus at LIU Post,” Berthel said. Student Life encourages any students who have ideas or suggestions for new programs to let them know.

The possibility of even more snowstorms has been the topic of discussion, as the winter season slowly dwindles to an end. This 2014 winter season has brought plenty of snow throughout the East Coast, and has caused commuters everywhere to roll their eyes at just the thought of more snow. Students at LIU Post have had a somewhat bittersweet relationship with this year’s snowstorms, as they have presented them with plenty of days off from school, but are also causing students to make up class days they have missed. So how have students spent their time during this semester’s snow days?
Many students found themselves stuck in a rut as they spent more time indoors, and less time being active within the campus community. “I hate all the snow days we’ve had because I find myself bored here on campus,” said Zoey Zhu, a graduate Business Administration student. “Hillwood closes for the day, and everything else closes early. I feel like I have to rush to eat, or not eat at all.”
When the university shut down during the snowstorms, many facilities on campus closed early, or did not open at all, so that workers would have the opportunity to get home safely. Hillwood Commons was closed during most of the storms, and on days in which the snowstorms arrived later in the evenings, Hillwood Commons closed earlier than its usual hours. Winnick dining hall on campus was open to students during snowstorms until 8 p.m. This gave students the opportunity to get their meals throughout the day.
Students who live off campus may have had an easier time finding things to do during the snow days, and may not have felt as though they were snowed in. “I have actually been enjoying the snow days,” said Andria Lynn Osler, a senior Public Relations major. “They have given me more time to focus on my senior project and since it’s my last semester; I’m enjoying the nice break now and then.”
Both commuter students and students living on campus have found various ways to cope with being stuck indoors during the snow days. Whether they are hanging out in their dorm rooms, at home working on their schoolwork, or searching for a nearby location to eat, students are spending the time resting in the comfort of their own environment. Although students may love the snow days, spring break is approaching fast, and another snowstorm appears to be the last thing on their minds.

Did you know that this past week was National Eating Disorders Awareness Week? Eating disorders are more common than you think, especially on college campuses. The most common eating disorders are Anorexia Nervosa, characterized by severe restriction of food intake leading to weight loss of more than 15 percent normal body weight, Bulimia Nervosa, characterized by compulsive self-induced vomiting or other compensatory behaviors after eating, and Binge Eating Disorder, where sufferers will consume large amounts of food without compensating, while feeling out of control during binge eating episodes.
Individuals who suffer from eating disorders often feel anxious and depressed about food, their weight, and about having an eating disorder in general, among other things. While there are many factors that can lead to the development of an eating disorder, disordered eating habits are prevalent and something to be aware of.
Most of us face pressure to lose weight, keep fit, or stay a certain size, and our eating behavior is greatly influenced by external sources. While dieting and monitoring calorie intake is a great way to keep tabs on how much food is needed to maintain, lose, or gain weight, the practice of mindful eating is rarely discussed.
Mindful eating involves paying close attention to the physiological sensations of hunger and fullness, as well as your mental and emotional states before, during, and after eating. Combined with a proper diet, using mindful eating techniques is one way to get in touch with yourself, and perhaps pinpoint the situations and stressors that could lead to some not-so-healthy eating behaviors, such as under- eating or binge eating during times of stress.
Repeatedly engaging in under-eating or binge eating can sometimes lead to a full-blown eating disorder. It’s important to focus on what food is intended to do: nourish our bodies and help fuel our activities, instead of using food as something to be controlled or turned to for comfort. Talking to a close friend, a trusted professor, counselor, or psychological professional is the next step to take if you think your eating behavior is starting to affect other aspects of your life.
So, how does one practice mindful eating in everyday situations? Before you eat, ask yourself what you’re really in the mood for, while considering the healthfulness of your choice. If possible, choose something that contains whole grains, vegetables, lean protein, fresh fruit, low-fat dairy, or a combination of some, or all, of the above.
Next, make sure that you’re eating because you are indeed hungry, and not bored, tired, sad, anxious, etc. While you’re eating, focus on the taste and texture of your food. Chew slowly, and feel the food fill your stomach. The closer you pay attention to your body during eating, the easier it is to gauge your satiety. Finally, do not feel compelled to eat all of your food just because it’s there. Respect your body and its feelings of fullness instead of forcing down food.
After eating a meal mindfully, you may feel much more centered and calm compared to eating a meal while distracted.
“No amount of calorie counting can tell you when you’re full or hungry, so it’s important to also use your own signals when you’re monitoring your diet,” said Michelle LaBozzetta, a Nutrition major.
Mindful eating appeals to those who have become frustrated with constant worry or anxiety around calorie-counting. “The ideas of mindful eating make dieting and living a healthy lifestyle so much more safe, effective, and enjoyable. It lets you look past the negativity of food, and helps you start to appreciate it,” said Heather DiBiasi, a Nutrition major.
Being mindful of how our emotional states influence our eating is a useful skill to have, and is helpful in overcoming disordered eating habits. Society is constantly told to try crazy fad diets and look a certain way, but it’s also important to trust yourself around food, and respect your body without trying to reach a weight that may be unreasonable for your body frame. Living a healthy lifestyle is all about balance, so staying active and eating a well-rounded diet, along with keeping mindful eating strategies, is an ideal way to stay healthy both physically and mentally.

College students deal with stress every day. From paper deadlines and tuition bills, to balancing school with a job, it’s difficult for students to relax. A 2008 article from ‘Mental Health’ on nbcnews.com, claims that one in five undergraduates are constantly stressed. “Most students in U.S. colleges are just plain stressed out, according to a poll of undergraduates from coast to coast. Everyone deals with stress in his or her own way, but how do students on our own campus fend off mounting anxiety?
Some students, including James Carroll, a junior Information Management Technology major, turn to friends or video games. “I’m not stressed often, but when I am, it is normally when I don’t understand an assignment, which is usually once a week,” Carroll said.
Other students deal with the stress of school by good organization and thoroughly planning ahead. For Amanda Gaimaro,
a sophomore Speech Pathology major, setting dates in advance helps greatly. “My calendar is my best friend, [I’m] constantly writing notes and organizing my planner. I’m stressed out often, but not always. Some weeks are better or worse than others. It depends on how much work I have,” she said.
For students who can’t yet find a way to relieve themselves of stress, Gaimaro added, “do your work ahead of time. Never wait until the last minute. This semester I’m really working on doing assignments weeks before they’re due.”
Music and crafts are helpful tools for some students. Susie Kelly, a junior Fine Arts major, uses music to drive away her stress. “I cope with stress mainly by listening to music. My favorite band always calms me down, no matter what’s bothering me. I also crochet. The repetitive motions really help to soothe my nerves, and by the time my thoughts are sorted, I’ve made an accessory,” Kelly said.
For Kelly, stress comes and goes. “I don’t feel stress that often, but when I do, it feels like I’ve been hit by a tidal wave. It usually comes when I find out I’m behind on assignments or I get overwhelmed with work,” she said. “I would recommend taking up a craft; even if it’s something small like crocheting or a paint by numbers. Sitting down for a small amount of time and doing a repetitive craft, or sorting your colors, will help relieve stress and allow you to organize your thoughts.”
Just doing nothing is the solution for others. Vanessa Gonzalez, a freshman Music Education major, sometimes likes to sit around and do nothing in order to relieve her mind of stress.
Gonzalez said that the most stressful time for her is from a few weeks before midterms until finals week. “At that point, every one of my classes demands more work, and I have that on top of music classes and practicing my instrument to keep up with my professor’s demands.” Gonzalez recommends finding some time within each week to do something enjoyable to forget about the stress. “Remember that it’s okay to sit for a bit and do nothing. Only for a short period, though, otherwise that turns into procrastination,” she said.
Stress is natural and certain stress can even motivate people into doing something they’ve been putting off, such as a paper. However, students faced with crippling stress, should take care of that stress, by meditating or some other stress reliever, before diving headfirst into a stack of papers.

On Wednesday, Feb. 26, the Lady Pioneers (21-5) took the court against the Molloy Lions (14-13) at the Pratt Recreation Center. The thrilling contest needed an overtime period in order to decide the winner. LIU came out victorious, pulling out the 64-57 win.
The first half was a tightly contested battle, with both teams giving it all they had. The back and forth battle featured four ties, with neither team leading the other by more than seven. It seemed that the Lions gained some momentum
with just under seven minutes remaining in the half when sophomore forward Ally Leftridge made a lay-up to give the Lions an 18-17 lead. That lead was pushed to seven with a little over three minutes until the half. The Pioneers cut the deficit to two by halftime with key baskets from junior guard Chelsea Williams.

Williams was the high scorer in the first half with 14 points, while the Lions were led by junior forward Megan Lonergan. The Pioneers were held to just 28 percent shooting from the field in the first half, but they made up for it by getting to the line 10 times. Both teams were uneasy with the ball as they combined for 16 turnovers, eight for each squad.
The Lions controlled the early part of the second half, as they added to their two point lead with a few baskets,
elevating it to seven points. The Pioneers, needing a jolt of energy, responded with a 16-1 run led by sophomore center
Nyasia Davis, who scored six points during that span. The lead expanded to eight, but a Lions’ response tied the game
with over six minutes left. With under a minute remaining, the Pioneers led by one and missed free throws proved
pivotal. The Pioneers missed three down the stretch and a basket by the Lions tied the game at 50. A game winning shot attempt by senior guard Kiki Sears did not go, and an extra period was needed.
In the overtime, the trio of Williams, Sears, and senior guard Alexis Peters combined for all 14 points. The Pioneers never trailed in the overtime, and their defense was suffocating, forcing the Lions to shoot 14 percent from the field. For the game, Williams finished with 24 points and 10 rebounds, while Peters accumulated 15 points, 11 boards, and five assists.
Not to be outdone, senior forward Shayna Gatling grabbed 10 rebounds and scored 13 points. The Pioneers had their first overtime game and their first game in which three players finished with double-doubles.
The Lady Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, March 1, when they wrapped up their regular season in Flushing N.Y. as they hit the hardwood against the Queens College Knights (19-7). In their previous meeting in January, the Green and Gold won by a score of 74-64.
The Pioneers already clinched the number one seed and home court in the ECC tournament, so this was just a warm up game for the Lady Pioneers, as they had nothing to lose. The Pioneers earned their 14th double digit victory of the season, showing how dominant they are. The Pioneers were led in scoring by Williams, who poured in 21, while Peters, Sears, Gatling all scored in double figures as well. The Pioneers were able to get off 16 more shots than the Knights.
The Pioneer defense was stellar as usual, as they forced 31 turnovers and turned them into 28 points. The 84-63 final was the cherry on top of a terrific Lady Pioneer regular season.
For the season, the Pioneers outscored their opponents by an average of 10 points. Their superior scoring translated to their statistics from the field and three point line, as well as they shot a higher percentage there then their opponents on average. In almost every category, the Pioneers beat their opponents, explaining their outstanding record. Williams was the average leading scorer, posting 19.2 points a game, and she was also second in the ECC in scoring. Peters averaged 13.4 points and 5 assists, while senior forward Dominique Pagan was the team’s leading shot blocker with over a block a game. Gatling was number one in the ECC in field goal percentage, as she shot over 60 percent for the season.
The Lady Pioneers earned the number one seed, a first round bye, and home court advantage in the ECC Tournament, and will await the winner of the game featuring Molloy and NYIT. The team posted a 3-1 record against the two squads this season. The Lady Pioneers will play their next game on Thursday, March 6, at the Pratt Recreation Center.

Now that the 2013-14 college basketball season is coming to an end, it’s an opportune time to reflect on the LIU Post men’s basketball team’s only graduating senior, Vaughn Allen.

From game winning buckets to rim-rocking dunks, there was no shortage of sensational highlights by Allen. Allen, a Broadcasting major, was born in Bronx, New York, and currently resides in Mount Vernon, New York. In fall 2010, Allen found a home-away-from home at LIU Post. The experience was nerve-racking—Allen was the only freshman among the team’s returning players. It was a rough experience for Allen because he felt that the coaches and players were being really hard on him. However, he knew that he had to earn his stripes on the court and allow his talent to speak for him.
He fully absorbed all of the constructive criticism because he knew that they were all there to guide him and never to discourage him.
The journey of being a student athlete is easily compared with taking on two jobs or even the equivalent of double majoring. Allen explained that throughout his first year as a student athlete, it was very difficult to manage his schoolwork and social life.
Over the course of his four years on the LIU Post men’s basketball team, Allen has so far averaged 17.2 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 1.2 steals per game. His experience on-and-off the court was an up-and-down roller coaster.
However, with the guidance of Christopher Casey, LIU Post head coach during the fall 2012- spring ‘13; Erik Smiles, LIU Post head coach during the fall 2013-spring ‘14; and Devine Smith, LIU assistant coach during the fall 2013-spring ‘14, Allen has been able to gradually mature as a player and as a man.
Specifically, Allen mentioned how Smith would take him to church every Sunday to keep him motivated and spiritually grounded. He learned to control his temper in games and has acquired the ability to always stay humbled.

The Pioneer (TP): How does it feel to be the team’s only senior?
Vaughn Allen (VA): I feel like I have a lot of pressure on me. I know everyone looks highly towards me as captain. I have to carry myself in a calm, cool, and professional manner to display the qualities of a role model to all of the lower classmen.
TP: What are you going to miss most about being on the team and at LIU Post?
VA: I am going to miss the student athlete experience. Specifically, I’m going to miss my teammates, practices, and mandatory study hours. I am most definitely going to miss all of my coaches and their constructive criticism. Coming from high school, we obviously do not have dorms so when entering LIU Post, I feel like I have more freedom while experiencing dorm life.
TP: Talk about one of your favorite times on the team and at LIU Post?
VA: In my freshman year season, I experienced my first championship game. We played our rivals, the Purple Knights of Bridgeport, away in Connecticut. We were both considered the best in our conference. I was nervous because five games before, our starting player had gotten hurt, which forced me to step up and become starter. I had a do-or-die mentality. It was either we give it our all and win, or we allow them to get the best of us and lose. I fed off the energy of my returning teammates and we prevailed. My favorite time at LIU Post was when I went out with my teammates. We went to a nearby club called Dublins. It was a great bonding experience as a freshman and I was really excited to go.
TP: What are your plans after graduation?
VA: I am going to weigh my options and see what opportunities are given to me when my season is over and go from there. I have an open mind about my future, and I’m going to take my time on what’s going to be my next move.
TP: If you could have a conversation with young Vaughn, what would you say to him?
VA: Don’t walk out of practice! Your coaches are there to motivate you towards bigger and better things to help the program flourish. Always believe in your abilities and work hard, and always stay humble and grounded. Your success is the team’s success.
TP: If you could go back and change anything during you time here at LIU Post, what would it be?
VA: When I first got into college, I had a cocky attitude because I allowed the comments of everyone mold my perception of my basketball potential. People were telling me how good I was and I was not humble. I started to listen to my coaches more because I felt that I was hurting myself more than helping myself because I had a closed mind to events in my life.
TP: Now that you’re done, what advice can you give to the team?
VA: Always stay humble and always stay positive. There will always be adversities surrounding you all in life. When adversity hits, that’s when the true character of a man shows. Never get down on yourself, and always believe in yourself and the team. Always follow the systems of the coaches because they are coaches for a reason. They are going to lead you all to positive things and championships.

On Wednesday Feb. 26, the LIU Post men’s basketball team took the time to recognize their lone senior, Vaughn Allen, as the Pioneers hosted the Molloy Lions at the Pratt Recreation Center.
Senior night proved successful for the men, as they defeated the opposition with a final score of 64-58, finishing their last home game with a win. The Pioneers led with a comfortable 10 points entering the intermission, the score standing at 33-23.
Although Molloy aggressively returned to the court for the second half, rattling off a 12-2 streak to go up 35-33 in just over four minutes, the Lions eventually fell short to the Pioneers. In response to the opposition’s performance, Allen took advantage of his night and reacted by equalizing the score to 35-all. The two squads exchanged five leads before the green and gold pulled away, finalizing the score with a six point advantage.
After the game, the Pioneers’ senior had mixed emotions about his final game on home turf. “I’m happy to represent my team as the only senior and leader. I was really pumped to play my last home game as a Pioneer,” Allen said. “The fans were great and they made my senior night an unforgettable moment. It was more than I ever expected.”
Despite their impressive performance, the men had to refocus for their next game, which took place three days later on Saturday, March 1 against the Queens College Knights at Fitzgerald Gymnasium in Flusing, N.Y. Looking for revenge after a heartbreaking overtime defeat on Jan. 25 against the Knights and in front of their home crowd, the Pioneers experienced deja-vu as they lost, 61- 56, in their 2013-14 regular season finale.
Even though it may not have been a fairytale regular season ending for the team, the Pioneers have now earned the number four seed in the East Coast Conference Championship (ECC), and thus will host fifth-seeded St. Thomas Aquinas in an opening-round on Wednesday March 5 at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y. The men intend to repeat their two victories against the Spartans this season. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m.
