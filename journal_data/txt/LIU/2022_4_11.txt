Countries are putting an end to their COVID-19 restrictions despite coronavirus cases reaching record numbers in many of these countries. Students question what’s in store for the future as Chief Operating Officer Joseph Schaefer announced that LIU would no longer require a mask mandate in accordance with CDC recommendations and Gov. Hochul lifting mask requirements for schools in New York as of March 2. 
Sophomore pre-veterinary and veterinary technology major Kaitlyn Cucolo has concerns about the lifting of coronavirus restrictions. Cucolo, like many, was personally affected by COVID-19.
“Back in December, around finals time, I actually tested positive for COVID. At first, I was in shock because I always wear a mask and social distance so I was confused,” Cucolo said.
Cucolo had mild symptoms, but she feared spreading COVID-19 to her mother who has a weakened immune system. 
“COVID is not eradicated yet and it’s still out there,” Cucolo said. “I agree that with the proper vaccines being given, people can have a little leeway. But still, keep in mind that not everything is back to normal yet.”
Despite an abundance of caution from many, the virus continues to spread and mutate. No matter what part of the world is being affected by COVID-19, there is always a possibility the virus will find its way back to America. Cucolo is not hopeful for the future. 
“There’s probably going to be another strand. No matter how many people get their vaccines, there’s still people who are against getting vaccinated,” Cucolo said.
Cucolo believes this lack of vaccinations will cause another outbreak of the virus and she fears going into isolation again. 
Junior art therapy major Olivia Greiss understands the risks of COVID-19, but is also ready for the world to return to a state of normalcy. She has occasional COVID-19 safety concerns, but for the most part she is able to go about her day without fear. She believes there should be a balance between safety and security. 
“People should be able to be cautious and still have freedom. No one should be locked in their country,” Greiss said.
Greiss notes that mandates keep changing which just adds to uncertainty and confusion. Moreso, it’s hard for her to grasp the full extent of COVID-19 in Europe since she isn’t there. 
“It’s hard to see what’s in store for the future, especially since mandates are continually changing,” Greiss said.
Sophomore biology major Maja Toth is from Budapest Hungary and has experienced COVID-19 hardships firsthand. During the height of COVID-19, she was a senior in high school who was studying abroad.
“I didn’t get to go home for the summer because I was scared they wouldn’t let me back in the country for college. I had a bunch of friends who had trouble getting into [America] and I didnt want to risk it,” Toth said.
Because of this, Toth did not get to see her family for almost 2 years.
“Travel restrictions are still very specific in some countries and constantly changing, making international travel frustrating and difficult,” Toth said.
This past summer Hungary lifted COVID-19 restrictions despite covid cases rising. Tourism improved but that decision put the safety of many at risk. 
“I think the government ignoring the health and safety of the people for the benefit of the economy is definitely a concern. My brother’s school has shut down multiple times because of high Covid cases since wearing masks are not mandatory in primary and high schools. The last few months the number of cases have been pretty high, but people keep getting vaccinated and getting boosters, so as of right now the situation is slowly getting better,” Toth said.
Toth believes both masks and travel restrictions will keep going back and forth in countries as COVID-19 numbers continue to change.

At 5:07 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 24, Russian troops launched a series of missile attacks in and around Kyiv, Ukraine, leading to what has become the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II. Almost immediately, airports, hospitals and schools were attacked. Since then, Russian forces have besieged five cities: Chernihiv, Sumy, Konotop, Kharkiv, and Mariupol. Many larger cities have been shelled, and millions of Ukranians have evacuated their homes. 
Ukraine is a Texas-sized, slavic country that is in-between Europe and Russia. The Eastern-European country is well known for diversity in its landscape, but over the last few weeks, the land that was once known to be beautiful is now surrounded and covered with military and artillery. 
The continuing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine started when the Soviet Union split up in 1991 at the end of the Cold War. Ukraine gained its independence from  the Soviet Union. From late 2013 to early 2014, protests that went on for months in Kyiv, due to the former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, backing out of signing a political association and free trade agreement with the European Union (EU). Instead, he signed a deal with Russia, which led to a lot of Ukrainians expressing their anger through violence. 
In February of 2014, Yanukovych was voted to be removed from office by the Ukrainian parliament. The deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, Melinda Haring, told Al Jazeera news that before Russia had even invaded Ukraine, it would  continue to see Ukraine as their property. 
“Part of what we’re seeing here and part of what we’re seeing since 2013, is Moscow does not want to let Ukraine go,”  Haring said.
After Yanokovych was dismissed from office in early 2014, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s decision to send Russian forces into Crimea, a peninsula that had been a part of Ukraine since the 1950s, was considered unpredictable. There was a referendum in Crimea, which was a clear violation of Ukrainian constitution and international law, but the Russian-speaking residents of the land voted to join Russia, so Putin annexed the peninsula. 
In April 2014, pro-Russian separatists began to take territory and control, through fighting in two areas, naming them “The People’s Republic of Luhansk and Donetsk.” These two areas are in the western part of Ukraine, bordering Russia. The separatists said that they were independent from Ukraine. Russia was accused of helping them with troops and weapons although Moscow has always denied it. Eight years have passed, and Russia and Ukraine still haven’t been able to resolve this issue.
Baruch graduate Andriy Koretskyy was born in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine, in the city of Novyi Rozdil and moved to the United States at the age of nine. Koretskyy has a lot of his close relatives that still live in Ukraine and is hoping that everything will get better so they remain safe. 
“I have a lot of family in Ukraine, my brother with his family, my grandparents, and all my cousins. Currently, everyone except my brother and his family still live in Ukraine. My brother crossed the Polish border last week to get his wife and two kids to a safer country. My grandparents, on the other hand, are not planning to leave Ukraine, and they are hoping everything will get better,” Koretskyy said.
Koretskyy, agreeing with Haring, believes that Russia has never seen Ukraine as an independent nation. 
“Russia has always looked at Ukraine as their property and never believed in Ukraine’s independence ever since the Soviet Union fell apart,” he said.
Koretskyy goes on,
“The conflict in Ukraine has been happening since 2014 and hasn’t stopped, but no one talked about it because it wasn’t referred to as an official war until recently, even though nearly 1,500 people had died and about 1.5 billion people were forced to evacuate their homes when it had begun in 2014,” Koretskyy said.
Freshman finance major Radmir Khodjakhanov also has personal ties to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
“I was born in Uzbekistan, but I lived most of my life in Moscow, Russia, which is why I consider myself to be Russian. This matter involves my country, my friends, and relatives. I also happen to have friends in Ukraine, though most of them have already fled the country,”  Khodjakhanov said. 
Khodjakhanov feels that Russia is attacking Ukraine for a few reasons: land, and wanting to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO is a military alliance that was created in 1949 by the US, Canada, and other Western European nations after WW2 to provide protection against the Soviet Union.
“The main conflict comes down to a few critical factors; Russia wanting to take back territories which belonged to Russia and are currently occupied by ethnic Russians, and Ukraine wanting to join/become a NATO member,” Khodjakhanov said. 
Anti-war protests have been occurring in Long Island, as well as all over the world. Russian protests are getting shut down by police, and protesters are getting arrested and taken into custody for doing so. Koretskyy has gone to a few anti-war protests and he believes that it is important for people, especially Russians, to continue to stand up for what they believe is right.
“Whatever happens, if Russia does win or lose this war, Putin has dug himself, and his country in a very deep hole that he will not be able to get out of. Their economy is tanking and the world finally sees Putin as a risk to everyone. People in Russia need to continue to unite and stand up against Putin and take him out of office,” Koretskyy said.
Currently, President Biden, as well as other leaders and companies have applied sanctions to Russia. The current president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has been in the front lines with his men, as well as visiting hospitals to meet with his wounded soldiers. Koretskyy is proud and grateful that there is a great president leading his country.
“I think he [Zelenskyy] is showing great leadership, staying calm throughout all of this, and he’s not evacuating Kyiv, which shows his courage and I know that makes me and other people more proud to be Ukrainian,” Koretskyy said.
 In order to support Ukraine, many students are donating to various charities, such as The Ukrainian Red Cross or Global Giving. This story is ongoing as more developments occur.

Winter sports have concluded here at LIU, and that means that spring sports are now getting in full swing as LIU’s lacrosse, baseball, softball, etc. programs are getting ready for their upcoming seasons. In particular, men’s lacrosse is gearing up for a competitive season, as they finished second in the first-ever Long Island Cup, falling to Stony Brook University 10-6. 
Starting on the offensive side of the ball, LIU’s attack aims to be very potent again, as the same attackers for LIU will be coming back for this upcoming season. 
Head Coach Eric Wolf gives an inside look on the team and some of the things that fans can expect for the upcoming season.
“Our attack has played for two straight years, Richie [LaCalandra] leading the way as NEC Offensive player of the year, Blake [Behlen] and Jake Gillis works really well off those two,” he said. “A lot of what we do runs off those guys. Think of Richie as a ball-dominant point guard, Jake as a spot-up shooter, and Blake, who can pretty much do anything. He’s a mixed bag of tricks.” 
Although this team has the same attack coming back, the team that will look very different this year will be the midfield. When comparing this team to last year, Wolf claims there will be some younger guys stepping up at other positions.
“We were older on the offensive end last year. This time around, all of our experience outside of our attack is on our defense. We’re definitely a balanced defensive team,” he said. “We like to get out and up and push transition early on in offense. If we don’t have it, we’re more than happy to play long offensive sets.”
On the defensive side of the ball, LIU is led by junior goalie Will Mark, who won NEC defensive player of the year last season. Wolf had nothing but praises for Mark.
“Will Mark has been the bedrock of our program for the last two years,” he said “Our recipe last year revolved around him getting 15-20 saves a game and outscoring other teams.”
The junior goalie averaged 13 saves in net last season and looks to continue his dominance in the net this upcoming season for the Sharks. Another defender that coach Wolf has high hopes for is senior defenseman, Chris Campbell. 
 “We like to throw Chris Campbell on an island on defense. I think he is the best defender in the conference, and I wouldn’t be shy about saying that. He is phenomenal,” he said.
 Campbell has started all nine of the games for the sharks so far this season and forced five turnovers from other teams this season.
As mentioned before, this upcoming team will be a younger team compared to the team last year. One of the players to look out for this season is sophomore midfielder Thomas Von Bargen. Coach Wolf commented that Von Bargen’s role will be expanded more this season, as he “played for us defensively last year a lot as a freshman, now he’s starting to play on the offensive side of the ball this year.”
The goal for Coach Wolf this season has never changed, as he said the goal is always to win the Northeast Conference (NEC) championship and compete for the national title. 
“I don’t think we were quite ready three years ago. Last year, we felt like we were ready to compete for the conference championship, and with both the NEC offensive and defensive player of the year, we felt ready,” he said. “We ended up falling short, but the difference this year is that we have more depth.”
LIU as a team is coming into the upcoming conference season ranked fourth, behind the defending conference champions Bryant University, the team that knocked LIU out of the playoffs last year St. Joseph’s University, as well as Hobart College. 
LIU is currently 3-1 in the NEC, and will face St. Joseph’s University on Saturday, April. 16 in their final home game on Senior Day

A veteran coach with decades of experience, Ron Cooper, will take the helm as the Sharks’ head football coach for the 2022 season. 
Cooper’s college football career started as a player for Jacksonville State. Upon graduating, he became a Graduate Assistant at Appalachian State and Minnesota. 
His first few positions throughout the 1980s and early 1990s include his time as the defensive coordinator at Murray State and the University of Nevada. He was also an assistant coach at Notre Dame from 1991-92. In both years, Notre Dame made the Orange Bowl and won it once. 
Cooper has had several head coaching positions in collegiate football and has coached under some prestigious Division 1 programs. 
Cooper’s first head coaching job was with Eastern Michigan in 1993. Throughout the 1990s, he also landed head coaching jobs with Louisville and Alabama A&M. At Alabama A&M, he helped transition the program from Division II to Division I and led the team to a 5-2 record in 2000, leading the Southwest Athletic Conference (SWAC).
After leaving Alabama A&M in 2001, Cooper was named to various positions on the defensive side of the ball for schools in many powerhouse Division I conferences. He spent one year as the defensive backs coach for the Badgers of the University of Wisconsin in 2002 before becoming Mississippi State defensive coordinator for a year in 2003.
He spent over a decade as a defensive backs coach with other various roles at the University of South Carolina from 2004-2008, and then became the defensive backs coach at Louisiana State University (LSU) from 2009-2011.
While at South Carolina, Cooper helped lead the Gamecocks to three bowl games, including a victory in the Liberty Bowl in 2006. While at LSU, Cooper was a part of the program that made three straight bowl games while adding an SEC championship to his resume in 2011.
Due to his success as a defensive backs coach in collegiate football over that time, he was hired as the defensive backs coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFL in 2012. 
Cooper moved his way up the ladder from the defensive backs coach of Florida International University to interim head coach in 2016. 
After leaving Florida International, Cooper was a defensive backs coach for two more SEC schools, Texas A&M and the University of Arkansas. 
His final position before joining LIU was as an analyst for the Crimson Tide of the University of Alabama in 2021 under legendary collegiate head coach Nick Saban. Under this role, Alabama won the SEC championship and made it all the way to the College Football National Championship game. 
Cooper claims he has had a long-time friendship with LIU’s Athletic Director Bill Martinov, which was a key factor for him when deciding to take charge of the football program here at LIU. 
“The athletic director and I have known each other for several years. We started off our early years of coaching in our early 20s, and then we met up again when I went to the University of Notre Dame. He was a strength coach, and I was the secondary coach,” he said. “We stayed in touch, and when the opportunity came about, he and I talked, and then I talked with Dr. Kline, and we had a great conversation and I felt like the commitment was totally made to Long Island University football. It was an exciting time. We decided to venture out and do it.”
Through Cooper’s experience at both the collegiate and professional levels, he acknowledges that there is a different approach to coaching the players at different levels.
“In college, you have to recruit. You get a man at 17, 18, 19 years old as a freshman. You get to know them when they’re in high school, and then you watch them mature from their freshman year through their senior year in college. You get a chance to nurture and teach him techniques and fundamentals, help them become young men and to grow into mature, responsible adults. When you go to the NFL, those guys are already mature adults, you’re coaching grown men who are feeding their families based on how they’re playing on the field, so there is a difference,” he said. “When it comes down to football, you still gotta teach them how to block, tackle, run, catch and install plays on offense and defense. All those things are still the same, but the young man that you’re dealing with in college is right out of high school. When I went to Terry Buccaneers, Ronde Barber was still there. Ronde was 37 years old, playing his last couple of years, so there is definitely a difference.”
Cooper has nothing but great things to say about the student-athletes and coaching staff he has worked with over his short time so far with LIU. 
“It’s a great group of not just athletes, but a group of students. My staff and I, we’ve eaten on campus just to be around and see what the environment is like. It’s a great environment for not just a student-athlete but a student. It’s a great place to go to school,” he said. “I’ve looked and witnessed the kids getting along in all the areas I’ve seen on campus, so it’s exciting for me to see.”
Cooper definitely plans to recruit more athletes over the coming months, but believes the group they have now will be the core they run with in the near future. 
We are definitely recruiting. We got a late start, but we’ve come out strong, and we will look to sign a few more student-athletes to scholarships, but the main look of our team on what we will do this year, they’re already here on campus. We’re working with about 80 guys every morning. The first group starts at 6 am, and we’re in here with them. They’re lifting, running, getting bigger and stronger. It gives us a chance to see each player’s work and what their attitude is like,” he said. “We’ve got them early in the morning, so we know they’re going to bed at night to be able to get up to be here. The door opens at 6 for stretching. I’ve been totally impressed. Since I’ve been here in January, we’ve had no unexcused absences, so that means that the guys wanna be good, they want to do something special and they’re buying in.”
Cooper will look to have an explosive first season with LIU and then continue to build on that for long-term success with the program. 
“We would like to have a winning season this first year. We’d like to have success winning at home. I’d like to aid the university in filling up that stadium and getting the people that are around this area interested in Long Island football and that’s gonna take putting a good product on the field,” he said. “I want the students involved, sitting behind our bench just like the other places I’ve been and other teams can’t really hear because students are making noise and trying to make it a fun atmosphere in that stadium out there, find a way to win all the home games, find a way to win on the road and have a winning season.”

The NBA trade deadline ended on Feb. 10, bringing a very different landscape to the NBA. Several trades took place that day that have truly shaken up the league and made some teams more legitimate threats to capture the 2022 NBA championship. 
Although some teams have made moves to win the title, others made moves that were meant for building the future of their franchises, as they traded away some players that could have been considered cornerstones of their respective teams. 
With that said, let’s recap some of these trades within the final days before the end of the trade deadline.
Let’s start with the trade that made headlines between the Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers. After not playing the entirety of the season thus far, the hybrid guard/forward Ben Simmons finally got what he’s been waiting for all season long, and that was a trade away from the team he started with, the Philadelphia 76ers. Simmons has been with the 76ers since he was the first overall draft pick in 2016 and will now, for the first time in his career, play for a different team. Brooklyn also received guard Seth Curry and center Andre Drummond, along with two first-round picks (2022 and 2027).  
The 76ers, on the other hand, received one of the most prolific scorers the NBA has seen in recent years and the 2018 Most Valuable Player of the year in shooting guard James Harden. Harden has been on the Nets since he was first traded to Brooklyn last January. In his first season in Brooklyn, he ended up getting hurt and missing the last series the Nets played in the playoffs, where they lost to the eventual champions, the Milwaukee Bucks. 
Senior communications major Dean Joannou feels this was a fair trade for both sides. 
“I feel that this is a rare mutually beneficial trade. When considering that Ben Simmons wouldn’t have played for Philadelphia this season, using his trade value to bring in James Harden is a major win,” he said. “For the Nets, getting an elite defensive player on a long-term contract in Simmons is a strong move since there were indications that Harden would have chosen to leave Brooklyn in the summer.” 
This has been the headliner trade that many have been talking about ever since it was first announced just hours before the deadline. However, this was not the only trade that occurred during this time.
Another trade that went under the radar is the trade between the Boston Celtics and the San Antonio Spurs, in which the Celtics received guard Derrick White, while the Spurs received guard Josh Richardson, hybrid guard/forward Romeo Langford and two first-round picks (2022 and 2028). 
Joannou had nothing but praise for the move on the Celtics’ part.
“White is the exact kind of quick decision-maker needed to play next to Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum,” he said. “I liked seeing the Celtics invest in this year’s team, which suddenly looks the part of a contender in the East.”

The 94th annual Oscars Awards ceremony was held on Sunday March 27, and it was a night no one will ever forget. The ceremony was hosted by Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall. 
This was a big night for many films, but “DUNE”  was the big winner, taking home awards in production design, cinematography, editing, sound, visual effects and score. 
“CODA” was another big hit among Oscar’s voters. “CODA” won the award for best Picture, director Sian Heder won for Best Adapted Screenplay and Troy Kutsor made history when he became the first deaf person to win Best Supporting Actor for his performance. 
Kotsur was visibly overcome with joy when presenter Youn Yuh-Jung announced and signed his name. It’s been a long road for Kotsur since he has been acting in low-budget deaf theater productions for decades. He then told a story about his father becoming paralyzed from a car accident, leaving him unable to perform sign language. 
“This is dedicated to the deaf community, the “CODA” community and the disabled community,” he said in his speech.
 Freshman at Holy Cross high school Vienna Frie discussed how emotional she was watching him on screen.
 “I haven’t watched “CODA” but it is now number one on my list of movies to watch,” she said.
While there was hardly any mention of the war in Ukraine, Mila Kunis had been an advocate for peace in the country where she was born. She used her time on stage as a presenter to praise Ukrainians for their resilience and was followed by a moment of silence.
“Recent global events have left many of us feeling gutted,” Kunis said. “Yet when you witness the strength and dignity of those facing such devastation, it’s impossible not to be moved by their resilience. One cannot help but be in awe of those who find the strength to keep fighting through unimaginable darkness.” 
While the night was heartwarming things took a quick turn when Chris Rock presented and from then on elevated to another level. 
Chris Rock was presenting the Oscar for best documentary feature when he made fun of Jada Pinkett Smith and said he was excited to see her in “G.I. Jane 2” due to her bald head. Smith revealed in 2018 she was diagnosed with alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss and her and her husband Will Smith did not take that “joke” lightly. 
Will Smith then marched to the stage and hit Rock across the face. The audio then cut out on the U.S. broadcast, but Smith appeared to be shouting the words, “Keep my wife’s name out of your f*****-g mouth!”
Junior Finance Elijah Stout had a lot to say about the incident. 
“It was only a matter of time until Will Smith snapped. No man can deal with the things he has to go through without reaching a breaking point. His wife makes him look so silly and then everyone on the outside is making fun of him. Although Will did laugh at the joke at first he still defended her,” Stout said.
Shortly after the hit, Will Smith won best actor for “King Richard” and compared the incident to how he portrayed Richard Williams from the movie. 
“Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family,” said Smith. “I’m being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people,” he said, as tears streamed down his face. “I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things.” 
This year’s Oscars will go down in history for being the longest show in previous years, and for having a fight between two celebrities. 
Here is the full list of Oscar winners:

The first recordings of the classic maternal insult—or your mother joke—date back to around 1500 BCE when researchers discovered a babylonian tablet covered with jokes and insults with some pertaining to the phrase surrounding one’s mother.
The joke has been an evolving constant over the years. One of history’s greatest entertainers, William Shakespeare, was not above making the joke himself, and was seen insulting mothers in some of his works such as “Titus Andronicus.” 
Though the delivery may have changed, the joke is still driven by the same intent, to insult your mother. 
Some may view the your mother joke as a classic or something childish and dull, but across the board most people have made or encountered the notorious your mother joke at least once.
“I remember when it was really big like in public schools and before college. When we were younger, you know, it was like little things, like yo mama so fat, or something else childish,, as we got older you know we were not little kids anymore and were grilling each other’s moms,” freshman history major Justin Bielecky said. 
The your mother joke is an incredibly versatile joke that can be applied in many different situations.  Starting with typical grade school banter the format has now evolved  into dirtier jokes. Whether it be simple your mother is not up to mental standard jokes against something more nefarious, the joke can be applied across nearly every type of insult to joke.
Anybody who has played online gaming knows how far some can take the joke when behind the shelter of the screen. 
“Things would get pretty heated in the chatroom,” undeclared freshman Jake Wittzelman said. Of course we’re gonna say that stuff. When you’re angry and want to inflict something verbal, what’s better than making fun of someone’s mom?” 
Starting on Sept. 18 2005, there was a channel on youtube, known simply as Yo Mama, dedicated to your mother jokes and has even seen relevant success, still producing content today with just a little over five million subscribers. It’s fascinating to see that a simple joke can garner so much success and possibly financial benefits. An example of the type of jokes feautured on the channel is “yo mama so dumb she tried to fill her car with Vin Diesel.”
A lot of people said they even found it entertaining at an age when the your mother joke was seen as childish, though of course the joke has its critics.
“It just seems dumb,” sophomore special education major Kasey Reeser said. Like what am I twelve? Why would I even bring that up, even when I’m trying to be funny. When I hear people say that stuff I just think what an immature loser,” said Reeser. 
The your mother joke has evolved greatly from crude and insulting jokes from the very beginnings of civilization to both humorous entertainment and harsh insults. Some even profit off the phrase. The very beginning of the phrasing has always had some sort of superiority humor by defaming the rival’s mother, though of course whether it be for fun or insult, the result is the same. 
There are many opposers to the phrase who view it as childish and low brow due to its simple nature and how it is often phrased by the younger generations, but all and all, the phrase is capable of inflicting whatever the sayer is meaning and can inflict something whether humorous or insulting.

“Uncharted” was released in theaters Feb. 18, 2022. Starring Tom Holland in the role of Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan, the film is filled with adventure and struggle to find a treasure worth five billion. 
The film is based on the prequel storyline from the Naughty Dog video game for PlayStation, and focuses on Drake’s first encounter with the professional rogue, Sullivan. Audience ratings are listed at 90 percent, while Rotten Tomatoes rated the film 41 percent.
In the film, Sullivan recruits the young street-smart Nathan Drake to accompany him on a journey to find a 500-year-old lost treasure accumulated by explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The heist soon turns into a race to reach the treasure before the merciless Santiago Moncada gets his hands on it. After crossing paths with old friends, the duo sets out to achieve the greatest treasure hunt of all time.
There are several opinions about the film’s performance, both positive and negative. Some feel as though Tom Holland was not the right fit for his character since Drake was conceived as a throwback Indiana Jones, or that his instincts should have been sharper. Others feel that Tom Holland was cast because of his likable personality, but he simply did not have what it takes to fit into the gritty character. 
Mark Wahlberg was accepted as a good character fit as someone who provided a good balance between his charisma and the exhausted tone of a treasure hunter who has seen and done enough, and simply wants a final expedition that can set him up for life.
“I think the movie was pretty good overall. It differed from the video game in some respects. For example, Drake and Sullivan looked different, but they played the characters well and acted off each other. Unlike the games, the movie is the story of the beginning of their friendship, rather than one that’s been built up over decades,” junior accounting major Juliana DeLeon said.
The film is heavily compared to the adventurous “Indiana Jones” series. However, “Uncharted” is still seen as respectable for its own franchise.
“I would not place “Uncharted” on the same level as “Indiana Jones,” but it is nevertheless exciting and thrilling in its own ways. The movie has been set up with a sequel in mind, and I can envision it growing into its own identity. A child who grows up on Tom Holland in “Uncharted” might have the same fondness as someone who grew up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones,” senior sports management major Ashlee Garrett said.
The sequel is rumored to be released in roughly three years according to the director, Ruben Fleischer.

It was just before midnight on this past New Year’s Eve,  while the world was waiting for 2022, the TV community was dealt a blow in the dying minutes of 2021. It was announced that “Impractical Jokers” star Joe Gatto would not be returning to the hit truTV show, taking many of the fans by surprise. 
Gatto stepped aside to deal with personal family matters, and left fans wondering what was next for the show. He was widely loved by the “Impractical Jokers” community, and the impact he had will not be forgotten by them. He leaves behind massive shoes to fill as the four lifelong friends who continue to embarrass each other are now down to three. 
It has been recently announced that a different celebrity guest will join the Jokers throughout the new season, with the first celebrity being featured is comedian Eric André. 
Grad student Ryan Branigan talked about what makes the Impractical Jokers so unique.
“What stands out about  “Impractical Jokers” versus other shows is that they really utilize the unpredictability of the public and make every show different,” he said. “You have no idea how the public are going to react to the most ridiculous things they do. They’re also really good at coming up with new and fun ways of putting the public to the test to see how they will react to their shenanigans and it’s great and makes for great TV.” 
When talking about change in the show, Branigan mentions that it can still continue after some mixup.
“I’m honestly not too sure what the impact of Joe leaving is going to be, you can’t really replace his dynamic,” he said. “The show has gone on for so long, they’re probably going to have to get new Jokers at some point, but I feel like with the premise of the show you don’t necessarily need the original guys to keep it going. It definitely helps to have the original jokers as we’ve seen and gotten to know them and bonded with them.”  
When thinking about the future of the show with the addition of celebrities, Branigan was cautiously optimistic.
“Obviously I think the show will go on without him. It might be a little different and might lose some viewers but I think it’ll be good overall going forward.I’m not fully sure the whole bringing a new celebrity to replace Joe is the best idea, I think it can work but I see it more as a temporary fix. I don’t think it is a long-term fix, I think you need to find a suitable replacement for Joe Gatto,” Branigan said.
Senior musical theatre major Francesco DiFlora touched on why he continues to go back and watch more episodes of the show.
“What makes Impractical Jokers stand out over other shows is how funny the dudes are,” he said. “They’re hysterical and the things they do, they do to real people so it’s just very funny to go back and watch new episodes. They’re very good at making me laugh because they do things you wouldn’t expect anybody to do in public. 
When thinking of the departure of Gatto, DiFlora remembered he was disappointed when he heard the news.
“Joe was my favorite joker because of how funny he is, so I am less inclined to go back and watch,” he said. “Joe leaving is super upsetting and I think it’s going to make their ratings go down a little bit.”
DiFlora is unsure of how the new celebrity guest format of the show will work.
“It has been done in the past and I think a celebrity would be cool, but how would people not know the celebrity? They need to get a celebrity that’s not well known so they can do pranks. I think the show will be fine without Joe in the long run but could struggle to get the same ratings,” DiFlora said.
Season 10 of “Impractical Jokers” premieres on Saturday, April 2, simulcasted on TBS, TNT and truTV directly after the NCAA Men’s Final Four.
