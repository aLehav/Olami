Professional Golfer Tiger Woods was involved in a high-speed rollover single-car accident on Feb. 23 that has left his health and golf career in jeopardy. The golfer was involved in the crash in Southern California on his way to film a content shoot with Golf Digest/GOLFTV after hosting the Genesis Invitational golf tournament. The two-lane road on which the crash occurred curves through the suburbs. The northbound side which Woods was on descends steeply with a 45 mph speed limit. 
According to Officer Villanueva, the Los Angeles County Sheriff who rescued Woods, his vehicle hit a median, went across two southbound lanes, hit a curb and trees and then rolled over several times with the vehicle coming to a rest several hundred feet from the road. Woods was conscious after the crash and had to be rescued with a pry bar and an axe. Woods will not face charges from the crash and had no drugs or alcohol in his system at the time. 
Woods suffered “significant orthopedic injuries” to the upper and lower portions of his tibia and fibula as well as multiple open fractures to his lower right leg, a rod placed in his tibia, and screws and pins inserted in his ankle and foot during the emergency surgery. A surgical release of the covering of the muscle to remove swelling was also performed. 
Nearly two days before the crash, Woods talked with commentator Jim Nantz about his timetable to return and stated that he was waiting on an MRI so that he could return to practice and competition, with his hopes set on the 2021 Masters in April. Sports fans like sophomore Madi Margroff were upset to hear of the crash. 
“I thought it was sad because he had such a great comeback, and now his career could be over,” she said. 
Sophomore marketing major Rachel Jenkins also feels sorry for Woods and hopes that this is not the end of his career. 
“I only watch golf when he’s playing, so I hope he is able to return. If anyone can get through this, it’s him,” she said.

The New York Knicks and their new dynamic team have been currently battling in the East sitting at .500, and New Yorkers are loving it. Previously in past years, the Knicks have been falling far from the playoffs, but with high hopes and some good pickups, the Knicks are contenders for a spot in the playoffs.
 To see how fans are taking this season, Nick Giacolone and Noah Anderson had a lot to say about the Knicks’ approach this year and their play. 
Anderson feels strongly about the improvements the Knicks have made since last year.
“As a Knicks fan, seeing us start out well and be fifth in the east and five games back from first feels good. It is a huge improvement for us seeing as though we finished 12th out of 15 teams in the East last season,” he said. 
Giacolone is very optimistic about where this season could be headed compared to years past.
“Having the Knicks in fourth right now is the best season since 2012 with Melo taking them to the playoffs. Hopefully they keep that going,” he said. 
The Knicks have been rebuilding for some time now with the improvement of Julies Randel and other pick-ups like veteran Derrick Rose.
Anderson believes these acquisitions have made a huge impact on the court so far. 
 “Julius Randle has been amazing for us. In his second year in New York, he is having a career year in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Free throw percentage, and three-point-percentage,” he said. “We also added Derrick Rose, again, and his experience has been pivotal to our young team.”
Giacolone is confident the Knicks can maintain their level of play for the remainder of this season. 
“The Knicks are a very talented group of young individuals,” he said. 
He also hopes to see them finish around the fifth seed at the end of the season. With the nets right next door and their dynamic superstar team, it will be interesting seeing how the Knicks match-up. 
With a very powerful nets team right next door., Anderson thinks the Nets have the edge in not just NY, but the Eastern Conference overall. 
“The Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers are tied for first place in the East, but I feel as though with Brooklyn’s recent acquisition of Blake Griffin, they ultimately win the East and retain that first seed,”  he said.
With high potential and a young team, the New York Knicks are in a great position to make a push for the playoffs and hopefully contend for a championship.

On Monday, March 8, women across the world were celebrated, empowered and uplifted on International Women’s Day.
International Women’s Day is a historically important global day recognized to celebrate the economic, cultural, societal and political achievements of women. This day also acts as a reminder and call to action for gender parity. On this day, there is significant activity around the world where many diverse groups of people come together to celebrate all of the historical achievements women have contributed to our society as well as rallying for women’s equality. 
March 1, marked the beginning of Women’s History Month. All month long, we are reminded and honor the overlooked contributions women have made to history. In 1911, International Women’s Day originated to celebrate women, but the idea to highlight women for an entire month was officiated and signed by Congress in 1987. Since then, all March long we commemorate all women and all they do. 
In today’s society, women are no stranger to derogatory remarks and discriminating treatment. This is one of the many reasons that International Women’s Day holds such an important status. As time goes on, women are feeling more empowered to use their voices and that has sparked a revolution for equality. A worldwide day of anti descrimation such as International Women’s Day has been recognized as a beacon of hope for many women and their allies.
“Women are capable of anything they desire and are constantly made to feel less than enough. Women tear women down, men tear women down, society tears women down, but on this day, we are reminded of all the possibilities that lie ahead,” junior musical theatre major Kassandra Popcevski said. “We are reminded of our strength, grace, courage and womanhood. We are reminded that the sky’s the limit.”
As times and the society we live in change, the way we celebrate International Women’s Day has evolved as well. This year, many social media apps participated in this uplifting day by creating special filters, hashtags and fun activities for users to participate in. In this technological age, these methods of celebration were received and greatly appreciated by all users. This allowed users of any gender to feel included and excited about the chance to recognize such an inspiring day. 
In honor of International Women’s Day every March, users create hashtags to highlight the themes and overall ideas of this worldwide day of acknowledgment. This year, one of the most used viral hashtags across all platforms was #ChooseToChallenge. This hashtags relates directly to the International Women’s Day 2021 mission statement that “A challenged world is an alert world and from challenge comes change. So let’s all choose to challenge.”
After years of change, evolution and societal growth, International Women’s Day and Women’s History Month are here to also remind us of how much more growth we must do as a society to embark on a better future. Women are to be celebrated for their achievements, encouraged to be whatever they want to be, and accepted for who they are. The toxic societal roles are being eliminated as optimistic voices of hope and change emerge into the conversation. Junior musical theatre major Kassandra Popcevski said,
“Being a woman isn’t just one thing, it’s anything that you desire to be and more. I can be strong and courageous but I can also be delicate and graceful. I can be respectful and uplifting but I can also say no,” junior musical theatre major Kassandra Popcevski said. “For so long I thought I only had one choice, one way of being a woman, but as I’ve grown I’ve realized there’s so much more to it than I thought possible. International Women’s Day reminds me of the power I hold and it encourages me to be proud of who I am and to shoot for the stars.”
In today’s complex society of change, confusion and justice driven movements, International Women’s Day is here to acknowledge the past. It is here to not only celebrate empowered women, but to remind us of the injustices women still struggle with and the changes that still need to be made.

“Alter/Ego, a Bowie Project” streamed from March 12-14 by the Post Theatre Company (PTC).  One might think it has much to do with the English singer and songwriter, David Bowie, which it does, but probably not how one would imagine.  
Sophomore musical theatre major, Quinn Doyle who sang “Moonage Daydream” said the play is not necessarily about David Bowie. 
 “We are taking a look at how gender identity and expression is examined in our current moment and in our modern generations, though fueled with a score by the Starman himself,” Doyle said.  
Senior musical theatre major Leigh Dillion explains the play is about more than just who David Bowie was.
“It’s about showing up, it’s about showing more than who we are, sometimes the side we don’t show to the world, it’s about trying new things, taking risks, exploration, having fun, being vulnerable, and how timeless Bowie’s music is.”
The project consists of, rather than characters, an ensemble of musicians expressing not only Bowie’s different personas but their own alter egos or alternate selves.
Like many of the cast, Dillon played a few versions of herself (in her case, two “roles”) as she explained,
 “One role that is me that I show to the world and the other being the one I wish I could be, it’s the more confident rock-star version of me.  There always feels like a duality within me, and in my solo, I was playing myself, just two personas like how Bowie has always done,” Dillion said.
The cast dedicated a lot of time to the project and were all proud of the final product.
“We had auditions and callbacks a week before rehearsals [which began] the week before classes started and continued rehearsals all the way through to the end of February,” Lee Metaxa, a senior musical theatre major, said.
But as the COVID pandemic is still very much present, there were a few obstacles that had to be overcome.
“This pandemic has made theatrical performance anything but easy, and learning the show’s material, as well as attending rehearsals from my bedroom every night, was challenging as much of the artistic process on my part was left for me to decide for myself,” Doyle said.
Of course, given the circumstance, not having an audience that could be seen, heard, or even felt was another hurdle that the actors had to overcome.  But the cast, with unrelenting positivity, only expressed gratitude.
“When I am able to perform in front of an audience live on stage again, the kinesthetic relationship and energy between us will be indescribable and so rewarding,” Doyle said.
Metaxa saw the circumstances as an opportunity to watch alongside her family and their reactions as well as a focus on the entirety of the performance and see everyone perform as she would not have been able to in an otherwise different circumstance.
Luckily, for most of the cast members, they were able to enjoy each other’s company in-person for the filming process while still practicing safe, social distancing, and mask protocols.
Doyle recalled, dancing with two masks in frigid cold temperatures and six-plus inches of snow.  Without a doubt, something he’ll always remember.

Marvel Studios has been one of the biggest names in entertainment for the past thirteen years. When the streaming service Disney+ was announced, Marvel Studios announced that they were going to branch off from just making movies by making television shows that will fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The first of these shows was the genre-bending and experimental show, “WandaVision.” During these mostly home-bound times due to the global pandemic, people needed something to celebrate and enjoy, which Marvel provided with “WandaVision.” The show took pop culture by storm, and broke countless records. So what did students think of it? 
“I really enjoyed ‘WandaVision’ a lot. The show felt like something new that I hadn’t seen before while also having very familiar aspects,” Gianna Gattuso, a student at the Savannah College of Art and Design said.
Gattuso felt that the show did great things in terms of portraying women in a strong and natural way. “The show included strong female characters, such as Darcy Lewis and Monica Rambeau, without making them feel overplayed and cheesy in a sense,” she said. 
The show follows pre-established Marvel characters Wanda Maximoff and Vision, as they live through the decades in the form of sitcoms. Starting in the 50s and going all the way up to modern times, the show’s episodes are each inspired by various classic sitcoms from each decade. This makes “WandaVision” a new kind of show that we haven’t ever seen before. 
“I thought it was very creative and they brought something different to the table,” Sophia Torres said. The concept was a risky one, because they didn’t want to just parody the sitcoms, but recreate them and be one itself. “You could show me an episode and I would believe that it was straight from that time,” she said.
“WandaVision’s” finale was met with controversy, because after eight widely beloved episodes full of easter eggs and set ups, including an appearance from Evan Peters who played the Fox X-Men version of Wanda’s brother Pietro; the finale followed up and delivered on only two of the countless set-ups. 
“I did not feel 100 percent satisfied with the ending and have so many unanswered questions,” Torres said.
“The finale was slightly disappointing compared to the rest of the show, but only in the way that it felt like it had been done before. For a finale for one of the most well thought out shows in my opinion, it felt rushed.” Gattuso said. She went on to explain how it had left many unanswered questions, and that she hopes they are answered during Wanda’s next appearance in “Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.”
Despite these issues with the finale, the one common thread in most people’s thoughts was that the finale executed Wanda and Vision’s emotional story and conclusion amazingly. The show is a story about grief, and on that front most people feel it did great.
“I really appreciated how they set up Wanda letting Vision and her kids go. The scene was so calm, yet devastating. You could see how in pain she was, but how she accepted this is what had to happen. The scene was beautiful and heartbreaking.” Gattuso said. 
Students feel that these Disney+ shows are lining up to be a great new way to experience the MCU. “It was interesting to watch a show instead of a movie. It was exciting to look forward to a new episode each week,” Torres said. 
This format provides so many new opportunities for Marvel media and fans seem to be very welcoming to it.
All in all, this show has clearly had a big impact. From experimenting with multiple genres to showing an MCU character in a way we never thought we could, “WandaVision” is the first step in a new era for Marvel and possibly pop culture as a whole.

Long Island University has been awarded four top honors awards from Bethpage Best of Long Island. LIU won Best College or University, Best College Sports Program, Best Theatre Arts Center and Bethpage accredited University President Dr.Kimberly Cline as the Best College President of 2021. 
This year marks the 16th consecutive year of the Best of Long Island Awards, and one million votes were cast this year. The Best of Long Island awards is presented by Bethpage Federal Credit Union, and has an array of categories. The categories for these awards range from restaurants, arts and entertainment, to education in Nassau county and Suffolk county.
Cline was appreciative of the honor.
 “We are honored to be recognized by our community for providing a top-tiered educational experience, and grateful for everyone who shares our vision and voted for LIU as the ‘Best of Long Island’,” she said in a press release statement.
Communications professor Dr. Jennifer Cusumano believes the awards will shine a positive light on the LIU community. 
“During this challenging year, it is especially welcome news to learn of this award. LIU has a  long history of serving the community with academic excellence, and programs that inspire intellectual rigor as well as world class performances in the arts. It is so nice to be acknowledged in this way.” 
Students, such as senior biology major Rondino Rameau, hope these awards will bring more attention to a need to upgrade school facilities.
“This is a nice accomplishment for the school, they have been doing good things academically for students,” he said. “I would like to see some of the dorms and other facilities improved though, especially for incoming students to see the true beauty of the campus.” 
Rameau thinks the introduction of the veterinary school was definitely a positive to the university, “Knowing Post is only one in four in the North East with a vet school is a big deal it will attract students across the country, especially with the revamp of the athletics program.”
The nomination process begins on Jan. 1, and is open until Aug. 31 of each year. Nominees will compete with the previous winner, and the top 15-18 nominees will move forward to the final ballot, which opens on  Oct. 1. If there is a restaurant, store or place that students feel should be spotlighted in the 2022 awards, they can visit the Best Of Long Island website where nominations can be submitted.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced that the state mask mandate will be lifted in April on Thursday, March 4. 
“Let me be abundantly clear, after April 9, I will not keep the mask order in effect,” Ivey said in a press statement.
Alabama is just one of many states that have repealed mask mandates. Texas, Mississippi, Iowa, Montana and North Dakota have also gotten rid of mask mandates in the last couple of months. 
In order to give private businesses ample time to establish their own policies regarding masks, Ivey decided to extend the repeal date, originally scheduled for March 8, to the beginning of April. 
Even though masks will no longer be mandatory, Ivey advised all citizens to still be cautious, and continue to wear face coverings in public. 
Alabama’s “Safer at Home” order will now stay in effect until April, allowing businesses and restaurants to operate at maximum capacity, but people must abide by social distancing guidelines, and sanitation standards are still in place. Senior citizens can still participate in outside activities, and hospitals and nursing homes are permitted to let in an additional visitor. 
Some students expressed support for Alabama’s decision to repeal the mask mandate. 
“It’s about time states start standing up to this tyranny,” freshman political science major Lewis Williams said. “I don’t want to be told to wear a muzzle all the time. And what’s the difference in a restaurant if I have to wear it standing up but take it off sitting down? Ridiculous.”
Sophomore history major Evelyn Bateman agreed with Williams.
“I wore a mask all the time, washed my hands, sanitized everything multiple times, and I still got COVID,” she said. “You’re really only supposed to wear the mask if you have the illness. I see people reusing masks all the time, so it defeats the purpose.” 
Other students and faculty members expressed concern with the decision to lift mask mandates. 
“Just another attempt by Trump supporters to spread the nonsense conspiracy theory that masks don’t work and that COVID-19 is a hoax,” junior English major Partick Halberstan said. “This governor is putting the citizens of Alabama at great risk by repealing the state’s mask mandate. I hope that doesn’t happen here.” 
“All [of] the states that are doing drastic rollbacks on a mask mandate are taking real risks, and, given the history of this virus, it seems more likely that there will be surges in cases in a few weeks in each of these states,” Dr. Barbara Fowles, professor of communications and film, said.  “I doubt if Alabama, in particular, has the medical resources to cope with a big wave of illness. These are political decisions which do not belong in a medical context.”
“I don’t know why people are so opposed to masks,” senior chemistry major Warner Cornwall said. “It boggles my mind that people are so opposed to taking measures that are supposed to keep them safe. Screaming ‘tyranny’ at the top of your lungs won’t make this pandemic disappear.” 
Ivey said that Alabama has experienced a 77 percent drop in the weekly average number of new patients admitted to hospitals daily since reaching a peak in January. The governor also said that the extended order will allow citizens to safely receive the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
According to data from the Center for Disease Control, over 670,000 Alabama residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine, almost 14 percent of the total population.
President Joe Biden, however, criticized the state’s move, calling it “a big mistake” and a form of “Neanderthal thinking” in a public statement.
Despite the conflicting opinions, Ivey has stood firm in her decision to pull back on the state’s mask mandate. 
“While I’m convinced a mask mandate has been the right thing to do, I also respect those who object and believe this was a step too far in government overreach,” Ivey said.

The University will be doing away with academic minors, making it so students will only be able to graduate with one or more majors. Rumors of the new changes had been circulating around campus for some time, before being confirmed by Vice President of Academic Affairs, Dr. Randy Burd. 
“LIU is committed to delivering an exceptional learning experience featuring in-demand degree programs with an emphasis on peer-student interaction, faculty expertise, and providing a competitive career advantage,” Burd said. “Based on current demand, we are enhancing the student experience by expanding new majors to replace certain minors and enabling students to efficiently pursue double majors which provide a competitive advantage in the career marketplace over those with a major and a minor. Students currently enrolled in a minor can continue to complete their minor.”
This is the first statement that has touched on the rumor, and no official word has been provided to the general student body. Incoming prospective students have been informed of the new policy.
Students currently pursuing minors have been worried that this new policy will affect their education. This new policy will only affect incoming students, all currently enrolled students will be able to keep their minors.
Freshman veterinary technology major Victoria Kefalas was upset to hear this news. She had planned on declaring an equine studies minor.
“When I heard I wasn’t able to declare a minor I was frustrated as to why and reasoning behind it,” Kefalas said.
Kefalas has talked to upperclassmen on campus, and believes she could carry the workload of the minor. Due to this change, Kefalas would be taking equine courses for fun, but it would not show up on her diploma.
“A reason I came to LIU is because I had the option to do both instead of just having a major,” junior musical theatre major and communications minor Jade Leah Burns said. 
Burns has always been involved in both areas of her study. She recalls participating in photography, announcements and theatre all throughout her high school career and beyond. 
“It seems like the opinions of students aren’t taken into consideration,” Burns said.
Burns had heard the talk surrounding minors and worries that it will personally affect her. Luckily for Burns, she will be grandfathered into her minor, as one of the last communication minor classes. 
Burns has speculated on why the campus would make this decision, and has settled on a monetary reason. “Everything is driven by money at this school,” Burns said.
Burns recalls seeing programs cut and has watched people get pushed out of their areas of study. She also mentions how the dorms on campus have not been updated and wishes some money would go toward renovations. 
Freshman directing major and philosophy minor Thomas Rowell agrees with Burns on this. “I understand wanting to save money, but not taking opportunities away from students,” Rowell said.
Rowell has just declared a philosophy minor and is already enrolled in classes needed to fulfill those credits. Rowell missed the cutoff, allowing them to keep their minor by one semester. 
“I love discussing the ideas and having deep conversations that come with the classes as well as I feel like it’s a useful tool for my goals as a theatre artist,” Rowell said. 
Rowell plans to apply the education offered from both the major and minor towards a future career path. Luckily with this education plan, this is something Rowell can easily pursue.
Rowell has never before heard of a college not having minors and wants to get a strong message across to the school. 
“LIU start talking to your students; we’re paying far too much to go here for you to not explain why you’re taking away our opportunities,” Rowell said.
Both Burns and Rowell get to keep their minors, being some of the last few students to be able to do so.
