Tai Rosten, an undeclared freshman, transgender student, faces her deadname everyday in order to access her school services and accounts. Her daily struggles are unique, unlike those encountered by students who were born comfortably in their own skin, and only a few on campus experience these obstacles alongside her.
Transgender is the term used by people of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) community who do not identify with the sex of the body they were born into. A deadname in the LGBTQ community is the birth name of someone who identifies as transgender and decided to change their name to better fit their true gender identity.
Those whose gender identity matches the one they were assigned at birth are described as cisgender. Rosten, who uses the she and her pronouns, identifies as a transgender woman.
“All it means is that in the same way cis people inherently know their gender, so do I,” she said. “Despite being born a boy or having XY chromosomes, I’ve never felt as though I was a boy at all.”
Kelly Coar, a junior stage management major who uses the pronouns they and them, identifies as nonbinary, which falls under the transgender umbrella and refers to those who do not identify as male or female. Being nonbinary has kept Coar outside of a box that never allowed them to feel fully accepted or comfortable.
“Identifying as a nonbinary individual means being the person I want to be and feel I am without the influence of gender and social roles,” Coar said. “It is also a community of people who understand the struggles I have faced in a way many people do not.”
Sky Hicks, a senior musical theatre major who uses the pronouns he and him, identifies as a transgender male, but prefers avoiding terminology that acknowledges a particular sex.
“Basically it means I am a guy; I identify as such,” Hicks said. “I personally don’t like to be referred to as female to male, often shortened to FTM, because I want to distance myself from that label.”
Gender is viewed today as a lot more than just female and male, and is thought of as a spectrum, according to many members of the LGBTQ community. Gender is not synonymous with sex, and often refers to a person’s social identity, while sex refers to biological characteristics. Not all people fall under one of two categories for sex or gender, according to The Associated Press.
In addition to all the different known labels that exist, Hicks said there are so many more that are unknown simply because people are discovering what terminology they personally feel comfortable calling themselves.
There’s the general umbrella term, transgender, which most accept to be an overarching term to cover binary, nonbinary, and all others who identify separately from their birth sex, according to Hicks, who added that it takes some people a while to find the gender identity that fits them well.
“When I first began to navigate what gender meant to me, I identified as agender, meaning identifying with no gender at all. I felt comfortable there,” Hicks said. “Then I figured out I was more comfortable leaning masculine, so I identified as demiboy, meaning partially identifying with the masculine, but not entirely. Then I ended up here, and right now that’s where I’m the most comfortable.”
There are all kinds of pronouns that someone can use, and understanding what they mean can be somewhat complex, as they change depending on the person, according to Coar. She and her are usually used by female-identifying people, whether cisgender or transgender. He and him are usually used by male-identifying people, whether cisgender or transgender. They and them are nonbinary pronouns. People can also use a combination of the pronouns depending on their gender identity. For example, someone may use the combination of she and they, he and they, or she, they and he, Coar explained further.
While the world has progressed in many ways over the last few decades, there are still many situations that transgender and nonbinary people face daily that cisgender people don’t usually think about. For instance, when Rosten logs into Blackboard, signs into MyLIU, uses her school ID, or receives mail, her deadname is still listed.
Being addressed by a deadname can be triggering, according to Rosten. Seeing the wrong name on school documents like Rosten has can be upsetting.
“It’s kinda like, oh wow, that’s not great. That doesn’t make me feel good,” Rosten said.
Coar is consistently struggling with presentation, including how they dress or act, which is usually determined day by day. On days they feel more masculine, it can be a task for them to present that way. They also worry about not being masculine enough. Sometimes, when presenting as traditionally feminine, nonbinary people like Coar worry about people assuming they’re a woman, even though they don’t identify as such. 
Coar, along with others in the LGBTQ community, struggle with coming out about a sexual or gender preference and not being accepted for who they are.
“There is also fear, so much fear. You never know how someone is going to react in public,” Coar said. “On the other side of that, being a visibly queer person can empower queer people who aren’t out, or visible, or haven’t come to terms with it yet.”
Hicks is in conflict with his ability to connect with his own body, so much so that he avoids his own reflection. At times, he does not recognize the person looking back at him, leaving him with an unshakable feeling of dread.
“I struggle looking into mirrors…because if I look in the mirror on a day where I’m already feeling down, I’ll only be able to focus on the things that aren’t masculine enough about me,” Hicks said.
On a similar note, Hicks worries about which bathroom to use while on campus because he’s concerned about how others will react. His fear depends on what building he’s in and who he’s with at the time.
“If I’m in a place I feel safe, like the theatre/film building, I’m perfectly comfortable using the men’s restroom,” Hicks said. “If I’m in Hillwood, I will wait for one of the two single-stall restrooms near Campus Concierge, but I’ll do so around the corner and wait for whoever was there to be out of sight before I go in.”
Rosten also struggles with connection to her body, along with gender dysphoria, a condition in which a person identifies as a gender opposite of their biological sex.
“As a trans person that is almost always perceived as her correct gender, I don’t think cis people understand what it’s like to feel like you look like a guy when you objectively don’t,” Rosten said. “I’ve had bad days where I’ve spent hours picking apart every aspect of my appearance and personality and literally convincing myself that no one sees me as a girl even when that is simply not true.”
These aren’t uncommon struggles among the LGBTQ community, according to Rosten, but both cisgender and transgender people “often act like once you start passing as your real gender instead of your assigned one, all of your dysphoria just kinda goes away,” she said.
While cisgender people can never fully understand what transgender and nonbinary individuals go through, the growing LGBTQ community encourages everyone to educate themselves on the subject. As a community, LGBTQ’s have a high suicide rate, according to Hicks, but that rate goes down with support from family, friends and peers.
One thing that Hicks really wants people to know is: “I If I say something is offensive, it probably is. There are terms that were widely accepted in the past that are considered slurs to most, and there are harmful stereotypes that still exist in the media today. There was even a man in a dress trope in the Trolls movie a few years back. We need to stop perpetuating stereotypes and concepts such as this because it only holds us back as a society. It turns being trans into a joke for people to laugh at—and that’s not okay.”
Coar agreed with Hicks’ statement in the fact that what their community is requesting is just basic human decency, and that everyone should respect others the same way they want to be respected in return. Also, more education and respect means safer spaces for people to come out and embrace their true self.
“This isn’t just some frivolous thing. This is who I am,” Hicks said. “This isn’t a matter of opinion, like if you like the color yellow or not. This is literally who I am as a person, as an individual. It’s inseparable from me. You can’t take a ‘hate the sin, love the sinner’ approach here when it’s literally my life.”
Editor’s Note: This story could not have been written without the help and education from Tai Rosten, Kelly Coar and Sky Hicks.

Students from around the globe attend LIU, and now that school is taught remotely, they’re expected to attend class at their regularly scheduled time, even though they may live in a different time zone.
Mia Daly, a sophomore sports management major, resides in Maui, Hawaii, where the time difference is six hours behind New York. Because of this, Daly’s class schedule begins at 5 a.m. and ends at 10:50 a.m.
“I don’t like my new schedule at all because I think it is very unfair to have students wake up that early for class,” Daly said. “I don’t think it’s very beneficial for me since I am not fully awake and attentive in class and it is hurting my learning.”
One of Daly’s professors is allowing her to miss class once a week when the professor records the lecture. Other than that, Daly is expected to be at all class periods.
Emily Poole, a sophomore sports management major, resides in Pontypridd, Whales, where the time is five hours ahead of New York, making all of her classes at a later time than usual. Poole’s classes now go from 4 p.m. to midnight.
“I actually prefer this schedule since I have my whole day to work out and study,” Poole said. “The only difficulty is making sure I do my assignments on time. I have to make sure to do them early since they are due in Eastern time.”
Poole’s professors gave her the choice to skip the Zoom lectures, which goes from 7-10:30 p.m. and 10:45 p.m.- 12:30 a.m., but she chose to attend them anyway.
“My professors offered to make an exception for these classes, but I didn’t take it because then I’d have to do an assignment for missing class. I felt like going to class wasn’t that much of a struggle,” Poole said.
Naveah Rascon, freshman forensic science major, lives in Tucson, Arizona, where they are three hours behind, making her classes earlier. Rascon’s schedule is from 5 a.m. to 1:50 p.m.
“My class schedule is going good. Sometimes it is hard waking up super early for classes but most of my teachers record them, or don’t use Zoom for every class, so when I do wake up, it’s only once in a while,” Rascon said. “The only thing I have to worry about is completing my assignments on time, making sure that I do them according to Eastern time, but to do so just takes a lot of time management.”
No one expected to attend classes from home this semester, and those from a different timezone never expected to attend classes from home at midnight or dawn; however, everyone is adjusting one way or another to their new normal due to COVID-19.

LIU announced it will add a women’s gymnastics team to the university’s athletics program beginning in the 2021 season.
The Shark gymnasts will compete in the East Atlantic Gymnastics League (EAGL), making them the seventh member of the EAGL, joining George Washington University, North Carolina State University, Towson University, University of New Hampshire, University of North Carolina, and University of Pittsburgh.
Director of Athletics Dr. William Martinov said the athletics department is looking forward to hiring an exceptional coaching staff to recruit and train new Sharks, according to a press release from.
“Gymnastics is one of the fastest growing women’s sports, and collegiately. We look forward to our continued pursuit of excellence both in the classroom and on the field,” Martinov said in press release.
With the new team being announced, some students are excited to see a new sport come to LIU.
“Having a Gymnastics team next year will attract more people to LIU, gymnastics is a very popular sport especially on long island with a wide reach of youth programs across the island,” Ryan Kraut, senior broadcasting major, said.
Helena Bradley, junior graphics design major, said this is a great accomplishment for the LIU community and appreciates that they’re branching out further into new sports disciplines.
“It’s great that the school finally has a gymnastics team. Hopefully, the university can build our program to the point that we are known across the country as one of the best,” Bradley said.
Long Island University is home to many Division I athletics programs, with the university having a total of 30 athletics teams across both The Post and Brooklyn Campuses. It is unknown whether the gymnastics team will be housed at the Brooklyn or Brookville campus.
Any student or prospective interested in joining the new team this upcoming season are encouraged to fill out this questionnaire on the athletics website for more information.

A new dean of arts, communication and design, Dr. Jennifer Holmes, officially joined Shark Nation two weeks before the school decided to have their administrative and academic offices operate remotely.
“It’s an invigorating time to be in a new job connecting to a vibrant community of artists, educators and entrepreneurs,” Holmes said.
Prior to applying for the dean’s position, Holmes earned degrees in theatre from New York University and Vassar College, and was an associate dean for the School of Drama at The New School in New York.
During her time at The New School, she developed partnerships with theatre companies such as Frantic Assembly, Elevator Repair Service and the Wooster Group. She directed two shows with professional and student collaborators which were performed at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center and The Great Hall of Cooper Union. She also started The Cultural Change Task Force, a group made up of students, faculty, and administration who care deeply about issues of equity, diversity and inclusion, as well as changing the culture of the professional world.
Holmes founded her own international theatre company in 2006 called Global Empowerment Theatre in which they facilitated social justice focused theatre projects in Zanzibar, Kenya, India, Myanmar and the United States.
Holmes was excited during the application process for the dean’s position and was inspired by the LIU faculty she met during that time.
“I love engaging with people and learning about their interests, research and practice,” she said. “I enjoyed learning more about LIU and [their] leadership’s vision for the future.”
Much of the new dean’s time thus far has consisted of working online, including virtual meetings all day that usually run into the evenings, as well as planning and coordinating the school’s next steps as the coronavirus continues to spread across the country.
“I’m so inspired and impressed by the faculty and their commitment to their students during these demanding times,” Holmes said. “I feel like [administration] are all learning together to create elegant solutions, pushing our creative capacities to their fullest to reimagine delivering an incredible experience to each and every student across the many and varied curricula of the college.”
While Holmes said she appreciates the emails and opportunities to speak with current and newly admitted students over the phone, she cannot wait until LIU becomes a campus community again.
“I cannot believe the creativity, flexibility, passion with which [members of the school] create together, support each other, and make LIU such a special place to work, learn and live,” she said.
Holmes’ plans as the new dean are to bring in artists and experts from a variety of disciplines to elevate the school to an even higher position on a national level.
“I look forward to increasing our visibility nationally and internationally, creating partnerships with artists and organizations that will inspire and hire our students,” she said. “My practice has been deeply enriched from all the work I have done around the world and I want our students to become impressive world citizens.”

The new coronavirus has become a global pandemic, affecting local businesses, their employees and customers. Some businesses are considered essential during a stay-at-home order, such as liquor and grocery stores, delivery and mail couriers, and gas stations. However, businesses deemed non-essential were forced to close their doors until the state lifts its stay-at-home order, making it difficult for them to remain afloat.
“New small companies are struggling while big corporations whose actions affect our society on a macro level, including local franchises, are losing ground every day.” Justin Simon, a senior business administration major, said.
The virus is taking a heavy toll on local businesses, according to David Jalajas, a business communications professor. When he goes jogging around his neighborhood in the morning, he notices that very few shops remain open.
“Restaurants have tried to make up for the losses by offering take-out, but I doubt that it can begin to replace the lost business,” Jalajas said. “I’m happy to see that grocery stores, CVS and BJ’s are open. They allow me to get my supplies for my household.”
Jalajas admitted that he has popped into Dunkin Donuts for a latte and a free donut on Friday’s while social-distancing. “But I miss my local Starbucks,” he said. “It was a good place to hang out, grade papers, and chat with the locals. The upside is that I’m probably saving $100 per month from its closure.”
Jalajas is concerned for his youngest son’s theatre program, the Performing Arts Studio in Port Jefferson, which according to him, is a small theatre run by three wonderful people.
“They have year-long and summer programs for kids and adults, but it’s shut down for now,” he said. “I worry how they’ll pay their bills.”
Some are worried, like Jalajas, that many small businesses may not make it without financial help, especially places like his son’s performing arts studio. With profits at a halt, the bills continue to come in, making it difficult to survive.
“I don’t know how that business, and others like it, will rebound from the loss of business,” he said. “I wish I could be more optimistic.”
Jalajas is finding it hard to see the positives in any of this, as he believes many businesses will not have a happy ending.
“People seem to be friendlier when I pass them during my runs, but a lot of people are going to lose their jobs,” he said. “It’s going to take a lot of ingenuity to bounce back.”

Due to the growing safety concerns regarding the new coronavirus, colleges all over the world were forced to take on the task of transferring in-person classes to online instruction, creating plenty of issues for students and faculty alike. All majors are affected by this change; however, each is faced with its own unique challenges.
Although it may be one of many areas of study that come to mind, students in the college of the arts, communication and design are faced with extreme difficulties in this new approach to learning. While many classes in the arts are conversation based and interactive, losing access to studio space, editing labs and important equipment has made the switch to online class extra intense, according to some students. To learn efficiently, some of these courses require hands-on learning, which is an aspect of the education experience that within the blink of an eye was no longer available.
“I don’t have access to the editing software I need and my documentary class is a group project,” Griffin Ward, a senior broadcasting major, said.
Students in varying fields rely on the school for most of their equipment, especially when it comes to lab-type work. But for students in the arts, traditional lectures can take on the feel of a lab in which students often have to work together.
“I think group projects are the hardest thing right now,” Ward said. “Everyone is kind of on their own schedule.”
A lack of valuable tools offered in a virtual classroom may affect a student’s ability to complete their work. While students in the technical arts like film and broadcasting struggle due to a lack of special equipment, dance and theater majors are experiencing a whole different problem.
“There’s a feeling of privacy and security that comes with the studios we work in. At home, I’m taken out of an environment that’s built to be worked in,” Michael Krebs, a junior musical theatre major, said.
Unable to utilize the campus studio, Krebs and other theater and dance majors are forced to come up with new ways to get things done.
“If I had WiFi that could support my device outside of the house, I’d absolutely dance out there,” Krebs said.
Issues like these have turned interactive classes into a three-hour conversation.
“Our production class is, well, it’s production,” Joseph Dorso, a junior film and history major, said. “We have had so many problems trying to do anything for our film over Zoom, and we obviously can’t get together to film anything new.”
As professors struggle to make remote learning a worthy experience, the stress of their students does not go unnoticed.
“Although every student is trying hard, they obviously don’t have the equipment or the ability to film,” Susan Zeig, chair of the communications and film department, said. “Filmmaking is a social activity, and the students are not able to connect with anyone in person. They’re doing their best work and we’re doing our best to make sure no one is penalized.”
In situations like these, classes are at somewhat of a standstill, with some students frantically trying to make things work over Zoom.
“Being in such a physically demanding major requires more than what we have access to without our studios,” Krebs said.
Another problem with the switch to online classes is the cost. Students are still paying the full price for a course, which in normal circumstances, includes full access and use of campus facilities like the theaters, radio station and film or television labs.
“Moving the curriculum online has stripped me and my fellow students of the opportunity for experiential learning, which frankly, is the only reason an aspiring filmmaker would agree to a tuition price of $30,000 a semester,” Kyle Smith, a senior film major, said.
Of course, the university never intended to end the semester this way, and students and professors are still trying to figure out the new flow of things.
Those studying the arts continue to search for ways to improve the current situation they’re now in. Some students are complementing their professors for how they have adapted to the switch.
“My professors are handling it very professionally, and a lot better than I thought,” Krebs said. “They offer a lot more office hours for us to join them on Zoom to continue working.”
But students agree that something more could be done to better their learning experience.
“There needs to be more communication,” Dorso said. “I have half my history stuff on blackboard, some through email, and my film stuff is in different places too. It’s hard to find Zoom links for that day’s meeting. I wish it was all just in one place.”
As students in all different types of majors are experiencing issues in their own way due to stay-at-home orders, Dorso said “We just have to adapt to the situation as well as we can,” along with reminding themselves that eventually they will dance, film, broadcast and design on campus again.

Students living in the United States are aware of the varying stay-at-home orders issued by the majority of state governments to ensure social-distancing and slow the spread of the new coronavirus—but stopping COVID-19 is a worldwide effort.
The White House and prominent health officials are urging people to remain home with the exception of those categorized as essential workers like grocery store employees and bank tellers. All nonessential businesses were ordered to close until the curve of the virus flattens. As of April 3, five states have yet to put these mandates in place: Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Another six states only enforced partial restrictions.
“All states should be doing everything in their power to keep people home”, Heather Felix, senior public relations major, said. ”Stricter orders will help to slow the spread of the virus and will allow us to return to normalcy asap. Other states have not been hit as hard as New York yet, therefore states must take every precautionary step possible to flatten the curve”
Similarly, other countries around the globe have placed restrictions to stop the spread of COVID-19.
In Australia, nationwide laws which restricted gatherings to a maximum of two individuals became effective on March 30. Some states took extra precautions like border restrictions, and others were more lenient, such as the Northern Territory and South Australia, which opted out of the two-person gathering rules. All states have closed all nonessential businesses, requiring people to work from home unless considered an essential worker. Individuals cannot leave their homes except for reasons such as getting essential goods or services, obtaining medical treatment or exercising.
In New South Wales, fines were put in place of up to $11,000 Australian dollars or six months of jail time for leaving the residence without a reasonable excuse. Further, citizens cannot leave the country until this “lockdown” order is lifted, and flights entering Australia are limited. Those who do arrive in the country will be forced to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days.
“The fines are excessive…. The U.S. should instead implement nationwide stay-at-home orders,” Felix said.
Breanna Boyce, junior fashion merchandising major, thinks the U.S. can benefit from implementing similar fines.
“It’s the only way to make people stay at home,” she said. “Despite the increasing numbers of cases and deaths, some people are not following social-distancing.”
Italy, one of the nations hit hardest by the pandemic with the third highest death toll thus far, issued a nationwide lockdown beginning March 9. Italian citizens must print out a certificate at home declaring their reason for leaving the house and then must seek permission from police to leave their homes or travel, according to a March 9 article from NPR. The country’s strict precautionary measures helped them to flatten their curve of confirmed cases.
“I think the measures Italy took were drastic, but were also necessary as Italy was the first country outside of China to be hit hard from this virus,” Joseph Campisi, sophomore biology major, said.
Boyce, who thought countries can benefit from stricter guidelines, also said that Italy acted too late in responding to the outbreak, but she is relieved to see a decline in their growing number of confirmed cases and deaths.
“It gives me hope for the U.S. and rest of the world,” she said.
India is the second-largest populated country in the world, and there is a growing fear among some of how they will handle a response to a severe outbreak of COVID-19. India has reported 5,916 cases of the new coronavirus with 178 deaths as of April 8, according to the World Health Organization.
In response, India placed the largest social-distancing measure in the world when it ordered a self-imposed nationwide shutdown for one day on Sunday, March 22, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., to give citizens an understanding of how their democracy would behave under restrictions, according to The Wall Street Journal. This measure was extended and is still currently in place.
All work, travel and movement is suspended in India, where they also placed a travel ban and prohibited entry of people from member countries of the European Union, Turkey and the United Kingdom, with the exception of Indian citizens. People entering the country will be placed in mandatory quarantine.
“In my opinion, India’s response to corona has been effective,” Campisi said. “An outbreak of COVID-19 in India would have devastating impacts on the country. It would be hard to contain and the hospitals would be unable to handle it.”

Promise coaches are working from home after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order requiring all nonessential business personnel to work from a remote location, or from home.
Michael Berthel, executive dean of students, sent all students an email on March 24 informing students about the promise coaches’ move and how students can reach them. The coaches also put together a video explaining how they can help students and posted it to the LIU Promise’s Instagram: @postliupromise. Resume help, online class assistance, registering for the fall semester, and financial aid questions are all ways the promise staff can virtually help students.
Promise coaches can be reached by phone, text, email, and through one-on-one zoom meetings. Each student received an email from their promise coach that included their work cell phone numbers and a more personalized message about how to contact them and schedule meetings.

The promise coaches’ transition from working on campus to their individual homes was decently smooth and went without too many problems, according to students. The transition hasn’t changed too much about how they contact and communicate with their promise coaches.
Freshman Gina Toscano, health sciences major, said, “I usually email my promise coach rather than going into the Promise office anyway, so this hasn’t been much of a transition for me. My promise coach helped me with my fall registration with no problem, almost like I couldn’t even tell he was working from home.”
Any problems that have arisen from the promise coaches’ location change have been minor.
“I have been able to get into contact with my promise coach and she has helped me with resources for my online classes,” Amanda Masullo, junior nursing student, said. “Recently it’s been sometimes taking her a little longer than normal to respond. But I’m sure that’s just because now that they’re working from home and students are probably emailing more than ever with all this craziness going on.”
The promise office reiterated multiple times through Instagram and email that they are here for students and want to continue to offer help in anyways they can during this time.

Some students may know who Carole Baskin is, while also being one of the many who watched the Netflix limited series, “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness.” This true-crime limited docuseries consists of seven episodes that are about 45 minutes to an hour long, covering the story of Joe Exotic, former zoo operator, and multiple exotic animal sanctuaries around the United States.
The story mainly follows Joe Schreibvogel (Joe Exotic) and his rivalry with Carole Baskin, a competitor at another exotic wildlife sanctuary. Joe Exotic was the owner of G.W. Zoo in Oklahoma, and he owned over 100 exotic species of animals, especially tigers. Carole Baskin is the owner and founder of Big Cat Rescue, a zoo and foundation aiming to help stop the abuse of tigers and other large exotic cats in sanctuaries across the states.
Throughout these seven mind-boggling episodes, viewers learn all about Joe Exotic and his two husbands, his love for making music, tigers, his zoo employees, and his hate for Carole Baskin. Viewers also get a thorough exploration of other large exotic sanctuaries, including Baskin’s Big Cat Rescue, Bhagavan Antle’s (Doc Antle) Myrtle Beach Safari, Tim Stark’s Wildlife in Need, and other businesses within the multimillion-dollar industry.
Some students have enjoyed “Tiger King” during their time indoors, having found the series to be oddly entertaining, and for the events to almost be unreal.
“I just recently started watching ‘Tiger King’ and I’m already halfway through the show,” Amanda Hartman, a sophomore speech-language pathology and audiology major, said. “For some reason I can’t stop watching, I don’t know why. Maybe it’s Joe Exotic, maybe it’s the unresolved murder of Carole’s husband. Although it’s a documentary, it doesn’t seem real.”

The “Thriving as an Artist” panel held on March 25 was a part of the ongoing department of art spring 2020 ongoing Business of Art Speaker Series. The goal of the series is to bring art professionals to talk with students about their work, speak about their own work, and give students the opportunity to connect with professionals in the fields they would like to pursue. Due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, the event was held online via Zoom.
Featured panelists were Alex Ferrone, photographer and owner of the Alex Ferrone Gallery for contemporary fine art in North Fork, Lisa Hock Mack, painter and director of Huntington Fine Arts, an art school and gallery and Lori Hororowitz, a sculptor, former gallery owner, and scenic painter.
Winn Rea, chair of the art department, invited participants to the event via email. “Each artist shared images of their artwork and spoke movingly about their artistic path.They discussed ways they have woven entrepreneurial and business skills into their professional lives on their way to becoming accomplished artists,” Rea said. “All the speakers agreed: artists need practical business skill training—and more of it.”
This speaker series reflects the mission of the art department to help students cultivate their creative passion and professional skills, according to Rea.
“We are breaking down the myth of the starving artist, an 19th-century trope that does not have to be true for artists who develop entrepreneurial and professional abilities,” she said.
This event reached an audience via Zoom meetings due to COVID-19 restrictions.
“We have alumni, members of the community and prospective students joining us from around the region and across the nation, so this difficult time has actually opened up new ways to reach out, and share inspiring examples with young artists,” Rea said.
The next, and last speaker in the series is Peter Gynd, artist, curator and director of Leslie Haller Gallery. The session will begin at 7 p.m., on April 25. Students interested in attending can contact Winn Rea at winn.rea@liu.edu to would like to receive an email with the Zoom meeting invitation.
This series is arranged in conjunction with MFA seminar class, led this semester by Professor Karen Fitzgerald.
“I thought the event was quite powerful. The presenters were well-spoken, knowledgeable, and carefully answered all the questions posed to them.”
“My preference would have been to be speaking in front of a live audience so I could have a true perception of my audience size and who I was speaking to,” Lori Horowitz, said. The audience was muted, there were no interruptions, but also no true sense of responses.
“It was a very enjoyable and engaging evening. During this time of isolation, it was a perfect way to interact and stay attached to the arts community. I met some new wonderful people and reconnected with some I haven’t seen for some time. I would recommend it as a teaching and networking tool that is very comprehensive and versatile. Most importantly it keeps us connected and able to share in this time of seclusion,” Horowitz said.

Just because students aren’t on campus, doesn’t mean clubs and events aren’t still happening. The Promise Office holds weekly virtual events via Zoom, and clubs have begun to host meetings over the online platform.
One of the many clubs on campus still holding meetings is The Newman Club. The Newman Club is a student run organization, which is Roman Catholic affiliated, and provides opportunities to students for further exploration of their faith, attend local, national and international service trips, attend mission trips all over the country, and hang out with students from around campus and other universities in the area.
The club goes on trips to the city for service and socializing like Catholic Undergrounds and volunteers in a multitude of places, such as working in soup kitchens, building homes with Nazareth Farms in Appalachia, and as volunteer pilgrims with North American Volunteers in Lourdes, France.
“We wanted to maintain that community. Faith is so profound, and we as faithful people depend on each other,” Michaela Fox, president of Newman Club and acting major, said. “We’re meant for human interaction, we’re meant to be united with other children of God. We literally greet each other in our Church as brother, sister.”
Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, the club still hasn’t let go of that sense of community.
“We didn’t want the coronavirus and the quarantines that come with it to stop us from nurturing those fruitful, joyous, loving relationships we have developed. No doubt they would continue to grow even being apart, because we are united in our prayer. But being together and praying together just makes it more fun, it’s a bonus,” Fox said. “We meet constantly throughout the week, like in Thursday’s at five for socializing followed by prayer, Fridays in Lent for the Stations of the Cross, and at other points for our women’s reading group and men’s group. But our club meetings are on Tuesdays at 12:45, officially. Govinda Willard (our campus minister) and I are usually in at 12:30 though in case people wanna come in early and chill.”
The club is open to any and all people—being Catholic is not a requirement to join and students from other schools are more than welcome. For more information contact Michaela Fox (michaela.fox@my.liu.edu) or follow the Newman Club on Instagram @liupostnewman for more updates.

With the outbreak of COVID-19, everyone is encouraged to stay indoors unless going out for essential purposes only. Because of this, people are now indoors for the majority of everyday throughout the week. Unless students have access to a personal gym, it may be difficult to keep active at this time.
To help encourage a healthy lifestyle, Promise has started posting simple workouts that students can do at home.
On Monday, March 30, Motivation Monday was dedicated to yoga and meditation. According to Osteopathic.org, participation in yoga can help lower blood pressure, reduce insomnia, as well as increase flexibility, muscle strength, and tone.
Kimmy Glasser, a sophomore nursing major who works in the Promise office, participated by doing yoga on Monday.
“I enjoy doing yoga on a regular basis anyways, so I didn’t mind doing it this week,” Glasser said. “Promise chose to include yoga as its physical activity for this week because it is easy to do at home and you don’t need much space or materials to do yoga.”
“Although we didn’t post anything on instagram for it this week, there was an email sent out to students, and that email itself made me want to do yoga,” Glasser said.
Promise will be posting daily activities that students can participate in at home, such as online bingo, Netflix trivia, and online lectures for you to attend. Head to @postliupromise on instagram for more details.

Since in person classes ceased, several majors were impacted for various reasons. Health Science majors do not have access to laboratories and theatre majors cannot use the school’s stages to perform. One major that was greatly affected was game design.
“Right now, we are using discord and Zoom to co-work, communicate, etc., and it’s been running smoothly,” junior game design major, Imani Harvey, said. “The university hasn’t really helped other than telling the professors to record their Zoom sessions.”
Students are expected to work and create at home without teacher guidance or one on one help. If someone does not understand an assignment or lesson, it is a lot harder to explain it virtually.
A vital part of the game design major curriculum is to get people to test their games. Without them, it is difficult to receive feedback.
“To be honest, some classes are very presentation based in that we often show off the work we’ve brought in. sure, it is still possible to do so online via screen sharing, but the ease of showing work in person is lost,” Alex Nicoletta, a senior game design major, said.
Another huge problem is that the students are staying away from making multiplayer games, which require more than one person on the same monitor. Also, some students cannot even create games without the technology provided by LIU.
In the game design labs, expensive software is readily available and is all in one place. There are some students that don’t even have personal computers.
“The digital design major works exclusively on higher end macs with programs that require a subscription like Autodesk Maya and creative cloud,” Julia Singh, a senior Game Design major, said

As universities around the country transition to an online format, a new problem has developed, getting in the way of students’ education. That problem is a practice known as Zoom bombing.
Zoom bombing is what is known as the hijacking of Zoom meetings by users who are not supposed to be in the session. People who invade the Zoom sessions are often malicious, using profanity and racial slurs.
CBC News reported that many of these “bombers” are causing disturbances in classes all over the world.
Professors and Zoom meeting hosts can prevent unauthorized users from entering sessions by adding a password to enter the meeting and avoiding sharing the link to the session on any social media.
Post has yet to experience any known distracting or inappropriate Zoom bombs, according to faculty.
“I don’t think we have any Zoom bombers because the students at Post are more respectful of their faculty and education than the people who enjoy things like this,” BrayLynn Willis, freshman musical theatre major, said. “We don’t have time to mess around like that if we want to get the most out of our spring semester.”
Sarah Henderson, freshman pre-veterinary technology major, thinks that students who now take high school and college classes online have a hard time taking work seriously because they are at home.
“Virtual school is just so distracting compared to real classes. Students pay to be in a more professional environment,” she said. “Also, the added anonymity lets people do whatever they want.”
While Post does not have any known harmful Zoom bombers, classes online are not taken as seriously as they were on campus by some students.
“In some of my classes, students get really off topic in the chats,” Henderson said. “Also, most of my classes don’t use cameras and everyone is muted, so some of the other people will not be paying attention … It’s annoying because the professors are trying to get used to the technology and still teach too.”
Willis agreed with Henderson that students are a lot less interested than if they were being instructed face-to-face.
“You can tell when people are on their phones and aren’t engaged in class,” Willis said.
Despite the distractions, Breanna Sheivdayal, a freshman biology pre-medical major, thinks that Zoom classes are as efficient as they can be.
“It’s everyone’s best option right now,” Sheivdayal said. “And people will act up whenever they can, it’s super uncalled for and disrespectful because teachers and students alike are putting in the effort to attend online classes and people who don’t take it seriously are taking away from others’ learning.”
Sheivdayal said she thinks Zoom bombers will get bored soon, or teachers will learn to take more precautions to keep unauthorized users out of their class meetings.
“Maybe professors should try to keep classes more engaged too,” she said.
“They could make it a requirement for students to participate at least once in a class if they feel that people aren’t paying attention or are disrupting the class.”
Willis also believes that professors should take action to improve Zoom classes rather than speculating on Zoom bombers and class inattentiveness.
“Focusing on how to make Zoom classes better is more beneficial for the learning community than making videos of Zoom bombers for people to make a joke out of on social media,” she said.

Raiquan Clarke, a men’s basketball senior, was recognized by the East College Athletic Conference for his play this past season, giving him all All First Team ECAC honors.
Clarke had an outstanding season for the Sharks, leading the NEC with 19.9 points per game, which also ranked him nationally at 29th. He became LIU’s all-time leading scorer the 2019-20 season, becoming the first ever to score 2,000 points, and finishing his career with 2,030 in total, ranking him 8th all-time for the NEC.
Clarke was also named first-team All-NEC for the second year in a row. Clarke started his career as a walk-on in 2015, then, following his redshirt for that season, made the starting lineup the following year. After playing on the Blackbirds the previous four years, Clarke wanted to be “2020 NEC champions” in his final season as a Shark.
“During the summer I tried to work out at least three to four times a day. You just have to remind yourself to stay the course because you have goals to reach,” Clarke said.
Derek Kellogg, men’s basketball coach, is impressed with Clarke’s perseverance over the years.
“His progression as a player and leader has grown over his time here, and was instrumental to the success of our program,” Kellogg said. “His lead-by-example personality was always great for our young players to follow and emulate. His senior guidance in the locker room will be sorely missed.”
Kellogg believes it was a huge asset to have a player like Clarke take over a game the way he did.
“Rai had one of the top usage rates of any player in the country. It is a huge advantage as a coach to have a player you can rely on, especially coming down the stretch of games,” he said.
Brandy Thomas, a women’s basketball sophomore, was also honored by the ECAC in 2019, earning the All Second Team award. Thomas was named rookie of the year in the same year by the ECAC, and looked to progress her play from thereon.
“I was looking to expand on my leadership skills and to be able to impact the game in more areas as a sophomore,” Thomas said. “These awards show the hard work I put in when the people weren’t watching. It also shows the trust that my teammates and coaches have in me to put me in positions to succeed.”
Thomas wants to achieve even more in her remaining two years with the Sharks.
“Individually, I will continue to add more things to my game to make me a more versatile player,” she said. “Going into my junior year, I want to elevate our team to ultimately get on a championship level in the NEC.”
Thomas is certain of her teammates’ potential moving forward. “I believe with the progress of my teammates this season, the recruits we have coming in, and the culture that the coaching staff has instilled in us, there should be great things ahead for Shark Nation,” she said.
Head Coach Rene Haynes had positive remarks about Thomas’ development and potential. “Brandy has a great personality and is the kind of player that every coach dreams of having in their locker room,” Haynes said. “She is an intense competitor that always wants to win and it fuels her teammates to want to be better every day.”
Haynes believed it was a huge advantage to have a player like Thomas who would dominate on both sides of the court.
“She expanded her game which allowed her to score in a multitude of ways which made her a huge component to our success on the offensive end,” she said. “Defensively it was great to see Brandy step up and guard some of the best players in the other teams when we needed her to. She was always willing and ready whenever we called on her to get the big stops that we needed.”

Softball was among all other NCAA teams whose season was cut short due to concerns surrounding the new coronavirus. The softball team was on a high note, with a seven-game win streak and a record of 14-12, when their season abruptly ended.
​The Sharks were projected to win the Northeast Conference this year. They were 16 days away from what would have been their first conference matchup and home game of the season on March 28. Although the Sharks never got the opportunity to face off in any conference play, the Sharks had the best overall record within the conference.
​Head Coach Roy Kortmann commented on how excited he was about his team coming together. The members were beginning to develop an understanding of their identity and how they could work together to win games, according to him.
​“I thought we had a chance for a special season,” Kortmann said.
Despite their short season, the Sharks were able to perform at a high level and earn a reputation within the NEC. Two position players, Kiana Cisneros and Tallie Woodson, earned NEC player of the week. In addition, three pitchers, Victoria Lowe, Elena Valenzuela, and Maya Avila, earned NEC pitcher of the week throughout the season.
​The team was in Florida, with three games left to play in the Sunshine State before heading back to New York, when they learned about the ending of their season. Kortmann said that when he delivered the news to his team, members shared a lot of tears and hugs. However, through such devastation, Coach Kortmann shared a memory from that day that he says was, “A moment I will never forget.”
​
“When I got back to the dugout, I turned around to the field and noticed our underclassmen were helping our seniors go through part of our senior day ceremony,” Kortman said. “Each senior had gone to their respective positions and taken off their cleats to leave on the field, symbolic of their footprints left on our program. The underclass athletes were then carrying each of them off the field, just as the seniors have carried them for the past years. It was spontaneous and heartwarming.”
​Since the start of nationwide stay-at-home orders, the team stayed in contact daily through Zoom meetings and other forms of connecting. ​As for coach and his staff, they stay “quite busy,” monitoring their current student athletes’ success rates in the classroom and scouting for upcoming seasons, according to Kortmann. ​Looking forward to next season keeps him and his staff energized and excited.
