Dorianna Valerio, The Pioneer’s Editor-in-Chief from 2013-2014, contacted The Pioneer in response to Angela Alfano’s editorial in the March, 2 issue about the struggle journalism majors face at LIU Post.
That was very well written. It really is a sad situation. I faced some adversity as a staff writer and then as the coeditor-in-chief, but there was a slightly more open path of communication between administration and The Pioneer’s journalists. Not a lot, but much more than what it seems your staff has. The relationship between student journalists and the school’s administration is a complex one. Customer service and journalism are like water and oil in LIU’s case.
As journalists, we should never expect any source to help us even if it’s for something that sheds light in a positive way and would be in their best interest to speak on. As a student, you should expect that the school provides you the adequate tools to be successful in your field of choice. However, when that is journalism — the school administrators are still a business and want to protect their image. That’s a tricky place to be in. If they help you willingly then they are providing top notch customer service and can expect you to only produce favorable articles since they provided great services. Think about when you order food. The food comes on time and taste good. The company than is expecting you to give it a high rating because they met your needs. Better to be on the side you’re on than in bed with the devil.
As journalists — please expect a sources’ door to be closed on you time and time again. If you’re a journalist working within a business, (which is LIU), the threat is scary for them. The Pioneer is a credible newspaper and hard hitting stories can be especially damaging to them. I’m not saying what they are doing is right because it’s not, but as a business, they have the right to refuse to speak to reporters. It’s not fair, but using your platform to raise awareness about Post’s secretive ways is absolutely the best and professional way to do it. Don’t expect to get any more support from them. There are plenty of stories to tell — keep writing. Keep including in your articles that the school refused to comment. Don’t back away from the harder stories because you don’t have a comment from administration. I know you want to be fair and balanced, but understand that you are systematically being silenced. At this point you have no other option but to tell the stories the only way you can. Reach out to everyone and continue to include in your stories their continual refusal to comment. At the end it looks bad on them from a business perspective (if I were a graduating high school senior and I read the school’s paper and all the stories included “refused to comment” I wouldn’t waste my time). You do everything you can do with the cards you are dealt. Be fair. Be honest. And don’t give up.
Also, don’t be afraid to write and find stories outside the school for your own personal blogs/websites. While Professor Levin would love you all to have real experience working on a newspaper, she understands the value of great pieces for a great portfolio and will always work with you on any journalistic projects you undertake. Real world journalism is fun. Don’t be discouraged. Good luck!

At least five times a day, I get a notification on my phone telling me that I have low storage. Most of the time, I just want to throw the device against the wall. However, I end up either ignoring it or doing what Apple calls “managing my storage.” As I manage the storage of my phone, I am able to see what is taking up most of the space and, I have to say, a good amount of it is apps.
What exactly is an “app” and what is the purpose of downloading them? Also known as “applications,” they range from social media, like Facebook or Instagram, to news sources, like The New York Times, to productivity, like Dropbox. The main thing with apps is that they have this notion attached to them that their purpose is to be helpful tools that make the user’s life easier and save them time, since everything they need is practically right in these apps.
However, the real question is: are these apps are useful or just deceiving and actually a huge waste of time? Personally, I am not quite sure what the answer to this question should be.
It depends on the app. For example, take a look at social media apps. Apps like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, sure make it a lot easier for users to check their respective accounts and be constantly connected to their social world. However, I think that social media apps are the biggest waste of time that there is. Most of the apps on my phone are social media apps. I have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr. My account for each of these platforms is always connected through these apps, which means there is never a moment that I am logged out of my social media platforms. Yes, this makes my social life a lot easier, I get to check all of my notifications the moment I receive them; but is it really making my life easier that I am constantly connected? There’s never a moment that I can back away and concentrate on one specific thing.
The apps keep me connected, but simultaneously distract me from more productive things I could be doing. Forrester Research, a research and advisory firm for business and technology, did a study reported by TechCrunch in which they found that 1.25 billion monthly use the Facebook application, social network apps in general claiming more than 25 minutes of use per day.
Apps that provide news, such as newspapers or magazines, can be a bit more constructive. Before the creation of applications, one would have to buy a newspaper or search online for the news source. Now with apps, people are able to receive notifications the minute the news breaks. Regardless of my preference for the physical publication, I do concede that news apps help keep users in the loop and can be beneficial. According to Forrester Research, a sports app can take up to 3 percent of usage minutes, while users show a higher interest in news apps. According to the report, they spend a median of 11 minutes and 51 seconds per day on these apps.
One of the biggest categories in the app store is “productivity.” These applications are designed to make the user’s life easier in terms of their work or school life, or really any aspect of their life that they want to keep organized. According to Forbes, there is currently a huge demand for productivity apps and people just keep creating more. Some sell for as much as $40 whereas others are free.
Most of these apps consist of to-do lists, emails, virtual notebooks, calendars and other organizational tools. There is even an app that through algorithms learns your behavior and suggests different ways that you could get things done.
I love the idea of these types of apps, but I always download them, use them for maybe two or three days, and then completely forget about them.
Call me old school, but I am still the type of person who likes to have an actual physical planner, or a piece of paper and pen to write my to-do list on. I think that in the time you take to download the app and update all your information into it, you could already have written down all your tasks in your calendar or to-do list. That’s my personal preference, but I do see how these apps can help people be productive and stay organized with all the different options they might offer.
Gabrielle Nau, sophomore radiology major and the vice president of membership for the Delta Zeta sorority, says that her organization uses the GIN System app, available to organizations of all shapes and sizes, providing an interactive dashboard. Nau claims that the sorority uses it particularly to keep good organization and communication throughout their chapter.
“GIN System has so many great tools such as calendars, text and email reminders, lists of members with all their important information, and even a section that we can upload all important documents,” she said. “Our officers can easily contact any member through the GIN app or GIN emails which can be customized to be sent automatically, or write them manually and send them to whomever you need. Without this system, our chapter wouldn’t run as smoothly as is does.”
So, are applications beneficial or a waste a time? I am not quite sure. Apps can be very useful and productive, but it mainly depends on what each individual uses them for. An app can be designed with the purpose of making the user’s life simpler, but in reality it could just take away from their time, whereas someone else might be able to make the most of their time with the same application. I believe that smartphones themselves are highly distracting, because it’s hard for any application on a smartphone to be non-distracting. It all depends on personal preference and how people use their applications for productivity without letting other factors waste their time.

It is no secret that the advent of social media has propelled the celebrity profile to astronomical heights. Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Rihanna, Drake, even Donald Trump, have profiles so big that just one tweet, or one action by any of these people can rule headlines for days. Celebrity influence goes past the headlines and tabloids. No matter the age or demographic; celebrities can change, even dictate, the way people live their lives. This phenomenon is known as ‘celebrity worship’, and it’s a bigger, much more serious problem than most people think. In fact, some psychologist and social anthropologists agree that celebrity worship can be classified as a mental condition, dubbing the condition ‘Celebrity Worship Syndrome.’
Dr. Stuart Fischoff, a spokesman for the American Psychological Association and contributor to WebMD, believes worshipping celebrities may just be in our DNA. “What’s in our DNA, as a social animal, is the interest in looking at alpha males and females; the ones who are important in the pack,” said Fischoff, in an interview with WebMD.com. “We are sociologically preprogrammed to “follow the leader,” and perhaps by following the influence of these ‘leaders’ we learn how to gain an edge in our society.”  This proposition is something social anthropologist Jamie Turino elaborated on during an interview with BBC News in 2013. “Celebrity worship actually holds a higher purpose and that purpose is cultural learning,” said Turino, who believes that by following celebrities, we “learn what to do and what not do in order to gain more social status ourselves.”
What makes these celebrities leaders? It’s quite simple; they’re dominant members of our global social group. If simplified from global terms, a teenage girl who follows the influence of a Kim Kardashian, in essences, translates to that same teenage girl following the influence of her mother, coach, or teacher. However, that’s where I have a fundamental problem with Celebrity Worship Syndrome, if it indeed is a syndrome.
I find it extremely unhealthy that some people view celebrities as a primary source of influence for many reasons. Why should anyone follow a celebrity’s influence if chances are that celebrity has no idea that you even exist? I find this problem to be exponentially exaggerated by social media. Take Rihanna, for instance. The talented and beautiful singer-songwriter currently has a following of over 57 million people. That’s more than double the population of Australia [23.13 million people] and crushes the population of Canada by more than 20 million people [Canadian population 35.16 million people]. Social media is rewriting the social handbook for human beings.
By following these mega-stars on social media, mostly young people follow the influence of these celebrities to ends of the earth. Often celebrities, such as Rihanna, may become the primary influence in a young person’s life.  How?  It’s simple. Rihanna’s music, and the messages in her songs, can be played 24/7, and the fact that people can interact with her through social media may give people the impression that they have an actual relationship with Rihanna. However, they do not. The only relationship is an inorganic one at best, filled with disillusionment, that’s largely exemplified through social media.
Long Island psychologist Abby Aronowitz, PhD, seconds my notion on how extreme celebrity worship can get and how social media enables this condition. In an interview with WedMd, Aronowitz said. “Information about the celebrity, or any little thing from their life, is like a fix the worshipper must have — they are almost compelled to learn more, read more, know more. And it’s non-ending.”
Celebrity Worship Syndrome isn’t just a problem that faces the ‘average Joe or Jane.’  In fact, corporations often deal with the same problem. Take Nike, for instance. Last year, Nike announced that it had “signed LeBron James to a ‘lifetime’ contract.” Speculation is that the deal will be worth more than $500 million, with some estimates making it a $1 billion contract according to Matt Powell in Forbes magazine. Contracts like these just shows how important dominant members of society are, and what a great influence on society they have.  Celebrity Worship Syndrome is a societal problem that is amplified by social media, and if not capped I believe masses of people will devalue traditional role models such as parents, teachers and coaches, for the likes of celebrities who, I believe, are not sufficient role models in our society.

In a world of essays to write and textbooks to read, it is easy to forget the fact that our planet’s environment is in a downward spiral. But two seniors in the Post Theatre Company, Cameron Clay and Laura Chamberlain, found the perfect way to combine academics with reminding people about the consequences of climate change in their thesis show, “Unless.” The show was made up of vignettes, stories, and raps on topics such as pollution from plastic companies, the increase in death of polar bears, and how many gallons of water are needed to manufacture products.
The show, which ran March 4 – 6 at the Rifle Range Theatre,  was a collaboration of both cast and audience, with Chamberlain and Clay starting their show saying that the audience was allowed to yell and cheer and participate. Why this change from the traditional separation of audience and performers? “It made it into a more collaborative environment, which really mirrored the message we were trying to share.” Chamberlain said, “[Saving the planet] is up to all of us and we cannot do it alone”. This message was received, as the audience members came up to the two directors after the show and shared the changes they have made, such as buying reusable water bottles and unplugging chargers and lights when not in use. “That was my favorite thing to hear,” Chamberlain said, “People’s actual daily behavior was changed.”
When asked how the topic of environment was chosen, Chamberlain said that it was something that both she and Clay had been very passionate about but were not very educated on. “There was one rehearsal in which we were talking about the two degrees Celsius mark which is called the Tipping Point. [This is] when the earth’s temperature increases by two degrees Celsius from where it started. Once we reach the two degree temperature increase, we will start seeing a lot of natural disasters; floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires.” The effects can already be seen, as our weather and storms have become more extreme every year. “Personally,” Chamberlain said, “I thought that the Tipping Point was 80 or 90 years from now…” but they learned that it is estimated to start around the year 2046. “[That was the] most shocking piece of information we learned; that the effects we’ll see will be so much sooner than we thought.”
So what can we do? There are the basics of recycling, reusing water bottles, and turning off lights, which everyone knows. Chamberlain offers another answer that if done, would make far more of an impact on protecting our planet. We need to respect it. We need to respect everything from the now polluted bodies of water, to the forests that are being chopped down, and to the animals that are quickly going extinct. “All life is worth saving, all life is worth protecting. All animals, all plants are worth saving,” she says.
With that in mind, Chamberlain hopes that “Unless” teaches people to not be afraid to speak out about the consequences of climate change. “When we first started working on the show, I was someone who cared about the environment but was afraid to go into detail and to preach at people and I didn’t want to be offensive. But don’t be afraid to speak the truth. Be informed and back up what you’re saying, but let people know, because if you tell three people that this is a real issue, those three people can spread it, and spread it, and spread it, and that is so powerful.” So, on that note, go do some research and then tell three other people; it’s our planet we’re talking about.
“Unless” was presented alongside the piece “It All” which was conceived as the honors student thesis of Abby Slocum.

You know I’ve been thinking about you lately.
I’m crazy about you.
There aren’t any words to describe how much I miss you.
We’ve been down this road before, huh?
Don’t worry we’ll be okay,
I’ll show you the way, a different way.
A different me.
It’s my fault really.
I didn’t know how to read before.
Not about the girl who would return to me as the waves that kiss the seashore.
Not about the boy who could not see the light from behind his own shadow.
I was in a dark place afraid of tomorrow.
I found a new path neither good nor bad.
A path shrouded in midnight where we can move the stars and sleep with the wind.
A path shined in the afternoon where we can rest with the clouds and talk with the waves.
This is a new beginning.
We write each other’s stories and caress each other’s souls.
This is the road to dawn,
in between the sun and moon,
smiles and tears,
past and future.
I will learn to read you as you will I,
making history one laugh and cry at a time.
We will travel through love and hate,
joy and pain.
But hey,
What’s sunshine without a little rain?

Niria Leyva-Gutierrez, an assistant professor of art history and museum studies, will host the latest chapter in the Dean’s Lecture Series presented by the College of Arts, Communications and Design on Thursday, April 7 during common hour. Her lecture is titled “Revolutionary Medicine in Mexico: Diego Rivera and the Art of Public Health.”
Leyva-Gutierrez explained that her research on Diego Rivera originated when she was a graduate student. “I started researching this topic as a graduate student many years ago and have recently revisited after conducting more research on the subject and realizing that very little has been written in the art historical literature on this topic,” Leyva-Gutierrez said. “Diego Rivera’s murals have been examined from a multitude of perspectives, but this is an important area that merits more research and interpretation.  This is why I have chosen to continue exploring it.” During the Spring 2016 semester, Leyva-Gutierrez is currently teaching ART 1, Introduction to Visual Arts; ART 60, Survey of World Art 2; and ART 590, Graduate Projects.
The lecture is based on Dr. Leyva-Gutierrez’s current research “which looks at the intersection between art and medicine. Specifically, I will be discussing public health campaigns in Mexico and the work of the famous muralist, Diego Rivera,” Leyva-Gutierrez said. Throughout Diego Rivera’s artistic career, he made several paintings exploring the themes of medicine and surgery. “Rivera’s first surgical theme can be traced to 1920, when he attended and drew the wonders of the surgical operation of Dr. Faure in Paris. The artist was particularly moved by surgical and medical events, and this surgical clinic enhanced his appetite for these important professional activities,” according to Luis Toledo Pereyra, an adjunct professor from the Western Michigan University Department of History, from the article “Diego Rivera and his extraordinary art of medicine and surgery” on the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health website.
Other works by Diego Rivera include “A History of Medicine,” “The Detroit Industry Fresco Cycle,” and “Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park.” According to TheArtStory.com, “The Detroit Industry Fresco Cycle” uses Aztec culture to show how medicine can be both beneficial and harmful to society, through the use of vaccines and lethal gas.
Levya-Gutierrez also explained where her research on Diego Rivera originally developed. “This research developed out of a paper I wrote about anti-clericalism and anti-clerical imagery produced in Mexico during and after the Mexican Revolution,” Leyva-Gutierrez stated. “What I came to realize during my research was that Rivera’s anti-clerical sentiment was in part informed by his commitment to the idea of modern medicine and universal healthcare. For Rivera, his promotion of science was a clear way of undermining the Catholic Church and, as he wrote, its ‘fanciful superstitions.’
The goal of the Dean’s Lecture Series is “to give faculty a venue to present their scholarly and artistic work, to give students and other faculty the opportunity to better understand the interests and passions of others, and to stimulate the academic environment of our campus by providing a place for dialogue and debate on important and artistic topics,” according to Noel Zahler, the Dean of the College of Arts, Communications and Design, formerly known as the School of Visual and Performing Arts. The College has presented the Dean’s Lecture Series for the last two years and tries to present three each semester, according to Dean Zahler. “I don’t believe that students really understand how distinguished our faculty are,” Zahler stated. “All of them are much more than classroom instructors. They pursue scholarly research and artistic creativity as part of their lives. These lectures are ‘a peek behind the curtain.”
Leyva-Gutierrez explained why students should attend this lecture. “This work is original research presented at Post for the first time and students should attend the lecture since it will offer an opportunity to see some of the most fascinating, yet neglected murals by this artist within the context of public health and medicine in Mexico.” The lecture will be held on Thursday, April 7, in The End Zone in Hillwood Commons from 12:30-1:50 p.m.
To reserve a seat, email post-cacd@liu.edu or call 516-299-2395.

Freshman catcher Julia Seader stole the show in the softball team’s first of two games against Adelphi University on Wednesday, March 16. The freshman drove in all four runs for the Pioneers and called a great game as the Pioneers won 4-0.
Seader kick-started the offense in the first inning; sending a shot to the gap in right-center to plate the first run of the game. One inning later, she was back and this time with the bases loaded. On the first pitch, Seader singled home two runs. And just for good measure, in the top half of the seventh inning Seader smacked a solo homer to right field, giving the Pioneers and insurance run that Ashley Martin wouldn’t need.
The junior hurler went the full seven innings, allowing a measly three hits and seven strikeouts. She upped her win total on the season to three with the complete game victory. Seader finished with three hits and four RBIs and just a triple short of the cycle.
In the second match on the day, Adelphi flipped the switch both offensively and with their pitching. The offense, completely shut down just hours earlier, drove in seven runs in the game’s opening two frames and scored 11 runs for the game on 11 hits. The Pioneers meanwhile, totaled just five hits and scratched two runs across home plate.
Head Coach Jamie Apicella and his squad, originally tagged with a double-header on Sunday, March 20, against Stonehill College, got hit with a cancellation because of inclement weather conditions. The Pioneers are set to return to field on Thursday, March 24, when they open up their home schedule against the University of Bridgeport. First-pitch from the LIU Post Softball Complex is scheduled for 2 p.m.

An eruption of 11 unanswered goals in the opening stanza proved to be the deciding factor for the fourth-ranked women’s lacrosse team (5-1) on Wednesday, March 16. The team took care of business in a 17-5 blowout win against Philadelphia University (1-2) in a non-conference showdown at Ravenhill Field in Philadelphia, PA.
The first half was highlighted by senior attacker Emily Delaney and freshman midfielder Ryan McKinney, who scored three goals apiece. Senior defender/midfielder Honey Roche also got a slice of the action, netting two scores for the Pioneers. Offensively, the Pioneers were extremely efficient, scoring on 11 of their 14 first half shots.
The Pioneers outscored the Rams 6-5 in the second half to complete the script and win their third-straight game. Delaney was impressive, finishing with a game-high eight points (3 G, 5 A). McKinney continued her standout freshman campaign, as she racked up five points along with junior attacker Connor Bird. Bird also won three draws for the Green and Gold while Roche had another field day, winning five face-offs and causing two turnovers.
In the cage, sophomore goalie Olivia Kirk totaled five saves and senior net-minder Kasey Kephart rejected one shot for the visitors.
On Saturday, March 19, the Pioneers topped their 17-point effort, as they defeated Roberts Wesleyan College (2-5) 18-4, at RWC Lacrosse Field in Rochester, N.Y.
Junior attacker Stefani Vagelatos paced the Pioneers’ offense, tallying seven points (5 G, 2 A) along with Delaney, who finished with a game-high eight points (4 G, 4 A).
After trailing 1-0 in the opening moments of the contest, the Pioneers responded with five unanswered goals and never looked back. Vagelatos and McKinney each scored two goals during that stretch. The Pioneers clicked on all cylinders and took a commanding 12-3 lead into the intermission.
In the latter stanza, the visitors continued to dominate; outscoring Roberts Wesleyan 6-1. Bird capped off the scoring with a free position marker with 1:58 remaining in regulation.
Defensively, Kirk made five saves for the Pioneers, as her counterpart, Shannon Knapp, had nine saves, but gave up 16 scores for the Redhawks. In addition, the Green and Gold held an advantage in nearly every category. The Pioneers outshot the Redhawks 35-9, led in draw controls (21-3), ground balls (13-6) and free-position shots (7-3). The Pioneers were also 10-of-10 on clears.
Head Coach Meghan McNamara and her Pioneer squad return home on Wednesday, March 23, as they prepare to host ECC rival Molloy College. The opening draw is slated for 3:30 p.m. at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.

In the fall of 2014, the LIU Post athletics department became home to the new women’s golf team. With only three semesters of play under their belts, the team has proven they’re wedging their way into the annals of Pioneer sports history, according to head coach Tom Kane.
“The team has been doing quite well. In the fall, we played in four invitationals.  We finished third out of 13 teams, seventh out of 14, fourth out of eight and we won our final tournament, the Revolutionary Collegiate Golf Classic, in Elkton, Maryland,” Kane said.
Kane, who previously coached the golf team at Smithtown High School, is determined to improve upon the team’s success this spring, a determination that is shared, of course, with the golfers. The team consists of six players, two of whom were a part of the initial roster in 2014. Since then, they’ve added three freshmen.
Shelby Townsend, a junior journalism major, and Alanna Jones, a freshman education major, shared their hopes of making this spring a hole in one.
“Our performance in the first few tournaments [last fall] was a little rocky, but I think we are all becoming more experienced, and everyone seems to be consistently improving,” Townsend said.
“For our team being very new, [we’re] working really hard to make a name for the Post golf program,” Jones said.
Kane mentioned that the team has petitioned to join the Northeast 10 – a national athletic conference – next year in order to give the girls more playing time. “That would open up more tournaments for us to play in as well as a conference championship. As of now, we are competing as an independent since the East Coast Conference does not have any other women’s golf teams,” he said. 
Kane admits that he was anxious about coaching a team that was not well established in the athletics department. “I wondered whether we would get enough golfers to compete as a team. Some colleges start at the club level before they attempt to compete as a varsity sport; some take years before they have a full team,” he said. “As it turned out, we were very lucky.”
Kane believes that the growing popularity of girls’ high school golf will be a contributing factor to the number of students willing to try out for the team at Post. Both Jones and Townsend shared that the golf program was a deciding factor in their decision to come to Post.
“It was a goal for myself to play collegiate level golf, so when I looked at schools I only looked at schools with women’s golf programs. It was a definite plus that Post started a golf team,” Jones said.
Townsend said, “I transferred to Post from Loyola University of Chicago. I’d actually never heard of Post until I started contacting golfcoaches on the east coast, and they told me about the new team here.”
In its one and a half years. the women’s golf team has fostered athletic achievements both on and off the green, bringing in tournament wins and prospective students, proving to be a sporting success in the department.
“Golf at the tournament level is very demanding. Like all sports, it requires hard work, discipline and perseverance. Golf also demands sportsmanship, honesty and a spirit of never giving up and always trying your best,” Kane said. “These are lessons our players learn on the golf course, and hopefully will apply to the rest of their lives.”
The golf team placed second at the Revolutionary Collegiate Golf Classic in Elkton, MD. on Saturday, March 19. Hannah Pohalski finished second overall while Jones and Townsend carded a 92 and a 99 respectively. The Pioneers are back on the green on Saturday, April 9, when they tee-off at the Kutztown University Spring Invitational.

After rallying from two-goal deficits on two separate occasions, the eighth-ranked men’s lacrosse team (4-3) fell to Chestnut Hill College (1-5), 14-10, on Saturday, March 18, in an East Coast Conference matchup at Plymouth Whitemarsh Stadium, in Lafayette Hill, PA.
Trailing 3-1 in the first quarter, senior attackman/midfielder Ryan Slane punched in back-to-back markers to tie the game at three. In the second quarter, the Pioneers found themselves behind 6-4 before senior midfielder Anthony Berardis and senior attacker Matt Bellando scored a goal apiece, making the score six-all.
However, the Griffins scored the following three points and led the Pioneers 9-6 near the end of the first half, until senior attacker Matty Beccaris found the back of the net, making it a 9-7 game heading into the break.
Berardis inched the Green and Gold closer in the third quarter with another goal, as he recorded three goals in the contest. That marker brought the Pioneers within one.
It wasn’t long before the Griffins got back on track and shut the door on the Pioneers for good, scoring five unanswered goals putting them ahead, 14-8, in the late stages of the final quarter.
For the guests, Berardis and Slane each netted three goals while junior midfielder Anthony Galeotafiore won 16-of-25 face-offs and scooped up 10 ground balls. Griffins sophomore attacker Dylan Klusaritz racked up a game-high five points (3 G, 2 A). In the cage, junior goalie Matthew Liantonio collected a game-high 10 saves for the Green and Gold.
Head Coach John Jez and the Pioneers seek their fifth victory of the season when they play host to Dominican College on Thursday, March 24, in an ECC battle at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Opening draw is slated for 3 p.m.

Pitching was dominant for the baseball team on Thursday, March 17, with seven strong innings from junior Dan Jagiello. In addition to the length Jagiello provided, he also allowed just one run on five hits and punched out nine members of Bloomfield College. The offense took care of business as well, pushing across six runs en route to a 6-1 victory.
The scoring began for the Pioneers in the first inning when senior first baseman David Groeneveld drove in a run via a sacrifice fly. After another Pioneer run, sophomore outfielder Rob Andreoli drove in a pair on a base knock, which gave the Pioneers a 4-0 lead.
After a Bloomfield run trimmed the lead to 4-1, the Pioneers responded with two more runs to put the game firmly in hand. Sophomore shortstop Joe Spitaleri and sophomore designated hitter James Cohan both had three-hit performances.
The Pioneers returned to the diamond on Friday, March 18, when they faced off against the University of New Haven in a non-conference game in Conn. After surrendering a five run lead and giving up seven unanswered runs, the Pioneers rallied for a combined three runs in the ninth and tenth innings to win 8-7 in thrilling fashion.
The Pioneers got out of the gate strong and delivered the first punch; scoring three runs in the first inning. Junior catcher Thomas Asbaty and Groeneveld each had run scoring singles and in the third inning, Groeneveld hit his second home run of the young season, making it a 4-0 Pioneer lead.
New Haven finally broke into the run column in the sixth inning and pushed two runs across. Their bats stayed hot in the seventh inning too, adding four more runs and subsequently giving New Haven a 6-5 lead. New Haven added another run in the eighth inning, giving them a 7-5 advantage.
In the top half of the ninth inning, the Pioneers were staring at a two run hole. After a one out base hit by Spitaleri, Asbaty kept the pressure on with a double, putting the tying run in scoring position. Following a fly out, head coach Mike Gaffney looked to his bench in the most crucial spot in the game. Cohan, fresh off the bench, came through in the biggest way; belting a ball to deep center and tying the game with a two-out two-run triple.
In extra innings, the Pioneers won the game with some fundamental baseball. Freshman third baseman Jimmy Mendyk reached on a two-out hit and stole second base a few pitches later. Then, with two strikes on him, Andreoli plated Mendyk with the game winning single. Freshman reliever James Varela, who earned his second win of the season, went 3.1 innings and struck out four.
The Pioneers have improved their record for the season to an even .500, at 8-8. Due to inclement weather and poor playing conditions, the Pioneers’ Sunday, March 20, double-header against Le Moyne College was cancelled and does not have a re-scheduled date as of yet.
Gaffney and Co. are back in action on Thursday, March 24, when they host Molloy College in the first of a four game set over a five day span. First pitch from the LIU Post baseball field is set for 3:30 p.m.

LIU Post is an open campus to the public and its students.  Anyone can enter freely and leave when they wish. There is no security that monitors who enters and leaves campus from either main entrance on Northern Boulevard.
During the week before spring break, a man who is allegedly neither a student nor an employee of LIU entered campus and was seen wandering around, approaching several female undergraduate students.
According to Alyssa Estevez, a senior public relations major, the man approached her on Wednesday, March 2 at approximately 11:15 a.m. outside Humanities Hall. Estevez described the man to be around 23-25 years old, of the Indian race, short and with a scruffy beard. He was wearing a leather jacket and plaid shirt. The man was wandering around campus, randomly approaching girls, starting conversations and asking them a bunch of questions, according to Estevez.
Estevez described her conversation with the man as follows: “Hey, I don’t mean to bother you and I know you’re way out of my league, but I just wanted to tell you that you’re very pretty.” She stated that she replied, “Oh, thank you,” and when he proceeded to try to ask more questions, she continued walking. She said, “He then asked me for a hug because I made his day, which I politely declined. He said that he was on his break but he looked like he didn’t even go to school here. He even went to try and kiss me, but I had to quickly say that I was married so he could leave me alone. I literally almost ran to class because it freaked me out!”
A similar situation occurred to Jacklyn Stringham, a senior public relations major, on the same day. “I never would have believed it if my friend Alyssa didn’t run into class describing the same situation I had to deal with about 2 minutes before,” she said. “He randomly came up to me and started to speak to me and ask me about a million questions. He told me that he goes here, but for some reason I really don’t think he does.”
Public Relations professor Arlene Pelota said that the students handled the situation appropriatley. “It’s hard on an open campus, because you can’t discriminate against people, and you have to allow everyone to come in. This is why I have always taught my daughters to make sure they are aware of what is happening around them. Situations like this happen all the time, and can have a worse outcome. I’m so glad our students were smart enough to get away from him as fast as they could.”
Another incident involving an individual who was allegedly not a student occurred on campus on Thursday, March 17. LIU Post sent a campus-wide email at 5:39 p.m. on that date alerting the community that an incident had been reported to Public Safety. The four sentence email revealed only that “Public Safety and local response units were on site” and encouraged individuals to, as always, “be alert, exercise caution for their personal safety, and report any suspicious activity to Public Safety at (516) 299-2222.” The e-mail did not state what the “incident” was.
Upon receiving the first email, Courtney Kay, a senior psychology major, immediately left her experimental psychology class and called Public Safety. “The email was so vague. They didn’t even say whether we were safe or not,” she said. “When I called Public Safety, they said they couldn’t tell me anything,” Kay continued. Stunned by their words, she asked if students were safe on campus, and the Public Safety representative replied that students are safe. Kay said she found out that a girl had been found handcuffed with a bag over her head later that night from reading Newsday online.
The Pioneer received reports from students and faculty that helicopters were flying above campus grounds on March 17 and that the gates at the entrances had been locked, with a Public Safety vehicle presence.
The university sent an email update about the incident at 6:57 p.m. on March 17, informing the campus community that a 27 year old female had been found near campus and that it was a purported suicide attempt. According to a representative from Public Safety, the location of the incident “technically was 2-feet off” campus grounds and the young woman was a former LIU Post student.
Local news media reported on the March 17 incident as well. News 12 Long Island reported that “a young woman was found in a wooded area near the LIU Post campus Thursday afternoon, but she does not appear to be a victim of assault. Detectives tell News 12 that the woman was not attacked. They believe she tried to kill herself.” Newsday reported that “Nassau County police confirmed that a 27-year-old woman was found on Thursday, March 17, 2016, by LIU Post security guards, who heard screaming for help in the woods near the school. Police said the woman, who had not been identified on Thursday evening, had her hands tied behind her back and a bag taped covering her head. Police said the woman, who attempted to commit suicide, was taken to a hospital, although they said she had no apparent injuries.”
The Nassau County Police Department referred The Pioneer’s request for information about the incident to the Matinecock Police Department, and the Matinecock Police Department did not provide the public record of the incident.
According to a Public Safety representative, because the matter at hand was declared a suicide attempt, it does not qualify as a public record. Thus, Public Safety stated that there is no incident report available from the university.
The office of Public Safety has not responded to multiple inquiries from the Pioneer about the wandering guest who approached students on March 2. According to the Public Safety page on the LIU website, “The Department of Public Safety is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors on the LIU Post in Brookville, NY. We provided safety and security services by foot, bicycle and vehicle patrol 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Public Safety Officers on the LIU Post are licensed by the State of New York and are trained, certified and registered pursuant to the New York State Security Guard Act of 1992.”

The national sorority Sigma Delta Tau (SDT) has reestablished its Beta Theta chapter on campus this spring. SDT’s main goal is to encourage and empower women to reach their fullest potential in everything they do.
SDT was founded at Cornell University on March 25, 1917. Next year, the national sorority will celebrate its 100-year anniversary.  It was founded by seven women, all of whom had previously been experiencing discrimination due to their religious backgrounds. That’s what lead them to form their own sorority. It became a place for all of them to bond, and encourage each other. Today SDT is partnered with Jewish Women International, Prevent Child Abuse America, and Women for Women International. All three of these organizations’ main focus is empowerment, which is exactly what SDT stands for.
SDT had a chapter on campus that was recognized in 1967. The sorority maintained recognition until the early 1990s. Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, said, “Our records do not indicate why they were removed, but we are so excited to partner with Sigma Delta Tau and welcome them back to LIU Post.”. Beth Gruber, SDT’s National Council Extension Chair, said, “We have wanted to return to the Brookville campus for many years and were thrilled when the campus was open for sorority expansion and SDT was selected.” SDT was selected by the Greek Council for LIU Post Greek organizations.
Courtney Kristan, who graduated from SUNY Geneseo, and Talya Laster, who graduated from University of Maryland, are SDT’s leadership consultants, living on campus to assist with the start up of SDT. They are currently living in Post Hall to make it more convenient for all of the new sisters of SDT. Kristan said, “It’s great being able to meet sisters from all around and forming relationships with each one of them.” Kristan and Laster are leadership consultants for SDT, which means they go to campuses to train and guide the new sisters of SDT.
The newly formed chapter has been selecting women to become a part of SDT. Selection of the founding class of 30 members took place on February 19.  Initiation and installment of the chapter is set for the end of the spring semester. All of the new members will be considered a founder of the LIU Post chapter.  “As founders, these women will get to leave a lasting legacy and make their mark at LIU Post. That is a tremendous opportunity,” said Gruber. These founding women have the opportunity to make it their own, and set up traditions in their chapter that will be passed on.
With the addition of SDT, there are now six sororities on campus.

Senior week, a week full of activities for the graduating class, is put together by representatives of the senior class and the office of campus life.   Events will begin on April 20 and last through May 6. “Senior Week, which occurs at the end of each spring, is one of our favorite events in Campus Life. We love giving seniors the opportunity to celebrate their commencement, reflect on their time at LIU, and end their career in a fun and memorable way,” said Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life.
The kick-off to senior week will begin with the Senior Grad Fair on April 20 and April 21. The fair will take place in Hillwood Commons 11a.m. to 3 p.m. and will serve as a one-stop shop for graduating seniors.
