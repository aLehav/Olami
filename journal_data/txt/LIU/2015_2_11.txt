According to a 2014 report from the nonprofit group Complete College America, graduating in four years is a myth for most college students. Only 19 percent of full time students at public universities gain their bachelor’s degree in four years.
Most students enter LIU Post anticipating to graduate within this timeframe. In reality, most students do not obtain their degrees within this allotted time. LIU Post is only at a 22 percent four-year graduation rate, according to a 2013 ranking by U.S. News College Rankings and Reviews.
In an effort to increase this rate, LIU Post has instituted a new policy allowing students to enroll in more than 18 credits, at no additional cost, above the flat-rate tuition charge. Beth Wilkow, Dean of Enrollment Services, said that the new policy began during the fall 2014 semester. However, she stated that prior to the new policy, students were already allowed to enroll in more than 19 credits. In the past, students who took more than the 19 credits were required to pay an extra fee above the tuition rate, and had to get permission from the chairperson of their department. With the new policy, students aren’t required to pay a fee; however, they are still required to speak to the chairperson of their department before going forward with any final decisions.
“I think the updated policy is a step in the right direction to hav[e] students graduate on time, but incoming students are usually unaware of the policies they can take advantage of, which is why many of them don’t graduate on time,” said senior Criminal Justice major, Kaity Lopez. “If the administration made all incoming students aware of this policy, the possibility of having students graduate within the promised time would be greater,” Lopez said. Taking more than 18 credits a semester isn’t unusual for Fine Arts students. Cara Gargano, Chairperson of the Department of Theater, Film, Dance & Arts Management, said that her students have been known to take as many as 24 credits a semester.
“I have a friend who took 27 credits last semester!” said Deana Albro, junior Music Education major, who happens to be taking 22 credits herself this semester. She mentioned that because Music Education carries the same workload as someone who is double majoring, the fact that she can take extra credits at no extra charge has become really helpful. “A lot of required music classes are only offered every couple of years, so I’m really glad I can take over 18 credits without having to feel like I need to catch up,” Albro said.
The Complete College America report emphasized the fact that some students take too few credits per semester, fail to register for mandatory classes, or lose credits after a transfer. Although this is an issue many college students face, Jackie Nealon, Vice President for Enrollment and Campus Life, said that LIU expects to have the new policy influence a positive change, affording more flexibility for students in schedule planning.
“We encourage students to think carefully about the amount of credits they take on each semester. When students carry high credit loads, the academic demands and time required to meet them make the work especially challenging, and may not be the best way to achieve your educational goals,” Nealon said. “Students should work closely with faculty and advisors to ensure that the coursework they pursue is right for the individual student.” Nealon added that completing a degree on time is possible. One of the most effective ways to do so is to take college or AP courses while still in high school, and to enroll in the winter and summer intersessions that the university offers.

Out of an interest in expanding LIU Post’s library collection, library faculty weeds books from their collection, which consists of about two million items. The process, according to Valeda Dent, Dean of University Libraries, is ongoing and happens year around.
However, some students feel as though that the library should keep the books instead of weeding them out. “I feel like we are becoming a paperless world, but I always value a physical book,” said Danielle Sposato, a junior English major. “[The library] might as well keep the books, isn’t that what a library is for?”
Even some faculty members have been unnerved by the recent rumors that the library was going to discard many books from its collection. “The library has not communicated the plan to faculty. I’m not sure my response is appropriate until I have more details,” said Willie Hiatt, Assistant Professor of History and Graduate Director of History. “I’m willing to listen, but the biggest concern right now is the lack of transparency in a process that obviously impacts faculty teaching and scholarship.”
“[LIU libraries], like all academic libraries, weed their collections consistently,” Dent said. “At any point in time, the library faculty at both LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn reviews the portions of the collection that they are responsible for, and they make decisions about which materials to keep and which materials to get rid of in order to support [the expansion] of the collection.” The process of weeding is crucial for making space for works that are more timely and up-to-date, according to Dent.
The University library system consists of two main locations – LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn. Currently, the books are segregated categorically: there are special collections, items that don’t circulate, those that have intrinsic value and that researchers and scholars tend to use when they are doing research, digital items, and traditional print
items. Each library faculty member has a background in a specific discipline that is responsible for collection development. Library faculty is required to have a minimum of two Masters degrees, and some have PhDs. “For instance, here, at Post, we have folks that have a background in business and accounting. They are responsible for managing portions of the collection that cover business and accounting,” Dent said. These faculty members make their decisions about which books to weed out based on the current curriculum, as well as changes in the market place and corporate America.
LIU Brooklyn works with Better World Books, a non-profit organization that sends books to other areas of the world that don’t have access to print materials. “Here, at Post, we usually hold on to them and sell them in an annual book sale, so if there are folks that want to buy books and add them to their collection, then they have the ability to do that at very inexpensive prices,” Dent said. However, the materials that are obsolete and lack relevance are discarded, according to Dent.
LIU Post holds book sales either every year or every other year. The Post Library Association (PLA), a non-profit that plans educational and cultural events for the B. Davis Schwartz Library, usually manages the book sale. The organization then collects the books from the library, organizes the books, and organizes the sale. The proceeds from the sale go to local programming for the campus. Due to a conflict with other campus events, the PLA Book Sale will be postponed from April to a later date, which has not yet been announced.
When books are neither discarded nor donated, they are placed on book trucks at the entrance of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, and students can take those books, free of charge.
“Most libraries will sell the books or donate them, so I understand why they do it,” said Melissa Nosel, a junior English major. “I like when libraries donate them and give others a chance to read them. Libraries shouldn’t just throw out books; they should donate them or sell them to charities if they can.”
In the fall of 2014, LIU added one of the industry’s largest e-book catalog, the catalog will let you know if we have it in print, and if we have it electronically,” Dent said. Titles can be found through the online catalog EBSCO that can be accessed through the LIU Post website.
Students now have access to databases that allow them to stream content. “These are videos that have academic quality and that are copyright cleared so that students have unfettered [right to use them] in their research and in their studies,” Dent said. “Faculty can also embed them in their Blackboard lessons and incorporate more videos in their teaching.”
Books are purchased by library faculty throughout the fiscal year starting Sept. 1, and ending at the end of August by using an acquisition budget. The acquisition budget allows library faculty to make purchases whenever they are needed so there is no deadline by which people need to buy items, according to Dent. The acquisition budget varies year to year, and is not available for public knowledge, Dent added.

In an effort to improve communication between students and professors, the dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts (SVPA), Noel Zahler, has organized a Student Advisory Committee. Zahler hopes that the members of the committee will work with him in refining the departments within SVPA. Unfortunately, because of inclement weather, the committee has yet to meet. The first meeting is now scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 19, at 12:30 p.m.
The committee consists of students from each of the four departments within SVPA; the Art, Media Arts, Music, and Theatre, Film, Dance and Arts Management. Zahler asked the chairperson of each of the departments to suggest two students who would best represent their respective departments. The committee was thus formed with eight students chosen this semester. “Similar to most advisory committees, it is important to get a proper representation from a cross-section of the student population,” Zahler explained.
The focus of this committee is to create goals that will give Zahler an opportunity to work personally with students. Zahler will circulate information directly to the committee to keep SVPA students informed about happenings in the school. “I hope this committee will allow for a better exchange of information between the Dean’s office and SVPA students. In addition to fostering better communication, I hope to build a stronger sense of community among the students and the administration,” Zahler added.
Brittany Mitchell, a sophomore Broadcasting major, is a member of the new Student Advisory Committee. She said that she feels honored to have been asked to be a part of something that affects all SVPA students. “Apart from the leadership abilities I hope to gain by being a member of this committee, I also plan on helping to promote a positive difference within SPVA,” Mitchell said.
Thomas Finn, a senior Broadcasting major, also feels honored to have been selected as a representative of the Media Arts Department. He hopes to show how talented its students and professors are. “I think the committee will help the school by actually getting to hear what the students are saying. There’s a key perspective that some schools don’t consider, and that’s the students,” Finn said. “I’m a student who attends all of my classes every day. I have my own opinions on the curriculum, and I also get to hear the opinions my peers have on the same curriculum on a daily basis. So I’m glad that, as a member of this committee, I can represent my fellow classmates and get their opinions heard too,” Finn explained.
However, senior Broadcasting major Trish Torrales has concerns on what the SVPA Student Advisory Committee will bring to focus. “I hope the student members will be able to fairly reflect the ideas and desires of those who weren’t chosen. I, for one, want the committee to ensure that students’ required courses do not overlap material. There are many classes I’ve taken that feel like repeats of previous courses, and it makes a student feel that they’re wasting their time and money,” she explained.
Despite her concerns, Torrales also sees a lot of the positive outcomes from this new committee. “The SVPA institution has a lot going for it, but it’s obviously not perfect, and to see that they’re trying to create some kind of outreach with the students in order to improve learning conditions is great. Whether they listen to what the students have to say or not will show in time,” she said.
Because of snowstorms in the beginning of the semesters, the first committee meeting had to be rescheduled, and will be held on Feb. 19. Zahler said that because the committee has yet to meet, there is not much to inform about their work, but they will be meeting at least three times this semester, in his new office in the Kahn Building, during common hour.
“There are a few professors in my major that have taught me so much and truly changed my life,” Finn said. “Yet they can only teach a certain number of classes due to their employment status. That’s an insane concept to me. In my opinion, these are the professors that should be teaching an abundance of classes, not just one or two.”

The School of Performing and Visual Arts (SVPA) is welcoming a new program on campus for fall 2015. The Digital Game Design and Development undergraduate B.F.A., as well as the B.F.A/M.A five-year program, will be joining the pre-existing two-year master’s program in Game Design and Development that has been offered for the past five years.
There is no expectation for incoming students to know anything about game design. “The idea is that we teach you every facet of video game development,” said Ramiro Corbetta, Director of the graduate Game Design program and Assistant Professor of Game Design and Development. “We teach video game design, which is coming up with ideas, creating levels. We also teach game programming, the actual code that creates the game. We also teach visual design, which is making the actual art that goes into the game. We do some audio design and some business. So it’s kind of like a program that makes sure that everyone learns every part of game development.”
With this model, it is expected that as students progress through the world of game design, they can choose to specialize in the area that they enjoy the most. The classes offered will not be limited to students in the Digital Game Design and Development major. In fact, students from all departments are encouraged to take the courses.
“I would be interested in taking the courses, but my heavy workload does not allow for leisurely classes,” said Albert Scott, a junior Social Work major.
“The idea of the program is that people will come in, and by the time they leave, they not only know how to make a game, but they know how to make good games,” Corbetta said. The students in the existing graduate program are already having success with their games. Graduate student Scott Tongue, who is in the process of developing a game called Vistics; his game will be shown at the LIU Games booth at IndieCade East, a festival and conference about independent games that is taking place from Feb 13-15 at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City.
The master’s program was started four years ago, and Corbetta became the director in Sept. 2014, having previously taught as an adjunct professor in the program during the fall of 2013. Because the program is relatively new, Corbetta primarily teaches all of the core game courses. Adjunct professors teach some of the other courses, and students are also expected to take courses in other departments, specifically the Visual Arts Department. The Media Arts Department is currently seeking a new full time professor to be the director of the new undergraduate program. The new program will be one of the few undergraduate degrees in gaming in New York.
Although the perception of gaming may seem like a solitary activity, the program will be driven very much by the aspect of community. Students are encouraged to work together to create ideas and to design games together over the course of their college careers. Work shopping and critiquing other students’ work plays a primary role in most of the classes, and the students who are currently taking the courses for the masters program spend a lot of their free time working with Corbetta, as well as the other students in the program.
“In my dream of what the program will become, it would be a group of people with different skills coming together to help people out, and I’d like to see that kind of energy of people excited about making things, and games are something that [are] easy to get excited about making. There are a lot of people who are really passionate about it,” Corbetta said.
It is also very possible that LIU Post will be offering a bachelor’s degree in Fashion Merchandising in the fall of 2014. “Fashion Merchandising is a B.S. degree which our department is creating at the request of President Cline,” said Barbara Fowles, Chairperson for the Media Arts department. “The program has been provisionally approved by the Media Arts faculty, and by the SVPA curriculum committee, pending a review by an outside expert. I do not know the status of this review. The program has not yet been approved by the board, and has not gone to the NYSED, though the paperwork is largely complete.” More information will be available upon board approval.
The Digital Game Design and Development program will begin in fall 2015. For more information on course offerings, please contact Professor Corbetta or Dr. Fowles.

The previous structure of one main ceremony followed by individual ceremonies for each school will be abolished when LIU Post celebrates its 59th annual commencement on Friday, May 8. Instead, two separate ceremonies – one for undergraduates, and one for graduates – will be held under a tent on the Great Lawn.
The Dean of Students, Dr. Abagail Van Vlerah, explained that previous commencement ceremonies have taken five hours, and the university anticipates that this year’s ceremonies will last for less than two hours each.
“This will allow both our undergraduate and graduate degree candidates a more personal and meaningful experience for them and their families and friends, within a much more condensed timeframe,” Van Vlerah said.
Senior Public Relations major Allyson Zaffos thinks the new concept sounds festive, but is not convinced it is going to be less time-consuming than previous commencements. “I am happy I get to graduate alongside friends from different [schools],” Zaffos said. “But it seems unlikely that the [undergraduate] ceremony will last for less than two hours.”
Approximately 1,200 seniors from the campuses of LIU Post, LIU Brentwood and LIU Riverhead will graduate this year, according to Rita Langdon, executive director of Operations.
The undergraduate student ceremony will begin at 9:30 a.m., and the graduate student ceremony at 2:30 p.m. During both ceremonies, each graduating student will be recognized by name, and have a photo taken as he/she crosses the stage – an act that previously took place during each individual school ceremony. The undergraduates’ ceremony will also include recognition of the Valedictorian and Salutatorian, and awards for Distinguished Alumni and Honorary Degree Recipients, while the graduates’ ceremony will include recognition of Distinguished Alumni, Honorary Degree Recipients, and the Teacher of the Year award.
A “Best of the Class of 2015” awards ceremony will be held on Friday, May 1, at 4 p.m. in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall. During this event, approximately 40 students receiving top academic honors – including the Valedictorian, Salutatorian, Academic Excellence Awards, Honors Program Awards, and Dean of Students Awards – will be recognized.
The application deadline to file for graduation is Friday, Feb. 6. Students can fill an application out online at my.liu.edu. Eligible students who fail to apply for graduation by the deadline, or who apply late, run the risk of not having their names included in the commencement program, according the LIU Post website.
Details of the reformatted commencement can be found on the LIU website, at www.liu.edu/post/commencement.

The LIU Post chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon has been ranked 4th in the nation by the fraternity’s Office of the Grand Chapter, first in the northeast region, and first in the New York-Metro province since June 2014 among TKE chapters, despite being a relatively new group that formed in 1989, and then removed from campus in the ‘90s, and was officially brought back in 2013 without full national recognition.

Although TKE is not yet an official chapter at Post, and is still only a colony, they have shown immense capabilities when it comes to expanding the LIU-based fraternity system.
Eric Simonson, a senior Marketing major, has been the president of TKE since 2014. “The Greek system here at Post is growing rapidly, and it can only improve from here. This is a great stage that the Greek system is at, at the moment, and can only develop for the better. It gives fraternities like ours, TKE’s, [a chance] to flourish and win accolades,” Simonson said.
Although many around the world have seen Hollywood films and TV shows depicting fraternity life as crazy, with a drinking-oriented ambition, “We are not like the stereotypical fraternity, where drinking and partying is the main focus point,” Simonson said. “In fact, we almost frown upon that analogy of the Greek system. What we do stand for and encourage is the bettering of us as men and the society we live in. Our slogan is ‘better men for a better world’, and all my brothers and I feel strongly that developing ourselves and our closest friends, as well as the general public, will improve the world.”
“Social development and creating better men to go into the world after we have graduated from Post, and even after hey have begun a different path in the brothers of TKE’s lives, is the most important thing that people will get from this fraternity,” he added.
TKE, or Tau Kappa Epsilon, thrive in trying to make not only their brothers and fraternity better as a whole, but also spread their positivity and drive throughout the Post community. This involves bake sales, charity work, and helping fellow students with any inquiries about anything around school.
Post’s TKE colony has achieved fourth place out of 266 fraternities in the United States for their community service and charitable fundraising. TKE’s fundraising includes raising money for St. Jude’s Children Research Hospital, which is the national charity for the every TKE fraternity across the nation, and their incredible interaction with their alumni.
Recruitment for new members of Tau Kappa Epsilon began on Monday, Feb. 9. “[Recruitment] lasts for two weeks, and we would love to have as many [join] as possible,” Simonson said. Simonson made it clear that TKE does not accept or tolerate hazing. Hazing will not occur to anyone that wants to join, according to Simonson. The members of TKE will be searching for fellow brothers who demonstrate a will to improve their skills as a man, and the will to help the community.

The phones rang lonely in the office of Peter Lipka, the Residence Hall Director of the South Residence Complex on Jan. 23. A group of resident students were without heat prior to Tuesday’s arrival of snow- storm Juno. Nick Lucidi, a senior Accounting major and resident in the South Residence Complex, reported the issue with the heating system the Friday prior to Juno’s arrival on Jan. 26.
Lucidi had noticed the thermostat in the common area of room B34 was off. “The temperature fell noticeably,” he said. His initial call was to Lipka, who, Lucidi said, failed to answer or follow up after he left a message. Lipka, who is also an assistant coach for the men’s basketball team, did not respond to The Pioneer’s request for comment.
Dormitory residents are instructed to call their Residence Hall Director if they have any issues with the room, according to Lucidi. “At first it wasn’t a big deal, it wasn’t too cold, but we didn’t want to have no heat when the big storm came,” Lucidi said. Lipka said he was traveling with the basketball team for a majority of the weekend, which is why he failed to communicate back with the complaint.
Lucidi, along with the others in Suite B34, Phil Armato, a senior Accounting major, and Vincent Branciforte, a junior Graphic Design major, grew anxious as Juno was approaching.
The next call was to Public Safety, who, Lucidi said, “claimed to have reported it to the facilities department.” By Monday, Jan. 26, the South Residence Complex was still without heat when the snow began to fall. “I was hoping to have the issue resolved before the storm,” Branciforte said.
With Juno at its peak and the heat still not working, Lucidi made one final attempt to get the problem solved. This time, he called the Facilities department directly. He said they were shocked to hear about the issue, claiming, “no one reported it to us.” Within two hours, the chief engineer arrived in the dorm room.
When Lucidi asked the engineer about the issue, the engineer said he shut it off because they were getting complaints that it was too hot in the building. With the flip of a switch, the engineer turned the heat and fans back on as per request of Lucidi and his suitemates.
“This is a recurring issue at Post,” Branciforte said. “Everyone claims to want to help you, but if you don’t make it happen, nothing will change. If Nick never called Facilities directly, we would have been without heat for the entirety of the storm.”
Facilities was unable to comment on the matter.

Several department offices have been moved this semester and other department moves are planned in the near future. Offices including the Honors Program, the English Department, the School of Visual and Performing Arts dean’s office, and the Media Arts Department have all been uprooted from their previous homes.
The Honors Program moved from the second floor of Humanities to the Winnick Mansion toward the end of the fall 2014 semester. Although the move itself happened swiftly, the planning process began in the summer of 2014.
“From the time she came to Post, President Cline said that she envisioned the mansion as the academic center of campus, and raised the prospect of moving Honors into that building,” said Dr. Joan Digby, Director of the Honors Program. “We are extremely happy in these new offices, and the students really like having a seminar room and lounge near the central Honors office. It is the perfect location for an Honors College, which we will inaugurate next fall,” Digby added.
The English Department also experienced a change of location at the end of the fall 2014 semester. Previously also located on the second floor of Humanities, the department can now be found in room 210 of the Winnick Mansion. The move, which began in late November, is still in progress, with the rest of the 36 total English department employees expected to finish within the next few weeks.
Dr. John Lutz, Chairperson of the English department, said that the people who work in Facilities have been nothing but helpful with the move. Although the process was a long one, Lutz said that it has definitely been positive. Some of the classes for the English department have been also moved to Winnick, and rather than having the department take up over 20 offices in Humanities, they are now all in one space, which has proven convenient.
“This is a nice space. This is a nice space for students as well. I think the building is beautiful. It’s a pleasant space to get work done,” Lutz said. “We are thinking of having a few events here, such as a murder mystery for the students.”
Lutz said that he would like to get the students more involved with the new location. There is a lounge on the ground level of Winnick specifically for students to come and spend their free time. “This building has a lot of nooks and areas for students to sit in.”
The office of Dean Noel Zahler of the School of Visual and Performing Arts moved from the first floor of Humanities to Kahn Hall before the spring semester began. Dr. Barbara Fowles, the chairperson of the Media Arts department, is scheduled to move from the basement of Humanities into the SVPA dean’s old office this week.
Two public relations professors from the Media Arts department, Abby Dress and Arlene Peltola, have already moved from the basement of Humanities to the SVPA assistant dean’s old office on the first floor of Humanities.
The moves have proven to be a positive experience for the staff, however students have mixed emotions about the ongoing office moves on campus.
“I had to find one of my professors to hand in an assignment outside of class and I assumed I knew where to find them,” Kaitlin Veygel, a junior Broadcasting major said. “It was a good thing I checked with a classmate before I went because they told me the offices were
moved.”Other students have not been negatively impacted by the moves. “I think these office moves were a good decision on Post’s end. I was looking for someone in the English department that I had never met before, and I heard about some of the moves from one of my professors and was easily able to find them without going too far out of my way, which was obviously convenient,” Jake Speigel, a junior Criminal Justice major said.

With the grossly commercialized holiday fast approaching, some students can be seen scrambling to find the perfect gift for their significant other, or booking a dinner for two at the finest restaurant in the area. But for those of us who are sans relationships on the most romantic day of the year, Feb. 14 is just another day.
Being single on Valentine’s Day, or “Singles Awareness Day,” is something I’m very good at since relationships are as useful to me as a bikini in the brunt of a blizzard. My father gave me one, sound piece of advice before I started college: “don’t date anyone too seriously because it’s very hard to make yourself a part of someone else’s life before you’ve even figured out your own.”
So, what do you do on a day that’s specifically designed for couples? You celebrate anyway. Because why should happy people have all the fun? And, just to clarify, I am a perfectly content person, despite being a single lady. If Beyoncé sees nothing wrong with it, then neither do I.
One solution to Valentine’s Day singleness is making one of your fellow single friends your Valentine. I did this last year with one of my guy friends, and it is an awesome alternative to the seriousness of an overpriced, (preferably) candlelit dinner with a S.O. We exchanged simple boxes of chocolate and humorous Hallmark cards, and it was one of the better memories I have about the holiday. Just being able to say I even had a Valentine made me feel just a tad less bitter about being perpetually alone (kidding… almost). And, I got a rose out of it, so that was nice, too.
Another alternative comes from the star-studded movie of the same name. In “Valentine’s Day,” Jessica Biel’s character hosts an anti- V-Day dinner for all of her single friends. Disregarding the fact that she ends up with Jamie Foxx in the end, Biel and her buds enjoy a night of drinking, dancing, and hitting the crap out of an oversized piñata shaped, appropriately, like a heart. The result has a similar effect of getting over a bad breakup: you and your girlfriends (or guy friends, I don’t discriminate) console and celebrate each other while you take your anger out on food and alcohol (and, in this case, a piñata filled with Russell Stover chocolates). You know what they say: two’s a crowd, but three or more is an anti-Valentine’s party.
If you’re more in the mood for me time on V-Day, take yourself on a date! Turn off your phone, because everyone and their S.O. will surely be posting a play-by-play of their Valentine’s Day festivities, and you don’t need to see that on your time. Order your favorite take-out food, buy a pint of Ben & Jerry’s and EAT THE WHOLE DARN THING, because why not? Slip into something more comfortable, like that onesie you got for Christmas; indulge yourself with your favorite romantic comedy, and then cry happy tears when Harry and Sally inevitably end up together. Send yourself roses, splurge on some bling… All of this is only appropriate twice a year — V-day, and your birthday — so live it up, ladies and gents.
But even after hearing all of these alternatives you’re still having FOMO about the V-Day craze, make your own luck, cut your own path… aka, ASK SOMEONE OUT. Girls and guys alike love a partner with some cojones, so take the plunge and see if your campus crush is free Saturday night. Speaking from experience, it’s not as scary as you’d think. Start out with a line that’ll peak their interest, such as “how do you feel about open bars?” This one’s fool proof, trust me. Be calm, cool, collected, casual — the worst thing that can happen is they say no. In the event that this does happen, which I’m not saying it will because anyone would be lucky to date you, feel free to offer yourself to the anti-love alternatives I’ve listed above.
“Love should be celebrated… no matter your relationship status.”
If all else fails, my fellow singles, embrace being alone. Valentine’s Day is not a blaring reminder that we have no one to buy us flowers and candy, but rather a reminder that love — whether it is romantic, platonic, or the kind that comes from yourself — is a worthy thing that should be celebrated, no matter your relationship status.

Many LIU Post students know or have heard of Marvin Johnson, also known as “Mocha.” Mocha is a junior Business Management major, and has won over the hearts of just about everyone he’s met. But how exactly was he donned with the name Mocha?
 
“The nickname came from my senior year track team,” Mocha said. “Three other teammates and I used to rap this song, and one of the parts was done by a member of the group named Mocha. The name stuck to me one day when I was running and I just rapped the song in my head. When I was done running the coach asked me what was I thinking of and I told him heavily breathing, ‘MOCHA,’ and it stuck ever since that day.”
What is it, exactly, that attracts people to Mocha? Is it his boisterous laugh, or his bright smile? “I believe it’s my personality,” Mocha said. “I’m open, just very vibrant. When I meet people, first thing that comes to mind is ‘Oh my god! Let me say hi!’”
“I was in SDA with him, and I love him. He’s really nice and easy to talk to, plus he’s hysterical. He’s definitely a character,” said Mariel Bourie, a freshman Music Education Major.
Mocha considers himself an extrovert, and sees no point in being friends with just one group of people. “Why not be friends with everybody?” he reasoned. Informed that he was well liked on campus, Mocha smiled big and said, “I love how people know me.”
For people who don’t know Mocha, or haven’t met him yet, there are a few things you should know. “I’m an open person,” Mocha said. “If you have a problem, don’t be afraid to come talk to me about it. I don’t blab, you know, this isn’t Pretty Little Liars. I just love helping people out.”
People who know Mocha describe him as fun and hyper. “He’s always energetic, and makes sure everyone has a good time,” said Tatiana Plunkett, a sophomore Psychology major.
“He’s funny and outgoing,” said Cynthia Theodore, a junior Psychology major.
Was Mocha surprised to be named a “Campus Cutie?” He took it as a complete shock.
“I really didn’t know it was possible to beat other amazing people out of this,” Mocha said. “I was like OMG, really? And almost started crying.”
So, does he deserve the title of campus cutie? “I think [the title] would be fitting for him because of his personality and his communication with other students. I think a lot of people are fond of him,” Bourie said.
Mocha explained how he loves Valentines Day, but said that Valentine’s Day doesn’t mean you necessarily have to celebrate it with a significant other. “I celebrate Valentine’s Day with my mom,” he said. “I just love my mommy.”
What’s the best piece of advice Mocha has when it comes to love, lust, and relationships? “Don’t chase love, let love chase you,” Mocha said. “Let them adore you first and then just walk away and let it linger.”

Valentine’s Day is right around the corner, and if you haven’t bought a gift for your Valentine yet, or are short of ideas, here are some suggestions to make your gift memorable and personal. What could be more personal than giving something you have made yourself? Some of these ideas are easy to make, thoughtful, and only cost under $10 each.
1. Make a Love Note Jar.
You need a transparent jar, notepaper, pen and glue. The jar can be bought at Michaels for $1.99 – $9.99, depending on the design. Alternatively, if you, like me, have an old jar sitting around at home, just wash it thoroughly to get rid of any residue. If you want to add some color, drape paper or fabric and glue it
to the lid. Fill the jar with love notes, poems, compliments or thoughts, and memories, such as “I love you because you are you,” or “You are my world.” If you are feeling extra-inspired, make 321 notes, one for each day remaining in 2015. This gift was created and recommended by www.kindnotes.com.
2. Design a Wall Print Frame.
You need a frame, paper, paint or coloring pens. The frame I used is from IKEA, for $1.99, but any frame would do. Target and Michaels also carry frames. Alternatively, if you have an old frame at home, it works just fine; you can give it new life by adding another coat of paint. Make your own personal wall paint frame with your most important dates, such as your first date, anniversary date, engagement or wedding date. Paint or draw your most important date(s) on a piece of paper. Then, put it in a frame of your liking.
3. Seven Days of Love:
You need a seven-day medicine holder, small candies, and note paper. A weekly pill planner compartment can be found at any drugstore, ranging from $2.99- $5.99. Open all the seven lids and fill the compartments with candies and a love note for each day. Candies that easily fit into the small compartments are skittles, nerds, M&M’s and tic-tacs.
For more ideas of how to create your seven days of love gift, go to www.karlamcurry.wordpress. com.
4. Homemade Love Potion Tea
Make your own Love potion tea for your valentine.
You need:
2 teaspoons of black tea
1 pinch of rosemary 3 pinches thyme
3 fresh mint leaves 4 lemon leaves
3 cups water
1 drop of red food coloring
A teakettle
Optional for serving: sugar and honey
Directions: Place all ingredients in a teakettle, with three cups of spring water. Bring to boil then strain and serve. Sweeten with sugar or honey for a sweeter taste. For more ideas to create love potion, go to www.links2love.com.
5. Homemade Heart-Shaped Candy
A super easy recipe for homemade heart shaped candy.
You need:
1⁄2 cup of granulated sugar
6 tablespoons of gelatin powder
1 1⁄2 cups of pink lemonade concentrate 1⁄4 cup of filtered water
2 drops of red food coloring
A heart shaped silicone mold
Optional: powdered sugar
Directions: Mix all ingredients in a pot; slowly bring to simmer while constantly stirring. Take it off the heat when all the sugar has melted. Pour the mixture into heart shaped silicone mold. Leave it at room temperature, until it hardens. If you like, you can coat them in powdered sugar.
If you rather want to aim for the classic Valentine’s Day gift, such as flowers or chocolate, here are two classic ideas with just a little personal touch.
Personalized M&M’s
Chocolate is one of the two most popular gifts for Valentine’s Day. You can personalize your chocolate at M&M stores or order them online.
Customized M&Ms in a red, heart-shaped tote with a window to display the M&M’s and your personal messages is a great gift. Your messages can contain a maximum of nine characters on each of the two lines, or you can choose clip art, prices from $14.99 – $39.99, shipping excluded. The last day to order for delivery before Valentine’s Day is Feb. 12
at noon. For more information, visit www. mymms.com.
Flowers with a message:
Flowers are another classic gift. Instead of buying an already made Valentine’s Day card and signing it, make it more personal by attaching a personal note around the stem of each flower. For example, if you buy a smaller bouquet with three roses, write three different notes. On one note, say, “why I cannot love without you,” – on the second “why I love you,” – on the third “What makes that person special to you.” Depending on how many flowers you buy, you can add small love notes, or if you want to keep it simple, buy a rose and attach a love letter to its stem.
At LIU Post, students prove that a personal Valentine’s Day gift is highly appreciated and fun to make. Edd Costa, a senior English major, described a Valentine’s Day gift he made, “A vinyl record with songs connected to things we did together.”
Gabrielle Messina, a junior Elementary Education major, said that last year she made a personalized gift for her boyfriend. “I filled a mason jar with Swedish fish and tagged it with ‘I am hooked on you.’” Messina explained that her boyfriend is a fisherman, and the gift was very well received.
Heather Weiland, a junior Biology major, said, “One year, I made heart shaped cookies and copied down the sayings from the candy heart sayings.”
Josh Levine, a junior Psychology major, explained how he carries around a personal gift he received from his girlfriend, a metal guitar pick engraved “Forever and Always.”
No matter what gift you give on Valentine’s Day, it’s the thought that counts. Giving a personal gift that you spent time and effort to make really shows how much you care about your valentine, plus it’s fun to be creative and always a great surprise.

“I think it’s unfair that teachers are counting absences. I’m a commuter, and usually take the buses, but even the buses weren’t running properly. I had to go out of my way to get here [after the storm].”— Andrew Kim, freshman Biology major (pictured above)Photo by Alyssa SeidmanAttendance policies are classroom specific. But is that fair?
On the first day of classes every semester, the professors of LIU Post distribute syllabi, and the common concern of many students is the attendance policy. The number most commonly thrown about is three: three absences per semester. What professors do not say is where the gray area is?
What happens if there is an emergency? What if a student is severely ill? Family tragedies? This semester, many Post students were concerned about the weather during the second week of classes, when the Juno storm hit Long Island. According to www.weather.com, parts of Long Island received over two feet of snow. The snowfall started at 6 a.m. on Monday morning and continued heavily throughout Tuesday evening.
LIU Post made an announcement late on Monday night, Jan. 26, that classes would be canceled on Tuesday, Jan 27. The clean-up for this storm was not as severe as Superstorm Sandy in 2012, however, there were some complications.
“My street did not get plowed until 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday night,” said junior Broadcasting major Kaitlin Veygel. “And by then my entire block was one giant sheet of ice.”
According to the LIU website, about 80 percent of students commute to Post. Commuting from Suffolk County, Veygel, much like the greater half of her student body, was not happy to see that school would be open at regular time for Wednesday classes.
The students who attend Post are also not confined to a specific radius around the campus. There are students who commute from outside of Long Island, where various towns and counties all got hit differently with this storm.
Despite the opinions of the administrators who made the decision to hold classes, believing that the campus and roads were safe enough to be on, many students felt otherwise. If the school does not cancel class, many professors go along with what has been decided and continue with their classes.
“When I went to Suffolk Community College, absences were not taken so seriously as here at Post,” Sofia Conigliaro, a junior Journalism major, said. “Of course, if you missed class, your grades would suffer, but I think they had a better understanding that if things come up, people can’t make it to class.”
Should this mentality be passed onto other schools? Absences cannot always be excused with a doctor’s note. Weather conditions are reason enough for missing classes.
Most of the students attending LIU Post are commuter students who could have gotten their drivers licenses as recently as one year prior to coming to Post.
Melissa Weisman, a senior Electronic Media major, said that when she emailed her professors explaining her absence due to the storm, some responded that they understood her reason for missing class, but that her absence would still count against her.
Journalism professor Sandra Mardenfeld said that she always follows protocol when it comes to canceling classes. “If the institution is open, I come,” Mardenfeld said. When asked if she would consider canceling classes due to weather conditions, Mardenfeld said that she considers the commute and unless it is a “suicide mission,” class is in session. During the second week of classes, we saw similar weather conditions without a single day to recuperate. However, the snow accumulation was not as bad as the black ice on the roads, as well as the thick layer of slush-turned-ice that coated sidewalks, and the entirety of campus.
“I commute from Wading River which is very deep in Suffolk,” Leah Fischman, a junior Criminal Justice major, said. “I drive a small car and it does not handle well in the snow, let alone having to drive 52 miles on ice. When I got to campus, there was a thick layer of slush that was just beginning to harden. By the time I got out of that one class to go back to my car, it was solid ice.”
Fischman mentioned that her concern had nothing to do with not wanting to go to class. In fact, she had stayed up well into the night prior to the first snow day to do homework for the next day. When she found out that classes were canceled, she was somewhat annoyed.
The weather conditions were stressful enough, but to attend a school where students are being penalized for staying home due to safety precautions is alarming.

As the student body of LIU Post grows with international students from all around the globe, the language barrier becomes more defined. However, clubs and events on campus give international and American students the opportunity to assimilate and learn about each other’s culture and customs.
Conversations Helping and Teaching Students (CHATS), has been a club on campus since 2009, uniting American and international students under the familiar umbrella of common language. Its purpose is to help international students adjust to life in America, while both students learn about other cultures. The partnerships forged in this club have led to valued friendships, rich with culturally invigorating experiences.
Treasurer of CHATS and senior Finance major, Abinaya Kunarathnam, believes the Office of Campus Life is doing the best it can to bring together international and American students.
“LIU offers many clubs and activities related to different cultures on campus,” Kunarathnam said. For example, the school has the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, CHATS, Indo-American Club, International Student Union, Korean Student Association, Latin American Students Organization, Taiwanese Student Association, Turkish American Student Association, and the Vikings.
Despite all these clubs, senior Theatre Arts major Doug Robinson doesn’t believe we have enough opportunities to bring together international and American students.
“Most international students have clubs for themselves,” Robinson said, “and with a language barrier, people don’t want to put themselves out there as much.”
The Vikings was his example, a club geared towards Norwegians. American students can join, but Tina Skjonhals, a second semester graduate student in Healthcare Administration, said that very few American students actually attend. Robinson did acknowledge, however, that clubs such as CHATS are working towards assimilating American and international students more.
CHATS pairs international students with American students at the Chapel at the beginning of each semester. Once paired, students spend a minimum of an hour a week together, in addition to attending CHATS events. Junior Marketing major Kristy O’Connell, the President of CHATS, and Kunarathnam noted that Karaoke night, held last semester on Nov 13, is their favorite CHATS event.
“It brings everyone out of their shell,” O’Connell said. “There’s something special about sharing a laugh with others, and I think that’s something that’s intercultural.”
Freshman Computer Science major Xinyu Sirie Zhang said her favorite event was the Friendship Night, also held in the beginning of fall semester, in which everyone in CHATS got to know each other through games. Second semester MBA student Qingmiao Wang agreed with
Zhang. “International students feel homesick and bored since we don’t know anyone in America,” Qingmiao said. “But this party and CHATS in general allows us to make more friends and feel comfortable here.”
Freshman Film major Yuxin Tao said CHATS helped to get rid of her nerves. “It is a good chance to communicate with people, and learn about other cultures.”
O’Connell is paired with Skjonhals from Norway. “Tina and I clicked right away,” she said. They were able to develop a friendship from learning about the world, other cultures, languages, and each other’s lives. Of all the wonderful and fun things O’Connell and Skjonhals do, O’Connell enjoys their long car rides together. Skjonhals explained, on the other hand, that her favorite was going to The Witches Brew, a café that reminded her a lot of back home. O’Connell also had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to Sweden during the summer because of the friendship she developed with her Swedish partner last year. “I want people to see the amazing things that this club does. Everyone should have a CHATS partner — if you can make a difference in someone’s life, then why not?” O’Connell said.
Aside from CHATS, there are plenty of opportunities at LIU Post for American and International students to integrate. To find out more about the club, you can follow CHATS on Facebook and Instagram at LIU Post Chats Club. CHATS meets every Monday during common hour in Hillwood room 106.

On Wednesday Feb. 4, students, faculty, and alumni had the opportunity to see an advanced screening of Mark Lawrence’s new movie “The Rewrite,” which was filmed primarily on LIU Post’s campus, and stars actors Hugh Grant and Marisa Tomei. The screening took place in the Gold Coast Cinema in Hillwood Commons at 7 p.m.
“The Rewrite” focuses on Keith Michaels (Grant), a washed- up screenwriter who finds himself lacking any good ideas and getting rejected by Hollywood. In desperate need of a job, he moves to Binghamton, N.Y., to be a screenwriting professor at a college in the middle of nowhere.
Holly Carpenter (Tomei) is a student in his class, and throughout the movie viewers see how their personalities connect. Although you may expect this to be your typical romantic comedy, “The Rewrite” surprisingly has more to it than just the romance; it mainly focuses on Grant’s character trying to find himself.
The event was initially planned for Monday, Feb. 2, and, despite poor weather conditions, a screening was held that day for resident students, without a Q and A. At the rescheduled event, several students and alumni were able to ask Lawrence questions regarding the film. Actors Steven Kaplan and Annie Q, who play students in Michaels’ screenwriting class in the film, were also present for questioning.
Lawrence talked about his past writing and directing for movies such as “Miss Congeniality,” “Two Week Notice,” and “Music and Lyrics.” He said that ideas for writing come in all different ways, explaining that sometimes you write a story because you are asked or need the money, but other times you aren’t really thinking of it, and the idea just pops into your head.
For “The Rewrite,” Lawrence stated that it was about things that he cared for, and he therefore started to write it. “I was talking to Hugh about doing something [on] a smaller scale,” said Lawrence. “We had always done bigger stuff together with huge sets, and we wanted to do something on a slightly more intimate scale.”
Lawrence believes that it’s hard to create movies much like this one in Hollywood today. “The film industry right now is mostly divided between Marvel films, really big movies, and then we have the Sundance world, all of these fantastic types of movies. So the middle ground is harder to occupy these days,” Lawrence said. “Part of it is because there is so much good television, and people are writing more [on] of an intimate human scale for TV, but for movies I don’t know who makes “Forrest Gump” right now.”
Actors Kaplan and Q said that working with Grant and Tomei was really great. “Marisa just has this vibe that she is the smartest person in the room, and her instincts are always right on,” said Kaplan. “And Hugh is so subtly brilliant. I’d be producing something with him, and I would catch the tail end on the monitor of what we had just [shot on film], and I’d see things in his performance that I didn’t even catch when I was standing right in front of him.” Q also confessed that she remembers having late night dance par-ties with Tomei in the halls in between takes.
Although the movie is supposed to take place at SUNY Binghamton, most of it was filmed on our campus at Post during April, May and October 2013. Not only external shots of buildings and different areas of the campus could be seen, but also the classroom and office scenes were all shot at Post. In fact, the office of J.K. Simmons’ character that was used in the movie was the actual office of Dr. John Lutz, chairperson of the English Department.
Although some filming was done on the Binghamton campus, Lawrence decided to film largely at Post for financial reasons, since it was hard economically to shoot the entire movie in Binghamton. “We needed to shoot near NYC, so we started doing location scouts,” said Lawrence. “And this campus was beautiful, but not overwhelmingly Ivy League type, which would have been odd for Binghamton. Also, the color schemes were very similar to Binghamton’s, and it was visually the best. Everyone here was very great and supportive with helping us making the film.”
Kathy Mendall, LIU Post’s Associate Director of Conference Services, claimed that it was a long process for them to actually pick Post as their location to film the movie. “For it to be the first major film being filmed on campus, it was the best learning experience for us to be able to see how things really work, so it has really opened the door for us to be able to have other types of filming being done on campus,” said Mendall.
Since most of the scenes were filmed during the month of May right after classes had finished, Mendall claimed that there were not many disruptions. “When we allow production companies on campus, some disruption can be expected, but we always look to make sure that it goes as smoothly as possible for the campus and the production company,” said Mendall.
Lawrence also offered a word of advice for students who want to pursue a career in screenwriting. “You have to write as much as possible, and watch as many movies or television shows as you can. For me, the sort of essential thing in the movie is whether screenwriting can be taught or not; I honestly don’t know where I come out on that,” said Lawrence. “I’ve been on both sides of the argument, but Woody Allen says, ‘Writers write the way institutionalized people basket-weave’, and that’s absolutely correct: you know who is a writer and who isn’t just by the fact that they write. As a writer, you’re either writing or you’re not working, so my advice is to just keep writing and don’t lose faith.”
“The Rewrite” will open in theaters nationwide on Feb. 13.

Dr. Michael A. Brown, Associate Curator of European Art at the San Diego Museum of Art, will be part of a free, professional panel discussion today, Feb. 11, at 5 p.m. in the Steinberg Museum of Art. Light refreshments will be served at the event, which is also viable for Honors program merit credit. All students are welcome to attend.
The event is sponsored by the School of Visual and Performing Arts at LIU Post, and is organized by Art History Professor Niria Leyva- Gutierrez and the Art and Art History club. The panel, “Tales from the Vaults: the Role of the Art Museum Curator,” will focus on the titular profession, and the experience of working within the art world.
Brown assumed his role at the San Diego Museum of Art in early 2014, and over-sees Permanent Collection Installations. The curator has a concentration in 17th and 18th century Colonial Spanish Art, having completed his doctoral dissertation at the NYU Institute of Fine Arts. The San Diego Museum of Art has a particularly diverse col-lection, including works of Spanish and Italian Masters, as well as works from Asia and the Americas.
This is not the first lecture of the sort, as the Art and Art History club regularly organizes events that involve learning about real issues and opportunities in the quest for a coveted job in the art field.
“These lectures are meant to provide art majors with the opportunity to hear first hand from professionals about their experiences in the art world,” said Stacey Zucker, a junior Digital Arts and Design major, and president of the club. Speakers in the past have included Sharon Matt Atkins, Managing Curator of Exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum, and Sunny Shin, director of Coohaus Art in Chelsea.
The panel is not exclusive to art majors and, as always, all are welcome to learn about things unknown to them. “To a non-major, it’s still interesting to hear professionals talking about their real hands-on experiences in exciting jobs like being a museum curator or museum director,” said Zucker. “Also, our panel event will count as Honors merit credit, so for those who need study credit, whether you’re an art major or not, this would be a great event for you to attend.”

Jean Carlomusto, professor of Media Arts and director of the Television Center, has received positive reviews for her film, “Larry Kramer in Love and Anger.” The film, which Carlomusto directed, had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah on Jan 23. “The film is an intimate portrait of a fiery activist. He’s known to many as the angriest man alive,” Carlomusto said of the film’s main character.
Larry Kramer is an author, screenwriter, health advocate, AIDS, and gay rights activist. “He opened people’s eyes to AIDS. In the ‘80s, a lot of gays and lesbians were still in the closet, and they were still subject to discrimination. Larry managed to get people off their butts and onto the streets – mainly by yelling and badgering,” Carlomusto said. “But that’s what they needed.” Kramer started ACT UP: AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power, and was a loud, notable spokesperson for AIDS and gay rights.
“He’s had a long career,” Carlomusto said of Kramer. “He started in the movie business and was nominated for an academy award for “Women in Love,” which was a big movie in the ‘70s.” His most recent work on screen was “The Normal Heart,” an HBO movie starring Mark Ruffalo and Jim Parsons, among others. “He’s also a noted author, with a number one book, “Faggots,” a portrait of the NYC gay community in the ‘70s,” she added.
The film is Carlomusto’s first to get to the prestigious Sundance festival. “Festivals are great to get the word around,” she said. The film has received positive reviews, including an in-depth review in The Hollywood Reporter. “That’s what you want. It’s every filmmakers dream to go to festivals like Sundance, and to leave there with good reviews is great!” she said. Carlomusto has had work shown at several, smaller festivals, including the Berlin Film Festival and Austin Film Festival.
“I’ve been making films for 20 years now. I’m drawn towards unorthodox investigations into topics that have been pushed to the periphery by society,” she said. She’s made movies on similar subjects in the past. AIDS, HIV, and gay culture are themes that recur in her work. However, teaching is equally as important to her. “I enjoy teaching, but I wouldn’t enjoy it as much if I didn’t do what I teach for myself. And I wouldn’t enjoy making films if I didn’t teach,” she said. “I like having a foot in both.”
The film was backed by the production company HBO, which gave Carlomusto the opportunity to improve her film. “The name [HBO], of course, is great, but what’s really great is the people,” she said of the people she worked with on her film. “The editor was brilliant. Editor Geof Bartz and co-editor Gladys Murphy stayed with me for six weeks, coming up to speed with my vision; they did a beautiful job cutting the film.”
Carlomusto also got the financial power needed to get licenses for major motion picture sound tracks, including the track from Kramer’s academy nominated “Women in Love.” “You’re talking major money here,” she said. Nina Wikstøl, a 2014 LIU Post graduate in Electronic Media, who was an HBO intern and student at the time, also worked
on the movie with Carlomusto. For more information on the film, visit www.facebook.com/LarryKramerDocumentary.

Last Wednesday, Feb. 4, the women’s basketball team (13-8) secured a slim five-point victory over the Purple Knights from the University of Bridgeport (4-18). The Pioneers were led by yet another double-double effort from junior center Nyasia Davis, who went for 20 points and 16 boards.
Senior guard Chelsea Williams was also a big part in the win, scoring 25 points, dishing out six assists, and being a pest on the defensive end with three steals. Junior guard Quanisha Ratley also chipped in with 10 points in the 71-66 victory in front of the Pratt Recreation Center faithful.
Three days later, on Saturday, Feb. 7, the Pioneers welcomed the Golden Lions from Dowling College (4-16) to Brookville, N.Y., in which the trio of Williams, Davis, and senior guard Ashley Castle combined for 58 points to lead LIU to a 76-62 win over their East Coast Conference opponents.
Williams led all scorers on the afternoon with 24 points, while Davis notched her 11th double-double on the young season with a 22-point and 10-rebound effort. Castle added 22 points of her own to go along with six assists.
The Pioneers were feeling it from long range, as they nailed nine shots from deep in the first half. The Pioneers pushed their lead to 16 in the first half and took a 44-32 lead into the break.
The Post squad kept its foot on the gas in the second half and continued to attack. The Green and Gold fed Davis throughout the latter stanza, where she scored 14 points and dominated down low.
As a team, the Pioneers grabbed rebounds and got second chance opportunities, as well as points off of turnovers. For the Golden Lions, junior guard Krstina Surlan totaled 24 points, eight boards, and six assists in the losing effort while teammate senior guard Christine Verrelle notched a double-double in points and rebounds.
Head Coach Deirdre Moore and the Pioneers return to action today when they take on the Mavericks from Mercy College in another ECC contest. Tip-off is set for 5 p.m. from Brookville, N.Y.

On Saturday, Feb. 7, the women’s swimming team showed precise form ahead of the upcoming Metropolitan Conference Championships, winning five out of seven events at the NYU Invitational, which was held at the Coles Sports Center.
The day started off with a team win for the Green Machine. The Pioneer squad raced to a time of 1:48.95 in the 200-yard medley relay, with three of the swimmers under 30 seconds.
Senior Carolin Rademacher continued in winning ways with back-to-back first-spots. Rademacher won her first event in the 400-yard individual relay with a time of 4:34.45, and touched the pad at 1:06.20 for the 100-yard breaststroke to secure the second. Freshman Erika Hultman swam in at third place in the latter stanza.
The Pioneers grabbed three top-four spots in the 100-yard butterfly. Junior Joyce Kwok bested the event with a time of 58.02, with freshman Laura Bendfeldt less than two seconds after. Junior Marthe Soerensen earned fourth place at 1:02.78.
LIU Post doubled up in the 100-yard backstroke, as well, with senior Johanna Petterson hitting the pad first at 58.49 and junior Meghan Brazier finishing second at 59.31.
Senior Courtney Delehanty added on a fourth-place mention in the 200-yard freestyle relay to the Pioneer account before the day was over.
The Green and Gold finished off with a second place in the 800- yard freestyle relay, as the top distance squad swam the feat at a time of 8:05.54.
Head Coach Maureen Travers and the Pioneers return to the pool on Friday, Feb. 20, when they will defend their conference title at the Metropolitan Conference Championships in Piscataway, N.J. After that, the National Championships await for a group of swimmers in Indianapolis, In.

Coming off a spectacular 2014 campaign, the softball team placed seventh in the National Fastpitch Coaches Association (NFCA) Preseason Top-25 Poll, which was announced late January.
In addition to their No. 7 ranking in the NFCA, the Pioneers were also awarded the No. 1 ranking in the East Coast Conference poll in an almost unanimous decision. Senior catcher Aly Dzierzynski and sophomore pitcher Ashley Martin captured preseason accolades, as well.
This season, the Pioneers will look to senior catcher Aly Dzierzynski. In her junior year, she owned a .438 batting average to go along with a .495 on base percentage, and a .907 slugging percentage. In addition, she also smacked 25 homers and totaled 77 RBIs, which ranked third among all hitters in the country. Dzierzynski broke previous LIU single-season records with her home run and RBI totals and also set new club records for total bases, extra base hits, and slugging percentage.
In her freshman year, Martin was named ECC Rookie of the Week three times and named to the All-ECC second team. In her 29 appearances, she compiled a 16-2 record, ranking second in the conference in victories. She also finished in the top- 5 in the ECC in earned run average and strikeouts.
In addition to Martin, returning to the circle for the Pioneers is senior pitcher Megan Salcido. Last season, she appeared in 19 games, going 6-2 and pitching to an impressive 1.89-earned run average. In her 74 innings pitched, she gave up only 65 hits and struck out 43 batters. Perhaps her best performance came against Caldwell University last season, when she tossed a complete-game two- hitter in the NCAA East Super Regional finale.
The Pioneers boasted a 50-11 record last season, compiling a .335 team batting average. The high batting average lead to an awful amount of runs scored, 395 to be exact. The Pioneers totaled 570 hits, and of those, 85 went for home runs.
The Pioneers won their conference and the NCAA Division II Region, but were sent home with back- to-back losses in the National Championships.
Head Coach Jaime Apicella and the Pioneers will begin their season on Sunday, March 1, when they face the Panthers from Adelphi University at Garden City, N.Y.

Q: As the head coach of the women’s basketball team, how has your team overcome challenges and adversity throughout the season?
A: We just work hard and improve on the things that need improvement on. It’s a long season and as long as there’s time, we can get better.
Q: Coming off an NCAA Tournament appearance last season, how do you feel your players’ experience will push you forward?
A: We try to build a habit of winning. We’re starting to run into a situation that the players we have here only know how it feels to be in the NCAA Tournament. Obviously Chelsea Williams has been one of the many players who have NCAA tournament experience.
Q: When did you first start coaching?
A: This is my seventh season as the head coach of the Pioneers. I was
an assistant coach for 15 years prior to that. I’ve grown by taking things season to season and team to team. I figure out what works for our team and what doesn’t.
Q: How do you feel your team has performed in ECC play?
A: The ECC is tough; it’s much improved. Every out is a tough out. The teams on the bottom you still have to play tough every night. The ECC
is competitive because there’s several close games. I think my team has played better in conference games than non-conference games, but non- conference play is supposed to get you ready for conference play so we’ll take it that way.
Q: Are the non-conference games tougher than the conference games? If so, how?
A: They’re both tough in different ways. The non-conference games are tough because we play quality teams that we’re not use to as much. The conference games are tough because the players are all familiar with each other, they play together over the summer, and they’ve played against each other for multiple years.
Q: What’s the key to winning the ECC?
A: We’re trying to take it one game at a time. If we could make a run at the NCAA tournament we need to play consistently. Taking care of the ball, rebounding, and defending are some of the keys for any team trying to win.
Q: What’s your most important aspect of the game?
A: It seems to change from game to game, but if you play defense you give yourself a chance to win. If I had to pick an area, I would pick defense and rebounding.
Q: What did you do before coaching at LIU Post?
A: I worked as a mathematics special education teacher in Queens for 11 years. I’m currently working towards earning another master’s degree in Electrical Engineering.
Q: Where did you attend college?
A: I went to school here at LIU Post where I played my collegiate career as a point guard for the Pioneers from 1992-96. I graduated in 1996 with a degree in pre-Engineering/Math and Physics. I then went on to earn my master’s degree from LIU Post in Math Education.
Head Coach Deidre Moore and her squad will face Mercy College in an East Coast Conference tilt tonight at 5 p.m. at the Pratt Recreation Center.

On Feb. 4, the men’s basketball team (11-10) ended up on the short end of a 63-53 score against the University of Bridgeport (15-5) in an East Coast Conference collision at the Pratt Recreation Center.
Trailing 7-6 in the opening moments of the contest, the Pioneers pieced together a 14-4 burst in a six-minute span to capture a 20-11 advantage with 7:54 left of the half. Sophomore forward Greg Dotson sparked the run with a one-handed slam, while senior forward Tyuan Williams nailed a jumper to cap it off. As the Pioneers began to cool off from the field, they fell flat at both ends of the court, helping Bridgeport re-gain the lead into intermission.
Although the Green and Gold clawed their way back into the game, the Purple Knights began to pull away with an 11-3 surge. Junior guard Jesse Jones put the icing on the cake with a three from the wing, putting Bridgeport ahead for good.
Williams led the Pioneers in scoring for the fifth-consecutive game, racking up 14 points. He also crashed the glass for nine boards. Senior forward Charles McCann tallied 11 rebounds, six points and three blocks. Dotson collected 10 points and two rejections in 20 minutes of action off the bench. Junior guard Dillon Burns chipped in with five points, four rebounds, three assists, and two steals.
The Pioneers returned to the court on Saturday, Feb. 7, scoring a smothering 35 points on fast breaks, which lead to an 82-68 triumph against East Coast Conference rival Dowling College (9-12) at the Pratt Recreation Center.
Leading 16-15 with 11 minutes to go in the opening stanza, the Pioneers went on a 13-2 run over a five-minute span to widen their advantage to 29-17 at the 5:55 mark. Junior guard Akosa Maduegbunam and Dotson each slammed home dunks in transition while Burns started the uproar with a three.
The Golden Lions chipped away at the double-digit deficit and narrowed the gap down to three points. However, LIU closed out the half on a quick 6-1 spurt. A reverse lay-up by Dotson gave the Pioneers a 39-31 cushion, which they carried into the locker room. Dotson registered eight points in the first 20 minutes to lead the Green and Gold in the scoring department.
Nearly four minutes into the latter stanza, the hosts held a 45-37 lead, until a 16-7 streak in a stretch of 4:28 opened the flood gates. Maduegbunam steered the court for a dunk on three separate occasions in the sequence. Senior guard P.J. Torres added six of his 16 points off the bench during the sequence.
Maduegbunam finished with 16 points on 7-of-16 shootings. Meanwhile, Torres hauled in a team-high of 11 rebounds for a double-double. Dotson amassed a game-high of 20 points, to go along with five boards and four blocks. McCann collected 10 rebounds, six points, three assists, and two steals while Burns pitched in with eight assists, six points, and four rebounds.
LIU Post shot 50 percent from the floor in the second half, propelling them to a solid 46 percent for the game. The Pioneers received a remarkable outing from their bench as they racked up 42 points.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers wrap up their four-game home stand today when they host Mercy College in an ECC battle at the Pratt Recreation Center. Opening tip is slated for 7.30 p.m.
