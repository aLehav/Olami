The spring semester has brought new faces to the LIU Promise office, located in Hillwood Commons. The Promise office offers students assistance with schedules, career services and academic guidance.
The Director of LIU Promise, Christopher Salute, left his position in early January. Along with being the director of Promise, Salute served as the director of student-run businesses. Taking his place as director of student-run businesses is Cara Caporale, who has been a promise coach for six months, since August 2016. Caporale also serves as one of the associate directors of LIU Promise alongside Sara Panarelli, who is now the senior associate director of Promise.
Dylan Silva, the chief operating officer of the student-run businesses and a junior business major, is excited to have Caporale on board. “Cara is hands down very professional; she likes to hear what the student’s wants and needs are for the student-run businesses. She has been working with the eboard (executive board) to help revamp the businesses, menu, etc. We have new products and vendors being launched over the course of the next few weeks,” Silva said.
The Student-Run Businesses Director of Operations, Matt Betz, a freshman business major, is also optimistic for the future with Caporale’s leadership. “The biggest thing I see is that last semester we had trouble getting ideas approved by Chris. With Cara, I see her listening to us and doing anything possible to get our ideas in the store. There’s a lot of positive changes coming. We are planning on improving our relationship with the student government and hope to get closer to the student body through that relationship. The student body is our family and it’s important to us that we provide the best service and products to them as possible.”
Also leaving LIU Promise is Mikki Rosman, who has served as a promise coach since September 2014. In addition, Promise Coach Kaitlyn Jensen, left LIU Promise for a new position at University Center. Jensen had served as a promise coach since January 2014. Both Rosman and Jensen are LIU Post alumni.
Kames Davis, a sophomore business administration major, was disappointed to learn that her Promise Coach, Miki Rosman, was leaving. “Miki was the reason I stayed at Post last spring; I’m so sad to see her leave. I was comfortable going to Miki about any problem I had. She wasn’t just an academic advisor, she was a great mentor and it’s sad to see her go,” Davis said.
New to LIU Promise is Gerald Russo-Stannard, who started in early January. He will serve as associate director of LIU Promise. Russo-Stannard, who has worked in higher education since 2008, most recently worked as interim associate director of academic internships at John Jay College.

Dr. Albert Inserra, who was appointed the Dean of the College of Education, Information and Technology on Oct. 10, had a long journey before acquiring this position. Studying chemistry and biology at Seton Hall University, Inserra never thought his life would end up the way it did. After receiving his masters degree in genetics at Seton Hall, he applied for a job at Essex Catholic High School, an all boys school in New Jersey, helping biology, chemistry and physics teachers set up labs. Just after receiving the job Brother Clancy, a priest who worked at the school, offered Inserra a teaching position even though he didn’t have an education degree. Inserra took the job and while teaching, he finished his masters degree.
At first, Inserra struggled with his job, not having any support or experience in the educational field. But, he fell in love with education; leading him to move to Long Island, taking a job in West Islip teaching Chemistry and Biology for 10 years. During his time teaching at West Islip, Inserra got his Certification in Administration at Hofstra University and received his doctorate at Fordham University. He then began a career in administration and soon became a Superintendent in Carle Place for 10 years, and in Port Washington for seven years.
Although Inserra loved teaching in a high school setting, he knew he couldn’t do it forever. After spending 34 years in K-12, Inserra knew he had had enough, which is why he retired in 2002 and became a professor in educational administration at Dowling College. In 2014, after being at Dowling College for 12 years, holding both professor and chair positions in educational administration, the chair of the Board of Trustees asked Inserra to become the president of the College of Educational Administration. Inserra was shocked regarding the offer saying, “I had no aspirations to be, nor even thought about it.” After conversations with his wife and thinking about the future of Dowling College, a school that was already $54 million in debt and had an enrollment decrease from about 6,000 to 1,500, Inserra took the job offer and started his presidency in September 2014.
During his first year as president, Inserra, said, “We did very well, but were still struggling.” Although enrollment was not stabilized and the college still had a lot of debt, things seemed to get a bit better. In September 2015, the incoming class was larger, but still not enough. By January 2016, the college was in trouble and when a potential partnership fell through, was forced to close. “The worst part,” Inserra said, “was the students.” Worried about where they would go, Inserra reached out to Dr. Kimberly R. Cline, the president of Long Island University. Cline sent a team over to Dowling to help the students. Inserra and Cline worked out a program that allowed all of the Dowling student’s credits to transfer over to Long Island University.  On Aug. 31, 2016, Dowling College officially closed its doors.
In September 2016, 150 Dowling students started school at LIU Post, several of them joining the education department. “Post did an excellent job welcoming Dowling students, it was really incredible,” Inserra said. “Dr. Cline and their faculty went out of their way.” Some students who transferred from Dowling to Post have struggled with the transition and are trying to get back on their feet at a new school. Rebecca Sapan, a senior who transferred from Dowling to Post, said, “Although transferring schools was very unexpected and hard at times, LIU is a great place to continue my education. Because I was going into my senior year at Dowling, I was scared I wasn’t going to graduate on time.” Sapan majored in media at Dowling and because that major is not offered at Post, her major is now broadcasting. Sapan has struggled a little with advanced classes because of material she had not learned, but will be able to graduate on time.
Kerri Ilyichenko, another senior transfer, said, “Changing schools unexpectedly was hard to come to terms with. It was something I never thought would happen, but transferring to LIU is allowing me to further my education with the right tools for a successful future.”
After Dowling closed, Inserra wasn’t sure if he wanted to retire or continue working. He said the closing of Dowling “wasn’t a good way to end a career in education.” Inserra then found out that the dean position for the College of Education, Information, and Technology at LIU was available because the dean at the time, Louisa Kramer-Vida, was holding the position temporarily . Inserra applied, was offered the job and accepted it. He officially started on Oct. 10 and said, “everyone here has been terrific.” His first goal is “to make the College of Education a place that everyone thinks about when they think about teaching and learning.” Inserra believes enrollment is going up because of the growth in education jobs, which will benefit LIU.
Inserra has been busy in his first few months. He is creating five dual certificates, allowing education students to be certified in two areas. He is partnering with local school districts to get freshmen involved in field work right away. Also, he is expanding the doctoral programs to Brooklyn and Hudson, and partnering with departments in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. “If you can marry your passion with a career, you’ve never worked,” Inserra said.” This is advice he believes every student should follow.

Fighting her way through circles in the crowded streets of Washington D.C. at 4 a.m. was not how Dorianna Valerio imagined spending her first presidential inauguration. After graduating from LIU Post in 2014 with a BFA in Journalism, Valerio joined CBS News Radio as desk associate, and a year later promoted to chief. Most days she can be found sitting behind the desk, operating audio files and fact checking. However, for news breaking events like the Presidential Inauguration, Valerio can be found working behind the scenes, covering the event live.
“My experience was really long and very interesting,” Valerio said. She spent three days of early mornings and long nights setting up for the CBS News Radio long form inauguration show. Traveling from her hotel to the Capitol, the uncertain weather and the mix of protesters and supporters created a new atmosphere  Valerio was not used to. Valerio got lost in the city several times.
Crowds of people were waiting to enter designated areas at 5 a.m. “It was interesting to hear the support and the disruptions all in the same space. It was really an interesting dynamic,” she said.
An experience with a cab driver one morning helped to lessen the challenges Valerio faced. “I had never been to D.C. before,” she said. During the inauguration, roads are closed down and usual routes to the Capitol are blocked. Fortunately, this cab driver knew the secrets of the city.
“He was very knowledgeable about which streets were closed off,” Valerio said. The driver, who had been working since President Reagan was in office, was used to the inaugural madness that overtook the city every four years. During the 2012 inauguration, the driver was granted permission by the Secret Service to drive in restricted zones. “He was confident in maneuvering the city,” Valerio said. It was Valerio’s first time attending an inauguration, an experience she described as a “once in a lifetime witness of a peaceful transition of power.” Though the excitement did not reach everyone in the city, “this is routine for D.C. people,” she said.
This May will mark Valerio’s two year anniversary at CBS. Aside from the inauguration, Valerio also assisted in coverage for the Democratic and Republican conventions in Philadelphia and Cleveland last summer. “I had a great time seeing politics in a very intimate close-up view,” she said.
“I’m having a really great time working for CBS Radio,” Valerio said. She is grateful to have bosses who trust her enough to allow her to cover these political events, and she has been able to learn a lot.
“I’m learning to appreciate what I am currently doing as a young journalist,” Valerio said. She is focused on the skills she is learning now at CBS, rather than planning too far ahead into her future career.
Valerio credits her time working on The Pioneer as a staff writer, news editor, and then Editor-in-Chief, with teaching her skills like meeting deadlines, that make her a real journalist. “I work very hard to be someone who never misses a deadline, never forgets to do something, and never misses the mark,” she said.
Aside from journalism and radio, Valerio loves to spend time with family and friends. There is importance to balancing work and life, even early on in a career. Ten years from now, Valerio hopes to be an expert in having a great career and a happy personal life without having to sacrifice either.
LIU Post alumnus Tom Francis (’06) has shared with the Pioneer one of his political cartoons for the inauguraltion of the Pioneer alumni corner. Francis founded MOLES N TROLLS COMICS in 2017. Francis received his B.A and is also a screenwriter.

Tau Kappa Epsilon, TKE, is one of  six greek life organizations on campus. Its track record of philanthropy is a lengthy one indeed.  Since Fall 2013, the fraternity has successfully organized and executed 25 charitable events, both on and off-campus. One of the fraternity’s favorite organizations to raise money for, St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, has benefited mightily from TKE. “I’m proud to say that we’ve been able to donate upwards of $5,000 to St. Jude’s, that’s special,” said Muhmaet Hassan, a TKE brother since 2015.
The Pioneer interviewed Nicholas Brailovsky, the president of the Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter on campus, and Muhmaet Hassan, the fraternity’s treasurer, about the fraternity’s upcoming charity events for spring semester 2017.
Q) “Before we get started, how did the charity event with Chipotle go last December?”
A) Hassan: “Really well.  Although turnout at Chipotle of Hicksville was less busy than expected that day, I’m happy to tell you that we were able to donate about $350 to our friends over at St. Jude’s which is always good. I think we established a good connection with that Chipotle location, so perhaps going forward, we can offer an event for them later in the semester.
Q) “Nick, as President of the fraternity, what are some contrasts when it comes to the functioning of TKE between the fall and spring semesters, if any?
A) Brailovsky: “Well in terms of recruitment, I think we like to take the same approach when it comes to taking in a new recruiting class, however; I think we recruit better in the fall for a variety of reasons. One being that there’s a higher influx of new students, but two, we focus on charity, philanthropy and our academics just a little bit more during the spring.”
A) Hassan: “Just to piggyback off of that, last semester we were able to organize three charity events. This semester we would like to shoot for four to six. For example, we’re organizing a winter carnival, which will be on campus. We’re currently in the beginning stages of organizing but all proceeds will go to St. Jude’s and we’re really proud of that. We even organized a GoFundMe account in regards to our St. Jude’s philanthropy. Our goal for that operation is $5,000 alone.”
“This is my last semester. After I graduate, I want to be able to look back at my time here at Post and say ‘Wow, we had a great time, but we also did great things.’  That will really mean a lot to me.”

Break is over, school is back in session, and 2016 is finally over. For better or for worse 2016 was certainly one of the more pivotal and perhaps tumultuous years in recent American history. With that said, there are two things the LIU Post community can take solace in. One, there hopefully be no more nasty, negative, and divisive presidential campaigns for at least two and half more years. Two, and most importantly, it’s time to usher and embrace a new calendar year, as well as a new year academically.
Academically speaking, 2017 offers a sense of refuge, a renewal of some sorts for both students and professors. For some students, 2017’s Spring Semester will be the semester they ‘right the ship,’ says Lauren Falco, a Junior Education major. “Although I finished with an above average GPA, and rarely missed class, I’m going to view this semester as a reset.” By her standards, Falco, by her standards, blames a sub-par fall semester on the flu. Knocking her out of seven school days, Falco says the sickness “knocked me off the school rocker.” So what is Falco’s Spring Semester resolution? According to Falco, ‘Stay healthy, stay focused, and maintain above a 3.5 GPA.”
Lauren Falco isn’t alone when it comes to writing the wrongs of the previous semester. Lauren Kane, a Senior Business major, plans to apply for her masters in business after she graduates this May. However, “I won’t get into the masters program I want if I take days off,” said Kane, as she pondered on what was a lack luster Fall Semester. “My grades were fine, I even felt like test scores were better than ever. What dragged me down was tardiness, but that is correctable.” Post Students and Professors alike are all too aware of the traffic concerns rear their head all too often, especially when it comes the Long Island Expressway and Northern Boulevard.
“Traffic shows no bias,” says Dean Eretzian, an undeclared major who hails from Queens. “My first week, it seemed like every morning there had to be an accident of some proportion.” Luckily for the young Freshman, Eretzian was never involved in an accident during the fall semester and has zero plans of being involved in one any time soon. According to Eretzian, the biggest adjustment he had to make when coming to post was adjusting to the commute. “If I had to, I could have walked to my High School [Saint Francis Prep] if I was running late. There’s a big difference when it comes to a five minute drive, to a 15 mile adventure on the Long Island Expressway.”
In terms of the Spring Semester, it seems that Post students need to hold themselves accountable when it comes to the alarm clock. Perhaps students should give themselves at least 15-20 minutes of buffer time when it comes to their morning commute during the Spring Semester. In closing, Lauren Falco probably said it best before our man on the street interview concluded. “No stress if you’re not late and studied for your test. If you’re not prepared, then prepare to fail.”

Don’t let her petite stature fool you.  Stephanie Athanasopolous, a senior digital art and design major, boasts a persona that is larger than life, and she has the résumé to prove it.  Before she turned 21 last October,  Athanasopolous had already interned for a blog site known as The Dishh.  It was where a young Athanasopolous designed material for one of Kim Kardashian’s closest friends, Jonathan Cheban, the founder and CEO of the website since 2014.  With her sights aimed high, Athanasopolous now works as a member of the graphic design team at JCDecaux [DEC], an advertisement company whose stock is publicly traded on the European Stock Exchange.
As a full time employee with JCDecaux, Athanasopolous is poised to graduate in May. Despite her packed schedule, the Pioneer interviewed Athanasopolous over the winter break.
Q) “How’d you get into Graphic Design?”
A) “Well, as a young girl in a Greek Orthodox elementary school, the emphasis is always on looks and appearance whether that be at the church, proms, schools functions, you name it. So long story short, Facebook infiltrated my group of friends in the 7th grade, and who took the pictures? Me. So before uploading all of the group pictures, I would edit them, and use Photoshop. So with that said, I became the ‘editor and chief,’ and just like that, playing with Photoshop became a hobby of mine.”
Q) “Ah, well thank you Facebook! Looking at your college transcript, it says you came in undecided, want to explain that to us?”
A)  “Well, I’m the daughter of two Greek immigrants who own a diner in Ozone Park, Queens. I watched them work hard, and I wanted to make them proud. So, I figured ‘Why not take up law?’ Well, I almost did just that. That was until I took a digital design class here at Post, and the rest was history. I was hooked; my professor at the time told me I had a great skill set for design. The next semester I was a declared Digital Arts & Design major.”
Q) “Were there any doubts or reservations? Push-back from your parents?”
A) “Eh, I guess there was some. I mean, when you make a life decision at the age of 18, it’s tough to trust your judgment on things, but I did it. As for my parents…I wondered how they’d take it. However, my father basically said to me; ‘The biggest decision I ever made was leaving Greece, the key to making a decision is sticking with it, but only if it’s your passion. Is this your passion, Stephanie?’ I responded ‘yes,’ and he said, ‘Well then I’m proud of you, and you have my utmost support, just be home by midnight please.’ I was going out that night, that’s why he said that to me.”
Q) “What’s it like practically having a career with a publically traded company? Do you do anything else on the side to refine your skills, keep you busy?”
A) “It doesn’t faze me; I wouldn’t say it’s easy because it’s not. Meeting deadlines for a company is no easy feat, but I get my work done. In terms of what I do on the side…I am also a freelance graphic designer, and if you want you can see some of my work here on my website: http://www.stephathana.com/ .”
Q) “Where are you five years from now?”
A) “Love these questions, because I have no answer for them. Of course I have goals, and I’m constantly creating systems in my head to reach those goals. Ideally I’d like to run my own graphic design company, but let’s graduate first, and then we can really talk future.”
Q) “Last Question: Any advice you want to give to the reader who may be struggling to take that next step in their career and/or major?”
A) “If we had a camera for this interview, I would look straight into it and say, ‘What are you waiting for?’ and that, ‘You can do it.’ Seriously, so the world is so full with talent and opportunity. Go out there and do it, get it done. Believe in yourself, set the bar high, and just do what you have to do. The worst thing you can do is sit on the sideline and tell yourself every reason why you can’t do it. Just do it, my friend, do it, see what you can do, and the rest will be history. I promise.”

Contributing Writer
The football team entered the 2016 season as underdogs, but proved all the experts and doubters wrong once the season was complete. The team entered the 2016 season with the expectation to build off its underwhelming 2015 season, finishing 4th in the Northeast 10 Conference, with a 7-4 record last season. Going into training camp last summer, Head football coach Bryan Collins believed his team had the capability to achieve many milestones this season. That started with the return of most of his skill position players and a new group of incoming freshman that he thought would make an immediate impact for the Pioneers this season. He was right. The season was historic. The Pioneers won more games than they ever have in one season.
Coach Collins had especially high expectations for his returning quarterback, and captain, Jeff Kidd. “I expect a lot of big things this season from Jeff this season, he has been showing a lot of great signs in camp and I think that he’s poised to have a big season this year for us,” Collins said before the season. Kidd’s season was set up for success. He knew he would have all of his offensive weapons returning, which is a dream for a quarterback no matter what level of football. “Having all of these guys come back for me this year like Shane [Hubbard], Malik [Pierre], David [White], Kyle Ward and James Higgins definitely makes me job easier since I now had a year to work with them and I’m just very excited,” Kidd said. After the preseason workouts were complete, it was time for the regular season and the journey began for the Pioneers.
The Pioneers were happy in particular to see some playmakers on defense return form injury. Secondary player Jarod Chester and defensive lineman Jess “Shark” Agbotse both returned from injuries that had kept them out for most of last season. Agbotse was ecstatic to be healthy and back with the team this year. “It’s always hard watching your brothers play and know you can’t contribute every Saturday was rough for me so I’m very excited for this year,” he said before the season.
Prior to the historic 2016 football season, the Pioneers never won more than 11 games in a single season. And, the team had only won 11 games in a season three times in history, since the football team was first established back in 1962. But this team had a different feeling to it. Even the players were ready for a long season, according to Anthony Denunzio, a junior defensive tackle. “Coach Collins said during training camp and all season that we are not going to be training for 11 games, we prepare for 16 since day one.” The reason to practice for 16 games is to be optimistic about playing the five potential rounds of playoffs should the team make it to the final round, and win the  NCAA Division II Playoffs.
Once the season began, the Pioneers began winning games in dominant fashion, outscoring opponents by upwards of 20 points a week. According to the university athletic department website, the Pioneers scored a total of 480 points while allowing only 272 points to all opponents. At the season’s end, the Pioneers finished the regular season with 11 wins, and an undefeated record for the fourth time in the school’s history.
Over a dozen players on the football team, as well as Coach Collins, were rewarded for their accomplishments. Quarterback Jeff Kidd won the Northeast 10 Conference MVP. Seven players were elected to the Conference First team, and eight players were elected to the second team all-conference. Head football coach Bryan Collins was the conference Coach of the Year.
But the mindset and training in the preseason were more valuable than ever as the Pioneers entered the NCAA Division II playoffs for the second time in three years, this time as the tenth ranked team overall in Division II Football. Their first matchup was a home game against the Rams of Winston Salem State University. The matchup was the first home playoff game for the Pioneers since 2002. The Pioneers emerged as victors and made school history by being the first team to win 12 games in one season. This also was the farthest the team had gone into the NCAA Playoffs by advancing to the second round. However, the Pioneers then fell short to the Shepherd Rams, losing 40-21.
Although the final result was not what the Pioneers had hoped, this was nonetheless a season that LIU Post students and players will never forget. “This season is one season that everyone that attends this school will never forget; this truly was a special group,” said alumnus Jeff Kroll.
The football team now waits to see what will happen for next season, as ten seniors will graduate this spring, including wide receiver Shane Hubbard. Hubbard recorded the best season a receiver has ever had at LIU Post by finishing the season with a school record 1,048 yards and nine touchdowns. He credited his quarterback and the coaches who have nurtured him for his four years with the program. “It all starts with the coaches, training me and making sure I know what’s expected of me every day, whether it’s in practice or during games,” Hubbard said. “I also have to thank Jeff [Kidd] because he is a great guy and an even better teammate and we just work really well together and that’s what gave us so much success.”
Hubbard was not the only member of the Pioneers to receive recognition for his hard work after this season concluded. Safety Jarod Chester came away with one of the biggest accolades of the season by being awarded “All-American Status.” The Division 2 Conference Commissioner’s Association honored Chester as a second-team selection. For Chester, it was his first All-America nod in his collegiate career. He is the first defensive player for the Pioneers to be named since 2011. Chester led the Pioneers this season and ranked third among the league’s defensive backs with 78 tackles (42 solo, 36 assist). He also paced the NE-10 in interceptions with seven.
This was truly a historic season for LIU Post football. The team won more games than it ever has in one season, had over 15 players voted to All-Conference teams, and had a select few win national collegiate awards. Fans can look back on this season with pride, despite the Pioneers not attaining the ultimate prize of an NCAA Division II Championship. The future looks bright for the Pioneers, as players and students wait for kickoff of the 2017 football season in September.

After completing a productive, non-conference fall season on December 7, the softball team took a much deserved four week break before resuming training in preparation for the tough spring season ahead.
Jamie Apicella, who is entering his 19th season as head coach of the Pioneers, said he feels very positive heading into the 2017 season. “Our strength this season is going to be our pitching staff,” Apicella explained.  “We have three formidable pitchers [who] arguably are going to make up the strongest staff in the region.”
Senior pitcher Ashley Martin also feels very confident heading into her final season.  “Our biggest strength is that we have a lot of depth at each position,” she explained.  “I think our team is going to be much stronger than last year.”
Last spring, the Pioneers finished with a 37-15-1 record.  Coach Apicella hopes that the team will work past the shortcomings of last year, and he does not want his players to be content with just making it to        post-season play.
“My goals have not changed in 19 years,” Apicella said.  “We always strive to be the best.  We want to win every facet of the season.”  This includes being regular season champions, East Coast Conference champions, regional championships, and a chance to compete for the NCAA Division II Championship this May in Salem, Va.
Senior infielder Kayla McCoy feels very confident in her team’s ability to make it further in the post season.  “Our team in extremely versatile and the internal competition pushes us to be better,” McCoy explained.
Apicella wants to see his team achieve smaller goals throughout the season and improve on some mistakes from last season to reach the ultimate goal of a national title.  This includes a .970 fielding percentage as a team, a goal they have come up slightly short of the last couple of years.  According the LIU Post’s athletic site, the Pioneers fielded at a .967 in 2016.  Apicella also said he would like to see his players play to the scoreboard less and focus on playing their own game to the best of their ability.
Each year, the Pioneers kick off their spring season in March with a tournament in Florida.  This year they will compete in the PFX Spring Games, which according to the tournament’s website, is the largest college softball event in the world with over 300 teams competing from the five collegiate divisions.
“We play some of the stronger programs from other regions to really test our team early,”  Apicella explained.  “Getting a taste for the strong teams early will help us late in the season.”
Although conference and non-conference play during the rest of the season can be difficult, Apicella is confident in his team’s ability to win.  They will play each team in the East Coast Conference four times during the regular season, which Apicella said can be very difficult.
McCoy said her team is focused on playing “Post softball” which means not focusing on each individual opponent.  “We intend to approach each game the same and remain consistent,” she said.
“We have always been a good finishing team,” Apicella said.  “It is just a matter of keeping our thoughts simple and playing the game to our true potential every day we step on the field.”

The women’s basketball team broke a three game losing streak Saturday with a 77-67 win over Georgian Court University at the Pratt Recreation Center.
Freshman Forward, Mikaiya Moore, was the leading scorer for the Pioneers with a total of 17 points.  The only time the Georgian Court Lions led the game was after the first basket of the game by Ivana Kovacev; but their lead was short-lived as Moore responded with a lay-up to tie the game.  After a successful jump shot by Moore less than four minutes into the game, the Pioneers never relinquished their lead.  They ended the half ahead of the Lions by seven points.
The Pioneer’s biggest lead came with 2:10 left to play in the third quarter, after two free throws by Pioneer, Sasha Patterson, brought the home team up by 17.  The Lions attempted a comeback in the fourth quarter but were only able to get within nine points of the Pioneers for the rest of the game.  A missed jumper by Lion Guard, Kaitlyn Lister, was rebounded by freshman Pioneer Guard, Kyla Formey, ending the game with the Pioneers up by ten.
Coach Dierdre Moore and the Pioneers are now 9-10 and will return to the court Wednesday Jan. 25 when they take on Daemen College in Amherst, NY at 4pm.

The Pioneers lost their fourth straight game Saturday after Saint Anselm College rose to a 87-81 lead in overtime at the Pratt Recreation Center.
Senior Forward Greg Dotson led the home team in total rebounds and total points with 9 and 26 respectively, and Senior Guard Jared Hall led the team in assists with ten.  The Pioneers started strong, leading the Saint Anselm Hawks 15-9 within the first four minutes of the game, but he lead for the rest of the first half would be a tug of war between the two teams.  At the half, the Pioneers came out one top with a small four-point lead.
The majority of the second half was dominated by the Pioneers.  A 6-0 run by the Pioneers brought them to their largest lead of 13 points with 11:22 left in the game.  It seemed as though the Hawks just couldn’t miss, and they quickly chipped away at the Pioneers lead during the last four minutes of the second half.  It was a three pointer by Saint Anselm sophomore Tim Guers that brought the Hawks to a one point lead over the Pioneers with just one minute left in the game. A clutch free throw by Red Shirt Junior Guard Aary Bibens tied the game with one second left on the clock, causing the game to overtime.
The Hawks dominated the first few minutes of overtime with a 5-0 run over the Pioneers.  A steal by Hawks Senior Forward Chris Braley sealed the deal with the Hawks up by six.
Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers now hold a record of 5-14 and will return to the court January 25 when they take on Daemen Amherst, NY at 6pm.
