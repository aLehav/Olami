Students had the chance to enjoy a Welcome Back Carnival in Hillwood on Wednesday, Jan. 22 during common hour. Anthony Garcia, a DJ from Enjoyable Entertainment, provided upbeat music while various events took place throughout the student center.
“It’s welcome week, so we have a photo booth going on right now, a DJ, we have friedOreos, funnel cakes, stuff like that just for the incoming freshmen,” Elizabeth Rosche from Enjoyable Entertainment, said.
Students of all grades passed through the carnival and enjoyed the free sweets andentertainment. While doing so, some considered what they anticipated going ahead into the new semester.
“I’m looking forward to good grades, a lot of great experiences, and hopefully I can getinvolved on campus more,” William Villalobos, senior criminal justice major, said. “I hope to find some clubs that I’m interested in and build a better resume.”
“I’m excited for the spring concert. I really hope it’s Blackbear, Blackbear is fire,” KiernanGriffin, junior art therapy major, said.
Katelyn Elvington, sophomore political science major, will transfer to Belmont Universityin Nashville at the end of the semester and will continue the same major. In the meantime, she wants to make the most of catching up with all of her friends on campus and remaining in her sorority, Sigma Delta Tau.

With a minor in fashion merchandising, Nancy Ambrosio, junior business administration major, is looking forward to the classes she is taking throughout the spring 2020 semester. “I’m taking the sustainability class which is really interesting because of how fashion is making an effort towards helping the earth,”Ambrosio said.
Students are also going into the new semester with goals to improve in both their academic and personal life.
Amanda Jones, a junior theater arts major, says her goal is to “have more confidence in myself and talking to people, to go out of my comfort zone and be the best self I can be.”
“[I want to] pass all my classes with flying colors, get some sleep, relieve stress, and learn more about the human mind,” Yevette Key, sophomore psychology major, said.

Melissa Ponton, a junior adolescent education major, wants to make time to spend timewith friends. “I feel like it’s very hard to have a friend life and your study life without one failing miserably,” she said.
Just 15 minutes into common hour, approximately 40 people visited the photo boothwhere a blue and gold Sharks backdrop was hung. In the fall 2019 semester, Rosche came to campus with Enjoyable Entertainment for the Homecoming festivities. At this outdoor event, students could take part in different activities including carnival games and eating treats like cotton candy. “We do so many events here. [With] all the homecomings and dances coming up, I’m sure we’ll be here for them,” Rosche said.
Students across a variety of majors attended the event, and some expressed their pride in their respective programs.
“I like how united we all are, if we need help we get connected to the right people,” Villalobos said. “And the head of the department is always there for us,” he said about Harvey Kushner, professor in the criminal justice department.

Key, formerly a broadcasting major, decided to study psychology after taking a class in the subject in 2019. “One thing I notice is that we’re all a really close-knit community within LIU and I really like that vibe,” she said.
“[I like] that we are able to get internships,” Griffin said about the art therapy program.Corien Bologna is the internship coordinator in the arts department who provides students with lists of places offering internships in their field of study. “Right now I’m working with patients who have traumatic brain injuries, and that’s going to be amazing,” Griffin said.
As part of her involvement in the fashion merchandising program, Ambrosio enjoysgetting involved with the Student Body Boutique and running the store. “It’s so much fun because I get the hands-on experience to learn everything,” she said.
Students can keep an eye out for more campus events by following the Student Activities Board on Instagram @liupostsab.

A group of 23 college students from Long Island have banded together to form the Long Island HIV Epidemic Campus Advisory Committee to aid in spreading awareness and education of HIV prevention and treatment methods among college students. Among the committee members is LIU junior nursing major, Kayla Halper, who is the student cochair of the committee alongside founder and Hofstra professor of public health, Dr. Anthony Santella.
In New York state more than 100,000 people are diagnosed with HIV according to theNew York State Department of Health.
In order to combat the disease, Governor Andrew Cuomo detailed a three point plantitled “Ending the Epidemic” (ETE) with the goal of ending the AIDS epidemic in New York state by the end of 2020. The goals of the plan include identifying people with undiagnosed HIV, improving medical care for those suffering from HIV and facilitating access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), an HIV prevention pill.
There are several other ETE awareness groups in both Nassau and Suffolk counties in addition to the inaugural campus advisory committee. The groups will coordinate meetings and events together. The campus committee is not currently open to new members, but students and community members are welcome to attend public meetings and events.
Halper will host several lectures on Monday, March 9 and Wednesday, March 25 in the Gold Coast Cinema to “explain the HIV retrovirus, how it works [and] how it can transform into the full on AIDS virus,” she said. The lectures will also cover PrEP and PEP medications, and how they can be used to potentially help prevent HIV.
Halper believes that by following the steps laid out in ETE, one day HIV will be wiped out entirely. “It’s very possible we could get rid of the HIV virus in totality if we’re just on top of screening and prevention methods, and coordinating the patients that are screened positively to be redirected to consulting therapy,” she said.

Students in the Post Theatre Company will be presenting “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’sNest,” the timeless story of a sane man, R.P McMurphy, in a mental institution run by thecontrolling Nurse Ratched. However, in this production, the cast members have reversedthe roles and made Nurse Ratched the only male character onstage.
In Ken Kesey’s original story, McMurphy is a “stereotypical” guy who liberates the menfrom the oppressive nature of the hospital and the manipulative Nurse Ratched who works actively to emasculate them. “We’ve genderswapped the production. The message is no longer about McMurphy coming in and ‘manning up’ the men; it’s instead, about giving voices to the voiceless,” Thea Kraus, a senior acting major who plays the role of McMurphy, said.
In this production, McMurphy is a radical feminist who is also sweet and caring, according to Kraus, who is also co-directing the production. “I love the complexities of McMurphy, and I also love how unpredictable she is,” she said.
Kesey wrote the original version of the story in 1962, and PTC’s production takes place in1950, where oppressive gender roles were accepted norms in American society. “With this gender-swap the story has become less of a comedy and more of an exposé on female oppression and mental illness, and this was important to the cast,” Kraus said.
“In this day and age, women’s voices are being suppressed more and more. And even iftheir voices are heard, they’re discredited.”
Another key character is Chief Bromden, a Native American patient who narrates Kesey’soriginal story. “Bromden is a woman who has been completely silenced by her society. She has been through a lot of difficult situations and has now become a woman who hides in plain sight,” Kaitlyn Piatti, a senior musical theater major portraying Bromden, said. By making herself essentially invisible, Bromden is able to avoid attention from the abusive staff.
This role is a meaningful one to Piatti. “Bromden is such an important character to mebecause as a Native American woman, there are almost no roles for Native American characters in theatre,” she said. “So getting to play Bromden is a really wonderful experience for me. She is also one of the most complex characters I’ve been able to play, which is always a wonderful time.”
The play is a thesis project for eight students; they’ve been working on the show sincethe spring 2019 semester. In their thesis tutorial, Kraus, co-director Logan Clingan, Ashley Bowden, Michaela Fox, Skylar Hicks, Kaitlyn Piatti, Lucy Sanci, and Alyssa Williams all did individual research for the project about their respective characters and/or technical theatre jobs in the show. “The actual rehearsals started mid-November, then we had winter break, and we started right back up on the first day back,” Kraus said.
This production will be a unique take on a classic story with aspects of the comedy andcurrent issues mixed in. It will explore issues of gender and equality, stigmas about mental illness treatments, as well as the systematic oppression of minority groups that highlight why the play is still relevant today.
Prior experience with the novel or film is not required to be able to appreciate the production. “It is a completely new take on the story so it is not necessary to enjoy this show,” codirector and senior acting major Logan Clingan said. “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” will be staged in the Rifle Range Theatre from Jan.31 at 7:30 p.m. to Feb. 2-3 with performances at 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tickets are free and can be reserved at tix55.com/ptc.

Who shot Ghost? The big reveal is just days away as fans approach the final episode of Starz’s hit television series, “Power.”

Diehards have patiently waited since the show’s midseason finale, which aired on Nov.19, to discover who’s responsible for the death of protagonist James “Ghost” St.Patrick portrayed by Omari Hardwick. He’s a debonair street gangster looking to leave his life of drug dealing behind to become New York City’s most popular club owner.
Since the show returned on Jan. 5, creator Courtney Kemp and producer Curtis “50 Cent”Jackson, used the final four out of five episodes to help fans narrow the seven suspects down to just three: Ghost’s wife, Tasha St.Patrick, portrayed by actress Naturi Naughton; Ghost’s son, Tariq St.Patrick, portrayed by Michael Rainey Jr.; and Cooper Saxe, the Assistant U.S. Attorney portrayed by actor Shane Johnson.
The audience can now rest assured that the killer isn’t wild, wounded and loyal to afault Tommy Egan, portrayed by actor Joseph Sikora. He’s Ghost’s lifelong friend and “business” partner in crime who later became the competition.
In the episode titled “It’s All Your Fault,” which aired on Jan. 19, Egan arrives at the scene of the crime as Ghost is taking his last breath. It was at this point, all hopes and conspiracies that he may still be alive or just dreaming were crushed.
Egan pleads with Ghost to hold on until he looks up to see the shooter standing on thebalcony above them, but the killer is never revealed to the audience. As Egan goes to grab his gun to take out the unrevealed suspect, Ghost asks him to “let her go.”
Many fans on social media expressed the assumption that because Ghost referenceda female during his final words, Tasha must be the shooter. But Joshua Williams, a juniorcomputer science major, interpreted the scene a bit differently.
“In the part where Ghost was on the ground and Tommy [Egan] came to see him, theperson that Tommy saw, I believe was Tasha. Ghost was telling him [Egan] don’t kill her and not to kill her because she wasn’t the killer,” he said. “The only other person could be Tariq. Ghost was shot before everybody else even got there to the club.”
The internet has gone crazy with possible outcomes backed by evidence and previousepisode watching, but finally, the truth is set to reveal itself on Sunday, Feb. 2.
And what will the show’s devoted fan base do when the show comes to an end?
Williams, who has watched the show from the very beginning and is disappointed it’sover, has his fingers crossed for a Tommy Egan spin-off. He also looks forward to seeing what other shows and films 50 Cent produces in the future. “I’m a very big fan. 50 Cent is one of my role models,” he said.

The Sharks women’s basketball team defeated the Red Flash from Saint Francis University 71-53 inside the Steinberg Wellness Center on Monday, Jan. 27. It was an all-around team effort from the Sharks, as three players finished with double digit points, including sophomore guard Brandy Thomas who led all players with 19 points and eight rebounds, and sophomore Kiara Bell, who finished with her season-high 16 points.
The Sharks opened the game strong and refused to look back as they jumped out to a 7-2 lead. The Red Flash tried to catch up, trailing 17-16 with 50 seconds left in the first quarter, but the Sharks responded with a four-point run to close out the first quarter up 21-16.
The Sharks kept going strong, starting the second quarter on a 7-3 run to extend their
lead. The teams continued to trade baskets throughout the quarter and went into halftime with five points separating them, 35-30 in favor of the Sharks.
The third quarter was more of the same, as the Sharks stayed true to their momentum, going on a quick 12-4 run to make it a 47-34 lead starting off the second half. However, the Red Flash finished the third quarter strong on a 7-4 run to cut the Sharks’ lead to 51-41.
The Sharks had a powerful finish as they put the game to bed in the fourth quarter, ending on a 15-5 run. Thomas, who had nine points in that stretch, led her team to their 71-53 victory.
This win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Sharks as they finished up the month of January on a high note. The three-game skid does not showcase the talent that the team displayed in the past few weeks; they fell by four points to the Bryant Bulldogs back on Saturday, Jan. 18, then fell to the Wagner Seahawks 63-61 in overtime on Monday, Jan. 20. The Sharks then faced the undefeated Robert Morris Colonials, and put up a good fight, but not good enough to take down the NEC’s finest.
There is still time for the Sharks to turn their season around after its slow start. After
the win, they improve to 3-5 in conference play, and the Red Flash fell to 6-3.
The Sharks turn their attention to the Merrimack Warriors, who they’ll play for their next
two contests. Women’s basketball is back in action on Saturday, Feb. 1 at 1 p.m. in Merrimack College’s Hammel Court.

Athletic Director Dr. William Martinov announced to the LIU community on Wednesday,Jan. 22. that Collin Audley would take over as head coach for the women’s soccer team,replacing Eleri Earnshaw, who was dismissed from her position in November 2019.
“There is a lot you can do in this game as a group.” Those are Collin Audley’s leadingwords as he takes over the position.
Audley originates from Fort Collins, Colorado and he grew up loving sports. He led a successful career as a soccer player, first for the University of Denver from 2006 to 2010, where he received All-Conference selections and a Newcomer of the Year Award; after collegiate soccer he made Major League Soccer trials and reserve-team appearances with the Colorado Rapids (2010) and the Chicago Fire (2011).
After playing professionally, Audley realized that coaching was the next step in his career.“I started coaching and I really enjoyed it,” he said.
Audley started his collegiate coaching career as an assistant coach at the University of Denver in 2014 where he also worked as the director of operations. He later served as anassistant coach for the University of Stanford’s men’s soccer team and led them to the national championship in 2017. He recently held the assistant coaching position at the University of Kentucky before transitioning to LIU.
Regarding the position at LIU, Audley shared that being a head coach was always agoal for him. “I have always wanted to have my own program, and the last few years I felt that even more,” he said. During the interview process, Audley said he felt a good connection with the athletic department and was excited to be a part of its early stages in Division I. “It seems like a lot of people are working hard to get us going in a positive direction,” he said.
Despite the excitement, Audley understands the position comes with many challenges. After a year of adjustments following the merger between the Post and Brooklyn athletic departments, Audley is the team’s third coach in three semesters for many of the players. “We can all look at the good and the bad from the past and we can all learn from it, but the most important thing is the direction we choose to go now,” Audley said. “Change is going to happen but your response to that change is the most important piece.”
To take the team forward, Audley wants to work as a transitional leader with the goalto move together as a group. He believes that clear communication, finding key motivators and purpose, discovering their own potential and having fun are the most important focus points for the team. “The challenge immediately is to get the group dynamic and people going in the same direction. Every day we are trying to get better,” he said.
Audley said improvements will go beyond the playing field and include the players bettering themselves as teammates, individuals and in the classroom. “Results, wins and losses are further down the road,” he said.
After a week with the team, Audley believes he has a hardworking group with great potential. “They have a great attitude. There has been a lot of energy and enthusiasm in the trainings and it has been competitive,” he said. “There is plenty of talent, there is plenty of hard workers, there is plenty of ambition and the girls are all good people with good intentions.”
To prepare for conference play in the fall 2020 season, the team will play four gamesduring the months of March and April, where the focus will lay on developing. “We want todevelop as people, we want to develop as players and we want to develop as a group,” Audley said.

I graduated from Long Island University in 1985. Back then, we simply called it “CW Post.” While attending Post, I took a class in Political Science with Professor Stanley Jarolem. That class, along with others that I took with other professors at the campus, changed my life. Because of the enthusiasm with which those professors taught, my
interest in education skyrocketed.
I went from being a “C” student in high school to an “A” student in college. I went from having no idea what I wanted to do for a career to knowing that I wanted to become a lawyer (a decision I’ve never looked back on).
Several years ago, I returned to the campus to work from the library, as I still do today to break up the monotony of working from home. I reflected on my education I got at Post and how satisfied I was with it. In walking the campus and passing through Humanities Hall, however, I saw no portraits of Professor Jarolem, no photographs of him, no statutes of him, no Hall or classroom was named after him; not even a plaque on a bench bore his name.
It was as though he (and my other professors) never existed – disturbingly akin to the ending of the movie Titanic when Rose was talked about how Jack saved her in so many different ways, but how Jack existed only in her mind many years later.
That saddens me to no end. How could someone who made such a significant contribution to my life (and others) as well as the school’s reputation not be publicly acknowledged in any respect? As I looked around the campus, there was nothing anywhere to recognize any of the staff who taught at this school over the 50+ years it has been in existence. It was as though the school has no history to speak of.
That needs to be changed. If Post is to build upon the recentlyadopted initiatives by its administration, the administration (as the prior ones should have) need to acknowledge the history of the school and that classes and professors that came before the present ones. In that respect, the school needs to build upon its past, so it is not simply viewed as just another stop in the pursuit of one’s education.
Some acknowledgment of the school’s academic history is in order. There is, after all, a tradition of which to be proud. Otherwise, the school will be viewed as little more than an assembly line factory in the wheels of education. At least during the time I attended Post, certain professors I had were giants who deserve to be recognized for their academic contributions as well as the personal ones they made to the student
body.
Sincerely,
Mitchell Dranow
Class of ’85

A giant inflatable rat, accompanied by members of the Painters District Council No.9 (DC9), were spotted on campus Tuesday, Jan. 14 and Jan. 28, picketing the school’s use of a non-union contractor for Suffolk Hall renovations.
“Scabby the Rat” – a grotesque rodent with bloodshot eyes and buck teeth that stands approximately 12 feet tall – hovered over the school’s entrance and grimaced while union workers handed out flyers to students, faculty and staff as they returned to campus from winter break.
The distributed flyer contained the headline “Long Island University C.W. Post Teaches Unfair Practice.” The handout further explained that Post awarded Suffolk Hall’s painting renovations to Better Life Builders Corp., a non-union general contractor based in the Bronx, N.Y.
When the school has a project that’s urgent or too intense, the painters on staff aren’t enough manpower to get the job done, according to executive director of facilities, Roy Fergus. “We put it out for bid; we get prices and we ask for prevailing wages, and we bring people on board on that basis,” he said.
Unions tend to prefer prevailing wage because it presents a floor or barrier; a basic minimum salary that employers can’t pay below, according to political science professor and former president of the faculty union, Michael Soupios.
DC9’s flyer asserted that Better Life Builders doesn’t compensate their workers according to the area’s prevailing wage and benefit standards set by the department of labor.
New York law requires public works contractors to pay the hourly amount set forth in any union contract. A DC9 representative who didn’t want to reveal his name said their presence on campus “has nothing to do with union or non-union. It’s about people getting paid properly and we’re out here to inform the public.”
Soupios confirmed that when a company brings in non-union labor, the union perceives it as a job that’s been taken away from its members.
“It’s a scheme that’s used by employers and the powers that be because you have people who are anti-labor and anti-union,” Soupios said. “If you take work away, take jobs away, you cut down on the membership. Of course you’re weakening the union. It’s part of a larger antagonistic attitude toward organized labor.”
When a union is unable to provide a sufficient amount of work for its members it can create disloyalty among the workers that remain. They may begin to question the purpose of paying their union dues. “You create this toxic environment for the union where they can’t justify their own existence against their own workers,” Soupios said.
Union wage standards for construction tradesmen are substantially larger than non-union because they include the worker’s mandated benefit contributions. Non-union tradesmen, also termed “scabs” by union workers, collect the entire amount of the wage or salary, never having to contribute to a unions’ supplemental benefits fund.
In 2019, employers spent an average of $19.39 on benefits for every hour worked by union employees and $9.43 on benefits for every hour worked by non-union employees, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics.
When the school puts out an invitation to bid for needed construction or renovation, they hold no bearing over the lowest bidder’s union status. “Another thing that is of concern, we’re going to be building the new vet school and a whole bit. And basically, again, you go through a competitive process, there’s a general contractor, and we basically indicate to him that our standard is prevailing wage,” Fergus said.
The Pioneer reached out to Post’s procurement department to verify if an invitation to bid was ever submitted for Suffolk Hall’s renovations or if the work was outsourced directly, but did not receive a response. DC9’s office and Better Life Builders also failed to respond.
“There are laws on the books in terms of minimum wage. So, if LIU is violating that, the union needs to go to a court and document that the school is violating the minimum wage structure established by the state. It comes down to who is cutting the checks,” Soupios said.
The Pioneer will reach out to the Facilities Services Department for further information.

Winnick Student Center is the go-to dining facility for some resident students on campus and has been for years. In the midst of the university’s rebranding as the LIU Sharks, themed interior decor appeared in the dining hall over winter break. In addition to the university blue paint job done in the fall 2019 semester, Winnick recently adopted surfboard shaped signs over each of the different food stations.
In regards to the signs, “It’s trying a little too hard. It’s a college dining hall,” Rachel Rienecker, a first-year MFA acting student, said. “I get that they wanted to change the colors to whatever our new school colors [are], but probably just leaving it alone would have been better.”
Another student enjoys the bright setting the new design provides. “It’s more welcoming. I think that for a student whose coming into the university, it’s more appealing than what it looked [like] previously,” Louis Copertino, senior public relations major, said.
“I kind of noticed it and I thought they looked okay,” Kate Gelvin, senior nursing major, said about the decorative signs. “I don’t really have much of a preference, I’m kind of neutral towards it.”
“For the incoming freshmen, I think it’s nice for them because they’re coming in as Sharks,” Amanda Jean-Louis, senior vocal performance major, said. “Whereas there’s us [seniors] who’ve been here since green and gold, so I [say] bleed green and gold forever.”
Other blue and gold decorations include glass containers filled with colored stones that sit atop locations such as the salad bar. The tables are currently still green and gold, as are the chairs in the Gold Coast Room. The result is a mismatched interior as more changes have yet to be made. “I think that’s something that’s just going to take time, and it’s probably really expensive to change, so they’re probably just waiting until they have enough money to do it,” Gelvin said.
A standalone waffle bar was added next to the dessert counter, neighboring the “Home Zone” section. Also, the “Street Food” section was renamed to “Street Eats.” A food warmer display was added over break, where at the grill station, students can pick up portioned trays of french fries and sweet potato fries, the latter being a new addition to the dining hall’s menu. “They’re actually good, so I was impressed,” Gelvin said.
“I think it’s more sanitary what they did with the fries, I think that’s a really important thing that they did because sharing hands is a way kids can get sick,” Copertino said. Previously, french fries would be set out in a warmed tray so students could use tongs to grab their desired amount and place it directly on their plates.
“I’ve been at Winnick more recently because of the change,” Copertino said. There are more changes he hopes to see in the future. “I remember they used to do sandwiches during lunch,” he said. “When they would make them fresh, it’s so much better than when they pre-prepare them in the back.” This service provided a personalized aspect of attention to detail, according to Copertino.
Jean-Louis hopes to see healthier food options incorporated into Winnick’s menu aside from salads. “I’m trying to eat healthier but all I really have to choose from is a burger or whatever’s over [in the Home Zone],” she said. “It’s not always healthy even though they have a vegetarian option. I’m not a vegetarian.”
Students can visit Winnick Student Center to see the new changes firsthand, and continue looking forward to themed meal nights listed on calendars throughout the dining room.
