Runs were at a premium in both games on Thursday, March 24, in the softball team’s double-header against the University of Bridgeport in Brookville, N.Y. With a combined five hits in the contest, the Pioneers were able to come out on top because they strung their base runners together.
Scoreless in the fourth inning, the Pioneers broke through with a two-run shot of the bat of freshman catcher Julia Seader. That was all the offense that junior pitcher Ashley Martin would need. Martin went the distance, allowing just two hits and fanning 11 Knights to earn her fifth win on the season. Martin’s counterpart, Alyssa Bua, pitched well enough for a win, but didn’t get the run-support necessary. The Pioneers came out on top 2-0.
In the latter game, the Pioneer offense managed to do its part and plate enough runs to squeak out another victory. The Pioneers opened the scoring in the second inning when senior third baseman Maria Palmeri smashed a solo shot. However, that lead was short lived, as Knights outfielder Kaila Crandall liked Palmeri’s style and did the same; launching a solo home run to even the score at one in the fourth inning. The scoring ceased from then up until the seventh inning.
Commanding the circle for the Pioneers was freshman Hannah Olshevski, who threw a complete game, surrendering just two hits and striking out three. In the Pioneer last half of the seventh inning, they put the pressure on the Knights defense when they loaded the bases with nobody out and the winning run standing on third base. Freshman shortstop Leah Mele drove in the winning run with a fly ball to right field that was deep enough to plate sophomore outfielder Jaclyn Hahn for the walk-off win.
The Pioneers were able to give their bullpen a day off as both starters tossed complete games. It’s pretty hard for the opposition to score when you don’t allow many hits and play good defense. That’s exactly what the Pioneers did. They committed one error in the two games and their pitchers allowed a combined four hits.
Martin and Olshevski were at it again on Saturday, March 26, when they hosted St. Thomas Aquinas College. Both girls continued their stellar outings against Bridgeport and paced two Pioneer shutout victories.
In the first game, the lone run of the match came via an error in the field in the fifth inning. Sophomore infielder Claire Travis, who legged out an infield single earlier in the inning, came around to score on a throw by St. Thomas’ Kelcy McGeehan which airmailed its intended target allowing Travis to advance home.
Martin, coming off a performance where she allowed zero runs on four hits, went out to the circle and did it again. She went all seven innings and allowed four hits and struck out eight. The Pioneers won by a score of 1-0.
In the second game, the Pioneers rode the arm of Olshevski, who surrendered one hit in a complete game victory for the Pioneers where they plated five runs. Although Olshevksi didn’t need that much run support, the Pioneers supplied plenty to go around. They opened the scoring in the second inning when sophomore outfielder Samantha Marrone drove in a run with a single and plated two more runs in the third inning on another RBI single and a run scoring base on balls. The Pioneers tacked on two more runs in the fifth and sixth innings with an RBI double by sophomore designated hitter Emily DeVito and an RBI single by Palmeri.
Olshevksi again went the distance and allowed zero runs. She didn’t strike out any hitters either, so the Pioneer defense was on its toes all game and they responded well.
The Pioneers improved their record to 13-5 and are undefeated in conference play. Over their last six games, the Pioneers are 6-0 and have allowed just three runs.
Head Coach Jamie Apicella and his team return to the field on Wednesday, March 30, when they visit Queens College for a doubleheader. Game-time is set for 3 p.m.

The baseball team opened up conference play on Thursday, March 24, when they hosted Molloy College. The Pioneers suffered a 5-2 loss to drop to 8-9 on the season.
The Pioneers drew first blood in the fourth inning when freshman outfielder Joe Piscitelli cracked a single with two runners on, plating them both to give the Green and Gold a 2-0 advantage.
Junior pitcher Jake DeCarli was in cruise control until the sixth inning when things began to unravel. With a runner on second and one out, Molloy stringed three straight hits together and plated two runs. They took a 3-2 lead on an RBI ground out.
The arms in the Molloy bullpen threw up zeros and put down any hopes of a Pioneer comeback. A pair of insurance runs in the eighth inning took some life out of the Pioneers and they went down without a fight in the ninth inning.
DeCarli tossed seven innings and surrendered 11 hits. He also allowed four earned runs and fanned three. At the dish, the Pioneers put 11 base runners on, but only plated two of them. They also left nine men on base.
The Pioneers looked to bounce back on Saturday, March 26, when they played against the very same Lions from Molloy College in a double-header. Although the venue changed, the results were still the same; losses for the Pioneers.
The Lions struck first this time, sending three players across home plate in the second inning against junior pitcher Dan Jagiello. The Pioneers cut into the deficit in the top of the seventh inning when junior outfielder Kenny Daley notched his first round tripper of the season. The Pioneers put a couple of runners on base later in the inning, but couldn’t send them around to score.
Just like Thursday, Molloy was able to get key insurance runs late in the game to further expand their lead and they took the opener by a score of 5-1.
In the second game of the double-header, the Pioneer bats were stifled by Lions hurler Bobby Kelly. The Pioneers managed a lone single against him while Kelly was able to go the distance, allowing zero runs and striking out three.
Red-shirt junior pitcher Joey Arena put up a valiant effort for the Pioneers, going a respectable six innings and striking out two while allowing three runs (two earned). The Lions plated their three runs before the fifth inning. In the first, they scored on a wild pitch and in the fourth inning, they plated two on a fielding error.
Head Coach Mike Gaffney and his team will look to get back on track when they travel to play St. Thomas Aquinas College on Friday, April 1. First-pitch is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.

Things continue to look better for the fourth-ranked women’s lacrosse team (7-1) as they inked another pair of wins to extend their winning streak to six games. In their first game on Wednesday, March 23, they smothered Molloy College by a score of 16-6, in an East Coast Conference collision at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
In what was another impressive start, the Pioneers jumped out of the gates early and took a commanding 4-0 lead in the first seven minutes of action. The stretch was capped off by junior attacker Stefani Vagelatos who scored an unassisted goal at the 23-minute mark.
Molloy would split the deficit midway through the opening stanza, but the Pioneers offense soared for five consecutive goals within seven minutes to go up 9-2. Junior attacker Connor Bird led the charge, notching two scores for the Green and Gold.
After leading 9-3 at the break, the Pioneers continued the offensive assault by scoring six out of the next eight goals to grab a comfortable 15-5 edge. The hosts never looked back, as senior attacker Emily Delaney and junior defender/midfielder Cara Douglas sealed the deal; combining for three scores in the final minutes of the contest.
Vagelatos, Delaney and Bird all racked up five points apiece. In addition, senior midfielder/defender Honey Roche won a gamehigh eight draws and caused one turnover. Defensively, sophomore goalkeeper Olivia Kirk was a force, rejecting seven shots, picking up four ground balls and causing a pair of turnovers.
Momentum carried over for the Pioneers as they tumbled over Holy Family University (0-8), 18-6 on Saturday, March 26, behind the lights of Delaney, who totaled a career-high 11 points (4 G, 7 A) in a nonconference matchup at Tiger Field in Philadelphia, PA.
Roche had another solid outing with five points (4 G, 1 A) as freshman Ryan McKinney continued to impress, scoring three goals for the Pioneers. Tied at one with under 20 minutes remaining in the openi ng period, the Pioneers went on a 7-1 run to carry an 8-2 lead into the break. McKinney and red-shirt junior attacker Alexis Newman scored two goals each during that juncture.
In the second half, Holy Family scored first, but it was all Pioneers from that point on. The Pioneers responded with a vengeance; closing out the game on a 10-2 run. Roche accounted for four tallies to lead the Pioneers during the latter stanza.
The Pioneers balanced attack continued to shine as they held a heavy margin in shots (40-16) and caused 21 turnovers. Between the pipes, Kirk and senior goalie Kasey Kephart totaled six stops for the Green and Gold. For the Tigers, goalkeeper Grace Deckert made 14 saves.

On two separate occasions this month LIU has served as the set to two television productions. From March 2 to March 9, NBC’s crime/ drama television series, “Blindspot,” and on March 24 and March 25 “True Crime with Aphrodite Jones,” was filmed, which airs on Investigation Discovery. Most of the shooting was done in either Humanities Hall or Pratt Recreation Center.
Specifically for “Blindspot” throughout the days of filming there was simulated gunfire, and several other action sequences being recorded. Students were made aware of the action scenes being filmed on campus through an alert sent to students e-mail accounts. “Blindspot” is about a woman who was found naked in Times Square, her body is covered with tattoos, but she has no recollection of how she got them or how she got there, according to nbc.com. From there, the story unfolds as the woman, Jane Doe and the FBI follow a trail of clues found through her tattoos. The cast includes; Sullivan Stapleton from “300: Rise of an Empire,” and “Strike Back”, Jaimie Alexander from “Thor: The Dark World,” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste from “Without a Trace.”
On the other hand, “True Crime with Aphrodite Jones” only filmed for two days, and did not require any alerts. This show is about Aphrodite Jones, an acclaimed crime writer, who goes behind the scenes of famous murder cases. This is done partially though reenactments, which is what was filmed on campus. This particular episode is about a murder in the 1980s, where a man killed his best friend, which was also reenacted on campus, but according to production members was done in a very non-gore way.
“Blindspot” coming to campus was coordinated through Conference Services, who are responsible for handling campus space. This includes coordinating with admissions for open houses or for different departments when they host guest speakers. In 2013, Post also hosted the cast while filming “The Rewrite,” a movie starring Hugh Grant.

The 84th chapter of the Alpha Eta Society, the national scholastic honor society for allied health professions, was founded at LIU Post on January 16, 2016.
To join this elite honor society, students must be in their senior year and have a cumulative 3.5 GPA. Faculty nominate eligible students who show leadership in their chosen profession. These nominations must then be approved by the dean of the School of Health Professions and Nursing. Currently there are 38 students and five faculty members in the honor society. Each year, all the students are eligible to join the honor society. There are over 100 students in health professions program.
Those who are inducted into the society receive a certificate, pin and special cord at their graduation ceremony. As a member of the honor society, students are part of an elite group of allied healthcare professionals who have shown academic excellence and leadership while at their institution of higher learning.
“Our mission of educating students from diverse backgrounds to address the health and social needs of individuals, families, communities and society, as well as to develop skills for best practice, based on humanistic values, inter-professional skills, scientific knowledge and evidence is closely aligned with the mission of Alpha Eta,” said Stacy Gropack, the dean for the School of Health Professions and Nursing.
According to the Alpha Eta website, “The development of a national honor society for allied health students was proposed in 1973. The purpose of the honor society was to recognize scholarship in allied health students using the model of the University of Florida’s local honor society, Eta Rho Phi. The society was named for the Greek letters equivalent to the first letters of allied health, which were Alpha Eta.”
The motto for the society is “Together We Serve” because it represents all of the allied health professions. The purpose of the society is to promote and show recognition of significant scholarship, leadership, and contributions to the allied health professions,” said Mimi Pezzuto, the director of Community Outreach for Post.
To establish this society at Post, a petition to create a chapter had to be sent to the national secretary-treasurer, who submitted the petition to the Board of Directors for consideration. Pezzuto coordinated the petition in December. Two-thirds of the council must vote affirmative for chapter establishment to be approved.
The School of Health Professions and Nursing has departments in social work, health sciences, biomedical sciences, nursing and nutrition. In order to join this society, chapters must be established at institutions of higher education with three or more allied health programs.
The induction ceremony for Alpha Eta Society will be held on April 27 at 3 p.m. in the Tiles Center. All members will be inducted during this ceremony. To join this honor society students must be nominated. The honor society will also hold annual meetings.

Since the fall of 2013, LIU has been focused on promoting student-run businesses. Some of which have been reimagined. The Student Body Boutique and LIU Post Treat Shop, Hutton and Post have seen several changes, in an effort to rebrand the businesses and attract more customers.
Sandra Angilletta, an art therapy major, works at the Student Body Boutique. According to Angilletta, “the grand re-opening was to reach out to the whole LIU student body and to let them know that there were some renovations and that there are going to be a lot of changes coming,” she said. Some of these changes include management and inventory. “We really are just trying to reach out to the LIU community and give more awareness to the store,” she said. As with the other student run business at LIU Post, any profits made from the stores goes back into student scholarships. According to success coach and head of student-business development, Eric Shapiro, fifty percent of profits go to student scholarships while the other fifty percent of profits go back into student-business development.
Before getting the job at the Student Body Boutique, Angiletta said she did not visit the store very frequently. Angiletta is satisfied with the trajectory the store is going in, but realizes that changes must be made in “baby steps.”
Another student invested in the success of the student run businesses is junior public relations major, Monica Peralta. Peralta has been involved since the program launched at LIU Post three years ago. Peralta also has a minor in fashion merchandising, which explains her employment at the Student Body Boutique. As the head of product development for all of the stores, Peralta helps design new products for Pioneer Nation (the campus merchandise store) and purchases inventory for the boutique and Hutton and Post (the new name for the treat shop). Peralta said she has learned a lot throughout her time working for these student businesses. “Being a part of student run businesses, I kind of got to put my hand in all the cookie jars,” she said. “Not only do I develop new products for the stores but I got to help promote them and get a little into social media, hiring, and management,” she said. Peralta hopes that all of these options can help her figure out what field she wants to go into after graduation.
Peralta does not take her opportunity to work for these stores for granted. “Being a part of the original committee with student run businesses, it is such a joy to see us branch out and create more opportunities for students to open more businesses and venture out into different industry,” Peralta said. For example, Peralta said if there was interest in opening an event planning company, this could be possible. “Anything that anyone is interested in and has a passion for,” she said. “We are at the very beginning stages still and it’s just so fascinating to see the program unfold,” she concluded.

The School of Health Professions and Nursing will offer a new Bachelor of Science degree in food, nutrition and wellness beginning in the fall semester of 2016. According to LIU’s website, the 129-credit program will offer two concentrations: nutrition, health and wellness or nutrition and food hospitality. Specifically, the program will focus on exercise and fitness, health in the community, and nutrition and food hospitality.
Dr. Josephine Wright, director of the didactic program in dietetics, said the program is a result of a collaboration of the entire department of nutrition, and that planning took a little over a year. Once planned out, the department had to get the program approved by on campus committees and then the state education department.
“We wanted to make something that we thought the students would enjoy where there would be more flexibility,” Wright said, referring to the fact that students will be able to choose one of the two concentrations within the program compared to the accredited B.S. in nutrition that is already offered at Post.
The new program is non-accredited, meaning that it is more suited for students who are looking to do something in fitness or hospitality, but not necessarily looking to become certified dietitians, according to Wright. This also means that students who have already taken classes relating to the new program, including nutrition, physical education, or psychology, could have those credits count toward their degree in food, nutrition and wellness.
Although the university has not assigned professors to teach the new courses offered for this degree, the courses are available for students to enroll in for the upcoming fall semester. Some of the new classes include nutrition in health and disease, designing cuisines, and a practicum where students can gain hands-on experience working with people in the health, nutrition and fitness fields.
“These new courses will address issues of today,” Wright explained. “They will deal with the kinds of health problems that are out there in the world today.” Many of these issues, she said, include obesity and diabetes.
Students will be able to work in a variety of professions with this new degree, depending on which concentration they choose to pursue. Some of the possibilities include jobs in the fitness field, like personal trainers or owning a fitness facility; jobs relating to health and the community; or jobs in hospitality like management and food service careers.
Wright said that this new degree and its flexibility in concentrations make it unique to Post.
“Queens College has an exercise degree with some nutrition, but not as much nutrition as [Post],” Wright said. “Community colleges also offer hospitality, so this is a great option for those coming from community colleges looking to finish their degree.”

The Leading With Edge is a new leadership certificate program designed to help women learn to lead in a professional environment. This is done through eight information sessions, the first of which was held on March 18. The session was called Leading for Result… Up and To the Right, and was designed to “help participants to understand the many inputs into leadership styles, starting with your social/personality style,” according to program’s website, executive.liu.edu.
Fourteen executive women from Long Island attended the first session. The cost was $3,500 if registered before February 15 or $4,000 anytime afterwards. The fee includes all eight of the information sessions and supplemental materials, including a notepad, pen, and published work from the presenters. At the end of the course participants will receive a certificate from the College of Management.
This was the first initiative of the Center for Executive Education, which was created this month as a way for executives in the business world to learn new skills, according to Ivy Algazy, director of leadership initiatives for the Center for Executive Education.
The instructor for the first session, Angelina Rouse, shared her experiences as a former chief accounting officer at Pall Corporation and chief financial officer of the North American Components division at Arrow Electronics.
Although this program is only for working professionals, LIU is planning to bring a similar program for students and possibly a youth program targeting women in high school at an unspecified time, according to Algazy. She believes attempting to implement all of these programs at once would have been too complicated, and elected to go with a rollout plan.
Algazy is the pioneer of the developing Center for Executive Education, which was a result of her prior experience with the Women’s Collaborative. The Women’s Collaborative brings executive women from several fields from across Long Island together to further their leadership abilities, which is what she is trying to do at Post.
The Women’s Collaborative was created in partner with the Long Island Association in 2014. The LIA is a business organization on Long Island that brings together the executives from the top companies on Long Island.
President Cline is one of only 13 women on 68-person board of directors for the LIA, according to longislandassociation.org. Naturally, when Algazy came to Post this momentum turned into The Center for Executive Education.
Graziela Fusaro, the associate dean of the College of Manage ment, was responsible for some of the smaller details of the program, such as how the Leading With Edge webpage would fit into Center for Executive Education website, or the finances of the course such as profit and loss of the program.
The second session, which will be held on April 1, is called Language of Leadership. The focus will be on how to convey a strong message through either body language, word choice, and how to use these skills to eventually ascend to higher places throughout the course of an individual’s career
