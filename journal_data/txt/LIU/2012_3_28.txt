“There’s No Business Like Show Business” is one of Irving Berlin’s many hit songs. The songwriter, who lived to be 101, might not be recognized by everyone, but when they hear his music, most Americans are likely to sing along. On March 22nd, Associate Professor of Theatre and Film John Koshel led an audience of students, faculty and visitors through Berlin’s career in a lecture filled with movie and music clips that highlighted Berlin’s more than 50 years of songwriting.
After applying to be one of 55 sites in the U.S. to host the traveling exhibit, “A Fine Romance: Jewish Songwriters, American Songs, 1910-1965,” LIU Post was selected to show parts of the nonprofit organization’s initiative by Nextbook, Inc. “I am so happy with the involvement from students and the community,” said Manju Prasad-Rao, the head of the Instructional Media Center and Coordinator for Exhibits in the Library,  After Professor Koshel’s presentation, seven vocalists from the LIU music department performed a selection of Berlin´s songs, accompanied by Professor of Advanced Theory and Piano Richard Iacona.
With hits including, “White Christmas,” “God Bless America,” and “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” Irving Berlin went down in history as one of the most popular American songwriters of all time. He was born in Russia but emigrated to the U.S. with his family after a house fire and settled in New York. At 14 years old, he ran away from home and got a job escorting a blind bar singer from one venue to another in Chinatown. Later, he became one of the top contributors in the music business by presenting one hit song after another throughout his 50 years of writing and composing.
“His songs are very sing-able,” said Professor Koshel, underscoring his statement by encouraging the crowd to sing along. Koshel described Berlin’s development with the changing technological times, starting with long tones at the time of no microphones in early 20th century and adapting to shorter words and an “as-we-speak” style of songwriting when the technology emerged.
Along with adapting to changes in the technological world, Berlin’s songs also work as an illustration of his lifetime. The composer made songs for both Christmas and Easter. His love for music started in his early years, during bar mitzvahs and holiday fun.
Along with an ear for music, he had an eye for business: Berlin retained the rights for his music and started his own publishing company. His songs, which he developed without ever being taught music, were played only on the piano black keys and were created during late-night and early morning hours. They were written towards “the mob,” or the ordinary people. Berlin liked to see them as “the ones who were always right,” Professor Koshel explained.
The lecture in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall attracted a crowd of students, faculty and visitors interested in paying a tribute to Berlin. The nearly hour and a half lecture and performance included important points of his career explained by Professor Kosher, along with clips from a couple of his famous songs, such as “Annie Get Your Gun,” “He Ain’t Got Rhythm,” and “Blue Skies”; It concluded with performances by Post students.
“It was really enjoyable,” said junior Psychology major Andrea Sieban. “It’s the kind of music we don’t hear too much, but I thought it had a good substance, and it was a nice experience.”
“A Fine Romance” continues with lectures and exhibitions, including a display of original movie posters from the LIU B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library’s Special Collections Departments and drawings and sketches by artist-in-residence at LIU Post Dan Christoffel. It is open Tuesday -Saturday from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and it ends on April 12th in the Library’s Hutchins Gallery at 12:30 p.m. A full schedule of events can be found at http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/exhibits/jewishsongwriters/html/exhibit_events.html.

LIU Post students, faculty and staff can now text a librarian to receive answers to general reference questions right on their cell phones.
The Text-A-Librarian service is replacing Instant Message A Librarian, an instant chat service between users and librarians.  Associate Professor and Librarian Elizabeth Mezick said, “The IM service was not being used very much by students or faculty. Since more people are texting today, the Library thought a texting service would be a better alternative.”
According to a Nielsen Mobile survey, since 2003, texting traffic has seen a steady rise of 37 percent every six months.  The library staff took notice of the importance of text messaging earlier this month and adopted a service it felt would be most effective.
Students, faculty and staff can text questions regarding services and information about the library, how to search the library catalogue, how to locate Internet sources and questions regarding the selection of databases.  The questions are then sent to reference librarians at LIU Post and are answered during library hours within the same day.  If a question is sent while the library is not open, the question is saved and then answered the next day.  For questions that cannot be answered by text, users are encouraged to come to the library for assistance or to call the reference desk at 516-299-2305.
To begin using the service, students should text “askpost” to 66746.  A confirmation message will be sent to the individual’s phone.  Standard messaging and data rates may apply.  Then, save the number in your phone, and ask questions when necessary.  The Text-A-Librarian service will now recognize your phone.  For everyone who uses the service, your information is protected Text-A-Librarian does not display phone numbers, and each question generates an anonymous ID number to ensure privacy.
Text-A-Librarian is a quick way to get help, especially for those people who cannot seem to find enough time in the day to stop by the Library.  Mezick explained, “It provides another way for students to access assistance from the library in addition to the traditional methods of visiting or calling the library, as well as the library’s virtual reference services of email and chat.”
The Text-A-Librarian service was launched on March 8th, and people have already begun to make use of the program.  Several other libraries offer the same service. Text-A-Librarian was created by the award-winning mobile technology company, Mosio.
Ashley Abney, a junior Public Relations major, said, “I love the idea because I have to do my senior thesis next semester and cite journals.  It’s going to be helpful having a librarian so conveniently available.”  Other students, including senior Psychology major Adwoa Boateng, said, “The library is kind of out of the way.  So, this is a good service if I need an answer to a quick question.”

At the March 6th Student Government meeting, the administration announced that the campus has exceeded its budget for this year.
“The campus has a budget of about $40 million, but the campus spent around $44 million,” stated LIU Post Provost Dr. Paul Forestell. Some students are concerned that this will lead to budget cuts or that it will negatively effect the campus.
Anketa Younge, a junior Science and Psychology major, said, “I’m worried that students will be affected financially and also the faculty members.”
Dr. Forestell explained that the budget is a non-digressional budget, meaning that the campus is required to pay certain expenses, including payroll, utilities and financial aid for students. The budget is decided upon by predicting the revenue and expenses the school will incur for the year.
One issue this year has been graduate enrollment, which is currently down around five percent. This adds up to a $3-4 million loss for campus income. Additionally, LIU Post had to hire more human resources personnel to cover legal work.
Dr. Forestell also said that increasing the student aid in scholarships, especially merit-based scholarships,  in order to raise the academic level of the school and bring in more students has added to campus expenses. According to Forestell, the amount of student aid has increased by 20 percent in the last five years.
While LIU Post faces budgetary issues, Forestell said that a new program will be introduced to the campus in Spring 2013. The Adult Completion program will allow people who never completed the required amount of credits to receive a degree. The program will be a blend of on-campus and online courses to aid those students who have families or full-time jobs.
Some students are still concerned with the budget issues and how it will affect them. “Hopefully, the school will figure out how to solve this problem,” said Jade Greco, a junior Biomedical Science major.
However, Forestell said that even though the campus has gone over the budget, financial aid will not be cut. “As long as students maintain good academic standing, their financial aid will be given to them,” he said.

I’ve always thought that boys had no clue how our brains worked; that men really were from a different planet or something. But now I’m starting to think that they may understand us a little better than I had anticipated. Ladies, don’t worry, I’m not saying they completely get us and they’re going to get everything perfect. I know that will never happen unless we find ourselves cast in a Disney movie and even then the handsome prince usually messes up once or twice before getting it right.
Hear me out though. As I’ve stated in previous articles, us females have a lovely tendency to fall for the bad guy, the guy who essentially has a billboard screaming heartbreak over his head. They have to be doing something right, don’t they? If they weren’t, we wouldn’t get involved with them in the first place. Well, my friends, I’ve figured it out.  Those sneaky little you know what’s have figured out the way our minds work.
They tell us exactly what we want to hear. Those buffoons have mastered the female psyche. A few days of being told how beautiful (not pretty, because they know beautiful sounds better) and different we are followed by a few days of silence will drive us batty and we’ll keep coming back for more. Their genius doesn’t end there. They will come up with some profound excuse as to why we were ignored; some asinine tragedy occurred, a distant relative got sick; the list goes on and on.
If you’re anything like me, you’ll question it at first but end up telling yourself that you’re being overly critical because the guy had already told you how “wonderful” you are. And we will just do this over and over again until we lose our minds. It’s all a big heaping load of garbage.
Looking back, I should have listened to my dad when he told me that guys don’t mature until they’re about 30 or 32. I would have saved so much time and energy. Of course we are all convinced that we found that one in a million guy at first, it’s new and exciting. The chance of them actually being that remarkable is slim to none at our ages.
I don’t have much hope that reading this article or any of the previous ones I’ve written on similar topics will be of much help. They are true masterminds; every word is plotted and strategic. The best part about this whole thing is that girls are still under the impression that they have the upper hand. As a gender, females will continue to be stupefied by a pretty face and an elusive compliment. Sorry ladies, for now the power is theirs because we give it to them.

The Republican primary race continues to push on and it still has no definitive winner. As each state holds its primary election and the tallies go up for Romney, Santorum, Gingrich, and Paul, the question is quickly shifting from who is the best Republican candidate to lead the country to who can beat President Obama in November? The even bigger question is; can he even be beaten? Of course no candidate is impossible to beat but do any of the four Republican contenders have what it takes to become President?
Part of the question relies on what the American public thinks of Obama going into Election Day. This isn’t looking to good at the moment since Obama has just hit an all time low approval rating of 46.8%, according to realclearpolitics.com. The numbers are not exact and could of course fluctuate over the next few months and alter the final election in November. But what about the Republicans; are they really up for the challenge?
America seems to still be unsure about that. Not one of the four major remaining candidates has a clear view of the finish line. Ron Paul, who is currently in last place, has yet to win a single state in the entire primary race. Why would he still continue to run this late without having a single state on his side? Of course he could bounce back and win a few but it probably won’t be enough to give him the nomination. What he can still do is be a spoiler. If Paul drops out, his loyal supporters will have to find another candidate to vote for. So by staying in the race he can at least take the few votes he will get and not have them handed to another candidate. For the rest of the candidates this just means fewer votes to go around, making every other vote count just a bit more.
And then of course there is Newt Gingrich, who is currently third in the race. Gingrich has won just a few states here and there. When the recent elections in Mississippi and Alabama occurred, Gingrich needed to come in better than third or dropping out would be a very real possibility. Although Gingrich didn’t win either state, he managed to pull in second place in both, keeping his hope alive just a bit longer. But even though he won second place, it still doesn’t give him a major push towards first overall. Gingrich made it clear from the beginning that he is in it for the long haul, so it doesn’t seem like he will be giving in any time soon.
So while Paul and Gingrich’s hopes hang on by threads, the two front runners are Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. A few months ago it seemed Romney had a clear victory and no one had ever heard of Santorum. Today, Romney is barely ahead of Santorum and the race is quickly tightening up. Santorum has been racking up the Deep South states such as Alabama, and Mississippi and other major states such as Kansas while Romney is picking up numerous other smaller states. Romney did pick up the majority of states in the Super Tuesday election but the battles in the more important states, such as Ohio, were so close it is almost impossible to tell that Romney had won at all. These states are considered more important because of the size of the population. The higher the population, the higher the number of delegates the state has. So states like Ohio, New York, California, and Texas are worth more than states such as Wyoming or Delaware. Santorum is quickly catching Romney and before long, Santorum could have the lead and a nomination if things continue in the same fashion they have been.
This brings it all back to the original question. Will one of these candidates be able to beat President Obama in November? The answer is still unclear. It is extremely difficult to tell at this point because things are so close at the moment. It does play in his favor that the Republican Party is so divided because if the party can’t pick a clear candidate then how will it ever agree to vote on the same one in the long run. But if Obama’s popularity continues to sink, then it may not look too good in November. It seems yet again that only time will tell what the outcome will be. For now the Republican candidates will fight for the first place spot, and Obama will fight for more popularity among the American people, but it will be the fight in November that will answer all the questions.

For seniors, graduation is quickly approaching. Students have mixed feelings about the big day when they truly enter the real world outside the comfortable gates of college.
I am only a junior and I already feel the pressure of finding a job and facing the “real world.” I have to admit, the thought of being a grown up really scares me and I feel like I’m not ready for it. Honestly, I don’t really want to grow up! I know I sound like Peter Pan, but it can be very overwhelming to leave childhood behind and become an adult with a lot of responsibilities.
Unlike comfortable college life, in the real world, you must buy and cook your own food when you want to eat. I bet the meals at Hillwood and Winnick sound pretty good now. Of course, you can always order take out or eat at a restaurant but how can someone straight out of college afford that? Most students are already thousands of dollars in debt the day they graduate with tons of loans to pay off.
Then don’t forget a place to live. Finding an affordable apartment in decent condition in a good neighborhood can be extremely difficult; especially if you do not have a job or form of steady income. This leads me to the worry most students stress about quite frequently….finding a job.
Several seniors seem to be feeling the pressure. “I am nervous about finding a job in this economy. I think I will find better job opportunities in Korea and should move back there,” said senior finance major, Sung Joon. “I’m really stressed out about finding a job,” said Senior Sharla Celestin, who is a social work major.
Some are not that worried about getting a job. “I’m sure I’ll get some job, it doesn’t have to be in my field. I’m a hard worker,” said senior Forensic Science major, Rachel Kurtz. “If I don’t get a job, I’ll live with my parents who will support me. They love me no matter what,” Kurtz added. “I can’t wait to graduate to relax and finally have free time. I really want to leave New York and travel to other countries,” said Kurtz.
Some do not feel the transition from school to work is much of a change. “The work is never over. When school is over, I have to get a real job,” said senior Maria Bivona, a Public Relations major.
The reality is that graduation is coming soon whether the class of 2012 is ready for it or not. One main reason most students attend college is to get a better job, which is supposed to pay more. It is the ending so many have waited their whole lives for. But will it all turn out the way one hoped? After all this is not a movie, this is real life. Will we get the happy ending we wanted?

If you haven’t noticed in the news lately, the subject of female contraceptives has been one of the largest trending topics surrounding the Republican primary. By August, President Obama wants to have health care providers cover female contraceptives. Many Republicans oppose this, causing many women activists to speak out against the Republicans running for president.
 
I’m all for free birth control and what not, but lately, women have been suggesting finding a contraceptive for men, and it’s not condoms. Use your imagination to figure that one out. But in the world of sex, what is safe and what isn’t?
 
Birth control: When taken the pill correctly, it has been proven to be 99.9 percent effective. The pill does not protect from sexually transmitted diseases. And as any woman knows, it’s easy to forget to take the pill. The pill must be taken every day on a schedule that goes by her menstrual cycle. The NuvaRing is similar to what the pill does, except it is inserted in the vagina and left for three weeks until a new one is put in. It is also 99 percent effective and it does not protect against STDs. Side effects for both are weight gain, nausea, vaginal infections, and erratic periods.
 
Condoms: The most effective protection against STDs is condoms. They are the most common contraceptive to use during sex, according to an FDA poll.  The use of condoms has decreased since many couples feel the sex isn’t comfortable with the condom. Many couples have tried the “pull out” method,which is what is sounds like – stopping sex before ejaculation. It is also known as the reversible method. Other reversible methods of contraception include IUDS and condoms. IUDS are copper containing devices that are surgically placed in the cervix. It’s a pain in the neck to have, but it is effective for up to five years. The bad news about pulling out is that it can lead to problems later for men such as erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. Also, the pull out method may not always be effective because pre-ejaculate fluids, commonly called “pre-cum,” contains semen and can lead to pregnancy.
Abstinence: According to Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, and many religions, abstinence is the way to go. They are right – abstinence is the safest way to go, but is it the sanest? Many doctors have said sex is good for those to let out anger and stress. Many societies that ban sex before marriage experience more acts of rage, aggression, and murder according to the U.S. Conservative Policy Research. Many young adults feel the need to fit in, so having sex is a gateway to be accepted.
 
For all of us, it is important to be safe from STDs and HIV. Ladies, we should visit a gynecologist once a year, even if we are not sexually active, just to be safe. As for those interested in politics, get prepared to hear a lot about sex in the next few months. Women count in this election, and the more the Republicans hold back from contraceptives, the more likely they will lose out on women voters.

Whether you live on-campus or are a commuter we all have complaints or things we wish would change about LIU-Post. After talking to several students and asking them, “What would you change about LIU Post?” I was given a lot of reoccurring answers as well as some more interesting ones. Faith Pinna, a junior social work major, said that she would change the “poor parking situation” and that the “sections of parking for students and faculty need to be fixed”. Allan Smith, another junior who is also studying social work, had the same complaint about the parking and also said that there needs to be “more opportunities to talk to their advisers”.
Dan Laterza, a graduate student in pre-pharmacy studies, said that he wanted “a shorter common hour”. Theresa Bergold a junior social work major, said she felt that the “information given to the students is indirect, especially concerning the school budget and how it affects them”. Taylor Fitzsimoms, also a junior studying social work, had two things to change, “Change the name back to C.W. Post” and “better parking”. Finally, Audey Thompson, a junior social work major, felt that “the students need more say in the administration”.
It’s clear that parking is a large issue, its limited and most faculty parking is located closest to the academic halls. This can be stressful for students who have to park out of their way and rush to class. Also the common hour reduction is a valid point to make, some of us would want to end classes a little earlier to be able to go home and for those students who have jobs in between classes, getting classes done for the day is important. Finally, the issues of the student say in the administration; are those who control our tuitions and how the school is run truly hearing us? When speaking further to Theresa Bergold, she said that she was at an SGA meeting not too long ago were it was stated that the school went over the budget and the administration wasn’t clear as to where cuts would be made. To any students, not knowing were any budget cut would be made is terrifying. Hopefully, this isn’t as bad as it sounds but if cuts are being made, we should know about them.

Picture yourself sitting by a beautiful campfire.   Every once in a while, you have to fuel the fire to keep it burning.  If you stop fueling the fire, then what happens?  Eventually, the fire will slow down until it is completely out.   Now imagine this fire is your body’s metabolism and the fuel of your metabolism is the food that you eat.   To keep our metabolism running as best as possible, we have to continue to fuel our bodies every so often just like the fire.
Metabolism is the amount of energy or calories that your body burns in order to maintain its weight.  At rest, your body has a set number of calories it will burn, and the more activity and exercise you do, the more calories your body will burn.   At around thirty years old, your body’s metabolism will gradually start to decrease, but you can take steps to stop this process and even boost your metabolism in the meantime.  The three key steps in boosting metabolism are eating breakfast, performing physical activity everyday and snacking smartly.
Most people do not realize that you must snack in order to keep up your metabolism.  The key to smart snacking is to eat every few hours, to snack mindfully and to include carbohydrate, protein and a little fat in your snack.  Keep each snack at 100-200 calories.  When you snack every few hours, you will never let your metabolism slump so low and you will be avoiding that feeling where you are so hungry, you will just grab anything.  A little planning ahead goes a long way.
Follow these simple tips and you will start to boost your metabolism in no time!  Just remember everybody is different and each person needs to eat a different amount of calories each day.
Simple Smart Snack Ideas (100-200 calories):
10 Whole wheat pretzels and 2 tablespoons hummus
¼ cup nuts and dried fruit trail mix
1 small banana with 1 tablespoon almond butter
1 apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon
6 oz. Greek yogurt and ½ cup berries
3 whole grain crackers and 1 string cheese
1 hard boiled egg and 1 slice whole wheat toast
Cereal or granola bar such as Kashi Bar, Lara Bar or Special K bar
½ peanut butter and jelly sandwich on whole wheat bread
3 cups popcorn (it’s a whole grain)

            Do you ever find yourself snacking when you’re not even hungry?  Have you ever had that guilty feeling after finishing a whole package of your favorite comfort food?  Overeating contributes to the current obesity epidemic in the United States.  How would you like to know what signals the body to stop eating?
The average person makes over 250 decisions a day about food.  Brian Wansink’s book, Mindless Eating, explores the psychology behind what we eat, why we eat so much, and why we can’t stop eating it.  It is not in human nature to put our fork down and contemplate whether or not we are full after each bite of food.  How much we eat depends on our environment.  We don’t overeat because of hunger; we overeat because of “family and friends, packages and plates, names and numbers, labels and lights, colors and candles, shapes and smells, distractions and distances, cupboards and containers.”  We mindlessly look for signals in the environment that we’ve had enough, like an empty plate or that there is no one left at the table.
Wansink says “The best diet is the one you don’t know you’re on.”  Overeating is unconscious and in order to control our bad habits we must learn to eat mindfully.  We need to pay more attention to internal cues that tell us we are no longer hungry.  We can also alter our environment which has a significant effect on our eating habits.  “See it before you eat it;” don’t eat directly out of a package or box, put your snack in a separate dish.  You can avoid mindlessly overeating simply by replacing large plates with smaller ones to cut down your servings.  Next time you grab that bag of chips or that box of cookies, check the serving size, put one serving in a bowl and enjoy!

Over the course of my time attending LIU Post, I have constantly heard people say that we don’t recycle on campus. This common misconception is usually said because LIU Post does not have a recycling bin next to every single garbage can around campus. Don’t get me wrong, I know that there are many schools that have recycling bins everywhere you turn, but the fact of the matter is that recycling receptacles are very expensive. To purchase a recycling bin for every garbage can that’s on campus would represent an incredible investment. Not to mention, there must be a person that maintains these recycling bins to make sure that garbage is separated from the recyclables. One would be surprised of how much garbage actually gets thrown into the recycling bins. So, there is an added labor cost in addition to the initial investment.
But, LIU Post does recycle and has been recycling for quite some time. The LIU Post Recycling Program actually started when students from the Southampton campus came to this campus back in 2006. Back then, students, who were members of PEACE (Protecting Every Aspect Concerning the Environment), volunteered their time to sort and clean all of recyclables in the recycling bins. At first, these students were only successful in getting recycling bins in the Quad buildings. As time went on though, the Recycling Program continued growing in addition to expanding to new areas on campus.
Presently, there are recycling bins in the lobby of each residence hall, in addition to, the Interfaith Center, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, and the Lodges. One of the locations that people have always said needs a recycling bin is Humanities Hall. Well guess what? There’s a brand new recycling receptacle located on the first floor of Humanities Hall right outside of the lecture hall. This recycling receptacle is similar to the ones that can be found inside Hillwood Commons and the Pratt. It has 3 different holes for the different materials that you can recycle: plastic, paper, and cans.
Plastic pretty much encompasses every plastic that has the numbers 1-7 on it. Anything from water bottles to plastic bags may be recyclable. Just look for the recycling symbol with the number in the middle of it. Cardboard and paperboard may also be placed in the paper section. This also encompasses newspapers, loose-leaf paper, and envelopes. Please do not throw napkins or paper towels in the paper slot. This would be considered trash and is not recyclable. Also, all staples, paper clips, and tape must be removed from any paper that is recycled.  Lastly, cans are simply either aluminum or tin cans.
Consideration is key when throwing away recyclables. For example, if a salad is in a plastic container, do not throw the container in the recycling bin without washing out the salad and dressing residue. The people that maintain these recycling bins are students and do not work every single day. It is unpleasant to come to work and be greeted with the rancid odor of an old salad that’s been sitting around for 2 to 3 days. So, please always be green, but make sure that you are not mean.

When I was growing up, I never really saw anyone like myself on television, in movies, or fairytales. It was always Boy meets Girl, they fall in love, and they live happily ever after. I never was able to identify with a character in a story in the way that straight children are. I didn’t want to rescue the princess; I wanted to ride off into the sunset with Prince Charming.
I honestly think that fairytales are a great way to teach children about the world, and everyone should read their children fairytales. However, in order to do this we have to include all children. The boys who like to wear dresses and the girls who like to play sports, the boys who like boys and the girls who like girls.
I hear people ask when Disney is finally going to make a film with a gay prince. I really think that it won’t happen any time soon. Let’s be honest, it took Disney seventy-five years to finally have an animated film starring a black princess. At the rate we are going, we won’t have a gay prince until 2087. I really hope that this won’t be the case.
Disney has been supportive of the LGBT community. Every year on the first Saturday of June since 1991, Disney World Orlando opens its doors for its annual Gay Day. Though Disney does not directly sanction Gay Days at Disney, they open their doors to the LGBT individuals, their family, and friends. Disney has been the subject of boycotts from The Southern Baptist Convention for eight years for not putting a stop to Gay Days and another organization flew banner planes warning the populace about the events during the Gay Days weekend.
What are we waiting for? Do we not live in a world where we are put in contact with different people of different cultures, beliefs, lifestyles, creeds, looks, tastes, and attitudes every day? Why haven’t we gotten to a point where an animated character can be openly gay when we have films and television shows depicting openly gay characters played daily? Last time I checked I lived in America, the home of the free and the brave. I have the right to see two gay men kiss in an animated movie while Mickey and Minnie cheer on from the side-lines.
Some people may not agree with me. They would say that sexuality has no place in children’s films or television, but isn’t it already? When Ariel kisses Prince Eric doesn’t that count as impressing sexuality upon a child? When children watch the princess getting the prince in the end, isn’t that implying to them that being straight is the “normal” and “correct” thing to do?
Once upon a time I was a little boy who never saw or heard a fairytale about a gay prince who met another prince and lived happily ever after, but I still grew up to be a young powerful gay man. Exposing children to the world will not harm them, it will teach them. Have you ever spoken to a child about boys who kiss boys? At first, they don’t understand because they’re taught to believe heterosexuality is right. Then, they look at you with eyes wide with understanding and they get it. They truly understand that if you love someone it doesn’t matter if they’re a boy or a girl. Why is it that the older someone gets the less they are able to see that? If a child can understand the concept of love and how simple it really is than we have no excuse. So, let’s see a gay prince, or a lesbian princess, hey, I’ll even go for a cross dressing pirate. It’s called True Love’s Kiss, not Straight Love’s Kiss.

Commuters have noticed some of the parking lots being blocked off for school trips, events at the Tilles, and more. I’m sure many of you have been frustrated with the blocking because that means you have to park in the back lot. What would get me angry is the fact that they would use a whole parking lot for two school buses because that isn’t sensible. But Public Safety uses this as a safety hazard, so what can we do about it?
Nothing really at first – just park where you can, especially if it’s after 11 a.m. And the days they do it on, we have no idea they’re doing it. So to start, you as a driver could ask the Public Safety officers blocking the gates when they are taking down the ropes so you can sneak out and get a good spot. It works – I tried it once and got a great spot. But believe me, those lots fill up fast.
I have said in the past I like the walks and what not, but not if I’m going to be late to class and lose a half a grade for being late. I suggest letting the school buses park in the back and have the kids walk up to the school. The buses are safer back there anyway, since everybody tries to avoid parking back there in the first place and it’s a ghost town after 12:30. So the buses have more space and the kids are young, they can walk farther than we can. I say let them walk so we can have our lot back. It’s not like the parking lot is dangerous. They might have to cross the street, but the cars are supposed to stop for pedestrians, which most of them do (sometimes).
I use this plan and suggest it to Public Safety as a way for us students to get our lot back and to use our lot. We of course want children to visit our school, but we don’t need our small, valuable parking spaces taken away either.

You may have spent your night dancing at a club, or, maybe, you went on a bar crawl the other weekend for St. Patty’s Day. Long story short, you may have had a “little” too much to drink. Congratulations. You have just survived your first hangover.
So, what do you do now? Here are some tips on how to cure a hangover. According to an article titled, “How To Cure A Hangover,” by private bartender, event planner and writer Collen Graham, there are many hangover remedies individuals could utilize to minimize the effects of a hangover. “Many of them will help you cope by replenishing the vitamins and liquid you lost over night, while some, like avoiding caffeine, are very important to a quicker recovery.”
First thing’s first: Sleep and rest all day if you need to. Most people can agree that having a hangover is not fun, and you don’t really have much energy to do anything but be a couch potato all day. Second, you need to hydrate your body with fluids. Water, fruit juice, and Gatorade or Powerade are good remedies to replenish your body, relieve dehydration, and replace needed electrolytes. Painkillers, such as Advil or Motrin, can reduce your hangover headache and muscles pains. According to Buddy T, a recovering alcoholic and the Alcoholism Guide since February 1997, explained his tips for curing a hangover in his article, “The Cures and Remedies for Hangovers: What Does and Does Not Work.” He explains that Tylenol should not be taken if you are experiencing a hangover because alcohol metabolism enhances acetaminophen’s toxicity.” Also, eggs, bananas, soup, and fruit juices help your hangover. For example, bananas and fruit juices help replace potassium and nutrients. They also help to remove toxins from your body.
If you do have a hangover, try to stay away from coffee because it will dehydrate your body even more. It may help your symptoms at first, but this is only temporary, and the symptoms will come back. Also, “foods that are greasy and fried slow down the absorption of alcohol but can irritate the stomach and intestines,” according to Buddy T.
Evening Nurse Conni at the Student Health and Counseling Center said, “As we all know and choose to ignore, not drinking, and preventing a hangover, is the best choice.  However, because alcohol is a diuretic, if you choose to drink, drink water in between drinks.  This can avoid the horrible headache often associated with a hangover. Replenish fluids with water and Gatorade and avoid caffeine.  Some people take orange juice or Alka-Seltzer with good relief.”
So, the next time you wake up with the spins, try some of these helpful tips to help cure your hangover.

Most people are aware that smoking, drinking alcohol and eating junk food can have a negative effect on their health. However, the thought of listening to their iPods usually does not come to mind when thinking of unhealthy habits.
They are almost everywhere you go. People with headphones on, zoned out in another world, bobbing their heads to their favorite tunes. What they might not know is they could be putting themselves at risk.
Between 2004 and 2011, fatal injuries to pedestrians who were listening to headphones more than tripled, according to researchers from the University of Maryland. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance system conducted a study in 2011 on injuries to pedestrians and found that there were 116 accidents involving pedestrians listening to headphones being hit by cars or trains. In this study, 70 percent of these accidents ended in death.
These types of accidents, called distraction-by-device, have been studied for years.  CNET defined as “inattention blindness,” when the brain’s resources are divided by multiple stimuli. The two most common electronic devices which cause distractions are headphones and cell phones. CNET concluded that if pedestrians limit their use of headphones and cell phones while walking near cars and trains, fatal accidents will be less likely to occur.
The use of headphones can have negative side effects on health, such as ear infections and hearing loss.  “Wearing headphones or ear sets does not allow the normal flow of air around and in the ear canal,” Mary Infantino, Director of the Nursing program at LIU Post, said. “When you wear head phones you create a dark, moist environment that encourages the growth of bacteria and fungus. This makes it much more likely to suffer from recurrent ear infections which may also affect hearing down the road.”
Hearing loss is another side of effect. People who regularly listen to music 88 decimals or higher with head phones are at high risk of permanent hearing loss as they get older, warned Infantino.
Young adults usually do not experience hearing loss, however it can appear later in life. Temporary loss of hearing has been seen in teenagers as an effect of headphones, Infantino said.
“I used to be able to hear whispers and now I can’t hear them anymore. I think that is because I put headphones on every day to listen to loud music,” Alex Zhang, a sophomore International Business major at LIU Post, said.
The types of headphone that are inserted directly inside the ear can be even more dangerous. “Loud noises that go directly into your ear drum can certainly damage your hearing,” said Conni Montalbano, a nurse at LIU Post.
Before joining LIU Post, Infantino was a nurse at Federal Express at JFK Airport, which has a hearing conservation program for the employees who work near the airplane engines. They used headsets while working and their hearing was inspected every year. Infantino said several workers stopped using headphones after they kept getting ear infections and over time, “suffered the worse permanent hearing loss.” The workers felt that since it was their job, they had no other choice. Infantino explained that the headphones caused hearing loss that the workers were not aware of until it was too late.
“And now we have a whole population of iPod users that are putting themselves at risk for the same things we tried so hard to prevent at Federal Express,” she said.

This past Friday, the first book of the Hunger Games trilogy was turned into a blockbuster success. The movie grossed $155 million in its opening weekend. The movie took Suzanne Collins’ novel and delivered a heart-wrenching film that depicts the struggle of a sixteen-year-old girl fighting for her life in a death match that will end up changing her world forever.
Katniss Everdeen, the heroine, is pitted against twenty-three other boys and girls between the ages of twelve and eighteen, including a boy from her home district, Peeta Mallark, who cares deeply for her. The catch is that only one can survive. Katniss must fight against the elements, her opponants, her friend, and, most dangerous of all, her emotions, in order to survive and return home to her family.
The arena is controlled by “The Gamemakers,” who can adjust elements and add dangerous obstacles to the playing field. Katniss becomes the object of a political battle between the people of Panem, the post apocalyptic country that was once America, and the government. You become deeply involved with the characters and learn to love them, and then you realize only one can survive.
Compared to the book, the movie follows the storyline almost perfectly, with some very slight variations and the cutting of some characters that didn’t need to be in the movie per se. The filmmakers did a great job of creating the political struggle to set up a glorified cliffhanger for another film.
Overall, the movie is not only a great interpretation of the book but also a movie for the ages. The sequel, Catching Fire, is already being anticipated for November of 2013. And as the saying goes, “Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor!”

A brand new deli/specialty grocery store has opened up less than ten minutes from the campus called The Meat House. The store has a lot of prepared foods, such as Mac and Cheese and even pulled pork, which is awesome. All of the foods are microwavable, so they can be brought back to your dorm. The store also has a huge butcher section with all cuts of steak, chicken, and fish. The portions they give are huge. I seriously knew I could never finish the “Cowboy Steak” in one sitting. The quantity is really good, so you get a lot of food for your money.
The deli section has a lot of choices of sandwiches, and you could even customize what you want. It has everything from Italian cold cuts to BBQ chicken and lots of cheeses to choose from. I got pulled pork with mushrooms and sautéed onions on multi-grain bread. The sandwich was really good and very filling, I couldn’t even finish it.
The store wasn’t as overwhelming as most grocery stores are. It offers many products that most stores usually don’t carry, including artisan cheeses and maple syrup imported from upstate. Employees give out a lot of free samples, and the store is nice, clean, and has an old-fashioned feel to it. They said they are going to start a program to give discounts to students who showing their ID cards, but this is still in the works. Overall, it’s a very cool place, and it’s great to have a deli around the school because I feel it’s something that the area really lacks. For anyone who lives close by, it’s a great new butcher shop and specialty foods store.
The Meat House is located at 1085 Northern Boulevard, Roslyn, NY 11576. It is open daily from 9 a.m. – 8 p.m. The store can be contacted at (516) 307-9880 or at Roslyn.NY@TheMeatHouse.com.

Well, folks, we’ve been duped! I had an idea that “A” was going to be Mona because a friend let it slip that that’s how the book series ends. They threw us off the “A” scent when Mona accompanies Spencer to “A’s” evil lair. But as soon as Spencer took the Spearmint gum wrapper out of the book, I knew. Then, at the last second, it is revealed that Mona is just another pawn in “A’s” master plan.
Getting off the “A” trail for a minute, we have Ezra and Aria. It seems as though they are over, as Ezra gets fired and tells Aria he is going to go stay with his parents. Then, at the masquerade ball, the typical prince charming he is, he surprises her. If that isn’t gut wrenching and heartwarming enough, he takes off both of their masks and tells her that he wants to see her during their first dance. Then, of course, we have Spencer and Toby, who share one heck of a kiss as the girls leave the police station.
All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the Season 2 finale and cannot wait to see what PLL’s creator, Marlene King, has in store for us on ABC Family’s June 5th Season 3 premiere.

Hard rock group LA’s Modern Day Escape’s sophomore album, “Under The Gun,” hit stores on March 27th via Standby Records.
The band consists of James Vegas (Vocals), Sandra Alva (Drums), Marti Rubels (Guitar), Mark Burn (Guitar), and Shep (Bass). Formed in Orlando, Florida in the summer of 2006, original member’s nXe and Shep traveled from California to Florida to meet up with singer James Vegas. Shep soon returned home to attend to personal concerns. nXe and Vegas formed “Avenging Addison” and recruited current guitarist Marti Rubels in 2007. “Avenging Addison” was later broken up to start from scratch. In 2008, they began playing any show they could, eventually landing Florida’s most important venues within a month. It was at this time that Shep returned from California.
Tracks include “Don’t Hold It Against Me,” “Life’s A Bitch,” and “Tiger’s Blood.” My personal favorites include “City Of Thieves” and “Voiceless.” “City Of Thieves’” melody takes you on an upbeat rockin’ rollercoaster ride, while “Voiceless” has a perfect balance of hard rock and calm music, which blend perfectly together. Modern Day Escape has teamed up with RevolverMag for an exclusive advanced stream of their new song “The Syndicate.” The album can be pre-ordered through the official Standby Records web-store. The single is also available to download on iTunes.

After sweeping American International College’s softball team by scores of 7-6 and 2-1, sweeping Queens College by scores of 3-1 and 12-1, and sweeping Adelphi University by scores of 11-1 and 6-4, the LIU Post Women’s softball team split a doubleheader with Merrimack College on Saturday, March 24th, at home at the Softball Complex. LIU Post managed to win the first game 3-2 but lost the second 3-1.
In the first game of the day, after trailing 1-0 heading into the fourth inning, the Pioneers scored two runs off of an RBI double to left field from sophomore third baseman Nicole Hagenah and an RBI single to right field from freshman catcher Aly Dzierzynski. Merrimack tied the game up in the sixth inning off an RBI single, but the lead didn’t last long, when senior second baseman Kendall Bright led off in the seventh inning and hit a home run off of the first pitch. Sophomore Liz Weber earned her sixth win of the season, allowing only one earned run and striking out eight batters.
In the first inning of game two, sophomore third baseman Alexis Gonzales drove in a run off an RBI single to center field, driving in Catherine Havens. Merrimack then scored two runs in the fifth and one in the sixth to seal the victory, giving Alie Thomas the win for the Warriors. Taking the loss for the Pioneers was freshman pitcher Megan Salcido, who allowed two runs on eight hits. Salcido walked away with four strikeouts on the day.

With the Final Four of the 2012 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament set to go, the University of Louisville, Ohio State University, the University of Kentucky and Kansas State are all ready for arguably some of the best matchups in college basketball history.
On Saturday, March 24th, the Louisville Cardinals defeated the Florida Gators by a score of 72-68, and Ohio State defeated the Syracuse Orange by a score of 77-70 in what many considered to be a big upset. The following day, the Kentucky Wildcats defeated Baylor 82-70, and the number-one North Carolina Tar Heels fell to number-two Kansas by a final score of 80-67.
Out of the four teams remaining in the tournament, only Kentucky came in a number-one seed, while Ohio State and Kansas were ranked second and Louisville fourth. Just as any other year has been, the 2012 tournament has been filled with upsets, so don’t count out teams like Louisville just yet, as they take on Kentucky on Saturday. Also on Saturday, Ohio State is set to take on Kansas. Both games will take place in New Orleans, at 6:09 and 8:49 respectively.  Look for two good match-ups, as four teams look for a spot in the championship game and college basketball history.

The C.W. Post men’s lacrosse team dropped its third game of the season on Saturday, March 24th, falling 11-6 to the NYIT Bears.
The Pioneers opened up the scoring when senior attacker Doug Hoch fired a shot past the Bears senior goaltender William McGee 12:10 into the first quarter. However, the Bears answered right back two minutes later when senior midfielder Jason Smith scored to tie the game at one. The Bears jumped ahead with 4:43 left in the first when freshman attacker Ryan Brunet scored to make it 2-1 Bears.
Pioneers junior attacker Justin Patterson scored his first of two goals in the game to tie the game up in closing minute of the quarter.
The Pioneers’ sophomore midfielder Ovtovio Bernabo gave LIU the lead back with his goal at 11:19 in the second quarter to make it 3-2. But the lead would last less than five minutes, as the Bears’ freshman midfielder Brandon Gamblin would score on the man up advantage and tie the game up at three. Pioneers’ junior midfielder Dennis Gannon would then score at 4:35, and Patterson would score seven seconds later to give the Pioneers a 5-3 lead going into halftime.
That lead disappeared in the third quarter when the Bears scored four unanswered goals. The first of the four unanswered goals for the Bears was by sophomore midfielder Bobby Calhoun when he scored at 13:14 to cut the lead to one goal. Then, sophomore midfielder Tyler Chin tied the game up at five at 7:52. Freshman midfielder Luke Miller followed with his own goal and put NYIT ahead when he scored two goals in the closing minute of the third quarter, making it 7-5 Bears.
In the fourth quarter, NYIT’s sophomore attacker Sean Rimmer added to the Bears’ lead, scoring midway through the quarter. Brunet added to the Bears’ lead when he scored on the man-up advantage to make it 9-5. Calhoun then made it 10-5 when he scored with 7:57 left in the quarter. The Pioneers’ senior attacker Eddie Plompen later scored on a man-up advantage to cut it to a 10-6 deficit, but it was too little, too late. The Bears’ sophomore midfielder Tom Duggan scored the game’s final goal with 2:35 left to make it 11-6 in favor of the NYIT Bears.
NYIT outshot the Pioneers 36 to 29 and had a 27-24 advantage in ground balls. The loss moves Pioneers to 3-3 on the season and 1-3 in conference play.
The Pioneers’ next game is Saturday, March 31st, against Mercyhurst College.

LIU Post’s women’s lacrosse team showed why it deserves its position as third in the nation by defeating the number six ranked Lock Haven Lady Eagles 11-8 March 24th in a come-from-behind victory in Lock Haven, PA. Junior goalkeeper Dominique Mosca led the Pioneer defense with 13 saves on the day, while the Post offense maintained a strong presence with balanced scoring from seven different players.
The non-conference win brought the Pioneers’ record to a perfect 4-0 overall while dropping the Lady Eagles to 2-4.
Lock Haven opened the scoring, capitalizing on three goals from Elyse Fisher to take the lead 4-1. The Pioneers quickly answered, though, with goals from sophomore attacker Jackie Sileo, sophomore midfielder Samantha Losco, and sophomore midfielder Kathleen Rotan to tie the game up with less than seven minutes left in the first half of play.
Fisher came through for the Lady Eagles again three minutes later, scoring her fourth goal of the day to pull Lock Haven ahead 5-4. But by the end of the half, another Lock Haven goal and two more Post goals resulted in a 6-6 tie at halftime.
The Pioneers looked in-control beginning the second half. Three straight goals, from junior Ashley Olen, senior Nan Mayott, and junior Abbie Ross, gave the team a 9-6 lead with 22:52 left to play. The next 10 minutes of play saw two more Lady Eagle goals interspersed with two Pioneer goals, but the women from Lock Haven didn’t have enough to overcome the solid defense of the Pioneers as the minutes counted down. Both teams were held scoreless in the final 10 minutes, as the two defenses battled it out until the whistle blew and the Pioneers walked away with the 11-8 win.
With 24 shots apiece for both teams, goalkeeping was the deciding factor of the match, as Mosca’s 13 saves were nearly twice as many as Lock Haven goalie Heather Sacko’s seven.
The Pioneers, who prior to Saturday’s game had dominated teams by 11, 20, and 15 goals, will take the field again on Wednesday, March 28th, when they travel to New Haven, Connecticut to face the University of New Haven. As of March 19th polls, LIU Post women’s lacrosse trailed only Le Moyne College and Adelphi University in national rankings.

Any favorite pro sport teams?
The New England Patriots, the Boston Red Sox, the Boston Celtics, and the Boston Bruins

The LIU Post men’s baseball team has opened the season perfectly within East Coast Conference play after defeating the University of Bridgeport on Wednesday, March 21st, and sweeping a double-header against Queens College on Saturday, March 24th.
After losing six of seven games in Winter Park, Florida, the Pioneers came back home and squared off against the Bridgeport Purple Knights. In the East Coast Conference opener, the Pioneers got a much-needed win, knocking off the Purple Knights by a score of 12-6. Junior pitcher Bo Budkevics picked up his fourth win of the season, going 5.1 innings, allowing three earned runs, walking two batters, and scattering 10 hits. Senior pitcher Paul Bischoff relieved Budkevics and was lights-out. Bischoff gets credit with the save, as he finished the game throwing 3.2 innings and only allowing two men to reach base.
In this game, the Pioneers’ offense exploded with 12 runs on 18 hits. Entering the seventh inning, the Pioneers led 8-6, but they scored four more runs in the inning, highlighted by a two-run homerun by junior catcher Anthony Corona. Later in the inning, junior third baseman Kevin Chenicek had an RBI single, and sophomore first baseman P.J. Jennings hit a sacrifice fly to extend the lead to 12-6.
The Pioneers then had two conference games on Saturday, March 24th, in the form of a double-header against Queens College. In the first game, the Pioneers won a low-scoring battle 2-0. Senior pitcher James Stone shutout the Knights, as he threw six strong innings, only allowing three hits and four walks. Junior pitcher Anthony Zapulla closed out the game for his first save of the season. On the offensive side, Chenicek drove in the Pioneers’ first run on a sacrifice fly in the second inning, scoring junior infielder Keith Herring. Later in the sixth inning, Herring would be a part of another Pioneers’ run as he had an RBI single for the game’s final run.
In the second game between LIU and Queens, the Pioneers won 4-2. The game was tied at two as the teams entered the seventh inning. The Pioneers came to bat in the top half of the inning and broke the tie with two runs. The first run was produced by sophomore infielder Rich Maccarone when he had an RBI double. The following batter was senior outfielder Matt Simone, and he drove in Maccarone with a run-scoring single. Zapulla picked up the win after relieving starter pitcher Mike Eckerle, who threw 5.2 innings, striking out 10 batters and allowing two earned runs.
The Pioneers’ next game is at home on Thursday, March 29th, at 3:00 p.m. against Caldwell College.
