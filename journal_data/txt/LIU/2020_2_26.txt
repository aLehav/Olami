The women’s ice hockey team continued to make history as they defeated Saint Anselm College with a score of 1-0 to capture the 2020 New England Women’s Hockey Alliance title in their inaugural season on Sunday, Feb. 23. The championship win marks the first Division I title won by a Shark team in LIU Athletics program history.
“If this team sticks to their game then we will raise a banner this season,” Head Coach Rob Morgan said before the start of the playoff weekend. Evidently, he judged his team’s abilities accurately.
The playoffs started for the Sharks on Wednesday, Feb. 19 as they hosted Saint Michael’s College and defeated them with a score of 7-0.
The team then secured their spot in the championship game as they ended the No. 1 seed and regular season champions Sacred Heart University’s 13 game win streak by defeating them with a score of 3-0.
In the championship game, the Sharks faced the Saint Anslem Hawks. The Hawks got the opportunity to defend their NEWHA title from last year after beating Franklin Pierce University in their semifinal, a game which was the longest NCAA women’s hockey game in history.
Four minutes into the second period the Sharks were on the power play and freshman defender Paula Bergström scored the game-winning goal.
Freshman goalkeeper Kenzie Harrison saved all 27 shots faced against her and earned her third consecutive shutout. Together with her 85 saves in the three postsea-son games, the achievements lead to Harrison being named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player. Bergström, Carrigan Umpherville, Harrison, and Saige McKay were also named to the All-Tournament team.
In their first ever season, the Sharks finished with an overall record of 14-18, an 11-9 record in conference play, and the team became the first team to win a Division I title in the history of the university’s recently implemented Division I athletic program.

At the beginning of the 2019-2020 academic year, the Student Body Boutique moved to its new location across from Starbucks in Hillwood Commons, and now the store is in the process of a branding evolution.
In the fall semester, the Boutique went through change of board members under a mission to ensure the Boutique is welcoming to all students. All funds received from store sales go toward fashion student scholarships.
Cherie Serota was recently appointed director of fashion merchandising. She assisted with the program’s growing process as a whole by offering students a more hands-on experience with activities such as volunteering at New York Fashion Week, attending lectures and taking shopping trips.
The boutique itself is also a hands-on experience on campus. The entire operation is student run, giving students a real-world learning opportunity. In order to get their new “vibe” out into the world, they are adding new events to their calendar.
“Our main inspiration for this is the growing concern of sustainability and the environment, in not just the fashion industry but globally,” Alina Chen, a sophomore business management major and head of marketing for the boutique, said.
“Thrifting, buying vintage, and investing in long-lasting versatile garments is something that will significantly reduce post-consumer waste, and something we want to show our student body: that sustainably can be fashionable and affordable,” she said.
The boutique plans to team up with the Sustainability Club to make dream catchers out of recycled materials. The boutique’s proceeds will go toward student scholarships, according to Chen.
The management board is also starting a “Student Ambassador Program.” This program will recognize different student leaders in contrasting communities on campus. Chen often sees students around campus and admires their individual styles.
The board wanted to make sure that selected student leaders throughout different departments on campus get the validation they deserve for their spectacular, unique tastes, according to Chen.
Rebranding includes teaming with other clubs and departments on campus as well. The management board plans to work with art majors to find an “in-house artist.” The board is granting one student the chance to redesign the boutique with their own style and taste.
“It takes their creativity to the next level,” Chen said. The chance to design and execute a concept for a real store is something a student can put on his or her resume; it not only benefits the boutique, but the student as well.
The Fashion Network Club is holding a fashion show in Hillwood’s fishbowl on April 23 at 8 p.m. and their theme for this year is street wear. The Student Body Boutique is co-sponsoring the club by offering some of their clothing merchandise to complete their collection.
This runway differs from the boutique’s previous shows because it includes work from students on campus as well as local talents, including the Student Body Boutique and neighborhood vintage boutiques. Eight designers from outside of the university are also expected to mix designs with the boutique for the show.
All of the models set to walk the runway are students from Post, and the show is currently looking for additional models to participate. Anyone interested can stop by the Student Body Boutique during its regular hours of operation.
The Student Body Boutique’s true purpose is to make sure students know that their designs are for them: the student body.
“We merchandise for typical college wear basics but with a trend; things you can wear to class, things you can wear out at night,” Serota said. “We also have an interview corner where there is interview clothing just in case there is a pop-up interview and you need something,” Serota said.
The board also wanted students to know that all of their clothing is now at an affordable price for the average college student. Their new mission is to make sure that all the clothing is at low ‘cost for all students.

Editor’s Note: Michael Atkinson is the professor of the JOU 41 Newspaper Laboratory course.
In a poll conducted by The Pioneer on Feb. 23, it was determined that 77 percent of students and alumni have referred to the rating website RateMyProfessor.com before choosing a professor or course.
RateMyProfessor.com is a website that allows students to give a public analysis and rating on how their professors performed throughout the duration of a particular course. In turn, some students use the accumulated reviews to guide them through their course selection process.
According to RateMyProfessor.com, users added more than 19 million ratings, 1.7 million professors and over 7,500 schools to the site. More than 4 million college students across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom use the site each month.
“I really like Rate My Professor because I’ve noticed most of the reviews reflect the professors really well,” Abigail Timmins, a junior criminal justice major, said. “It allows a student platform to talk about a professor’s strengths and weaknesses, and also lets you know if that professor is suitable for your style of teaching.”
Some professors on campus are aware of the site but pay little to no attention to it. They don’t see the site’s beneficial value, as some reviews may come from a biased perspective.
“I believe these rating systems are of limited value because they tend to measure popularity more than instructional effectiveness,” Michael Soupios, professor of political science, said. “Also, l suspect some students allow a poor grade to impact their assessment which mixes apples and oranges.”
Some professors claim the site is of no use to them and has no impact on their way of teaching. Some even encourage fellow professors to pay no attention to it.
“I looked at [RateMyProfessor] years ago. And the comments praising my class, how easy and interesting it was, were matched exactly by comments saying it was tough and dull, which only supports the timeless idea that you get from college, in general, what you bring to it,” Micahel Atkinson, adjunct professor of film, said. “All in all, it would seem to have limited usefulness. Teachers certainly should know better than to pay attention to it.”
Although the website offers professors a glimpse into what may be slightly skewed opinions from former students, the website’s target audience is students.
Amanda Hartman, a sophomore speech-language pathology and audiology major, was cautious of potentially slanted reviews, but said the site offered her a sense of comfort when making course selections.
“When sifting through comments about professors, I can find some pretty positive or negative comments,” Hartman said. “Sometimes, I need to ignore those types of comments because the student is being super subjective. However, in all honesty, I’ve used the website numerous times. It has helped me find some really great professors.”
Jean Carlomusto, professor of media arts, said she values an alternate form of feedback rather than RateMyProfessor.com.
“I prefer the class reviews given to students at the end of the semester because most students in the class participate, and I’m able to get a broader range of responses” she said.
Carlomusto and Soupios agreed that students who received poorer grades were more likely to rate their class and professor.
“In the past, when I looked at Rate My Professor, I saw fewer reviews. These were more likely to be authored by students who were unhappy with their grade,” Carlomusto said.
Sam Uebel, a senior broadcasting major, disagreed with the viewpoint that only disgruntled students go through the trouble of leaving a review.
“I’ve had professors who’ve liked me and I’ve done very well in their class and still not liked the professor. Professors need to be mindful of how they treat their students,” she said.
The semesterly survey that Carlomusto referred to doesn’t include certain aspects that Rate My Professor offers, according to Soupios.
“The only thing I like about the format is students are able to add comments which they are not able to include in the instrument used by the University,” he said.
Uebel used the website to research the ratings of professors she’s never taken a course with before.
“So if I look them up, I’m looking for what could happen to me in the class for the worst case scenario, but it’s never steered me away from a course,” she said.
As for leaving a review for a former professor, Uebel said, “I’ve never cared enough, even when I probably should’ve.”

Resident Assistants (RA) in Post Hall started a new program that promotes going meatless every Monday.
Sabina Muharemovic, senior nursing major, started the program in the spring 2020 semester because she is vegan and learned a lot in her health classes about how meat is often unethically produced in the United States.
“Usually our dorm has programs that have to do with food, like pizza for the entire resident hall,” Muharemovic said. “I don’t even eat pizza, so I wanted to make a program that’s a reflection of me too.”
After considering different programs over the course of a few weeks, Muharemovic started sending photos and information about vegan and vegetarian options on campus to a group chat which included the four other resident assistants and resident director of Post Hall, Trey Pogue.
The group supported Muharemovic’s quest for plant-based options on campus, and began sending photos of their own meatless meals to their group chat.
“It’s hard to adhere to a meat-free diet with our dining plan options at LIU,” Muharemovic said. “The group chat helped me think of having meatless Mondays in our dorm.”
Muharemovic then went on social media to post the health, financial and environmental benefits of going without eating meat one day a week.
According to NorthShore University Health System, a meatless Monday can lower the risk for colorectal cancer, obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, eating less meat will lower the amount of greenhouse emissions involved with the transportation and production of livestock produce.
Muharemovic created posters for Post Hall to promote her program and spoke in person with many of the residents about the benefits of meatless Mondays. So far, the response was positive.
“I think that it’s a great way to … introduce people to the lifestyle of eating like a vegetarian without it being a hassle to anyone,” vegetarian Sarabeth Schiff, freshman musical theatre major, said. “It’s hard to do, and it’s a good way to start eating a green-based diet without forcing yourself to completely dive in.”
Muhavemovic wanted to advocate for meatless Mondays without pressuring people to adopt the same eating habits as full-time vegans or vegetarians.
“Sometimes veganism is a controversial topic,” she said. “I just wanted to educate people and not force the vegan ideology.”
A fellow resident assistant in Post Hall, Matthew Sporrer, sophomore musical theatre and international relations major, said Muhavemovic’s program is a great change this semester.
“Many people think you have to go vegetarian or vegan to help the environment, when really just cutting out meat and dairy products for a day or two every week does so much more than doing nothing,” he said.
Spreading the message of meatless Mondays is important so more students across campus can get involved. Although this is a program for Post Hall, anyone can participate.
“I have been a vegetarian for nine years so I always do meatless Monday, but I love the awareness [the program] is raising for a more environmentally friendly and healthy diet [for the students],” Sporrer said.
Future plans for the program include expanding it across campus and potentially giving out prizes to devoted meatless Monday participants.

The Pioneer reported on the loss of trees along Chipmunk Trail on Feb. 5. Since then, Roy Fergus, director of facilities, elaborated on the diminished forestry, and Dr. Wendy Ryden, professor of English, submitted a letter to the editors explaining the environmental consequences caused by their removal.
The once lush Chipmunk Trail was left seemingly bare by grounds workers who removed some of the trees. While the loss of the area’s beauty is upsetting to some on campus, it’s the impact it has on the surrounding environment that has others concerned.
Some who walk along the trail now notice a lack of forestry, but it was mainly underbrush removed from the trails, according to Fergus. He explained that the trees weren’t cut down for aesthetic purposes, and those which were removed were dead, or had branches that were dead.
As Fergus’ responsibility on campus is to keep everyone safe, he said the dead branches and trees became a hazard, and therefore, had to be cut down before they injured someone.
While workers chopped down the branches and other potential dangers, they also cleared the area’s underbrush, making the path’s surroundings appear more bare than some people on campus were used to seeing.
But visual starkness isn’t the only problem caused by the clean up. Although most of the dead woodlands and brush had to be removed for safety reasons, Ryden pointed out the importance of their existence in the life cycle of the ecosystem.
In the Feb. 5 article about the excavation of Chipmunk Trail, students commented on the insects and animals now left without a home. Ryden said she was “heartened by student awareness of the negative environmental impacts and effects on wildlife.”
Nature aids in the blossoming of life during the spring, according to Ryden. “It causes soil erosion and depletion, and disrupts the natural cycle of replenishment. This practice will eventually turn the naturalized areas into dead zones,” she said.
With many worried about the planet’s condition, the cutting down of even a few trees is something to think twice about, as “we are engaging in backward landscaping practices,” according to Ryden.
As safety around campus is a priority, the natural state of the planet is also something to embrace. A compromise which allows the leaves and twigs of the forest’s floor to remain could help to maintain the campus’ natural habitat on campus.
“I get that cleaning up the scraps from the forest floor would make the grounds look more manicured,” said Juliana Veraldi, a junior film major, “but for the good of the flora and fauna that try to live and grow in the already sparse woods of the campus, the natural debris should be left alone.”

Promise staff members hosted Cultural Explosion on Thursday, Feb. 20 in Hillwood Commons. The annual event celebrates different cultures from around the world.
This year Promise held “Taste of Promise” where everyone in the office brought dishes from their own specific culture. “We did our best to be inclusive and promote diversity on campus,” Julia Pagano, a promise coach, said.
There were also sheets on each table asking students what type of activities and food they hope to see next year. “I really hope students love the event,” Pagano said. “It seems like the event gets more and more popular each year.”
The event featured foods from all over the world, from tacos to dumplings. Food wasn’t the only activity available for students to enjoy. Temporary henna tattoos were available as well as do-it-yourself headbands for Dia De Los Muertos. “I think it’s great that they’re promoting diversity here at Post because I think being on Long Island, we lack some of that,” Carrie Lenza, a sophomore acting major, said.
“Coming from Chicago where a lot of these cultures and food are more heavily represented, it was very refreshing to experience that again,” Lenza said. “I feel like here at Post there tends to only be the center world view, so It’s really important that we show people that there is life outside of Long Island.”
Adam Silverstein, senior social work major, has attended the event every year since he was a freshman. “This is the best it’s been since then,” he said. “I’m excited to keep watching it grow in future years.”
Members of Promise hope to continue hosting the event every year. Students who have any suggestions for the next Cultural Explosion can contact the Promise office at (516) 299-3737.

Valentine’s Day may be over, but love could still be in the air. The Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity is hosting a speed dating event called Matchmaker on Wednesday, Feb. 26 at 7:11 p.m. in the Hillwood Commons Fishbowl.
“What’s in store is for everyone to have fun, make new friends, relationships, bonds and they should be walking away with just that,” Jahrid Barker, a senior digital arts and design major and polemarch of Kappa Alpha Psi, said. “We decided to do [Matchmaker] because nobody’s done it before and it’s a new look [and] feel to the campus.”
Matchmaker will be run in a style that allows for participants to create their own questions. “It’s going to be run like traditional speed dating in the sense that people will be lined up across from each other and they will have between four to six minutes to speak to the other person and get to know them,” Michael Bruny, a senior business sports management major and a member of Kappa Alpha Psi said “Each person will create their own questions based on what they want to know.”
The event is free and Kappa Alpha Psi encourages all students to participate, have fun, and walk away with a new bond.

Film program alum Brian DiLorenzo (‘10), released his first feature film “Myth” in 2019. The movie is currently circulating around film festivals and has won several awards.
The film takes place in upstate New York where aspiring filmmaker Alex, played by Nick Tucci, meets his favorite director JP Smith. The movie follows Alex as JP makes him the star of his next movie and their lives quickly entangle, changing Alex’s world completely.
“The core idea was really just me daydreaming about getting the chance to meet some of my favorite movie directors, and what that experience would be like, and that was sort of the jumping off point for the film,” DiLorenzo said. “I took a lot of inspiration from growing up in the upstate and different directors I like admired and stuff like that.”
DiLorenzo worked with a team of other university graduates to make this film. “It was pretty much an entire C.W. Post crew,” he said. “We were film majors and we stuck together after school, and I couldn’t have done it without those guys.” DiLorenzo and his crew have been working on the film since 2015, four years before its release.
The movie plays on the audiences’ and characters’ trust and reveals the truth behind filmmaking through JP’s character, according to DiLorenzo. The tipping point for this reveal was the final breakthrough scene.
“We really wanted to give the ending a lot of punch, to give the main character an experience that he really is gonna grapple with,” DiLorenzo said. When filming the scene, DiLorenzo accredits some of its power to the actors in it, as well as the directing and writing.
“A lot came out of improv on set in addition to what I wrote on the paper,” DiLorenzo said.
During filming, the actors, especially Tucci, would come up with little details to make the final reveal as dramatic as possible.
The movie also plays on current events and human obsession with over-the-top content at the expense of quality and the mental health of content creators.
“We want it to feel current. I tried to stay away from naming specific websites and stuff like that, but we wanted to give the film some relevance in 2019, and we felt when we released it, we wanted to reflect how things are now,” DiLorenzo said.
The movie has been shown at film festivals such as Yobi Film Festival, Chain Film Festival, Peekskill Film Festival and will be shown at the Winter Film Awards and Kansas City Underground. It has won awards for best narrative picture and best actress at the Chain Film Festival. The film has not yet been released publically but students can find the latest news at www.followmyth.com.

The sculpture gallery hosted the art of Emily Schmitz, first year MFA in fine art, from Monday, Feb. 17 to Friday, Feb. 21. Schmitz titled her exhibition, “Embrace,” to encourage viewers to imagine warmth and hugs. The artist said she felt as though when a person hugs someone, they embrace them in a circle, and as all of her artwork centered around circles, she felt it was an appropriate name.
Although Schmitz has been involved in art since around 2010, she also spent eight years working at Summit Vision, an eye doctor’s office in Islip. This experience inspired most of her artwork. “A lot of my paintings started off being eyeballs, and I always stuck with the circular form,” Schmitz said.
The artwork in the gallery showed circles in various colors, designs, and mediums. The work captured the viewers with texture, as some paintings were more than just paint. Many of Schmitz’s pieces were multimedia pieces, extending from the canvas, with materials like cloth, denim, and other items.
With plenty of experience showcasing her art in group collections this was Schmitz’s first time in a solo show. While an exciting moment, Schmitz said that preparing for a show is more stressful than anything. However making her work available to the public is her favorite aspect of being an artist. “I think seeing people’s reactions, and seeing that other people say ‘Oh my god I really love that’,” Schmitz said about what she finds exciting. While someone enjoying her art is rewarding in itself, Schmitz also sells her pieces, which makes attracting a crowd all the more exciting.

Several people attended the Sculpture Gallery’s reception on Wednesday, Feb. 19, including Schmitz’s long-time friend Christina Lorenzoni, who made a special trip from Islip to see the show. “It’s all very colorful, unique, and sparkly,” Lorenzoni said about the work. When asked if she had a favorite piece, Lorenzoni pointed out a glossy piece called ‘Ring,’ which Schmitz created by pouring resin over a finished canvas. Schmitz also pointed out her favorite painting, a piece near “Ring” titled “Space.”
As a teaching assistant to professor Seung Lee in a figure drawing and painting class, Schmitz tries to help students stay inspired by pushing them to look online or search for something that’s new to them, “I think being a graduate assistant helps me push other students in the art field,” she said.
Those looking to see more of Emily Schmitz’s work, or purchase some, can find her on instagram @art_em_schmitz.

For any students looking for a place to indulge in a hands-on way to relax, experience a new art form, unleash creativity, or get rid of anxious energy, the ceramics studio is open to all students interested in creating a piece of their own.
The studio is located in the Craft Center between Life Sciences and Kumble Hall. Frank Olt, professor of art, is in charge of the ceramics studio and has enjoyed teaching students on campus since 1988. Olt mentioned that the ceramics studio is a place to sculpt, as well as connect with others and create a warm environment. “The sense of community is astounding. We have alumni and senior citizen volunteers from the surrounding area that come in,” he said. “Sculpting is a communal activity. Everyone is gathered around the fire, symbolically the kiln.”
“I met a lot of people here at LIU Post solely through sitting next to them by chance in the studio and creating art,” Rebecca Ebner (‘19) said. “These are people that I have no classes with, that I am fortunate enough to have been sculpting with. There would have been no other way that we could have met. I am thankful for the friends that I have made. It makes the studio feel more like a family.”
Students visit the studio seemingly every day, eager to offer and receive help, according to Ebner. Professors including Olt and Dan Christoffel roam the studio ready to answer questions or show students how to execute a step in the sculpting process. There is always a pot of either coffee or tea always in the back, next to a shelf of sculpted mugs made by students and faculty.
“With the advent of new age wellness and mindfulness, even children in elementary school are taught this,” Olt said, regarding ceramics sculpting. “Ceramics helps. It sort of yoga for the hands, mind, and body in terms of art.”

The Post Theatre Company (PTC) will stage their production of William Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure,” a play addressing issues prevalent in today’s society with a darkly comedic twist.
The story is set in the city of Vienna where citizens live within a patriarchy structure. When Duke Vincento departs on a trip, he leaves Lord Angelo in charge of the city. The morally devout Angelo begins strictly enforcing new laws that ban brothels and prohibit residents from having pre-marital sex. Under Angelo’s reign, a resident who breaks these laws will be sent to jail and put to death. The plot follows the story of Isabella after her brother Claudio is arrested for impregnating his lover, Juliet.
The production is set in a conceptualized world that uses the theme of BDSM, which stands for bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, and masochism, to cover an extensive range of tastes and activities.
“The themes of BDSM can reflect fascist-leaning sadistic government structures. The conflation of the brothel and the prison as bondage moves [events] from consensual play to non-consensual domination, [and it helps depict] Angelo’s journey as dominating disciplinarian yielding to the submissive pleasures of the flesh,” Dara Malina, director, said.
Margaret Levin, senior musical theatre major, explained how sensitive themes like BDSM are used as devices to deliver the play’s plot. “The characters in this play are driven by a sense of either dominance or submission. The plot deals in the sexual and political worlds, and explores how these two themes coexist. It looks through a lens of how women are empowered with BDSM and how these women fight the patriarchy,” she said.
Anastacia Munoz, junior musical theatre major, portrays the protagonist Isabella. “Isabella is a nun-in-training. In the play, she is on a mission to save her brother’s live as he engaged in pre-marital sex with his girlfriend, who is now pregnant,” Munoz said.
Lauren Lehosky, junior acting major, portrays Pompey. “Essentially Pompey Is the clown of the show and owns the brothel,” she said. This character is important for showing how women are fighting back against the rules in place.
The Provost is played by Camille Chartier, a junior musical theatre major. “My character runs the jail and enforces the laws,” she said. Chartier finds her character interesting because of her indecisive state throughout the play, and how she must constantly choose between behaving correctly morally or lawfully.
“If I do not follow the law and put the accused to death, then I lose my job and l will be put to death myself. But at the same time Provost does not think it is right,” Chartier explained.
According to Chartier, “Several characters ponder the theme self-preservation versus morality, and it is a major theme that runs throughout the play; all the character think the laws in place are stupid,” she said. This provides the audience with a platform to think about what they would do in such a situation.
“Measure for Measure” will be staged on the Little Theatre Mainstage from Friday, Feb. 28 to Sunday, March 1, and Friday, March 5 through Sunday, March 8. Performances will start at 7:30 p.m. with 3 p.m. matinees on Sundays. Tickets are available online at tix55.com/ptc700. Tickets are $15 for general admission, $12 for seniors, and $10 for students.

The softball team’s season has started and the Sharks have their eyes set on success. “Every season we compete to win championships and compete on a national level,” Head Coach Roy Kortman said.
In the NEC preseason poll, the team is estimated to finish at first place in the conference. Last season, the Blackbirds won the regular season title but fell short in the NEC tournament. However, Kortman, who enters his 26th season as head coach at LIU, said they pay no attention to polls and try to concentrate on their own play. “We focus on our preparation, our improvement, and our competitiveness,” he said.
Kiana Cisneros, a junior and shortstop for the team, is excited to start a new season as the newly branded Sharks. She is focused on the common goal, which she said stays the same no matter what colors or name they wear on their jerseys. “We still have the same goal as always, to win an NEC championship for the school and represent at regionals,” she said.
In terms of her own play, she describes herself as a consistent player and thinks it is because of the work they put in during their off season and her ability to work hard. “I am very motivated during winter break to keep pushing myself. As my coach says ‘the ball always finds you’ and I want to make sure I am 100 percent prepared every time.”
Another player looking forward to the new season as Sharks is sophomore starting pitcher Elena Valenzuela. She thinks the success will come as long as the team works together. “We are ready to compete as a team and I am so excited to succeed as a team this season. Go Sharks,” she said.
Aliana Castillo, a junior and third baseman, led the Blackbirds in OPS (the sum of the player’s on-base percentage and slugging percentage) last season and expects herself to keep doing what she can to help her team. “My expectations for myself are always to be competitive and be the best teammate that I can be,” she said.
In a position with significant impact both on the field and at the bat, she said it is important to not carry over a performance from one place to the other. “Having a clear head at the plate and on the field helps keep me focused and ready for the next play,” she said.
Patricia Griffin, a redshirt senior and right fielder, has played her entire collegiate career as a Blackbird, but said she is excited to finish out her college career as a Shark.
“I enjoyed every single moment as a Blackbird and will cherish the memories I made for the rest of my life. Ending my collegiate career as a Shark is another new opportunity to take on, she said.”
The team currently has a 5-8 record after three weekends of play. Their biggest win was against the Army Black Knights on Friday, Feb. 14, where the team won by a score of 10-2 in five innings of play.Despite having eight losses in the beginning of the season, Kortman is optimistic going forward.
“Our team has shown some terrific resilience and competitiveness,” he said. “If we stay with the process and understand it is a long season and not a sprint, we can put ourselves in a position to find success.”

Well-known National Basketball Association (NBA) stars gathered for the 69th NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, Feb. 16 in Chicago, ILL. and this year, the game had a new format to make every quarter more competitive and to honor the lives of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant.
The NBA All-Star Game is where top players are selected by a voting process through a panel of broadcasters, sportswriters and fans to compete against each other. The two highest ranked players become captains for the two teams. Captains then draft players from the voting process to create their team. This year, the two captains were LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. Coaches are selected by the two teams who lead their conferences. The LA Lakers coach, Frank Vogel, coached Team LeBron, and Nick Nurse, the coach for the Toronto Raptors, coached Team Giannis.
For the first time in NBA All-Star Game history, the three first quarters started with the score of 0-0 to increase the level of competition and make every quarter count, according to an official release made by the NBA on Jan. 30.The team who won each quarter would receive $100,000 to donate to their selected charity. If the quarter ended in a tie, the money would be carried over to the next quarter’s pot. Team LeBron won the first quarter, and Team Giannis won the second quarter. The third quarter ended in a tie, so the money was withheld until the final quarter.
To honor Kobe Bryant, the basketball legend who lost his life on January 26 in a helicopter accident, the last quarter was not timed. Instead the first team to score 24 points from the leading team’s score would be victorious. Team Giannis lead the cumulative score of 133-124, making the target score 157 points.
Kelsey Wright, a junior childhood special education major, watched the All-Star Game and thought the format of not having a timed fourth quarter made the game more thrilling to watch than previous years. “Since the fourth quarter wasn’t timed and you had to hit a target score, it changed the dynamic of the game. Players were more attacking and forward which made it more enjoyable to watch,” Wright said. “It brought out the ‘mamba mentality’ in all of the players.”
Another action made to honor the lives of Bryant and his daughter was the choice of the teams’ jersey numbers. Team Giannis wore number 24, Kobe Bryant’s former jersey number, and Team LeBron wore number 2, GiannaBryant’s jersey number.
As an athlete, Wright liked the tributes to the two Bryant family members, especially since Kobe Bryant was an important symbol for athletes. “Kobe was such an inspiration to not only basketball players, but to all athletes,” Wright said. “His hard work and dedication, the ‘mamba mentality’, is something that drove me to excel as an athlete.”
Sydney Pasquarella, a junior psychology major, also appreciated the All-Star Game’s tributes to Bryant. “Kobe was someone all athletes, as well as non-athletes could look up to,” Pasquarella said. “Bryant’s commitment wassomething that everyone could implement in their lives, whether it be in sports, school, work, or anything, everyone should strive to be the best in what they do, which is what Kobe did.”
The game ended with a win for Team LeBron after they made a comeback in the last quarter. The final score was 157-155. “It was thrilling to see LeBron’s team make a comeback since LeBron has now taken the lead role on the Lakers, where Kobe retired from [in 2016],” Wright said. “It was a beautiful way to honorKobe,” Pasquarella added.

During the annual “Battle of Brooklyn” game on Tuesday, Feb. 18, the men’s basketball team lost to the St. Francis College Terriers with a score of 87-77.
The Sharks were off to a rough start, down 0-9 only minutes into the game. Head Coach Derek Kellogg called a timeout so his team could regroup. The Sharks returned to the court refreshed with a 10-2 run, and they successfully decreased the score deficit to one point.
From there, both teams alternated leading points multiple times. With little over seven minutes left to play in the first half, the Sharks sank back-to-back baskets, scored by redshirt junior forward Ty Flowers and redshirt senior guard Raiquan Clark, to give the Sharks a 29- 23 lead. The team continued outscoring theTerriers 11-4.

However, the Terriers were resilient and fought back. They went on an additional 9-0 run just before the half ended and brought the team within striking distance of the Sharks. At halftime, the Sharks had a 41-38 lead.
Five minutes into the second half, the Sharks took their biggest lead of the game, making the score 54-48. However, the Terriers made a comeback once again and went on a 14-2 run, gaining them a six point lead.
Afterwards, The Sharks’ sophomore guard Jermaine Jackson Jr. responded by hitting three straight three pointers to put the Sharks back ahead (65-62).
For the following five minutes, the Sharks struggled and the Terriers took advantage. Saint Francis went on their biggest run of the night, 14-0. The Sharks tried to answer and managed to score a three pointer, however the score was 65-76 in favor of the Terriers with less than five minutes to play. The game ended in a 71-74 loss for the Sharks.
Despite the loss, there were remarkable individual performances. Jackson led the Sharks with a season-high of 30 points. Additionally, Clark added 17 points and eight rebounds. The Sharks are now 8-8 in conference play this season with two games remaining. They sit in 4th place in the conference, two games behind Sacred Heart University and just one game ahead of Mount St. Mary College and Fairleigh Dickinson University, meaning the Sharks need to win their last two games to secure a home playoff game.
Looking ahead, the Sharks will host Wagner College Thursday, Feb. 27 in the Steinberg Wellness Center at 7 p.m. for Senior Day. They will close out the regular season Saturday Feb. 29 at Sacred Heart University.

Despite a strong second-half run, the men’s lacrosse team was defeated at home by St. Johns University with a score of 15-17 on Saturday, Feb. 22.
The St. Johns University Red Storms scored the first two goals of the game within the first five minutes. Junior attacker Will Snelders then scored a goal in the back of the net to end the Red Storm’s run. Less than a minute after Snelder’s goal, sophomore attacker Jake Gillis scored to make it an even score of 2-2.
However, the Red Storms took back control of the game and went on a fivegoal run in the first quarter and into the second. There were only seconds left in the third quarter when the Sharks took back momentum of the game. Graduate student Alex Russell scored off an assist from Jake Gillis to make the score 9-16 with the Red Storms in the lead.
In the fourth quarter, senior Dylan Villari kicked off a scoring spree for the Sharks. Over the next six and a half minutes, three more Shark attackers would score. With just a little under six minutes left to play in regulation, St. John’s scored their last goal of the game and brought the score to 13-17.
In the final five minutes, the Sharks had a strong defense and scored two more goals. However, a strong fourth quarter and outscoring St. Johns 6-1 was not enough for the Sharks and St. Johns University stood as winners.
Although the game ended in a loss, the Sharks showed great promise offensively with eight different goal scorers. Freshman Richie Lacalandra and junior Will Snelders had three goals each and led the Sharks in scoring. Lacalandra also added two assists to finish the day with five points.
Next up for the Sharks is a game against Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. on Saturday, Feb. 29 at 1 p.m.
