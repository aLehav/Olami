On Tuesday, Jan. 31, the women resident assistants in Brookville Hall held a mandatory meeting for all female residents. The meeting was held at 10 p.m. and took place on the third floor lounge. One Brookville resident wasn’t pleased that the meeting was scheduled so late. “Why does it have to be so late? This is my bedtime. How am I expected to be productive tomorrow if I can’t get enough sleep?” Aida Enamorado, a junior international studies major said. When the four RA’s that run the women’s floors showed up, they handed out M&M’s to lighten the mood of the residents.
RA Antoinette Daure began the meeting by discussing some of the problems on the women’s floors including bathroom etiquette, quiet hours and the side doors. The women’s bathrooms are not kept up to standards, she reported. Students were leaving hair in the sinks and would not report anything that was broken in the bathroom. If there is something broken in the bathroom, students should either report it to the RA on duty or the office of campus life at 516.299.2800.
Daure also mentioned quiet hours, which are Monday-Friday, from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and asked the residents to be respectful of their neighbors. Brookville side doors were also discussed during the meeting, which can only be used to exit the building from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. If caught exiting the doors at any other time or entering the building from those doors at all, students are required to make a donation to Relay for Life at that time and give the money to the RA who caught them.
The RAs also said to not put furniture in the hallways because of recent events with the men’s third floor. On Sept. 16 a bed frame was found in the third floor lounge. Now, there are six pieces of furniture in the lounge, which has since been locked because of this. The RAs asked the women to behave and not be like the “reckless boys.” Daure said that the lounge may be kept locked for the rest of the semester. Two weeks ago, a mattress was also found in the third floor men’s bathroom on the left side of the building. The bathroom is now locked, with a sign on the door reading, “Dear third floor residents, due to recent events, this restroom will be closed until further notice.
If anyone has any information regarding why furniture was purposely left here, please contact CLC Peter Lipka at peter.lipka@liu.edu or at 516.299.2498. Thank you.’
When asked when the bathroom will reopen, RA Daure said there is “no time frame really. If we see improvements in the other bathrooms.” Daure said it is really up to the men and how they behave.
Recently, men were found brushing their teeth in the women’s bathroom on the second floor, which is directly below the one that is locked. Kyra Prazer, a Brookville resident, said, “The guys are using our bathroom on the second floor; it’s a little disturbing.”

After President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27, imposing a 90 day ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim populated countries, students from those respective countries face uncertainty.
The order, titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States,” puts a hold on entry into this country by citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban resulted in detaining foreign citizens with existing student, work, or travel visas in airports as they arrive into the country. At least forty lawsuits have been led against the order. In one of those suits, a federal judge issued a nationwide temporary block of the order on Feb. 3, which is currently on appeal in a federal appeals court.
In a Jan. 31 email statement, issued by University President Kimberly R. Cline, advised students and staff on student and work visas hailing from the seven banned countries to consult an attorney if they are considering leaving the country within the 90 days of the ban. Cline also directed students and faculty in need of assistance to their respective dean of students and human resources department. Cline also included the number to the New York State hotline.
“They care, they care a lot,” Ammar Abdul Rahim, a Sudanese graduate student completing his masters degree in management engineering, said about the university’s handling of the ban. Staff at the international resources office advised Rahim to remain on campus and stay safe. They are also helping him acquire an ID since he misplaced his passport.
“I was planning to go home for summer break, but international [the office of international resources] has told me not to go,” Rahim said.
Since the ban, Rahim received worried messages from his family in Sudan. “My family back home feels so bad; they feel like I am living in danger here, that I am being harassed, but it’s not like that here,” he said. There is support from students,faculty and staff against the ban.
Rahim said that fellow students have expressed their sympathy for him.
“We are not what you think we are. You cannot judge us by religion or region,” Rahim said, a message to President Trump.
Students on other campuses on Long Island are also uniting in support for their international students and faculty from the seven countries. The weekend the executive order was issued, Vahideh Rasekhi, a Stony Brook University student from Iran, was detained for more than 24 hours at John F. Kennedy Airport, according to Newsday.
In the days following Rasekhi’s detainment, Stony Brook held a “Seawolf Solidarity Rally,” at which students and faculty marched on campus with signs and chants against the ban, and were addressed by the Stony Brook University president, who denounced the ban.
Newsday reported that approximately 150 people attended an hour long immigration seminar held by immigration attorneys from Barst, Mukamal & Kleiner, a Manhattan law firm, later that day at Stony Brook.
There have been no reports of any LIU students being directly affected by the ban, neither on the Post nor Brooklyn campuses.

To Whom it May Concern,
As an artist who has worked in a variety of fields, I have never forgotten my first professional acting gig; the first cinema to screen one of my films; my first solo exhibition; or the first production of one of my plays. And as a writer who has published seven books, I have never forgotten that as a student at LIU Post in the long ago days before there was a Hillwood Commons, a Tiles Center, or a B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, I published my first article in the pages of the Pioneer.
I still regard the Post campus as one of the most exceptional in the world, and I value the fine education I received there as a student of Philosophy, Theatre, and English Literature. I thus want to express my allegiance to, and alliance with, the Pioneer, now that its survival as a journal is being threatened, as is the future of the campus as the locus of a vibrant Liberal Arts education. Lately, LIU has entered educational history in a most unflattering manner, and, as a result, this administration has earned a No Confidence vote by the faculties of both campuses.
Helen Thomas said: “It is our job to seek the truth and put constant pressure on our leaders until we get answers.” No administration devalues an organ of potential dissent unless it has something to hide. During even the most settled times, but especially in times of crisis, the effort to limit the freedom of young journalists to report on what is happening at their own university is the essence of what historian Barbara Tuchman called wooden-headedness. It is doomed to be self-defeating. Meanwhile, the policy of preventing staff from speaking with the Pioneer in an effort to disguise growing dissatisfaction with the current administration insults the integrity of its reporters, its editors, the student body who reads the paper, and the concept and import of good journalism. An administration that pretends that it cannot afford an inexpensively printed hard copy of its own newspaper is further verifying how little it cares for hardworking students who aspire to make the Pioneer the best it can be— and, of course, for the student body who reads it. It also betokens a major misjudgment about the significance to a republic of training young journalists to enter the wider public discourse with voices that are honest, well informed, brave and distinct.
At the same time that it won’t support its own own newspaper, and no longer offers even a minimum stipend to its fine journalists, LIU is offering a six-figure stipend for Steve Israel to be a writer-in-residence on campus. Such a situation is beyond studied indifference: it’s an insult, plain and simple. As a former U.S. Congressman whose district included the Post campus, and as a vocal supporter of Occupy Wall Street, Israel’s first duty at Post should be to express his outrage at how the Pioneer is being treated. He could even donate a portion of his stipend to insure the future of the Pioneer. It doesn’t cost much at all, Steve… and it’s better than students having to Occupy Post!
In Hillwood Commons, a sign on the wall opposite Room 201 (the Pioneer offices) reads: THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF C.W. POST. Contemplating this sign, I can’t help reflecting on how the administration has attempted to take the Pioneer away from the students who need and deserve it. Without the minimal funding required to keep it in hard-copy print, and without encouragement to report the full range and depth of campus opinion, the Pioneer, if it survives, will be turned into a paper without a purpose in order to turn Post into a campus without an identity.

For some students, transitioning to college can be difficult, and assistance may be necessary. The Arthur O’ Eve Higher Education Program (HEOP) is a New York State funded program set out to help students make the transition easier. They provide academic support services for those who would not normally meet either the academic or economic criteria for admission into college. They assist students through a variety of services including tutoring, academic advisement, financial aid, career and personal counseling. The HEOP office at LIU Post is calling on Post students to assist in their efforts this semester.
HEOP is hiring sophomores, juniors, seniors and graduate students interested in tutoring HEOP students. Tutors will earn $10 per hour. A cumulative GPA of 3.4 and a letter grade of A in the course they wish to tutor is necessary.
“We take applications on an ongoing basis, and we always need more tutors,” Jessica Jones, HEOP’s associate director, said. “We have about 28 to 29 students that usually have mandatory tutoring for certain amount of hours per week. So the ability to service all of these students is extremely difficult, with a limited number of tutors.” She said they only have about 10-15 tutors right now. The tutoring program ends at the end of the semester, but begins again for the fall semester. Jones added that “mainly all” of their tutors do return in the following semesters.
Even students with busy schedules can apply to tutor. Jones said that the tutoring schedules are flexible and work around the availability of the tutor. HEOP does not mandate anyone to tutor at certain times. The tutoring sessions take place in the HEOP office located on the first floor of Post Hall. Sessions last for one hour, although if the tutor’s and student’s schedules permit, it can go over that time, Jones said.
The Director of HEOP, William Clyde, said the tutoring program “absolutely” works. “You might not have the best grades, but you can become a better student,” he said.
The benefit to tutoring other students is “multi-faceted,” Clyde said. “A lot of tutors we get are upperclassmen and graduate students,” he said. Many of the international students who tutor “feel like they can improve their own knowledge about the subject they are tutoring” and they can also “learn to communicate better in English,” he added.
“From my time being a tutor for the program, I have gained a lot.” said Grace Oshin, who has been a tutor in the program since 2015. “But the most important thing I’ve gained is a family,” she said. She also said those who become tutors for the program can expect to feel “incredible happiness in seeing the difference you make” and that “it’s so rewarding.” Jones also added that being able to teach someone and watch them learn and develop skills really gives a great sense of satisfaction.
Students interested in tutoring can contact the HEOP office at 516-299-2397, post-heop@liu.edu, or visit the HEOP office in Post Hall.

Samantha Negron, a senior broadcasting major originally from Florida, has worked at WCWP, the campus radio station, since she was an intern during her senior year in high school. Negron moved to Long Island when she was a sophomore in high school and has lived here ever since.
After she graduates in May, Negron aspires to work with Z100. Negron says that she had two reasons for becoming involved in radio, “a silly one and a serious one.” As for the silly one, “I got into broadcasting originally because a member of a boy band I enjoyed, One Direction, was dating a broadcaster, so if he could be interested in her then maybe he could be interested in me one day too.”
Negron laughed as she recounted that story, but she shared the real reason, “I got an internship my senior year of high school at Post working at the radio station, and I enjoyed it so much, and it inspired me to come to Post and work in radio,” Negron said with a smile on her face.
Negron is now the Student Program Director of WCWP. She has been on two shows for WCWP and refers to said shows as, “her babies.” She has since been reading the news on WCWP and Midday Madness, a talk and music show during common hour, since her freshman year. Negron was even one of the first hosts for Midday Madness. She has also done the show, Total Access, which has a similar sound to the New York radio station, Z100.
Negron has also had three radio internships off-campus with the network iHeartRadio. She interned at Q104.3, doing mostly board work and helping on-air. Then she interned with Elvis Duran and the Morning Show in September 2016, doing audio production and varying on-air tasks.
Now Negron is interning at Maxwell at Night, doing social media and board work for the show. She also has a few shots on air where she creates short conversations. Negron mentioned that of all three of her internships, she has had the most work and hands-on experience at her current one at Maxwell, and that the show is one she would like to do in the future.
Negron has been interning at iHeartRadio for three years now, gaining different experiences in each of the internships. She describes, “It is a dream to be with Maxwell right now, especially with all the air time I get.”.
Does she want to stay with iHeartRadio? Negron answered quickly, “If they hired me of course, no doubt, but I definitely want to stay in iHeartRadio, and it would be a dream to work at Z100 even if it was handing out papers.”
Negron has many goals in radio, but she said her true goal and dream in radio is to have an afternoon show that takes people home from work. She described herself as “not a morning person,” so she wants to work in the afternoon with some talk and mostly songs.
She admitted, though, “maybe I am not a morning person because I am in college and my sleep schedule is messed up, but I just want to take people home with my music.”

President Trump’s cabinet picks are in the middle of the Senate confirmation process. Although Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and CIA Director Mike Pompeo have been confirmed, less than one third of the cabinet picks that require confirmation have yet to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The remainder of the nominees are awaiting floor votes or hearings.
Democrats were aggressive with their questioning of Trump’s nominees Pruitt, Tillerson, Price, Sessions, DeVos and Mnuchin in January. After President Trump issued an executive order banning travel from seven Middle Eastern and African nations on Jan.3o, Democratic leadership pledged to slow the nominations. The hearings for Pruitt, Price and Mnuchinin in Senate committees have been sabotaged by Democrats who have staged full boycotts of the meetings to delay votes.
Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer, has called the cabinet a “swamp cabinet,” according to the New York Times. Schumer has been focusing hard on Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, saying “In all areas she ranks among the lowest of any cabinet nominee I have ever seen,” according to the New York Times. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also been critical of Devos, saying it is “hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous person to be entrusted both with our country’s education policy and with a trillion-dollar student loan program,” according to the New York Times.
“It’s scary that the people in political power care more about nominating people who are political loyalists than nominating people who are actually qualified for the job,” Nicole Guillet, sophomore education major said of the cabinet appointees.
Sophomore clinical lab science major Diandra Ellis sees the cabinet nominations as a part of a larger problem. “The people of the Republican Party are unwilling to focus on the unqualified nominees and misrepresented ideologies of the president because they refuse to accept the views of an opposing party.”
Several LIU Post students who stated they supported the cabinet nominees declined to comment about the nominees.
Along with the polarizing cabinet picks, President Trump announced his long awaited Supreme Court nomination on Feb.1. Trump’s pick to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Justice Scalia last February is Neil Gorsuch, a federal appellate court judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Gorsuch has ruled on many controversial cases, including the infamous Hobby Lobby V. Burwell case; the case raised the question of whether or not Hobby Lobby could legally deny its employees health coverage for contraceptives.
Senate Democrats are currently debating if a libuster is the logical move to respond to the Republican’s treatment of President Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland; Garland was not given a hearing, despite what Democrats argues was the Senate’s constitutional duty to do so.
“A generation ago, Gorsuch would have been confirmed without much difficulty. But not today,” Jeremy Buchman, a professor in the political science department, said. The Democratic base, and much of the Senate Democratic caucus, sees the Supreme Court vacancy as stolen property that a president who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million should not have carte blanche to fill. The base is especially energized
in the face of Trumpism (Donald Trump’s policy agenda), and it is not about to let its Senators play nice. At this point, I’d expect a threatened libuster, followed by a successful Republican move to eliminate the libuster for Supreme Court nominees,” Buchman said.
Buchman described Judge Gorsuch as “a younger, less dyspeptic version of Scalia.” He added that “both are vocal proponents of originalism, or the idea that constitutional text should be interpreted in light of the meaning its drafters would have understood it to have. Both favor greater leeway for religious expression in the public sphere, strongly oppose Roe v. Wade, and sometimes take positions on criminal justice issues that conservatives typically don’t take. And both are known for their vivid and clear prose style.” Although, according to Buchman, “legal observers on both sides of the aisle speak very highly of Gorsuch’s intellectual capabilities and temperament,” that does not necessarily “mean Democrats won’t be seeking payback for Garland, but it does suggest that the opposition to Gorsuch won’t necessarily be about Gorsuch per se.”

The Jazz program will bring its final performance in the Jazz on Stage Series to the Tilles Center on Feb. 12, with “Jazz on Stage with Matt Wilson.” The earlier Jazz on Stage performances included the Jimmy Heath Quartet on Oct. 6 and Renee Roses Quartet on Jan. 22.
In his fourth year as a music professor, Matt Wilson is once again leading the series as curator. The performance will include guitarist Keith Ganz and pianist Gary Versace. Wilsonbelieves the audience will be in for a treat.
“I think the Jazz on Stage series is an extremely unique experience that connects students to professionals in an atmosphere that is more intimate than any other master classes or performances I have attended in the past,” Tyler Moore, a music graduate student, said. Moore added that as a jazz student he has gained invaluable wisdom from the artists through witnessing “inspiring jazz performances from true masters of jazz tradition.” Andrew Krahm, a senior music major, said that the series has helped him improve his craft, “I have had the pleasure of being coached by some of the greatest jazz musicians of eras past and present. Whether it was tenor sax player Jimmy Heath, or Renee Rosnes, it has been an amazing experience for me, even as a senior to be afforded these experiences.” He continued, “Not only do I learn things as a jazz sax player, I have taken many of these ideas and transferred them to my studies as a classical violinist with the Music Department in addition to my studies to be a music educator!”
“Jazz on Stage” with Matt Wilson” will be held on Feb. 12. Pre-performance discussions will begin at 2:15 p.m. with the concert beginning shortly thereafter. Tickets are $40 including a $3 facility fee. Tickets are available at the Tilles Center box office and at ticketmaster.com via the Tilles Center website.

ETHEL, a modern string quartet, performed in the Hillwood Recital Hall on Feb. 2. Comprised of Ralph Farris (viola), Dorothy Lawson (cello), Kip Jones (violin) and Corin Lee (violin), ETHEL brought enchanting music and personality to the stage.
ETHEL’s performance was not that of a traditional string quartet. Under spotlights, the four members stood in a wide u-formation, moving about as the music moved them. Their dress was casual and so was their vibe. In between songs, they made sure to connect with the audience. Before performing their last song, Roulette by Anna Clyne, they had technical difficulties with the back track. However, they made sure to not lose connection with their audience.
“It’s ok,” Jones said. “What did everyone have for dinner?” While the technicians worked on the problem, the group played two songs that Jones said was their encore. “That was our encore, so don’t clap!” Jones joked.
ETHEL’s music experiments with art, vocals and covers. The majority of the program consisted of their take on popular songs. “I loved that they reinterpreted songs we’re familiar with,” Noemi Fletcher, education and public programs coordinator at Nassau County Museum of Art, said.
Noemi Fletcher and Laura Lynch, director of education at Nassau County Museum of Art, had seen ETHEL perform the day before at the museum. “We were moved by their work, we had to see them two days in a row,” Lynch said. Tammy Green, an audience member from Huntington said, “It sounds like a recording of sounds that could have not come out of real instruments.” She added, “when they add their voices it’s other-worldly.”
After the concert, the members of ETHEL mingled with their audience. Farris and Lee spoke with The Pioneer.
The Pioneer: “What advice do you have for an aspiring musician?”
Farris: “To do what you love and enjoy every time you play music. It should always be fun.”
Lee: “Even the work, the grind. Because in the end when you can do crazy stuff, after hours of consistent practice, it feels pretty good.”
TP: “What’s your favorite part about being in ETHEL?”
Farris: “My favorite part are the snacks. They give good snacks here. No, no, traditionally speaking it [music] is a place where individuals subjugate themselves to whoever is in charge. It’s like someone who makes decisions and the rest of us kind of do what’s on a page in front of us. And we have created an environment where that is not the case; we do what we want. I mean we still pay key to one of those opinions and someone will lead this and someone will lead that, but we have significantly more creative freedom than the vast majority of classical musicians. ”
TP: “How do you use art to inspire your music?”
Lee: “I guess it would start with improv a little bit. Just going off your basic reaction to it and letting that idea go.”
TP: “What’s your inspiration for making music?”
Farris: “Life is so good. Everything in life is the same and good. When you can go to work and do this. It’s like the whole ball of wax. Maintaining a healthy relationship with my wife feeds my enjoyment of music and vice versa. My inspiration is trying to keep that whole thing on track.”
Lee: “The ability to be able to communicate to the audience in a certain way. Selecting pieces or creating programs that have some type of message that can kind of transcend them. It’s not like ‘this is this’ it’s just like this is music and it affects people in a certain way. Or how we perform it also affects it too. To create an experience and connect on a totally different level, not just language.”

“Taj Express: The Bollywood Musical” is currently on tour throughout the United States and performed at the Tilles Center on its second stop in America. Audiences at the Feb. 3 performance were treated to live music and dancing, a mix of a traditional and modern Indian Bollywood performance with costumes reflecting the culture of India.
The show began with a calm song and dance by a female soloist, leading into a more upbeat performance by the entire cast, all costumed in gold sparkles. The costumes are culturally influenced, including detailed patterns and glitter. Following dancing, the story line was introduced. While traditional Bollywood productions include a love story that ends with a happy ending of marriage and an occasional link to royalty, this play is about a songwriter taking the audience on an adventure to compose a score after he is given a Bollywood film script. The script and music are written and composed in Hindi, the most common language in India. Though centered around tradition, “Taj Express” brings a modern flavor to the stage by setting the scene in the songwriter’s studio. The script is in English but the music is sung in Hindi and some of the beats include hip hop rhythms.
The backdrop throughout the entire production makes changing scenes quick, dramatic, and exciting. Within seconds, the audience is taken from a studio space to a nightclub, a street, a garden, and a palace. One major concept throughout the performance is understanding that most of what the audience is seeing is the imagination of the song writer; he imagines what his music would look like in the script that he is working on. This is apparent to the audience as he reads through the script before, during, and after a dance piece is performed on stage.
Performers were different than previous dancers who have visited the Tilles stage. The bodies of the female dancers were not as toned and one of the lead male dancers had a makeup designed six pack. Individual precision did not seem to be much of a priority, as each dancer did the same movement slightly different from one another. However, as a whole, the company stayed in sync.
The performance ended with a happy Bollywood ending, but with an element of surprise. The dancers engaged with the audience, bringing them to their feet while dancing with them in the crowd. The show was fun and energetic and contained unique effects. “Taj Express was a worldly experience that was both entertaining and educational of a new culture,” Emily Bivona, a junior dance major, said.

The men’s and women’s indoor track teams competed at the Metropolitan Conference Championships on Friday, Feb. 3 in Staten Island. Multiple runners achieved personal bests.
The women’s team tied for ninth out of 17 teams with only 13 girls competing. According to Head Coach Kevin Buckley, who is the head coach for both teams, the women’s team is currently only “distance and middle distance based,” meaning that they have no sprinters. Buckley added that they are “recruiting vigorously in that area for next year.”
Junior Talya Williams led 2,800 meters of the 3,000-meter run, and finished second in 9:57.85, a personal record. Graduate students Elizabeth Stirling and Ashlin Conroy tallied points for the Pioneers in the 5,000-meter by finishing fourth and eighth, respectively. Freshman Nicole Costanzo continues to improve in the high jump and triple jump, Coach Buckley said. She finished fourth in the high jump after clearing 1.55 meters and 14th the pentathlon. Freshman Alexandria Okon also collected points for the Pioneers with a sixth place finish in the 800-meter run.
The men’s team finished in 11th place out of 15 teams with the long sprinters tallying the most points for the Pioneers. Coach Buckley said freshman Jeffrey Reyes ran well in the 1,000-meter run until the last 200 meters when he experienced some hamstring tightness. The injury prevented Reyes from running in the 1600-meter relay later in the meet, which Buckley said hurt the relay team’s overall time. Still, the relay team consisting of senior Stefan Adams, red-shirt junior Kyle Ward, sophomore Jermaine Ifill and freshman Damario Hussey finished the race in sixth place with a time of 3:28.69. Adams also tallied points for the Pioneers in the 400-meter dash finishing fifth with a time of 50.20 and Ifill recorded a personal record in the same event with a time of 51.54.
The Pioneers have two more meets before they return to Staten Island, N.Y. for the East Coast Conference Championships Friday, Feb. 24. The ECC pre-meet poll projects the women’s team finishing in sixth at the meet and the men in seventh, but Coach Buckly is hoping to finish in fourth and fifth respectively. “Our goal is rather lofty, given our limited number of athletes on each side,” Buckley explained. “As long as we perform to our own capabilities, it’s fine. Let the points and standings fall where they may.”
Both indoor tack teams return to action at the St. Joseph’s Winter Invitational in South Huntington, N.Y. on Saturday, Feb. 11.

With the baseball team’s season fast approaching, Head Coach Michael Gaffney and his team hope that lessons learned from a “disappointing season” last year and more experience this year will help push them into post season play.
The Pioneers ended their 2016 season with an overall record of 23-20. Gaffney is entering his third year as head coach of the Pioneers, and he is hoping to learn from the inconsistencies that prevented his team from making it to post season play just a year ago.
“We were very young last year, therefore inconsistent,” Gaffney explained. “For instance, we had two wins versus nationally ranked top ten opponents, but lost nine out of 12 to start our conference schedule.”
Last year, the Pioneers finished with their best record since 2012, and they were just one game away from making it into the post season. “We had a lot of trouble holding onto leads last in games,” Gaffney explained. “Our bullpen was inconsistent. This season, we feel we made the necessary adjustments to improve that area.”
The team returned to campus from the holiday break on Jan. 14 with full team practices starting on Jan. 15. Gaffney said that the team has been working to build consistency on offense with more focus on hitting, bunting and running the bases.
Junior shortstop Joe Spitaleri said the team is working very hard, and their goal is to build a “winner’s mentality,” which he explained as everyone doing each and every job that needs to be done for practice. “Setting up equipment, taking ground balls, hitting or even picking someone up when they are having a bad day. It all has to be done with a great focus and effort day in and day out,” Spitaleri said.
Coach Gaffney and his players are confident in the team’s experience this year compared to last year. With eight out of nine starters returning from last year’s lineup, Gaffney is confident that “the same talent and another year of experience is going to go a long way.”
The Pioneers will travel to Gaffney, S.C. for their first two games on Feb. 18 and 19 against Gannon University and Limestone College. They will return to South Carolina during the last week of February for the Northeast Challenge at Myrtle Beach. Last year, the team travelled to South Carolina, Texas and Florida, but Gaffney said “these two trips were the ones we felt would give us that challenge and opportunity.” He also said it is important for the team to play 15 to 20 games before Conference play begins in March.
Junior outfield Rob Andreoli said the team is eager and excited for their upcoming trip. “Last year, Limestone took four from us, so we’re looking forward to giving them a little pay back this year,” Andreoli said.
He also added that the second trip to South Carolina could be their toughest test. “We’re facing two teams in Southern New Hampshire and Franklin Pierce who are nationally ranked,” Andreoli explained. “I think that will be our toughest games of the year.”
The first Conference game is scheduled for March 24 against Saint Thomas Aquinas College at LIU Post Baseball Field, but they will play seven games between Conference play and their trips down south.
Before Conference play begins, The Pioneers will return to their home field for the first time this year on March 4 when they take on Boomfield College at 12pm.

The women’s rugby team has made it clear that it is a force on campus not to be ignored. On Feb. 18, 2016, the Director of Athletics and Recreation Bryan Collins announced that the school would be adding women’s rugby to its list of sport clubs in the 2016-2017 academic year. Fast forward to January of 2017 and the girls are in the process of becoming an official NCAA team. The team now has 18 players, three managers and one coach.
A majority of the games they have played so far are usually on other campuses, including Manhattanville College and Bard College. As a result, support from the Post campus when they have away games is pretty scarce, but when the match is brought back home, many are cheering these girls on. Attendance at rugby games was scarce at first, but support has grown as the team has grown more successful.
William Monroe, a senior nance major, was surprised the team was even still around. “I have seen teams and clubs come and go left and right so it’s surprising but amusing to hear that they are still around but even about to become an official team, they should pat themselves on the back.” Monroe said.
Many students are still unaware that the rugby team has been formed. The school’s official social media accounts don’t include posts pertaining to the team. And because many of the team’s first games have been away, Post students have not travelled to watch the matches. Taylor Hill, the team’s captain, who is a junior broadcasting major, feels as though the lack of promotion hasn’t benefited the team in any way. “It’s frustrating because we should have more promotion regardless if we are a varsity team or not,” Hill said.” “We’re also in transition into becoming part of the NCAA, so I feel as though we should be promoted more. Many people don’t know that we’re still on campus and we’re always looking for members.”
While they are looking for more teammates, Shakira Clarke, a sophomore public relations major, would rather keep her team the way it is. “I honestly love my teammates. I’ve met some of my closest friends through rugby, Clarke said. “Our bonds are unbreakable. I think the coach brought the best group of girls together and created a beautiful little family.”
With their first game of the pre-season scheduled in March, the team is practicing every day during common hour and in the evenings to get ready for the season. No pads, no helmets, just a ball.
