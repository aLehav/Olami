Over the course of a month, Taylor Swift, globally renowned singer-songwriter, has taken over the social media app TikTok. 
On Aug. 23, Swift surprised her fans by creating her first TikTok on her account. Swift had been mainly using the platform to share content of her cats. Until Sept. 17, when she shocked her fans, and the rest of Tiktok, by posting a video announcing the surprise-rerelease of ‘Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version)’. This comes as the viral Tiktok POV trend, using the original ‘wildest dreams’ continues to gain popularity. 
In a little over 30 days Swift has amassed 5.2 million followers on TikTok. She averages 18 million views and 180,000 likes per video . As of Sunday Sept. 25, the video announcing the song release has 47 million views and 6.7 million likes.
Swift is rereleasing her music for financial and retributional purposes. 
Swift released “Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version)” so TikTokers could continue making videos with her new version, changing who receives revenue from the viral trend. Profiting off her work while denying profit to those who own her masters. Swift has already begun the process of rerecording her first six albums, presumably tacking “Taylor’s Version” to the end of each album title. 
 In 2019, Swift’s music catalogue was sold by her formal label, Big Machine Records, without her knowledge or permission. Neither of which were necessary for the record label to make the sale, as they had outright ownership of Swift’s music produced from 2005 – 2018. 
Consequently, her catalogue, as well as the rest of Big Machine’s Label Group was sold for over 300 million dollars to Scooter Braun, who has since resold Swift’s catalogue to an unknown investment fund. 
On Tumblr, Swift is quoted as saying the rights ending up in Scooter Braun’s hands was “worst case scenario” and her “worst nightmare”.  Therefore, the goal of rereleasing her music is not only to own it all, but to prevent Scooter Braun and others from making more money off of her work. 
Students on campus are talking about Swift’s new TikTok account.
“I don’t think I’ve ever followed anyone faster,” sophomore international relations major Sage Gauthier said.
Students support Swift’s decision to remake her music.
“I love that she’s owning her masters. I’ve been in support of her re-recording her albums from the beginning because I definitely think that she deserves to own her own music and plus it’s an added benefit for the fans because we get to relive each era and get new music,” freshman musical theatre major Morgan Vybihal said. 
When asked how she felt about the new version of “Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s version),” Vybihal raved.
 “Yes, I think her voice has definitely improved since when she first recorded it, so it’s really cool to witness and I love everything she does anyway,” Vybihal said. 
Other students have differing opinions on Swift’s new release.
“I feel like it was just kind of like silly, because it sounded like the same exact thing to me. It kinda was worse in my opinion,”  junior early childhood education major Leon said.
Leon said that she was unaware that Swift was rerecording her first six albums and the reasoning behind it. 
Though opinions on the new release differed, Vybihal, Gauthier, and Leon all agreed that Swift and all other artists and musicians should own the rights to their own music.

 Post alumni Petter Holmsen has recently released a horror series “Post-Mortem: No One Dies in Skarnes” on Netflix. The series has enthralled viewers all across the globe.
In this series, a girl comes back from the dead as a bloodthirsty creature. She begins killing people so that her undertaker family can get more business by taking care of the corpses. This simple plot has intrigued students on campus, including junior biology major Madison Eppers.
“This sounds interesting. I love horror movies and I watch a lot of true crime and scary things, so I would definitely add this to my watch list,” Eppers said.
Horror and true crime are fitting terms. The premise is similar to classic films such as the “Night of the Living Dead” series and “Dracula”.
Reviews of the series have also been positive, Forbes contributor Sheena Scott has given her thoughts on “Post-Mortem.” 
“This six-part series blends Nordic noir and the vampire horror genre together with an unsettling dose of dark humor.” Scott said. “Post-Mortem is an odd sort of series, and I mean that in a good way. Don’t be fooled by its seemingly light-hearted dark humor, as if to point out the absurdity of the whole situation, this is a brutal series about vampires.” 
Aside from the “Post Mortem” series, many students were also impressed by Petter Holmsen’s accomplishment.
“It’s a big achievement in a tough industry so it’s great that he was able to make it successful,” junior art therapy major Katie Zarka said.
Other students have shared Zarka’s sentiments about Holmsen’s accomplishment.
“[It] makes me feel … good that I go to a school that gives people these types of opportunities,” junior game design major Sam Gothelf said.
Even back when Holmsen was still in school, his professors had high hopes for him. Chair of the department of communications and film Susan Zeig was one of those professors.
“We all felt quite sure that Petter would have a professional career. I would also like to add that Petter was chosen as the 2014 Valedictorian of LIU Post, so we were not the only ones who recognized his talent and ability,” Zeig said.
Creating a successful series is difficult, and those that do are worthy of respect. Students interested in “Post-Mortem” can tune in to it anytime on Netflix.

Lil Nas X released his long-anticipated debut studio album “MONTERO” on Sep. 17. The sixteen-track album includes features from Jack Harlow, Doja Cat, Elton John, Megan Thee Stallion and Miley Cyrus. 
The album is poised for a number two debut on the Billboard 200, and had a number one debut on the Official UK Album Chart. 
Nas X first burst onto the scene when his first single “Old Town Road” – a country rap song that has gone on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time– gained popularity on TikTok in early 2019. 
Students on campus are enjoying “MONTERO” with “Am I Dreaming?”, featuring Miley Cyrus, being a popular choice for favorite song on the album.
“I can imagine myself driving to it, very good driving music,” junior nutrition major Kendra Moore said.
“I really like the range of his voice and the statements some of the songs make,” junior accounting major Malina Medeiros said.
Though the reception from students of the music has been mostly positive, a common criticism was that it was lacking in versatility.
“He could’ve pushed the borders in terms of beat. Typical pop hits. Not anything new,” Moore said. 
Others shared a similar sentiment. 
“It’s very centralized around pop-hip/hop sound, I would’ve liked a bit more diversity on the tracks themselves,” Medeiros said.
Medeiros is a big fan of Nas X. She loves his provocative fashion statements, promotional material and music videos.  
“I adore how he’s breaking the boundaries of gender norms,” she said.
Other students on campus shared similar sentiments of admiration for Nas X’s unorthodox approach to his art.
“The way he expresses himself is pretty cool, there’s not a lot of people stepping out. He’s paving the way for a lot of people,” junior computer science major Carlos Claudio said. 
However, some disagree that Nas X is doing anything other than making catchy pop tunes. 
“I don’t view this as something that’s going to advance any part of society or influence … He’s the same as everybody else,” Moore said.
In June 2019, Nas X came out as gay on Twitter. Students on campus are supportive of Nas X and believe he can be a role model for LGBTQ+ youth.
“He’s just eliminating toxic masculinity and I think it’s great for young boys who have a sense of belonging to that community to have someone to look up to, especially [for] people of color,” Medeiros said.
Nas X made significant use of social media to promote the album. He made satan-themed shoes – a customization of a Nike shoe that included a drop of human blood and satanic symbolism and imagery. He also posted images and videos of him with a prosthetic pregnant belly – symbolizing him “giving birth” to his first album. Student reaction to Nas X promotional material has been mixed.
“I think the promotions were amazing. I was in love with them. He made a statement and showed that he’s going to do what he wants despite backlash,” Medeiros said.
Other students on campus weren’t so fond of it, and found it rather confusing. 
“I dislike that. He did it just to get attention and cause controversy. That’s not advancing anything for anyone. He’s not creating a discussion; he’s creating an argument and that takes away from bigger issues,” Moore said.
Nas X has released four music videos in promotion of “MONTERO” and the reception from students has been more positive.
“I think they’re really cool and creative,” Medeiros said.
 Others shared a similar sentiment,
“They’re very explicit but he should do what he wants to do,” Claudio said.
“MONTERO” has more than 1.5 billion streams on Spotify in its first week of being released,
