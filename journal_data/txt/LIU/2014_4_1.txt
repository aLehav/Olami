College students spend so much time deciding on a major that they often overlook whether or not a minor would complement their degree. The debate about whether the minor truly matters has always existed. Students are not sure whether the extra work is worth it.
“A minor just doesn’t seem like a big deal to me,” said Ryan Kelly, a senior Business Administration major. “I think it matters more where you went to school or interned, and what you actually studied for four years. A minor is only a few courses; it doesn’t mean you know everything about that field.”
LIU Post offers many different minors ranging from Chemistry to Film.
Currently, there are about 300 undergraduate students with declared minors, according to Beth Wilkow, registrar. The most popular minor is Business Administration, with 56 students declared. The others are 30 students minoring in Chemistry, 30 in Psychology, 18 in Criminal Justice, and 15 in Sociology. Adding a minor would not increase the price of tuition and could possibly add more school time depending on the student’s plan of courses and credits to be received.
In order to receive a minor in Business Administration, students must complete 18 credits: 9 credits of required Business core courses, and 9 credits of Business elective courses. Students would pick one of the four Business Administration areas of concentration, which are Finance, International Business, Management, and Marketing.
“I hope to run my own art gallery one day, so I think a Business minor adds something to my degree,” said Kelly Riley, a sophomore Arts Management major and Business Administration minor. “If art doesn’t work out well for me, I can always try to go to business school and work from there.”
Psychology minors require students to complete a minimum of 24 credits in Psychology courses. Courses would include two
general Psychology courses, Principles of Psychology, and at least five additional Psychology courses, which might include one special Topics in Psychology course.
“Psychology and Political Science have a lot to do with each other. It helps me understand the way that people think,” said John Gordon, a junior Political Science major and Psychology minor. “I think I want to go to law school when I graduate, and being a lawyer is all about understanding the situation and using tactics to win the case.”
A college major is much more important than your minor, but some employers may like a potential candidate who has knowledge in multiple fields. A minor could be a potential tiebreaker between you and another job candidate being considered.
Minors help to broaden your skills in a field other than the degree you are receiving. Whether you are looking to explore a personal interest or make your resume stand out, minors can be a smart choice to add to your degree.

The LIU Post Hillel hosted an event to commemorate the 81st anniversary of the Holocaust, on Thursday, March 27. Guest speaker Stan Lebovic spoke to an audience of around 20 Post students in the Tilles Center Atrium. A He displayed his artwork, which he created using a computer, and the computerized pictures depict religious symbols memorializing the Holocaust. Some of these images included a Swastika and a mezuzah.
Lebovic grew up as the son of a concentration camp survivor, Alex Lebovic. “Being the son of a Holocaust survivor made it very difficult to maintain my faith. The more serious I take it and look at it, the more difficult it becomes,” he said. “I had grown up with this at such a young age. The way my father felt about it; he just told and retold the stories,” he added. “It had an impact on me because the stories my father told me showed that he survived something that he almost did not and should not have. The artwork I do helps. My artwork is an expression of that struggle.”
Wolf German, a junior Sociology major who was in the audience, found the event inspirational. “I thought the event was very insightful, as it not only went into the aspects of the Torah and how it brought together that God is there for us even through the awful times like the Holocaust,” he said. “One of the artwork pieces, the L’chaim piece, you have the cup, which is the ritual cup used in drinking wine; it looks like someone from the concentration camp. That to me conveys that while the Holocaust was definitely an atrocity; in the end, it symbolizes that the Jewish people proved to be resilient,” he added. “My grandparents are Holocaust survivors and with all this art; it brings on the reliance about how we should never forget the Holocaust as we go on with our lives.”
Hillel, a national organization with a branch on LIU Post’s campus, meets in the Interfaith Chapel on Wednesdays at 4:30 p.m. The organization hosts events throughout the school year, which promote Jewish life and history.
Lebovic is a member of a non-profit organization called Black Is A Color, whose members express what they have experienced during the Holocaust through their artwork. Their artwork displays pictures of historical events and religious memorabilia.

You’re walking through the halls of Humanites on the way to class and notice somebody running back and forth, waving their hands in the air while talking on their phone. They are talking in a voice that bounces off the walls 10 classrooms away, paying no attention to the people around them. 
You’re walking through Hillwood trying to find a seat, and all you hear is “OMG I can’t believe she Instagrammed that! Did you see her tweet? I saw it on Facebook!” Many students are not only ignoring their lunch but they’re also ignoring the friends sitting next to them. Instead, they are busy texting or tweeting other “friends.”
Anything sound familiar? The truth is: Cell phones are taking over the world and LIU Post one tweet at a time. According to the Telecom Agency [a specialized agency that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies], recent studies show that out of the world’s seven billion people, six billion have access to mobile phones. Only 4.5 of these seven million have working toilets. Everyone can list all the ways cell phones have improved our lives, but life pre-cell phone was a lot less chaotic.
Believe it or not, your cell phone is causing you more damage than good.
Research by the Telecom Agency has shown that people who are constantly breaking away from tasks to reply to emails or text
messages suffer effects on the mind similar to losing a night’s sleep. The majority of us probably need to change how frequently we use our cell phones.
How many people can you see right now? How many are on their phone?
To see how frequent cell phone usage is at LIU Post, a small informal study was conducted on 11 Post students by text.
The survey started with the question “Do you think you are addicted to your cellphone?” 10 out of 11 said yes.
Hunter Stones, a junior Social Work major, explained how she couldn’t go more than 40 minutes without checking her phone. “I can’t last any time at all without my phone; it is always with me,” said James Harrison, a junior Forensics major.
All students in the group agreed that the most frequently used applications are Twitter and Instagram, and when asked if they use the phone in class, while driving, and even in the bathroom, all said yes.
“I always hear someone saying ‘OMG look at her tweet or OMG look at that Instagram picture.’ – I constantly see people on their phone,” said Brooke Eversman, a freshman Education major.
Kevin Felden, a senior Political Science major, and Ashley Munford, a junior Education major, both agreed that when going out to eat, people are on their phones. “Whoever I’m with is usually checking their phone,” Munford said. When the students were asked why they rather send a text over making a phone call, all answers involved convenience. Texting is “easier, faster and more private,” said Felden. “Most people will answer a text over a phone call,” said Billy Sullivan, a senior Business major.
Junior Medical Imaging major Shannon Reilly disagreed, and said, “I honestly prefer calling over texting; it’s more personal.” Gerry DeAngelo, a freshman Art major said, “It’s easier to text and it saves precious time. Addicted…not yet. But I guess I’m getting there.”
So how do you detach yourself from your phone and take yourself off “autopilot?” Well, just like any other bad habit, kick it to the curb. Here are five tips that will help:
1. Delete all unimportant apps
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, and Snapchat, along with any other social media apps, are not important. You do not need to micromanage social media sites and be informed of all events at every second of every day. Stop looking at the sky through a picture that has gone through 40 edits and filters, and just look up. People have their heads buried in the phones at all times and miss out on real life experiences. Actually take your friend to that really cool place you always text pictures of, and share the memory instead.
“The use of texting, Facebook, Twitter and other sites as a form of communication is corrupting people’s ability to write sentences that communicate real meaning,” Saunders Medlock, owner of Life by Design Coaching, said in a recent ‘Coaching Tip Of The Week’ video. “It also allows people to communicate without ever seeing each other or hearing a voice, and this has a huge impact in that much communication is done nonverbally.” Delete the apps. It’s not that hard – promise.
2. Silence/Vibrate/Do Not Disturb mode
It’s not as bad as it sounds; there are just times when you shouldn’t be interrupted! Designate certain parts of the day to work on things you need to get done, such as your schoolwork, hanging with your friends, and driving. Turn the ringer off during class, practice, dinner and other family or alone time, so you can really enjoy what’s around you.
Take a leap of faith and realize everything will not crumble just because you don’t instantly know when a “like” or text message comes in. It may not be easy at first, but it really is beneficial. Save certain time throughout the day to read e-mails and texts instead of constantly checking your phone every time you feel a buzz.
3. Leave the phone behind
It’s great that you can do just about everything on your cellphone, but can you do anything without it? You don’t need the phone when running to the bank, food store, or gym – but I bet it’s always by your side. Take some time to yourself and enjoy the alone time; sometimes the gossip gets overwhelming. Don’t use phones at a meal, whether at home or eating out, and don’t check the phone on a date or when you are out with friends. You don’t need your phone while in an important meeting. It can wait. Don’t feel the need to update the world every time you change location – we will manage change.
4. Work with friends to limit texting
It’s always easier to fix things with a partner, rather than doing it alone. Get a group of friends together and see who can go the longest without posting a picture or sending out a tweet. See who sends the first text message and reward the friend who can wait the longest. The more enjoyable you make it, the less dependent you will become of your phone.
Reilly teamed up with some friends to see if this strategy really works – and it proved effective. “After deleting all of my unnecessary applications, and limiting my texting, I was on my phone way less. This helped me to have more verbal contact with my friends, rather than always talking through a text. Deleting the apps was extremely helpful. It brought my friend group closer together; making a phone call wasn’t so bad after all.”
5. Switch phones
You don’t need an iPhone to be able to connect with people. You don’t need the fastest, sleekest, LTE, touch screen phone to send a message. The original flip phone is all you need: you can text and make phone calls. In all honesty, the rest can wait.

Herstory has taught thousands of silenced Long Islanders to transform their personal stories into intensely moving narratives that connect individual experiences with larger social issues. Working in partnership with colleges, universities, schools, and nonprofit organizations, Herstory gives voice to the most isolated and vulnerable populations on Long Island, including women in prison, homeless shelters, women on disability and welfare, domestic workers, Asian, Hispanic and Caribbean immigrants, pregnant and parenting teens, and young men.
“For justice” is the Herstory Writers Workshop’s motto. Their mission is to offer youth tools that transform their individual voices and experiences into literary works of art leading to personal and societal change.
Herstory Writers Workshop held its 18th Anniversary Gala Luncheon on Sunday, March 23, at Stony Brook University, where there were many social justice issues addressed. There was a story of a young man who was 17-years-old when he was arrested and thrown into solitary confinement, as well as the story of a teenage Muslim girl who was harassed because of her religion, and called a “terrorist,” making high school a living nightmare for her.
At the Gala event, there were a few honorees that have dedicated time and effort into helping change the way our justice system deals with our youths. Angelo Pinto was honored for his skill and compassion for changing outdated policies in New York State. Pinto is the Raise the Age Campaign manager for the Correctional Association of New York.
He is currently seeking to increase New York State’s age of criminal responsibility, to end the practice of housing children in adult jails and prisons, and ensure that children in the justice system receive appropriate rehabilitative services.
Gabrielle Horowitz-Prisco, another honoree, is the director of the Correctional Association of New York’s Juvenile Justice Project
and manages the project’s principal activities. Prisco spoke about the importance of the collaboration between Herstory and the Correctional Association as a way to get New York to rise the age of legal liability from 16 to 18 years of age. Since social policies have historically been shaped without the voices of those most affected, workshop participants who have gained insight and confidence are encouraged to use their stories to inspire community action and influence social policies. With the assistance of a part-time justice advocate, these stories, and their writers, are paired with specific initiatives in justice, immigration, education and other human rights’ reform movements.
A training program in the Herstory methodology and two teaching manuals are offered to organizations interested in using it for their clients. Current participants include two Unitarian congregations, seven youth-serving organizations, and a seriously disadvantaged school district.
To learn more on Herstory’s initiative, visit the Fish Bowl in Hillwood Commons on Tuesday, April 15, 2014, from 2 to 4 p.m. This teach-in will give a chance to hear from Post classmates, as well as Herstory advocates, and learn the importance of youth justice reform.

College education is expensive, and sometimes students find themselves struggling with subject matter, workloads, and continuing to read stories about college students having trouble finding jobs after graduation in the current job market. So, in 2014, is college education still worth the cost?
An article titled, “Is College Worth It?” published by the Gallup Business Journal on Aug. 27, 2013, analyzes the question, while providing examples as to why going to college might be worth the time and vise versa. “Higher education faces daunting challenges: soaring costs, access and completion issues, rapidly changing technology, and accountability pressures from state and federal officials,” wrote Brandon Busteed, the author of the article.
Busteed uses the current condition of the economy to provide substance for his claim. “As a result of the recent economic downturn, many graduates are not finding well-paying jobs. Meanwhile, over the past two decades, average tuition at American colleges and universities has jumped 248 percent. As a percentage of household income, tuition has risen from 23 percent in 2001 to 38 percent today.”
Some LIU Post students agree that, despite the cost, there are benefits to their college education, but changes are needed, like perhaps more integration with social media, and more interaction with students.
Joe Voce, a senior Electronic Media major, thinks that education as a whole, including earning a college degree, has some deficiencies. “I think education for modern-times like today needs to step up its game. We are slowly drifting as a country into stupidity, and it’s a proven fact. Maybe we take too many tests. Not a lot of people are good at taking tests, and our education is based around nothing but tests.” Yet, Voce is still uncertain of whether college is completely worth it or not. “I’m going to say yes and no. College is worth it — the experience, the education, and the independence. A degree is important. [It] looks good on resumes, and some employers may be impressed by it. But in that sense, college is being forced on by most parents, which makes having a college degree not that special.”
Deandre Wilson, a junior Broadcasting major, thinks that a college degree is still worthwhile. “We can learn at a higher level because we’re not limited to anything since it’s so easy to get information.” Wilson thinks that his professors are doing a good job. “I think teachers are more effective in teaching material to students because they have so many options of showing material to their students. Teachers can use videos, audio, newspapers, books, and more, as compared to the simpler devices used by teachers in the past.” However, Wilson still thinks there could be improvements made to the education system, such as making lessons more interactive.
Trish Torrales, a junior Broadcasting major, thinks that a college degree is absolutely necessary. She claims that education is one of the biggest necessities you need to succeed. “I think education is an essential thing in this day and age. Nowadays, you need a degree to get the majority of jobs out there, so it’s really important to finish school.” Torrales agrees that teachers are doing well in the education field. “I think it depends on the school and the teacher, but generally, I think teachers have gotten more effective at teaching students materials over the years.”
Angelique Vito, a sophomore Management major, believes that earning a college degree is more than important. “Education plays a big role in society today. I feel the students nowadays are more obligated to get an education because it is what is expected. Especially with today’s economy, it is very hard to get a job. The competition for jobs has also increased over the years, which I think has led to students staying in school for a longer period of time, just to qualify for a job.”
The value of our education system is relative to the student and to the teacher. However, the notion that finding more innovative ways to incorporate the student, like having more direct interaction, or integrating more social media, could further bounce the ball in a “progressive” motion. Education is essential. However, our education system could be tugged in a positive direction — or a negative one, depending on many factors. As for where it stands now, we are in the middle of an “education” tug of war.
Having a college degree is necessary in today’s modern world. It is necessary for what your field of study might be, and necessary for potential employers to hire you. Not everyone can be the next Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, but if you are able to achieve success by having a college degree, that can reassure relief, benefit, and happiness in another aspect.

Why we look and behave the way we do is a complicated question with a lot of factors to consider. What is it that forms us and makes us who we are?
The issue to consider is heredity versus environment, also known as nature versus nurture. Heredity, or nature, is used to explain the gene part of our formation and growth, while environment, or nurture, is the surroundings and circumstances of our upbringing.
There are no sides to take in this debate. Nature and nurture overlap so much that there is no one “right” side. Our life has been formed by both nature and nurture and the only way to “take sides” is to discuss the issues that spring out from the ideas.
The issue manifests itself in wide-ranging debates, from why some people are more prone to disease than others, to why some are addicted to alcohol and some are not, and whether or not people are born gay.
Homosexuals and other Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people are born the way they are. I believe that when a baby comes into this world, it has already been decided whether or not the baby will grow up to be gay. It is not a choice for that person, and they can never  change. Homosexuality and bisexuality are not exclusive to humans.
It’s been observed in nature in many different species. Penguins are one example of animals where two penguins of the same gender have formed a romantic relationship. I think it’s ignorant of people to call homosexuality unnatural when it is seen in many places in nature. Consider this, if nature has nothing to do with people being gay, how does that explain why one brother or sister is gay and one isn’t? If they both had the same childhood, have been exposed to the same environment and people, and nurture is the only factor considered, then they should both be gay. Nature has a big role there, but I also believe that nurture is an important factor.
There are a lot of grey areas, and there are no definite answers when it comes to nature versus nurture. With so many factors to consider, there are too many variables and too many outcomes to prove a conclusion. But some things have, I believe, been proven by nature itself. An example of that is that LGBT people are born the way they are; it’s not a decision they have made or a direct outcome of their upbringing. It’s just the way they are born.

Washington State Governor Jay Inslee imposed a moratorium, or a suspension, of the death penalty, in February. As a result, there have been extremely passionate opinions from people all over the United States, and across the world about capital punishment. The moratorium will allow Inslee to issue a reprieve to any death penalty case that comes to his desk. Many students at LIU Post believe this newly issued moratorium is a major stride in creating a more progressive nation but some students seem to believe that the complete abolition of the death penalty is not the direction that they want this country to go in. 
The death penalty draws such intense emotion because it is quite literally the issue of life and death. However, there are a few facts that people should be informed of before making a decision of whether they support it or not.
According to Amnesty International, there is no credible evidence that the death penalty actually deters crime. In some death penalty states, the crime rate is higher than in non-death penalty states.
Another popular public opinion about capital punishment is that taxpayers don’t want to pay to keep an inmate in prison for the duration of their lives. However, a 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70 percent more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case.
Therefore, these figures pose the question: Does abolition of the death penalty actually lower tax costs for citizens?
However, some students believe that dollar signs and statistical figures should not be the focus of analysis. They believe that we as a people should be more concerned with the moral dilemma that arises from the use of the death penalty.
“The state should be bigger than the individual,” said Shervin Naghibi, a sophomore Film major. Naghibi and his friend Bendik Sorenson, a sophomore Journalism major, are originally from Norway, and staunchly opposed the death penalty.
Sorenson believes that a more humane option to the death penalty is the concept of rehabilitation. The lack of rehabilitation in the penal system contributes to a slew of different factors, such as a person continuously reoffending, also known as recidivism. Recidivism only adds to the strain on the economy, the legal process, and burdens the taxpayers.
However, some LIU Post students are able to view the death penalty from the perspective that if people are willing to commit such heinous crimes, then they should be punished just as harshly.
“There has to be a penalty that shakes you to the core,” said Jenny Edengard, a junior English Writing major. “If the worst thing that will happen to you is that you’re going to spend the rest of your life in prison, then that’s not enough. For some criminals, being in prison is like a vacation. They don’t have to worry about contributing to society or the stresses of paying bills and working a full-time job.”
Some students, including Christina Urbancik, a freshman Pre- Pharmacy major, look at the situation from both perspectives. “If the person has committed multiple, severe offenses like that of a terrorist, then I can understand the use of the death penalty. However, it shouldn’t just be used lightly,” said Urbancik.
Many people would agree with Urbancik, especially because of the recent terrorist during the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against 20- year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect. His trial is set to begin on Nov. 3. Tsarnaev is facing over more than 30 federal charges for the bombings that killed 3 people and injured more than 260. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 70 percent of those surveyed favored the death penalty in the Boston case. Elizabeth Emmert, a student at Boston University, who was present at the Boston Marathon during the bombings, knows first hand of Boston’s reaction to such a horrific event.
“Once the bombs went off, [the city] had a totally different vibe,” Emmert said. “I remember people frantically running around trying to find their friends and family and all the phone lines being down.” It was especially tragic for Emmert when she had found out that one of Boston University’s graduate students died from the bombing.
“I don’t know why the bombers did this but I do know that justice was served when we caught the surviving bomber,” said Emmert. “I’m not [pro-death penalty] but I understand why the victims’ families would want to him to be given the death penalty.”
According to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel, only 3 inmates have been executed out of the 74 federal cases where the defendant was sentenced to death since 1988. This number seems low compared to the 16 inmates that were executed on Texas Death Row last year alone. Through comparison it can be seen that the use of the capital punishment varies drastically on a federal to state level, but also a state- to-state level.
In 2004, the New York Court of Appeals held that a portion of the state›s death penalty law was unconstitutional. In 2008, then Governor David Paterson issued an executive order requiring the removal of the state’s execution equipment. Despite the current disestablishment the capital punishment in New York, the death penalty debate is still ongoing for the rest of the nation, as there are only 19 states, with Washington State being the newest addition, that currently do not have the death penalty in effect.
History Professor Willie Hiatt disagrees with the issue of death penalty. “I don’t think that in the age of a modern nation state, we should be in the business of killing our citizens,” he said.

LIU Post has recently faced a number of cutbacks in student work hours on campus. Student reactions to cutbacks was fearful and pessimistic, with little exception. 
Shannon Namigohar, a senior Education major who is minoring in Psychology, works four hours a week as a teacher’s assistant at Post’s Center for Gifted Youth. “I work on campus and they’re going to cut my hours in the fall. It’s terrible. They make tuition so high and then expect to make our wages minimum wage. No one can afford anything on minimum wage.” She questioned why the lack of university funding has hit the students, “Why is it our fault that they have to cut the budget?”
Ryan Cantar, a junior Digital Art Design major, recently lost a work-study position with the Center for Student Information (CSI). “Because of the budget cuts, I lost my work-study so I had to find a job off campus at Toys “R” Us. As a commuter, that’s a lot of expended gasoline. It’s annoying to know that I had the job, but I lost it with no warning. They didn’t tell me why or anything,” he said.
Laura Sherman, a junior Digital Arts Design major, recently acquired a position in the office of Student Life. “I make posters for Student Life now. I am excited for this job opportunity. It will improve my portfolio and give me something to put on my resume. Hopefully the budget cuts won’t affect my job because I’d hate to lose it before I start. I was hired two days ago,” she said.
Jerrome Warden, a graduate Theatre Performance major, works on campus as a Resident Assistant (RA). Warden’s stipend might be reduced from $200 to an undeclared amount. Nevertheless, Warden is thankful for being able to keep a position at Post that pays for the full amount of his room and board. He explained, “There have been rumors of cuts for monthly stipends, which we hope that there isn’t because RAs do so much. I know many students are finding work off campus because the financial stability is not here yet.
A lot of students are out of state or country, so if they need to fly home that can get pretty expensive. As long as they keep room and board [coverage for RAs], it’ll be a great opportunity for out of state or international students.”
Christopher Fevola, vice president for Finance at LIU, would not comment on how many student workers will be affected by the cutbacks. “The University’s reorganization activities have focused on improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and levels of quality provided in key student service areas. It is not the University’s practice to discuss or publish specific personnel information,” Fevola said. “However, we believe the launch of LIU Promise and Enrollment Services, and our commitment to maximum 2 percent tuition rate increases through 2020, exemplify the positive effects of reexamining the student experience and the affordability of a quality education at LIU.”

We live in an age where science is rapidly progressing. Immunizations, vaccines, and other scientific advancements make it so that some diseases that used to kill millions of people, such as small pox and tuberculosis, do not affect the average person today. Yet, millions of people die each year because of diseases that they were genetically predisposed to and weren’t aware of getting. If it were possible to know exactly what diseases you might contract in your lifetime, would you want to know?
“Knowledge is power,” said Doug Robinson, a sophomore Theatre Arts major. “For example, if it came back that you were predisposed to get prostate cancer, then you could look up preventative measures such as a special diet that could help decrease your chances of getting it,” he added.
“I have a lot of family members that passed away from cancer. I would like to know if I’m predisposed to it. If the test was available to me then I would take it,” said Justin Barsky, a graduate student in the Digital Game Development and Design program.
Genetic testing allows people to find out what exactly they are predisposed to in terms of illness and disease. According to the Mayo Clinic, a nonprofit worldwide leader in medical care, research, and education, genetic testing can reveal changes or alterations in genes that may cause illness or disease. However, there are limitations to the testing. Although genetic testing can provide important information for diagnosing, treating, and preventing illness, it doesn’t definitely mean that the person will develop a disease that he or she has demonstrated a predisposition to.
Interest was sparked in genetic testing when Angelia Jolie, an American actress, revealed that she underwent a preventative double mastectomy and hysterectomy after genetic testing revealed that she had an 87 percent risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective gene. Students at LIU Post sympathize with and understand the measures that Jolie took, and some claim they would undergo the same procedures if they found out that they were predisposed to a certain illness.
“Breast cancer is extremely serious, so I understand why Jolie got a mastectomy to prevent breast cancer,” said Brian Riley, a sophomore Journalism major. “I would do the same thing if I was in her position.”
Marit Ronningen, a senior Sociology major, agrees that she would want to take the test, but questions whether or not she would follow through with what some people would call the “drastic measures” that Jolie took.
“If it was something that I could prevent, without doing anything drastic, then I would take the appropriate measures,” Ronningen said. “If it was affordable, I probably would get the test because I don’t know a lot about diseases in my family.”
Ronningen brings up a question that many people face: Does the cost [of genetic testing] allow the tests to be accessible to most citizens?
According to the Genetics Home Reference website, an online service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the cost of genetic testing can range from under $100 to more than $2,000, depending on the nature and complexity of the test, if more than one test is necessary, or if multiple family members must be tested to obtain a meaningful result. Depending on the person’s socio-economic stance, then this either makes taking the test possible or not possible.
“It would have to be affordable,” said Michael Youssef, a senior Journalism major. “I would do it if my insurance covered it.”
However, some students believe that taking the test would interfere with the natural progression of life and would prefer not to know what diseases they were predisposed to.
“I have to take my family into account because I am a mother,” said Hanit Gluck, a senior Early Childhood Education major. “I wouldn’t want to take the test because I wouldn’t want the prognosis to shape my life. It’s hard to say because if there was an achievable cure then I would want to know, but I have to look at it from the perspective of what I put my family through.”
Focusing solely on a disease you may or may not ever develop is a valid concern. Since genetic testing is not absolute, there are no guarantees that you will or will not acquire the disease you demonstrated predisposition to. Perhaps, the prospect of choice and options is the most comforting part of the growing science of genetic testing. For some, genetic testing is the perfect solution to diseases that could be potentially prevented. Yet, to others, it is something that causes conflict, as well as difficult and painful decision-making.

A free screening of the film “Other Months,” and a talk with first- time feature film director and editor, Nick Singer, was held Monday, March 24 in the Kahn Building during common hour. The event was coordinated by Film professor Susan Zeig, who is friends with Singer’s parents, and encouraged him to attend a summer camp for high school students called SOCAPA, with locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn, founded my Jamie Yerkes, a former LIU Post Professor. Singer grew up in New York, and graduated from Wesleyan University’s Film Studies Department in 2011. Students asked Singer questions regarding the film after the screening, with Zeig acting as moderator. 
“Other Months,” Singer’s first feature effort, was an official selection at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival 2014 in Austin, Texas, screening three times. In the film, a young writer named Nash (Christopher Bonewitz) finds an uneasy security in his job as
a plumber, but is conflicted about giving up his artistic dreams for a sense of safety. The film follows Nash over the course of several months, where he works, meets and hooks up with women, and has lapses into
a depression as he tries to sort out personal meaning in his life. Highly visual and meditative, Singer described the film as “arty” and “slow,” but with its own distinct rhythm.
“It’s really great to use his advice, moving forward,” Zeig said. “[Singer] was able to finish his first feature. He spent quite a few years on it, and it was a very thoughtful process. Sometimes it’s hard to make a feature, when you don’t have money all at once. Nick was able to make [“Other Months”] in several parts, and the film itself works well completely whole. It’s a very smart strategy, with fantastic results.” The filmmaker gave students advice on funding projects, music copyright, submitting to festivals and more.
Singer discussed financing independent films, as many Post filmmakers anticipate funding their own thesis and production lab projects. “The money was personal money, but two-thirds of it was raised on Kickstarter a year and a half ago,” Singer. said “It [cost] $28,000 for the whole film, which seems like a lot of money now, but it’s really nothing compared to any other film that was at SXSW.”
Crewmembers for “Other Months” consisted of mostly college friends of Singer. “The crew, throughout the whole process, has been this knot of people,” Singer said. “We were just students who got much better at working together over the years. The actor, Chris, I worked with on a short project a year before we shot the first piece of the film. He’s a professional actor.” Singer hired a publicist for the film as it is entering festivals, in hope of being approached by future financiers, and reaching an audience through a distribution deal.
“The starting point for me and the whole project was the dream [sequence] in the beginning,” Singer said. That scene is very surreal and abstracted, tapping instantly into the sense of claustrophobia the main character feels. In it, wolf-like shapes are making love in what would be total darkness if not for faint red light. “There’s a red sort of sex scene; it’s a very abstracted, kind of dream sex scene,” he continued. “I had this crazy dream of this moment, and I thought ‘that’s very interesting.’ I couldn’t get it out of my head. I spoke to some friends about it and it just grew, it accrued meaning, the longer it stayed around, and the wolf became different things. The project grew from that.”
There is an unorthodox approach to pacing in “Other Months” where silent nature scenes often give way to long and heavy dialogue between characters. In one scene, we find Nash drunk at a bar with a friend, discussing in-depth their philosophy of chaos, and what it means to find security in the world. Singer often maintains long-takes, never cutting to a new shot, displaying superb acting skills, with little deviation from the script. “There was almost no improv,” noted Singer. “Other Months” was shot over the course of three years, with segments of the film standing as stand-alone stories of Nash’s life. The first segment of the film, titled “February” was an official selection of the prestigious Slamdance Film Festival 2012, in Utah.
Slamdance has launched the careers of filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan (“Inception”). Singer’s segmentation of the film fits the whole piece artistically: “If there’s one overall message of the film, its disconnection,” said Singer. “Disconnection visually and thematically.”

Following the release of his album “Satellite Flight: Journey to Mother Moon” on Feb. 25, hip-hop artist Kid Cudi put on a concert at the Barclays Center Saturday, March 22. A galaxy-themed stage set-up was put together for the rapper’s performance, donned with bright lights of various colors, and mountainous rocks formed to look somewhat like fans had just landed on a completely different planet. 
Along with Cudi came rapper King Chip, formerly known as Chip Tha Ripper. This artist, although new to some, has been featured on many of Kid Cudi’s previous albums on popular songs such as “Hyyer” off of 2009’s “Man on the Moon: The End of Day,” and “The End” from 2010’s “Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager.” King Chip opened the show for Cudi, performing songs of his own: some new, some old, and even one that has not yet been released.
As Kid Cudi prepared to perform, the stage illuminated in bright white lights as the intro to his album “Destination: Mother Moon” began to play. Cudi appeared from a gaping hole in center stage, dressed in an all white and dark grey space suit. He immediately began his performance, first performing a song off of his new album “Satellite Flight.” Though the concert was in promotion of his newly released album, this did not stop Cudi from performing hits from his former albums. Cudi encouraged crowd participation as he performed songs such as “Mr. Rager,” “Man on the Moon,” “Memories,” and The Crookers remix of his smash hit “Day n’ Nite.”
Many songs from his new album were also performed during the duration of the concert. Songs such as “Balmain Jeans,” “Troubled Boy,” and “Satellite Flight” were just a few of the new songs performed. “Satellite Flight” continues Cudi’s themes from previous albums — of his personal struggle and perseverance through rough patches in his life.
In his first few albums, fans witnessed a darker side of the artist as he touched on topics of drugs, depression, and feeling alone. His journey slowly changed over the years as he began to overcome many of these things. During the show, Cudi explained the trials and tribulations he faced when writing the song “Mr. Rager,” wanting to use the song for his new album, he was worried he would not be able to hit some of the high notes within the song due to his heavy use of drugs at that time. He explained to the crowd that the first way he overcame this struggle was to completely stop doing drugs, and began practicing the song.
The mood throughout Cudi’s “Satellite Flight” concert fluctuated throughout the night, as the rapper performed both slow ballads followed by more upbeat songs. The crowd was constantly encouraged to engage with the artist, as he kept up a personal rapport with them. When talking about difficult times in his life, he would sit and speak to the audience, addressed them when he wanted them to sing along, and at one point during a performance, stopped to sign a picture a fan drew of him. Energy was high throughout most of the show, and the excitement could be felt throughout the entirety of the show.
Cudi has upcoming show dates at festivals such as Lollapalooza in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. In addition, the artist has dates at
the Coachella Festival in California, and the Sasquatch Festival in Washington.

On Saturday, March 29, the no. 9 Pioneer Men’s Lacrosse team (5-2) squared off against no. 15 ranked Griffins of Chestnut Hill College (3-4). The ECC clash featured an epic comeback by the Pioneers, overcoming a four goal deficit at the half to win 10-9 on enemy turf.
It seemed to be the Griffins’ day early on, as they scored five unanswered goals in the second period. Senior attackman Michael Melnychenko and sophomore attackman Michael Plaia combined for four of the goals, pushing their lead to 6-2 at the half.
The third period was a different story, as the Pioneers came out more aggressively, and it showed in their shots on goal in the period. They out-shot their opponent by 10, leading to three goals which helped narrow the deficit to 7-5 heading into the last frame.
Sophomore midfielder Anthony Berardis tied the game at seven with two goals in the fourth period, giving him three for the game. The Pioneers took a two goal lead with just over five minutes remaining in the game, giving them a 9-7 advantage. However, the Griffins scored twice in the final minute of the game to tie it up at nine. With just over 30 seconds on the clock, sophomore attackman Matty Beccaris scored the go ahead and eventual game-winning goal for the Green and Gold.
Senior defenseman T.J. McAndrew caused three turnovers in the game and also accounted for the assist on Beccaris’ game winning goal. The Pioneers won 11 of 21 faceoffs, and converted on 2 of 5 extra man opportunities as well. Coach John Jez and his squad are back in action on Wednesday, April 2 when they travel to Merrimack College in Massachusetts. Game time is slated for 4 p.m.

The LIU Post Dance team has announced that its 2014-2015 auditions will take place on April 27 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Pratt Recreation Center. The team of 10 is set on recruiting a large group of experienced dancers to replace the four seniors who will be graduating this semester. The seniors who will be stepping off the stage are Melissa DeBitetto, Chloe Evans, Kristin McDonough and Ashley Scadura.
Although the team may be small, they have a big impact on campus. The ladies bring spirit to LIU Post’s athletic department, primarily performing at the games of the football team and both men’s and women’s basketball teams during home games. Additionally, the Pioneers recently placed third at the 2014 Universal Dance Association (UDA) New England Championships, held in Westfield, M.A, on March 2. “We finally think the team is ready to compete next year at the 2015 UDA College Dance Team National Championship in Orlando, Florida,” said Head Coach Chris Klein.
Ashley Ioveno, a junior Journalism major, shared her history as a member of the dance team. “Since my freshman year the team has grown in ability, strength, dedication, performance, showmanship, sportsmanship, involvement, and dancing technique. The team is performing at a skill level higher than ever, and we have become better dancers as a team and especially as individuals. I am able to dance in ways I never imagined possible three years ago.”
Ioveno discussed why students at Post should try out for the team, which is considered one of the minority sports on campus. “We would love for more people to join the team and become a part of our dance family. Most people who grow up dancing call their dance studio their second home, a place where they are always welcome, well it’s the same here. People should know that with joining, you will not only improve and have fun as a dancer, but you will [also] find your new home away from home,” Ioveno said.
“Anyone is able to audition for the team; undergraduates, graduates, boys, girls, anyone.” Auditions are open, but the tram does require some experience. During auditions, everyone is required to perform a one-minute original solo to a song of choice. However, it must be jazz or lyrical genre. The second part of the auditions requires learning a hip-hop routine, which will be taught and demonstrated in pairs. “Even the girls who have been on the team in the previous years are required to try out [again], so do not fear the solo requirement.”

Despite capricious weather conditions, the Pioneer Softball team kick-started their East Coast Conference Championships on Thursday, March 27, with a doubleheader victory against Mercy College, at the LIU Post Softball Complex in Brookville, N.Y.
Due to constant inclement weather during their pre-season preparations, the Pioneers had to put off several games. As a result, the team has been left out from the NFCA Division II poll that is ranking the top 25 teams in the country for the last couple of weeks. However, the green and gold recently reclaimed a spot, going in as number 23, and in the ECC premier the team demonstrated why.
The Pioneers (currently 15-3) dictated the first game, without giving any room for the guests to shine. LIU Post simply took the first game in five innings, marking an 11-0 win. Senior Liz Weber stood for her eighth victory of the season, as she threw a complete-game three- hitter; a game in which a pitcher allows the opposing team only three hits, while walking just one and striking out two.
In the nightcap (the second game), the Mercy Mavericks sought revenge, and finally found their way around the course to earn their
first points of the afternoon. Although, the visitors would not hold on to their lead very long, as sophomore and third baseman Maria Palmeri sacrificed herself in center field to send home her teammate from third base. The Green Machine helped each other around smoothly, and finally counted for eight points, two more than the visitors.
Unfortunately, the rain found its way back, and washed out the possibilities to play on Saturday, March 29. Undefeated at home, the green and gold now have to try and keep its 12 game winning-streak going, in what will become the first away game for the ECC season next week. First off will be Bridgeport on April 1, for a new pair of matches, starting at 2 p.m.
In focus: Last week, on Monday, March 24, two Pioneers received honors for their contributions to the team’s success lately. Junior catcher Aly Dzierzynski was selected as the East Coast Conference Player of the Week, while freshman hurler Ashley Martin was named Rookie of the Week.

It only took 20 seconds for the Pioneers to strike, as senior attackers Jackie Sileo and Morgan Chiarenzza hooked up for the games opening tally. The quick strike set the game’s tone, as the Pioneers (8-0) steamrolled Queens (0-4) in a 16-2 victory at Knights Field on Saturday, March 22, in Flushing, N.Y. The victory improved the Pioneers overall record to 8-0 on the season and 2-0 in
the ECC.The Pioneers took charge, as senior attacker Jackie Sileo registered the game-high with seven points (3 G, 4 A). Sileo also made her presence felt defensively, as she caused two turnovers and picked up two ground balls. Sileo’s outstanding play has given her 61 points for the season, and she›s only 20 points shy of becoming the NCAA›s (I, II, III) all-time leading scorer.
After leading 12-0 at the intermission, the green and gold continued to shine as freshman defender Nicole Stackpole marked her first collegiate goal and added another goal minutes later. Senior attacker Katie Rotan pitched in with three points and won two of her three draw controls. Freshman attacker Stefani Vagelatos added four points (2 G, 2 A). In the cage, senior goalkeepers Katie Hanaan and Renee Schwartz, along with sophomore Kasey Kephart, recorded one save apiece for the Pioneers. Queens’ goalkeeper Kahli Evans ended up with 16 saves. The Pioneers had an overwhelming advantage in shots (35-6), and held the edge in ground balls (17-9) and draw controls (15-4). In addition, the visitors converted all 13 of their clears.
The Pioneers traveled to Worcester, Mass. on Thursday, March 27, where they soared past Assumption with a 15-5 victory. Assumption (5-3) opened up the game with a free position goal around the 4:00 mark, but the Pioneers (9-0) responded immediately and went on a 9-1 run to close out the first half. Junior midfielder Jenna Pierro registered two goals for the Pioneers and complet- ed her hat-trick later in the game. Senior attackers Samantha Losco and Jackie Sileo each recorded a hat-trick of their own, capping off another outstanding performance as the Pioneers shut out the Greyhounds in the second half to improve 9-0 on the season.
Sileo continued to dish out her teammates with five assists, while senior Morgan Chiarenzza chimed in with two goals and two assists on the day.
On the defensive side, sophomore Emily Hanifan paved the way with three caused turnovers. Senior goalie Katie Hannan tallied up three saves in the pen for the Pioneers. Her counterparts, Jaclyn Chirco and Michelle Monahan, tallied up nine saves combined for the Greyhounds.
ECC goalie of the week Katie Hannan mentioned that communication with her defense is key. They talk after every goal, own up to their mistakes, and look to get the ball to the other end of the field. Hannan also commented that her and her teammates emphasize taking the season day by day, which has worked in their advantage thus far. As Hannan was named ECC goalie of the week, she›s eager to keep improving and working hard as the season progresses. “We need to keep our energy, focus, and strong work ethics while having fun,» Hannan said.
The Pioneers dominated in shots (27-9) and forced 24 turnovers. They held the edge in ground balls (28-18) and draw controls (13-9). Once again, the Pioneers were very efficient on clears, going (16-20).
