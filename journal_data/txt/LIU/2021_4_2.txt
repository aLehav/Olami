On March 19, TikTok star Addison Rae released her first single, “Obsessed.” Her song reached number ten on the New Music Friday and Pop Rising playlist on Spotify that week. Rae will be performing her new song for the first time on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on March 26.
The official music video was posted to her YouTube channel for her 4.76 million subscribers and the video currently has over 12 million views. Addison Rae is one of the most followed social media influencers, with 78.7 million followers on TikTok, 36.9 million followers on Instagram, and 4.7 million followers on Twitter. 
However, following her release of the song and her performance on “The Tonight Show,” Rae has received a lot of backlash. The most liked comment on her music video said “She’s bold for turning on the comments section.” The singer has also received backlash on Tik Tok and Twitter with many fans disappointed she got a performance on “The Tonight Show” over other artists. 
Some students on campus feel the public is being too harsh on Rae. 
 “To be honest I didn’t like it at all. I don’t have a problem with Addison Rae,” junior biology major Rachel Helms said. “I know she has gotten a lot of criticism for the song. I think people are being a little bit too hard on her though. I do get the message she’s trying to get across and I can appreciate that. It’s just not the kind of music that I like to listen to.”
Sophomore psychology major Dennis Goodwin hasn’t been surprised with the public’s reaction to “Obsessed.” 
 “I don’t know much about her but I think the song is okay. I’m not surprised that she’s getting a lot of hate for the song,” Goodwin said.  “People are always extremely critical of these types of things. I’m not crazy about it but I’ve heard songs much worse come from social media influencers that decide to do music.”
In an interview with Rolling Stone published March 19, Rae opened up about the meaning behind the song. 
“One could take it as being vainly obsessed with yourself, but that’s not what I’m trying to communicate. It’s more I can love myself as much as you love me, and that’s important,” Rae said. “There are days where I struggle, and it’s definitely a work in progress to accept who I am and give myself the love I deserve.” 
Freshman dance studies major Abby Mitchell is a fan of the song and loves the message behind it.
“I really like Addison Rae. I think it’s so cool that she decided to make music. I think the message of the song is really important. I think it’s extremely important to send the message out to everyone, especially young girls, that they need to love themselves,” Mitchell said. “Many young girls feel like they need to try to be a certain way to be acceptable and liked. No one should have to feel that way and I think it’s great that someone with a lot of followers that are young girls, to see that they should love themselves and not rely on love from other people.”

Being an Resident Assistant (RA) requires meeting residents and building a community, but in the times of COVID-19 this has become increasingly difficult. Despite the social limitations, the RA’s of Riggs hall are finding ways to make this semester fun yet safe.
 Sophomore biology major Madison Eppers is experiencing her first year being an RA, and this year didn’t go quite as she expected. 
“I wanted to have in-person self-care nights with coloring, movies, snacks, pajamas, and face masks. I can still probably do that on zoom, but it’s definitely not the same,” Eppers said. 
Eppers was surprised by the workload that being an RA during a pandemic entailed.
“Being an RA during a pandemic is definitely a lot more work than I thought it would be but it’s been super rewarding so far. These challenges inspired RAs to step up to the plate to make living on campus safer and more fun despite being virtual,” she said. “Currently, I’m trying to figure out some good self-care programming to help residents relax and get to know each other and me a bit more.” 
Due to covid restrictions, student engagement is once again limited to virtual engagement. However,  the responsibilities of the RA’s remain the same.
“Every semester, regardless of covid, RAs have to have RA programs. These programs are ways to get students involved and connected by building a community in the residence halls,” junior physical and health education major Jack Tomlinson said.  “Since last semester I have been co-hosting the ‘Beyond the Residence Halls Podcast’ alongside RA Nick and now RA Shaun. Here, we talk about campus life both inside and outside the residence halls. Hopefully, providing the Shark Nation with a bit of love and entertainment.” 
The “Beyond the Residence Halls Podcast” has one more episode in the works, which is planned to release on Wednesday, April 14. These episodes can be found on the LIU Promise Instagram page @PostLiuPromise.
In addition to the podcast, Riggs hall RA’s are introducing other safe yet engaging activities. A favorite among students is the Riggs Hall Playlist introduced by RA Matthew Sporrer. Here, every resident can pin a song suggestion to a board and the songs were made into a collaborative playlist. Additionally, RA Nick introduces a new question of the week every Monday, prompting a resident vote. 
Danielle Burnman, junior musical theatre major and Riggs Hall resident, doesn’t find the student engagement this semester to be too different from other years on campus.
“The only thing that’s different about this year is that you can’t be in the lounges,” Burnman said. “I think once Covid is better and we are allowed to gather and go into friend’s dorm rooms [student involvement] will improve, but until then we just have to stay away from each other to stay safe.”
Sophomore Theatre Arts major, Saffron Cooper, believes student involvement has improved since the fall semester. With the chaos of this year, she acknowledges the importance of student activities, but also understands why limitations are in place. 
“Being able to have in-person classes with the delayed start of the term has helped with involvement, but it comes at the cost of eliminating breaks entirely, creating a general sense of exhaustion and burnout among the student body,” Cooper said. “Personally, I want more relaxation and rest though I think for other people, de-stressing might manifest in other ways such as activities and engagement.”
Cooper believes that despite the limitations, students can still enjoy themselves throughout the semester. 
“At the end of the day, though it isn’t ideal, there are things to be prioritized by the administration and university above events and engagement. Though these aspects of the college experience are crucial for the mental and emotional wellness of students, our physical health is the most important,” she said. “I think we all can improve and continue our commitment to following covid guidelines, staying socially distant, wearing masks and having respect for the campus community. That is the only way we can work towards a better future.”

The Distributive Education Clubs of America (DECA) club is a new business-oriented club on campus that is built on competitions and networking. 
DECA is a non-profit organization seeking to build chapters among educational institutions. 
“DECA prepares emerging leaders and entrepreneurs in marketing, finance, hospitality and management in high schools and colleges around the globe,” the DECA website said. 
Sophomore accounting major Griffin Jusko is the president of the DECA foundation at Post. 
Because campus has an emphasis on their business programs, Jusko felt a related club should be available for students to join. 
“I was surprised there was no DECA chapter or even any business club on campus at all, so I approached my faculty advisors, and they liked the idea,” he said. 
Jusko is excited about all of the competitions that DECA will soon be taking part in. 
“It’s very open and free-flowing DECA competitions between us and other schools, as well as regional and state competitions,” he said. “We’ve done one competition so far, but I have some more planned.”
Jusko loves everything that DECA has to offer beyond just the competitions. 
“We will be having workshops for your resumes, guest speakers, and internship opportunities,” he said. “Even if you get a LinkedIn connection out of the call, that’s a win and can never hurt you.”
Jusko claims that students will have a greater say on what goes on in DECA compared to other clubs on campus. 
“Since it’s a new club, all members have a say in what we can do. It is not a scheduled or rigid club, and general members can decide what they are interested in,” he said. 
Jusko first got involved in DECA when a chapter emerged during his senior year of high school. 
“My chapter in high school is very preliminary. I don’t have a solid path to follow or examples, so that’s why it’s open for all members to take the initiative because everyone’s voice is heard,” he said. “Since it didn’t get far, I did my own research on what it could offer LIU, and I felt it was a great club to bring to LIU to go along with the established business program.” 
Jusko was happy with the fast development that came with the club’s excitement when he brought it up to faculty.
“After looking, I realized this is something that could become very prevalent at LIU, and that’s when I approached Dan Klein and Chuck Garcia, and they were very excited to bring it to LIU as well, they were behind me all the way,” he said.
Marketing professor Daniel Klien serves as the faculty advisor for DECA. Klien feels DECA sets students up with perfect examples of future business experiences. 
“The DECA LIU chapter helps talented business students connect to discuss real-world business in a competitive environment, and it’s been great to work with them as a part of this program,” he said. 
Klien knows what it takes to succeed and proposer in this business world, and is certain DECA can put students in a position to do just that. 
“We are able to drive into multiple aspects of running a company and brainstorm on ideas to solve pressing business issues,” he said. “The students in the program will enter the workforce well ahead of others who have not participated in DECA.”
Jusko wants to develop his skills while helping everyone else in the club achieve their maximum potential. 
“Individually, I want to work on leadership skills, and that’s why it’s very open to the members. It’s not me telling them what we’re doing, and it’s what you feel like you’ll get out of it,” he said. “Even if one person takes away something, it’s a win.”
Jusko wants DECA to have a strong influence on campus. 
“I think it should be very prevalent on campus. I want to have a strong presence,” he said. “The more kids we have, the more competitions we can do, and the more fun it will be.”
Jusko would like students on campus to be open-minded and give DECA a try. 
“Business is all about networking and what you can learn from other people. If you have any interest, definitely join,” he said. “I want to offer something that’s worthwhile for [club members’] time and help them down the road or sometime in their life.”
Jusko believes with how much DECA can grow, it will be a great learning experience for many students. 
“People have to learn to work together in a group with different personalities. It’s always better having people with different views voicing ideas off each other to create a strong business proposition when more minds come together,” he said. 
Assistant Dean of the College of Management Chuck Garcia is confident that DECA is the spark business students on campus need to get the experience that co-sponsors the knowledge they are getting through their education. 
“In a world of profound uncertainty, DECA stands on a foundation of three critical skill sets: communication, collaboration and creativity. This is exactly what the business world demands from its next generation of leaders,” he said. “The LIU College of Management is perfectly suited to contribute to the mission of this highly inventive organization.”

Caitlin Ann Huber, is a 25 year old Christian homemaker who lives in Michigan with her husband and dog. She runs a blog and YouTube channel called “Mrs. Midwest.” 
“The idea of that 1950s bored housewife who just stays at home, and she would be so much happier in an office environment. Like, ‘oh, the poor lady.’ That’s outdated,” Huber said at the beginning of her video “Housewives are NOT Oppressed: 5 Myths About Being a Housewife.”
On her Twitter page, Caitlin describes herself as a writer on “feminine homemaking, women’s heart and mind issues, slow living, faith, and marriage.”
She began her blog back in Oct. 2018, and published her first YouTube video in Feb. 2019.
Huber is part of a larger trend of young women promoting traditional values on social media. YouTubers Cynthia Loewen and Natalie Bennett echo her worldview, imploring their viewers to embrace their femininity, revere homemakers and reject the consumerist attitudes that pervade modern society. 
“I believe that part of the exuberant support for my channel and blog has been from women who are already living a traditional lifestyle,” Huber said in an interview with “The Epoch Times”.
Huber often refers to her viewers as her “feminine sisters” and ends her videos by wishing her audience “a blessed day.”
Huber regularly engages with her fans on YouTube and Instagram, thanking them for their continued support and encouragement. 
“Many of my viewers are religious, sometimes conservative women who have felt alienated by the modern progressive narrative,” she said. “I think they resonate with my content because I’m speaking up about these topics from a perspective they agree with.”
Huber’s audience is reflective of a larger societal trend. According to a 2019 National Geographic poll, feminism does not resonate with the majority of American women, with only 29 percent of women polled identifying as feminists. 
“I think the fact that she’s young and has a presence on social media shows that our generation is becoming more conservative,” Samantha Aprile, a senior English major at St. John’s University said. “I really feel like she’s giving women who want to live a traditional lifestyle a voice in a society that largely ignores us.” 
On her YouTube vlog “Living the Housewife Life,” Huber offers a look into her typical day, which embodies the traditional female role in a sphere of domesticity. 
First, she wakes up and takes a cup of coffee into the backyard, enjoying the sights and sounds of nature. She then cleans up a bit in her kitchen and gets herself ready for the day ahead.
Donning a thrifted plaid dress and a wide-brimmed hat, she enters her garden to tend to her flowers. She then goes back into the house to prepare some baked treats for herself and her husband. 
After tidying up from baking, she proceeds to make her bed and fold the laundry. In order to offer herself some reprieve from her domestic duties, she goes to the local library to pick out some books. 
“I think what she’s doing is really cool,” sophomore art major at Hofstra University Stephanie Dante said. “She is really appealing to a small but forgotten group of women who feel like their voice isn’t really being heard, and she’s giving them a platform in a society that expresses contempt and hostility toward traditional values.” 
After returning from the library, she puts some fresh flowers into a vase. By this time, it is already evening, so she takes her dog to the beach nearby for some recreation and relaxation while her husband, a police officer, is away at work for the night shift. 
Neither Caitlin nor her husband have commented on the debate regarding police reform in America. 
Along with providing a look into her personality and daily activities, Huber offers her audience her opinion on social and economic issues. 
In her video “Let’s Talk About Casual Sex” she said, “I care about your entire life, the longevity of your decisions, and the future that you live.” 
“The magazines and the information out there right now are telling you they care about you, but what they care about is your current pleasure, the orgasm you’re going to have tonight, and the hook-up you’re having next week,” she said. “They don’t care about your entire life, and the thing is sex is so important, it is wonderful, it is a gift, but it is not your entire life.” 
In her video “How I Practice Frugality: 10 Tips for Living in Your Means” she said, “Making due is all about understanding that you don’t need the latest and greatest to feel like life is the greatest.” 
“There is this overconsumption, overspending, taking on debt, taking on car loans, taking on student loans,” she said. “Our culture is at a fever pitch of consumerism and overconsumption.” 
Not all members of Generation Z, however, share Huber’s sentiments. 
“I think what she is promoting is sexist and destructive,” senior math major at Columbia University Elle Walker said. “People like her are the reason why stereotypical and misogynistic attitudes toward women have not been eradicated from society.” 
Other women who watch Caitlin’s content have expressed support for her message. 
“We have a lot in common,” junior psychology major Jillian Smith said. “She prioritizes her family life, and I agree with her, since family is the most important thing to me, too. I hope to be like her someday.”

President Joe Biden gave his first official press conference, an event which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on Thursday, March 25.
Due to social distancing protocols, only 30 reporters were present, a stark contrast to previous densely-packed press conferences. 
Biden began the conference by saying that he has set a new goal of 200 million vaccine doses after surpassing his goal of 100 million doses. 
Though Biden touted the practical benefits of his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, and his efforts to jumpstart the economy, he was also pressed on how Republican opposition to his views on immigration, guns, and voting rights have taken away from his legislative victories. 
“I got elected to solve problems,” Biden said. “There are a lot of problems,” he said, but he argued those other issues were “long-term problems” while he needed to put all his initial focus on dealing with the pandemic and the economic fallout.
Biden also said that the willingness to cooperate is incumbent upon Republicans and that they have to make the choice as to whether or not they want to work towards uniting an already divided country.
“I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to — is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division, but I’m not going to do that. I’m just going to move forward and take these things as they come,” Biden said.
When asked whether or not his administration’s more welcoming view towards immigrants could be a factor in the upsurge of migrants at the southern border, Biden said that an uptick in migrants in an annual occurrence and that many of the current problems resulted from the failings of his predecessor, Donald Trump. 
“So what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild, rebuild the system that can accommodate what is happening today,” Biden said. “And I’d like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not, it’s because of what’s happened every year.”
Biden also said that although he has called on Congress to take action regarding gun control, it is imperative to wait for the right timing. 
“It’s a matter of timing,” he said. “As you’ve all observed, successful presidents better than me have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they’re doing. Order it. Decide in priorities what needs to be done.”
Regarding getting his agenda passed, Biden said that he would go beyond mere reinstatement of the “talking filibuster.” 
“If we have to, if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about,” Biden said. “It used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.” 
Biden then turned to the issue of foreign affairs, acknowledging that there have been increasing tensions with Russia and North Korea, and that there is a looming May 1 deadline to remove all troops from Afghanistan. 
Biden said that he is open to diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, but that it may be difficult to meet the May 1 deadline for removing all troops from Afghanistan. 
Some students lauded Biden’s handling of questions from reporters. 
“I think he did a phenomenal job,” freshman English major Scott Anderson said. “He was much more composed than Trump, who did nothing but berate and discredit reporters the whole time.” 
Sophomore political science major Alicia Wyman agreed with Anderson. 
“It seems that Biden is looking to work with the other side, and not create constant conflict,” Wyman said. “I hope he continues to do this in further press conferences.” 
Other students, however, were not very pleased with Biden’s first press conference. 
“He couldn’t articulate his ideas clearly half the time,” junior history major John Jones said. “Is this guy really fit to be president? He can’t even walk up the stairs!” 
Senior biology major Jillian Pavlich agreed with Jones. 
“I can’t believe this guy is president,” Pavlich said. “No wonder the rest of the world laughs at us. We have an aging buffoon as Commander-in-Chief.” 
Biden closed the press conference by telling reporters his plans for reelection. 
“My plan is to run for reelection,” Biden said. “That’s my expectation.”

With the rise of electric powered cars and alternative energy sources, many students think that the gas-powered car may soon be done for. Companies like General Motors and Tesla have started making electric cars with much success. General Motors has been developing their own electric car battery called the Ultium Platform, which is planned to be released in 2025. 
“At GM, our goal is to create a world where everyone can enjoy the benefits of electric vehicles. We cannot reach the future we envision alone — we must continue to pursue collaboration opportunities with leaders across the industry,” according to the General Motors website. “A shift this massive requires the entire mobility and energy ecosystem to work together toward a single goal – a zero-emissions, all-electric future. Our approach is centered on working closely with a network of leaders in the charging, ridesharing, infrastructure, battery and vehicle development fields. Uniting with experts and exploring solutions across every facet of the EV ecosystem should allow us to make EVs affordable to own and unlock the best benefits to improve the EV driving experience, charging infrastructure and EV rideshare access.”
“This transition is necessary since it will ultimately [be] helping our Planet, and ensuring reduced greenhouse gases,” freshman speech pathology major Dayna Romero said.
 Romero feels this way due to the recent uptick in climate change impacts around the world. 
“I wouldn’t have any objections if gas powered cars were replaced,” Romero said. “Electric cars are typically cheaper to maintain too.” 
She feels that this transition would first take place in Europe, and would take years for society to completely transition to electric vehicles.
“It would take a long time to make this transition happen due to how comfortable everyone is with using gas powered cars as well as not enough locations to charge the cars,” she said.
 “It would possibly be Tesla or Google who would be at the head of this movement.” 
Romero  believes that there will be resistance to the change because of the inconvenience of having to charge the batteries for the car.
“People would bring up the point it takes longer to charge a car and there’s a sense of convenience to using gas-powered cars in terms of getting to places quicker,” she said.
Alumna Charli Beshers also has a positive opinion of electric vehicles becoming more mainstream. 
“I think as we spend more time looking at how using gas and other fossil fuels are affecting not just how long Earth as a planet will last but how long Earth as a planet will be livable it becomes clearer that the change to electric cars is a necessity,” Beshers said. “I think it’s logical for electric cars to become the new normal in everyday society.”

David Dobrik is a Youtuber with over 18 million subscribers, and a net worth of 20 million. Dobrik’s devoted fan base can be seen wearing ‘clickbait’ merchandise, and using the app Dobrik’s team developed, known as Dispo.
Dobrik began his career on the app formerly known as Vine, where he quickly gained hundreds of thousands of fans. He moved his content to YouTube, and his fans followed. 
Dobrik’s YouTube videos follow specific guidelines that are replicated with every video. He makes short four minute and 20 second vlogs with his friends, he often featured celebrities like Olivia Jade and Howie Mandel in the videos.  His fans named the recurring people in the vlogs, the “Vlog Squad.”
Dobrik and his friends hang out together, go to parties and even pull a prank or two in the vlogs. This content seems relatable to Dobrik’s young fans, which encourages them to tune in every time he posts.
Over his career, Dobrik has had a few scandals. One that is notable is how he treated former “Vlog Squad” member Seth Francois.
In interviews, Francois has stated that Dobrik played pranks on him that were racially motivated, and one that was classified as sexual assault. 
“I honestly didn’t realize how much that situation affected me until the beginning of last year when COVID happened,” Francois said in a Buzzfeed article.
Francois has since left the squad, and has been working on his own personal company.
 None of Dobrik’s scandals  had been in the public eye as much as the allegations Dobrik is facing now. 
On Mar. 16, Insider reporter Kat Tenbarge published an article containing allegations of sexual assault against a member of the “Vlog Squad,” Dom Zeglaitis.
Though Dobrik is not the one being accused of the act, he has been accused of enabling and providing an environment for it to happen, as well as putting it in a vlog on his channel.
Dobrik has responded to the allegations in the form of two apology videos posted on YouTube.
The first one came out the same day as the article, and has six and half million views. In the short video, Dobrik acknowledges that people can change their minds when it comes to consent, something he says is very important to him.
He also mentions Zeglaitis, stating he is no longer friends with him. “I’ve chosen to distance myself because I don’t align with some of the actions,” Dobrik said, despite having videos on Youtube with Zeglaitis from one year ago, after several women had publicly accused Zeglaitis of sexual assault.
Comments were turned off on the video Dobrik titled “Let’s Talk.”
In the following days, brands that sponsored Dobrik began to drop him.  Dobrik  lost 13 brand deals, including Chipotle and SeatGeek. Brand deals are Dobrik’s main form of income.
On Mar. 22, Dobrik posted a longer video in which he states that he believes the victims, and is going to step away from his platforms for a bit.
Many people in the comment section question if this newfound accountability is due to his loss of sponsors. 
“I wasn’t surprised at all when I heard the rumor that there was some sort of allegation,” University of Southern California student Sophie Hankes said. 
Hankes has met Dobrik, and the “Vlog Squad,” two separate times. The first time was on her first day moving into USC in 2018, and she couldn’t have been more excited.
“I watched his videos everyday before I went to bed, everyday that he posted,” Hankes said.
Hankes had been a long time fan, and let Dobrik know this. He seemed uninterested and awkward. 
Fellow “Vlog Squad” member Heath Hussar was with Dobrik, and was smoking a cigarette. When Hankes was talking to them, he blew cigarette smoke into her face.
“It was exceedingly rude and completely unnecessary,” Hankes said.
Hankes remembers feeling “disconcerted” and weird. After the interaction, Hankes stopped supporting Dobrik completely.
The second time Hankes met the group, they used her to get into a party. Once they got in, they walked away from her without saying anything.
“It was strange the way he treated us, it was strange that they were coming and hanging out with a bunch of 18 and 19 year old girls, I felt really uncomfortable,” Hankes said.
To Hankes, it seemed like Dobrik was only focused on content for his videos.
“When you meet him in person, it seems almost clear that it’s a business,” Hankes said.
Hankes thinks people forgive big creators too easily, and hopes that doesn’t happen with Dobrik.
“I think that we’re way too quick to forgive big creators because they’re big creators and we look up to them, but having money doesn’t excuse you from making terrible decisions,” Hankes said.
Being based in Los Angeles, there is always a chance Hankes will run into Dobrik, something she hopes doesn’t happen a third time.
Students on campus are also reacting to the allegations.
“I was not shocked, I haven’t been super fond of David for a couple years just because I feel like the way he conducts himself is rather odd,” junior acting major Aubrey Shadle said. 
Shadle used to watch Dobrik’s vlogs, and has kept up on every aspect of the YouTube drama. They also recall watching the specific video the allegations are about.
“I remember watching that video and being like ‘this doesn’t seem right,’ but like I’m sure it’s all staged,” Shadle said.
In the Insider article, the victim claims that the event was not staged, and they never planned on anything happening.
Shadle has also watched Dobrik’s apology videos.
“I think he’s getting emotional, I think those are real feelings, I just think that’s about him losing his career,” Shadle said.
In the second apology video, Dobrik talks about how he can’t imagine a childhood friend like Zeglaitis doing something like this.
“Guys aren’t willing to hold their friends accountable when many many women step forward,” Shadle said.
Many people have condemned Dobrik for not believing Zeglaitis would do this, even when he has had multiple allegations against him in the past.
Shadle believes people can change, but not overnight. 
“There has to be evidence of time, education, learning and growth,” Shadle said.
Many of Dobrik’s fans are young and impressionable, therefore he sets a standard for many. Both Hankes and Shadle hope he will work and learn to do better.

Ozlem Tureci, a German scientist who was a key developer in the coronavirus vaccine, is developing a technology that will be effective in targeting cancer tumors. Tureci, who is a co-founder alongside her husband of the company BioNTech, was developing a new technology that will help control the body’s immune system in order to fight against tumors last year, before the coronavirus developed a worldwide pandemic. 
This development for cancer was halted, and the company decided to put their focus over that time on the virus. BioNTech was able to create a vaccine that will use messenger RNA that will instruct the human body to create a protein that will attack a specific virus, the same system would be used on tumors.
“It pays off to make bold decisions and to trust that if you have an extraordinary team, you will be able to solve any problem and obstacle which comes your way in real time,” Tureci told The Associated Press in an interview.
Tureci says that the vaccine will take a few years to develop, and the toughest challenge of getting a vaccine approved is orchestrating large scale clinical trials that will supersede multiple regions. 
Biology professor Dr. Theodore Brummel believes while the vaccine sounds promising, but won’t be the complete answer to defeating cancer.
“Using vaccines in one case you are training the body to respond to a foreign entity and in the other you are trying to train the body to respond to abnormal cells,” Brummel said. “However, I do believe it is likely that vaccines will be used successfully to treat many cancers, but I am highly doubtful that we will be able to eradicate cancer by this approach as we did for some infectious diseases, such as polio and smallpox.”
In regards to availability and accessibility, Brummel believes in universal reception.
“If this approach works I think that many of the vaccines will be very widely available as much of the cost of the vaccine is associated with its development, and thus when widely used they become relatively inexpensive,” Brummel said. “I think it would almost certainly be more cost effective than many of the currently used treatments.” 
BioNTech is a small company that has employees in 60 different countries. The company’s capital and attention has increased significantly since the pandemic, which has given the company the ability to fund the progress of their cancer vaccine research. 
Junior nursing major Jahaila Harley was surprised to hear about a cancer vaccine.
“I never heard about this new development, I don’t know much about cancer, but I do know that cancer is completely different from a virus,” she said. “I believe scientists know what they’re doing and there will be plenty of trials for it so I’m hopeful that it can help such a large scale disease.” 
Dr. Brummel also believes that completely eliminating cancer may not be as easy as it sounds.
“I would like to emphasize that cancer is not a disease in the way that COVID is, but rather it is more like a collection of different genetic abnormalities that result in multiple very different diseases that share many features,” he said. “We have been successfully improving the standard of care for cancer for many decades and will continue to do so.  However, Cancer is a very challenging problem and it is very difficult to predict which excellent ideas for combating it will be most effective.“
On March 18, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier awarded Tureci and her husband the Order of Merit, one of Germany’’s highest decorations.
 “You began with a drug to treat cancer in a single individual, and today we have a vaccine for all of humanity,” Steinmeier told the couple at the ceremony. 
Tureci insists that it wouldn’t have been possible without the effort and help of her team. “It’s about the effort of many: our team at BioNTech, all the partners who were involved, also governments, regulatory authorities, which worked together with a sense of urgency,” Tureci said. “The way we see it, this is an acknowledgement of this effort and also a celebration of science.”
As for now, Tureci says that her husband and team are focusing on the ongoing pandemic, ensuring that every government entity that has ordered vaccines are provided with them and also ensuring BioNTech stays on top of any new mutations to coronavirus.

While the 2021 athletic season has been different for a number of reasons, the success that Coach Meghan McNamara has had coaching Women’s Lacrosse has remained the same. Coach McNamara reached her historic 200th win on March 13 with an 11-5 win over Central Connecticut State University. For McNamara, the magnitude of the win was a surprise.
 “I had no idea that I hit this milestone, let alone close to it until the announcement came out. I was speechless and very humbled by this accomplishment when my assistant, Coach Courtney, let me know about it. I didn’t know how to feel, I was so overwhelmed. To have this game be my 200th was very special to me,” said McNamara. “After reflecting as it all settled in, I was heartfelt. There were lots of tears and laughs as I thought of each team, each player, each staff member, each fan, each parent,each family and all of our successes and journeys we had together to get to this accomplishment here at LIU. I am forever grateful.”
It’s not common to have a head coach with as much success as McNamara. Senior  midfielder Elise Person is grateful for her expertise.
 “Coach Meg is one of the most knowledgeable coaches I’ve ever had. She understands every aspect of the game, and she helps break it down to us through film, drills and chalk talk sessions. Aside from her knowledge of the game, she is really a coach that you can go to with anything,” she said. “She has a different and unique relationship with every member of our team, and I think that’s something really special. Not all coaches take the time to get to know their players on a deeper level off the field, but Meg takes that time.” 
Junior starting goalie Hailey Duchnowski credits McNamara’s past as a key reason for her success.
 “Coming from the University of Maryland Coach McNamara has brought intensity, enthusiasm and always has a positive attitude towards every day helping each and every one of us achieve our goals as a team,” she said.
While the team and Coach McNamara celebrated her 200th win, McNamara has a specific goal that she would like to reach. 
“We have many goals for the season. Ultimately, it is to Win the NEC. It is a journey to get there, and we have small goals as we approach each game and each week,” she said. “As we do this, our bond as a family will continue to grow, and that is truly important to us.” 
The women’s lacrosse team currently has an overall record of 6-1, and sits third in the NEC with a 4-1 conference record.

The baseball team has started off their season sitting at an overall record of 5-3 and 3-3 in conference action.
The Sharks are contenders for an NEC title as many of the players are striving for the championship with their play each day. 
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, starting pitcher Jackson Svete believes everyone has done their part in making sure the team pulls through together.
 “It was definitely difficult preparing and staying ready for this season. In these times, you never know if you will get a call saying that your season is canceled [or] postponed. As a team, we know that it is possible that happens one day, but every single guy on our team hasn’t let that affect them,” he said. “Through quarantine, the fall season and winter break every single guy has worked extremely hard and it has shown on the field.” 
Outfielder Giovanni Ciaccio has a similar sentiment that everyone has their own role to play in getting everyone on the right path.
“It was a challenge throughout all the uncertainty but we took as work as we always did. We make sure we get our work in no matter what it takes. And it goes without saying [that] personal accountability is very important and it is something we all stand by,” he said.
Ciaccio believes that the team should focus on things that they can control, instead of worrying about things that are beyond their scope.
 “The biggest problem besides Covid is the fact that we just got outside because of the weather. A lot of our opponents have dealt with the same issue so we know we just have to take advantage of the time we have to be ready,” he said.
Shortstop Anthoy Warneke thinks that if the team can collectively play to their best ability, winning the NEC is inevitable. 
“Our expectations for this year is winning a conference championship and nothing less, while playing together as a team and playing to our strengths,” he said.
Catcher Andy Camillo also said that focus will be the team’s driving factor this season. 
“Our biggest factor for us to win is to not beat ourselves and play our game. Also,  trusting each other and being ready to step up when your name is called on,” he said. “There is no best feeling when you know you are going to a war with all your soldiers having your back and ready to fight.”
