ESPN’s Monday Night Football (MNF) broadcasts are shaking up by introducing a secondary broadcast featuring the National Football League’s favorite brothers, Peyton and Eli Manning. Starting this NFL season, the Manning bros will host their own show during 10 of the 16 Monday Night Football games, bringing in guests to help commentate on ESPN’s second channel, ESPN 2. Dubbed the “Manning-Cast,” the show has been nothing but successful and has seen its ratings climb each and every week.  
The success of the new Manning-Cast challenges the traditional style of NFL broadcasting and suggests that it may be time for a change. The almost century-old style of broadcasting football games may not be the best way to engage fans in the game anymore, especially the highly coveted younger audience. With the NFL focused on engaging younger and diverse audiences, a new broadcasting style similar to that of the Manning-Cast could be the secret to reaching this target audience. Clearly, the Monday Night Football broadcast between the two beloved NFL legends has the potential to shake up the sports broadcast landscape. 
Traditionally, the NFL broadcast consists of a play-by-play man along with a color commentator, with the play-by-play usually being an individual with broadcasting experience, and the color commentator being a former coach or player who can provide insight into the minds of the coaches and players. These two individuals help guide the audience through the game, providing commentary on what is happening while also conveying additional information that might interest the fans. 
The MNF broadcast between the two NFL legends is structured a little differently, as the brothers cover the game from separate locations, using a Zoom-style format to connect with each other and the guests. Throughout the course of the game, Peyton and Eli cover the game, analyze the highlights, and interview a variety of guests, ranging from current and former NFL players and coaches. This format gives the brothers more freedom to crack jokes, go off on rants, and entertain the fans without having to stay focused on calling each and every play of the game. 
The Manning-Cast has been met with near-universal praise by fans across social media, as many praised the brothers for their on-air chemistry and unique football knowledge. 
As stated by Ryan Boettcher, a Junior Broadcasting major at LIU Post, the Mannings provided a more “information-based knowledge towards the game,” while also having that “brother rivalry which led to a ton of comedic moments.” Boettcher admitted that he preferred this Manning-Cast over the traditional ESPN broadcast, citing that the conventional was more for the “casual fan,” while the new broadcast provided “more of a laid back broadcast for the knowledgeable fan.”
While Boettcher and a majority of fans were crazed about the Manning-Cast, some weren’t as intrigued. Like most things, it only takes one Twitter search to find sharp criticism about MNF’s newest broadcast. From brief technical issues to problems with the format and commentating from the brothers, critics had plenty to complain about. Mike Fiorio, an analyst for NBC, went as far as to say the broadcast was “unnecessary” and made the game “generally hard to follow.”  
It has been no secret that the NFL has been trying to reach a younger and more diverse audience while also retaining the die-hard fans that help make it the most successful sports league in America. Over the past few years, the NFL has expanded their presence on social media, launching the Playmaker’s Program on Instagram, and expanding their football coverage to Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, and even Nickelodeon. They have also continued their efforts to expand the league globally, playing two games in London this season, and approving at least four international games per year for future seasons. 
With the NFL putting an emphasis on expanding their audience, the success of the Manning-Cast shows that the answer to their woes might be in their broadcasts. In its limited time on-air, the Mannings have captivated the sports world and have drawn more attention and viewership each week. This early success indicates that it may be time for a change in the sportscasting industry, as the old way of broadcasting may not be the best way to reach a wider audience. 
Bob Costas, a long-time NBC broadcaster, suggests that the Mannings success may not be able to be replicated, as the dynamic between the brothers makes the broadcast so entertaining. Without that chemistry, alternate broadcasts could struggle to reach “the Manning level.”
While Costas may be skeptical, the Manning-Cast has opened the door for a new form of sportscasting and has made a splash in a nearly century-old industry. With the success of the Mannings’ broadcast thus far, the NFL will undoubtedly explore this further, as having alternate broadcasts to their primetime games could be the key to reaching new audiences and expanding the game we love.
While the Manning-Cast wasn’t perfect by any means, the overwhelming amount of praise and media attention shows there is plenty of support, which is a good sign for the future of this new alternate broadcast, and any others that may follow.

Adele recently dropped her newest single “Easy On Me” after not releasing any music since 2015. The single is already breaking records, and is causing a big uproar from her fans.
Fans were ecstatic when they found out Adele would be putting out a brand-new single on Oct. 15. The single became a smashing success, along with a large amount of publicity for Adele. 
“I definitely think that since Adele waited so long to put out new music, her fans are even more excited about what’s to come after hearing ‘Easy On Me’,” sophomore business major Gabrielle Selter said. 
“Easy On Me” is already making its way to the top of the charts. It has been recognized for setting first-day records on both YouTube and Spotify. 
A week after it was released, the single was awarded the most played song in U.S. radio history during the first week of its debut. It was also named the most added song in the history of Mediabase. 
Mediabase stated on Thursday night that “Easy On Me” already had over 3,000 plays at Top 40 stations, over 1,000 plays at Hot AC outlets, over 1,000 at AC and even more plays for other stations. 
“It is so interesting how quickly she climbed back to the top in just a week after so many years of not creating new music,” sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato said.
“It doesn’t surprise me that she made it to the top of the charts so quickly, since she hasn’t released anything in a long time. People are curious about how her music has evolved since it has been a few years,” Selter said.
Many listeners of Adele are eager to see what kind of releases will be coming from her in the future, especially after she announced that she will be releasing a new album in November. This has helped Adele gain more and more publicity so quickly after having not released any new music for years.
“I am pretty excited about this release because she hasn’t put new music out in a while and she has been very particular with what wants to put out in order to get people excited,” Selter said. 
Many students are speculating on what exactly this next album will be about.
 “I feel like for this album, she will talk about more personal life details and we’ll get more of an inside look at her life since she has been out of the public eye for quite a bit of time,” Selter said.
Adele’s album is one of the most anticipated albums of the year by students.

“Dune” is a science fiction film based off of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. This film has shaken the media because of two rising stars who portray main characters: Timothée Chalamet, who plays Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides I and Zendaya Coleman, who plays Chani. 
Students on campus are excited to see these two influential artists finally working together to create a film. Students are also excited to see the film’s cinematography due to its large budget.
“I have been waiting to see these two work together for so long and the time has finally come. I will be buying my tickets for this movie to see in the theaters,” sophomore public relations major Lauren Miller said.
Miller has been a fan of Chalamet since she saw his performance in the movie “Call Me By Your Name.” Miller is also eager to see Chalamet working with Zendaya, especially since the news broke that Zendaya was Chalamet’s childhood crush. 
Chalamet has been a popular media figure for young women this past year.
“After just recently watching “Call Me By Your Name” featuring Timothée Chalamet, I have a huge crush on [Chalamet] and his work,” sophomore public relations major Mara Titarsolej said.
As more COVID-19 safety restrictions are being lifted, students are ready to get back to seeing movies in theaters. Miller is excited because this will be the first movie she has seen in the theaters since the pandemic hit.
“Because I haven’t seen a movie in the theaters in so long, I can’t wait to get the whole experience when going to see “Dune”,” she said.
Other students are looking forward to seeing the movie, not because of its star vehicle, but because of the movie’s social media dominance. 
“I’m not that big of a fan of Timothée [Chalamet] and Zendaya, but because I’ve seen ads for this movie all over the internet and social media. I feel like I have to see it,” junior business major Amanda Loo said.
Loo went on to explain that science fiction is one of her favorite movie genres.
“… I also really enjoy movies that are adventurous, and because sci-fi is one of my favorite types of movies, and this movie’s picture making looks incredible, I will be going to see this movie,” Loo said.
Students who are more interested in the movie’s celebrity drama are invested in “Dune”, not only for the spectacle, but to see how things play out with celebrity romances on and off screen. 
Titarsolej just recently became a Chalamet fan and is excited to see “Dune”, but does not want to see Chalamet and Zendaya become too close off-set. Zendaya is supposedly in a relationship with English actor Tom Holland, famously known for his role as Spider-Man. 
“Though I am excited to see this film, I really hope Zendaya and Tom Holland stay together because they are a cute couple,” Titarsolej said. 
“Dune” has reportedly earned over $130 million at the box office since it’s Friday release in theaters and on HBO Max.

Nintendo announced plans for a new animated Super Mario Bros. movie to be released in 2022 on Sept. 23. Illumination Entertainment, the animation studio famous for creating movies such as “Minions” ,“The Lorax” and “Sing” will be producing the film.
 Members of the star-studded cast include Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Charlie Day, Seth Rogan, Keegan-Michael Key, Fred Armisen, Kevin Michael Richardson and Sebastian Maniscalo. 
An official plot synopsis has not yet been released. However, 
“[The film] will be a very collaborative project between Illumination and Nintendo,”Shigeru Miyamoto, the original creator of Mario and video game designer at Nintendo, said.
 This has led many to speculate that the movie will be more successful and loyal to the original game ideas than the 1993 live action Mario movie. 
The 1993 live action Mario movie was unsuccessful in profiting, and was not faithful to the plot or idea of the video game. It is often referred to inside the industry as a flop. After the movie was released and chastised by critics and fans alike, Nintendo didn’t involve itself in making movies for the next 25 years.
Immediately after the announcement of the film,  social media blew up with memes about the new movie. Especially those making fun of the actor voicing Mario, Chris Pratt. A particular theme being Pratt’s accusations of homophobia. 
While Pratt has vehemently denied allegations of homophobia, skeptics cite his belonging to Hillsong, an infamously controversial church. As well as his following of “right-wing extremists and homophobes” on Twitter, including Turning Points USA, a right wing, conservative organization often referred to as an anti-LGBTQ hate group. 
Fans also criticized not casting Charles Martinet, the original voice actor for Mario. 
“And ‘Surprise Cameos from Charles Martinet’?! Wow this legend deserved better,” 
 one Twitter user wrote. 
Memes about the casting choices have circulated, but are generally light-hearted. Every other main character was otherwise well received. 
Students also have comments about the casting.
“The cast seems like it doesn’t fit,” junior speech and language pathology major Kenia Diaz said.
Freshman English education major Stephanie Hatem agrees with Diaz. 
”The cast is definitely interesting, but I’m not sure all of the actors will match the voices well,” Hatem said.
On the other hand, sophomore musical theatre major Lainee Jentz is looking forward to seeing Pratt as Mario. 
“I honestly love Chris Pratt … I think he would’ve been better in his Andy Dwyer days … Wait, maybe they should’ve gone with someone Italian,” Jentz said.
All three students had similar ideas about what the plot would be like.
“It’ll be the same plot as the games itself. Saving Princess Peach or something or something with her getting kidnapped,” Diaz said.
“Mario trying to save Peach from Bowser. I think it might be a bit cheesy,” Hatem said.
Student overall thoughts on the Super Mario Bros. announcement.
“I have a bad feeling that it’ll end up like the Sonic movie, everyone hated it so much that they redesigned it. And it still got bad reviews,” Hatem said.
Jentz agrees with Hatem.
“I think it could be good, it could also be bad, I don’t know. If it’s like “Wreck-it Ralph”, it’ll be great … Video game movies, I feel like, are hard,” said Jentz.
Overall students seem hopeful, but extremely skeptical of the movie.

 Eight Amtrak train cars flipped over 90 degrees, lying on their side; passengers and crew members had to push their way out through broken windows, many of them were hurt or injured on Sept. 25 in Japlin, Montana.
In the incident, eight of the ten train cars had been overturned on their sides; the cause is something that safety officials are still trying to figure out.
Of the total 141 passengers and 17 crew members, three passengers were killed, and dozens were injured.
The three passengers who had died in this incident include a married couple traveling together and a husband. The couple, 74-year-old Donald Varnado and 72-year-old wife Marjorie were celebrating their 50th anniversary when the incident occurred. 
With safety now one of the major topics of discussion for Amtrak, it’s important to note that this has been just one of multiple Amtrak trains crashing within the past decade. 
One that was costly was the 2017 Washington train crash where an Amtrak train derailed on a bridge above Interstate I-5. The damages were extensive, as were the number of civilians that were injured that day. Of the five Amtrak employees and 77 passengers on board, three passengers were killed and 57 passengers and crew members injured. The severity of the crash was not just in the derailment, but that the train itself fell onto the interstate, blocking the heavily relied-on roadway.
A similar accident took place in 2015, when another Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia. The train was traveling from Washington D.C. to New York when it derailed at a curved railway, traveling at about 100 miles per hour instead of the 50 miles per hour limit. The devastating crash left over 200 victims injured, and eight dead.
This portfolio of major accidents where hundreds of people are left injured has done well to put the cross country train company safety procedures under the magnifying glass.
A recent passenger who rode the Amtrak’s Seattle to Chicago line not too long before the incident in Japlin said now she would think twice before riding again.
Senior theater and communications majors Shelley Dean took the Amtrak back home from Seattle for her senior year of college before the fall semester started.  She figured it would be a fun way to get back for her senior year. Fortunately, all was well for Dean. She described the trip as ethereal.
“Watching the view change from the Pacific Northwest to the Midwest was an experience that is hard to put into words,” Dean said. 
This all changed for Shelley when she heard about the accident in Japlin. 
“When I heard the news about the same train I was on crashing, my stomach dropped, knowing something could have happened to me was terrifying. My heart goes out to the victims’ families.  I am looking forward to hearing what the company has to say about the crash, and how they are planning on preventing a situation like this in the future. For a travel experience that is so expensive, I want to make sure it is safe for me.”
Dean is not the only one expecting to hear from Amtrak for their liability in the accident. 
“I think they should definitely own up to it. The [government] is ultimately accountable for maintaining the lines. Even if it was a freak mistake,” Brian Chang, senior business management major Brian Chang said.
This is exactly what many of the crash victims have in mind as they move forward to file a suit against Amtrak and BNSF railway under the firm Clifford Law Offices. For each of the seven plaintiffs, a maximum of $295 million was set in reparations for each individual.
The reason for the derailment still is unclear, with further investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Admission still underway.

Tensions are high after an oil rig in California spilled oil into the Pacific Ocean on Oct. 2. While the cause is not fully known yet, the Associated Press reported that the spill is believed to be caused by a strike from an anchor of a cargo ship.
Cargo ships frequent the waters off the Southern California coast in order to deliver cargo containers to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The pipeline off the coast of Orange County was ruptured and leaked oil into the Pacific Ocean for hours until it was shut down, causing oil to spew out into the ocean and wash up on the coast.
Students were shocked at the news.
“I remember seeing it on my newsfeed, and I couldn’t believe it,” junior musical theatre major Hannah Winston said. “It reminded me of the BP oil spill that happened when I was a kid. It’s so awful.”
Gov. officials are outraged at the incident.
“I have never seen, nor do I ever again want to see, the beaches of Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, and Laguna Beach this empty,” state senator Dave Min (D-CA) said. “I am 100 percent committed to doing what I can to ensure California’s coastlines never experience another oil spill.”
With the exact cause unknown, the Los Angeles Times reported that increased cargo ship traffic in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have caused ships to have no choice but to drop anchors and wait until they can unload. These waters in which the ships are sitting have oil pipelines and other equipment running beneath them.
Amplify Energy Corporation, the company that operates the pipeline, says that the pipeline was “pulled like a bowstring”.
Amplify has come under scrutiny for ignoring the initial reports and letting the oil spew into the ocean for nearly 12 hours, causing death to wildlife and catastrophic water quality damage across some of the nation’s most popular beaches.
Amplify said that at 2:30 a.m. on Oct. 2, the facility was notified of the leak. However, it took until 6 a.m. to shut down the pipeline. This has raised many questions as to why the pipeline wasn’t shut down sooner.
Some people blame the timeline, as there were fewer workers in control room positions that late at night, while others are not convinced that the alarms in the facility were operating correctly.
“I don’t understand why it took so many hours to shut down the pipelines,” Winston said.
Beachgoers and residents in Huntington Beach reported a petroleum smelling odor, as well as oily waters as early as Friday night.
By Monday Oct. 4, the Unified Command found that the pipeline was ruptured and displaced 105 feet from its original position. This is evidence of the line being dragged by some force, most likely a ship.
Reports have come out in recent days that a large cargo ship with its anchor down was seen making erratic movements in the waters off of Huntington Beach just hours before the spill.
This spill has brought attention to the risks and consequences of offshore drilling.
“Those damn platforms, fossil fuels. It’s not very complicated. We need to grow up, grow out of this dependency and this mindset, this mindset that we can’t do more and do better,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) said. “I want the Trump administration folks, all those folks out there, all those Republicans out there who still think the answer to the problem is more offshore drilling to just know: Not in our backyard. It won’t happen.”
Newsom has declared a state of emergency for Orange County following the spill.
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) gave a statement with more insight about the oil spill to the public on Oct. 4.
 “The oil spill off the coast of Orange County reiterates the perils of offshore drilling. A pipeline failure has leaked an estimated 126,000 gallons of oil, killing aquatic wildlife, threatening the health of local communities and forcing several beaches to close,” Feinstein
Feinstein used this spill as a way to raise awareness to pass the West Coast Ocean Protection Act. 
“Our bill would permanently ban oil and gas drilling in federal waters off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington,” she said. “Californians have made it clear: We don’t want oil drilling off our coast. It’s time to stop dangerous offshore drilling and invest in safer, cleaner energy solutions.”
The general consensus from politicians and residents close to the issue is that offshore drilling is not supported and needs to end. Time will tell whether or not this latest spill has any impact on environmental policy in California, and the nation.

Tesla(TSLA) ⬆️ 
Tesla is booming and back past it’s all time high from early on this year. After all the back and forth, the patience has paid off as the stock price hits $1,000 per share for the first time ever, and has marked over a trillion dollars in market cap. This has caused CEO Elon Musk’s net worth to soar over $250 billion, pouncing on Jeff Bezos for the world’s richest person. We have seen a nearly 90% increase since the low back in May, and 32% this month alone. The Nasdaq, S&P 500, and AARK have all seen tremendous growth due to the Volume Tesla has added, and the similar companies that have risen due to this news Tesla has led.
Boeing(BA) ⬇️
Boeing has seen some tough quarters over the past couple years. This is highlighted by the 7.5% loss in the past 3 weeks. It is hard to tell what will happen in the near future, but there should not be much concern long term as Boeing is still an industry leader, with large government contracts still in the works and a long track record of stability and growth.
Berkshire Hathaway(BRK.A/BRK.B) ⬆️ 
Berkshire Hathaway is one of the most well rounded companies in the world. With a huge portfolio of other publicly traded companies managed by Warren Buffet, undoubtedly the greatest investor of all time, as well as full acquisitions of dozens of companies across many industries, and a real estate team with hundreds of headquarters all over the world, it makes perfect sense why Berkshire Hathaway has seen a 42% increase this year, and it does not look to slow down anytime soon. The consistency and diversity of the assets under this corporation are a go to for any value investor
Ethereum (ETH) ⬆️
 Ether has seen tremendous gains over the past few months along with the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. This 46% boost over the past month has benefited from the obvious bitcoin adoption in everyday use, but also all the NFTs and popular cryptos developed along the Ethereum network such as Chainlink(LINK) and recently hyped up Shiba Inu(SHIB).

Due to the reduced social distancing guidelines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Post was to finally host their homecoming weekend after two years of not being able to. Events took place from Oct. 15 to Oct. 18. LIU faced Merrimack for a football game on Saturday, Oct. 16 and lost 43-5. 
Starting the weekend off was the evening carnival at the Pratt parking lot on Friday, Oct. 15 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.. This was one of the students’ favorite events because it had festival foods such as fried Oreos and funnel cakes, along with carnival-style games and hair-raising rides that were also running the next day before and during the football game. 
Sophomore biology major Jah’Liyah Bedminster said that the carnival was her favorite part of the entire weekend.
“Being able to let loose and come together to do things like eat funnel cake and enjoy fun rides like a family is really what made this weekend so special,” she said. 
Bedminster also believes that the carnival was a great way to relieve stress as midterms approach.
“Last year was incredibly stressful with COVID, and having to follow social distancing guidelines, it was really hard to lean on friends for emotional support during hard times of the semester like midterm week,” Bedminster said. “The carnival was a great way to relieve some of the academic pressure that students may be feeling.”
Post has not had a home football game since Nov. 23, 2019. This makes homecoming weekend the first in-person game that Shark fans have been able to see at Post in almost two years. Performances from the marching band, the dance team and the cheer team throughout the game helped the excitement for the atmosphere of the student and family section cheering on the Sharks. 
Graduate student Killian Bloat has never attended a football game at Post before homecoming. As a baseball alumni, Bloat misses the atmosphere of home games. 
“Hearing the crowd cheer for my friends on the field really made me reminisce [about] my time as a Shark athlete,” he said. “Even though LIU lost the game, memories were gained and everyone seemed to enjoy their first homecoming back and that’s all that really matters.”
Bloat said that his favorite part of the weekend was the game, but also the festivities that went with the game. 
“The food, the atmosphere, the fan section, the souvenirs, and the ability to be together – All of this made my homecoming weekend unforgettable,” he said.
Brooklyn students had the opportunity to take a shuttle from the Brooklyn campus to join Post students in their celebration of being Sharks. Students, like junior student athlete Katy Koopman, who also had never been to a Shark football game, believes that having the other half of LIU sharing the homecoming experience was important.
“I was shocked that I was even able to meet other student athletes from the Brooklyn campus,” Koopman said. “I’m glad I did because now we can see each other at upcoming events, like Midnight Madness, and attend each other’s competitions.”
The tailgate is tradition for homecoming, and this year it brought students together after over a year of virtual events. Koopman believes that tailgating with her friends and teammates after the game was another great way to meet new people, and can’t wait to do it again next year.
“Because [Post]  is so small, my expectations were a little low for this year’s homecoming, but the fact that it is small makes it so unique and personal because everyone knows everyone and we’re all close with each other,” she said.
The celebration continued through Sunday, Oct. 17, with relaxing events for students to attend throughout the day, including indoor and outdoor movies at the Hillwood Commons Cinema and Riggs Park. Students were brought together to enjoy a sunset that wrapped up the entire weekend filled with friends, families and alumni that came to Post to enjoy the Sharks.
