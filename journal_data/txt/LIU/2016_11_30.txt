Nov. 14 was in many ways a Monday like no other. Still reeling from perhaps one of the most tumultuous, momentous and historic elections in the history of American politics, Post’s theatre majors began their weekly retreat back to the classroom.
However, most, if not all theatre majors attending the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building that day were shocked with inspiration when they saw what was waiting for them on the chalkboard in the west wing of the building.
An anonymous creator left a platform for theatre majors to put their dreams into writing, for all of campus to see. The creator has yet to claim responsibility for the mural.
“It’s a board where everyone can talk freely about anything,” said Sabrina Ali, a freshman theatre major, who also works as a receptionist in the department of theatre, dance & arts management. “It’s completely anonymous, it’s us being ourselves.”
With her hands folded, Ali gazed at the mural and said, “We want to be free, and this wall is our outlet.” According to Ali, the mural only began with the words ‘Before I Die, I want to…” and since then, this outlet has grown every day, consistently, by the hour, with each student and one dream at a time.
While Ali was speaking, three students passed by the mural and one contributed, writing what she wishes to accomplish before her time comes: “Make Mom and Dad Proud.”
The mural of motivation has no names, signatures, or any other form of identification. Regardless of whether it’s an image, quote, or simply just a word, this mural allows members of the student body to peacefully and properly display their thoughts, their emotions, and their perspective.
“We seem to learn a lot more about one another when we reveal ourselves to one another,” said Jacob Lackey, a freshman undeclared major. “I think the mural humanizes us, and in a digital world, we sometimes lose touch of that.”
With no plans to remove it, the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building mural currently remains untouched, located on the old chalkboard in the west wing of the building. Students who wish to view and/or contribute to the mural are welcome to do so as long as reverence is shown for classes that may be in attendance.

The chorus is preparing for a special performance at Carnegie Hall on Dec 10. This will be the group’s third consecutive year at the venue. As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 26 issue, Music Professor Mark Shapiro’s connection with Carnegie Hall paved the way for the music students’ performances.
Junior music major Veronica Nguyen, a member of the chorus, is excited to sing at the historic venue. “It’s a really fantastic experience,” Nguyen said. “Singing at Carnegie Hall is really like nothing else. You can really feel the history and the magnitude of where you’re performing when you’re standing on that stage.”
Nguyen is a seasoned singer, as she started singing in middle school. She is ready for the moment but admits that when singing at a place as famous and appreciated as Carnegie Hall, she needs to calm her nerves. “It’s definitely a lot higher [amount of] pressure. You really have to know all the ins and outs of your music; you have to be prepared because time on the Carnegie Hall stage is really valuable,” she said. “You really only get one shot at it.”
The chorus has been working since the start of the semester to make sure the performance goes on without a hitch.
Leading the choir is Professor Shapiro, who is the director of Choral Studies. Nguyen praised Shapiro noting that he stresses that the students understand music theory concepts as well as using listening skills to “sing by ear” (not reading notes).
Shapiro also directs the Cecilia Chorus of New York in New York City. The Cecilia Chorus will be performing with the LIU chorus at Carnegie Hall. In addition to another chorus, professional singers, as well as an orchestra will be added to the choir. Combining both choruses, Nguyen estimates that there will be about 200 people singing.

The Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity will partner with Chipotle Mexican Grill of Hicksville in an all-day charity event on Dec. 9, designed to combat childhood cancer and diseases.
“Fifty percent of TKE-referred patrons’ meal costs [on Dec. 9] will be given to our fraternity, and in turn, be used to cover basic chapter fees, but most importantly to St. Jude’s Children Hospital,” said Nicholas Brailovskiy, the president of the TKE chapter on campus.
“We are always trying to give back to the community,” Inderjit said. “TKE helps by bringing in sales, and in turn they raise money [for their chapter] and donate those proceeds to their organization [St. Jude’s].”
Like other Greek life organizations, members of TKE must cover ‘dues’, which include: annual membership fees, risk management fees, off-campus housing fees, and chapter assessment fees.
Mohammed Hassan, a senior finance major and TKE’s treasurer stressed the importance of his fraternity’s philanthropy by citing the three key pillars of TKE’s pledge of brotherhood. “At the end of the day, it really comes down to our three core beliefs: charity, love, and esteem,” Hassan said. “As a non-profit organization, we obviously have to cover basic TKE chapter fees, but once all that is covered; we really go all out for St. Jude’s.” While donation totals may vary from event to event, TKE strives to contribute 80-85 percent of its charitable earnings to St. Jude’s, according to Hassan.
TKE holds four to five charitable events each semester for St. Jude’s. Its most recent charitable events were the first annual ‘Pumpkin Smash Fundraiser’ on Oct. 27 and the St. Jude’s Brooklyn Bridge walk on Sept. 26. According to Hassan, these unconventional ways of donating to charity do a great job at engaging Post’s student body. “The more we can help give back to the community, the better, and that’s why we hope we can get as many people to Chipotle Dec. 9 as possible!” Hassan said.
This will be TKE’s final of four fundraisers of the fall semester. “We don’t take this lightly. Childhood Cancer and disease affects all and sadly the less fortunate and most vulnerable. That’s why we donate. That’s what this is all about,” Hassan said.

As we inch closer to a Donald Trump presidency, many students seem to have more questions than answers; people simply want an idea of what the administration of this controversial candidate will be like. Three of our Political Science professors weighed in on what we may expect.
Q-What effect do you think Donald Trump will have on trade, and how do you foresee him interacting with the current US trade partners?

A-“I think we will see moderation, I think TPP* is dead. The consequences of TPP going away will not help us with the politics of Asia. This is the one area where presumably [Trump] has his strengths, so I hope there will be improvements here.”
  -Michael Soupios, professor of political science
*TPP: the Trans-Pacific Trade agreement among twelve countries, including the U.S., located around the Pacific. Read more at ustr.gov/tpp.
Q-How do you foresee the Supreme Court nomination process going under a Donald Trump presidency and what is at stake with this nomination?
A-“I think Trump cares little about the judiciary, aside from how it handles the multitude of lawsuits still pending against him. So he’ll delegate authority over selection to either Vice-President-elect Pence or Senate conservatives. As for impact, replacing Antonin Scalia with a fellow conservative means that the Supreme Court won’t shift leftward, as it would have done if Merrick Garland had been confirmed or the election had gone differently. But liberals will be able to hold their ground on any issue where they can garner Anthony Kennedy’s vote. The greater shift would come if another vacancy were to emerge because one of the liberal justices left office. I’m expecting that they won’t be leaving voluntarily.”
                                                                                                       -Jeremy Buchman, professor of political science
Q-Students are concerned that a Trump presidency will mean more war in the Middle East. Do you think Donald Trump would hesitate to deploy more US soldiers to the Middle East?
A-“Trump’s chosen foreign policy and national security advisers, [and] his tough talk about America’s power, suggest that he believes in using force. Upon assuming office, he will have to deal with a host of complex national security challenges: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, radical jihadists, Iran’s expanding influence across the Gulf and the Arab East, North Korea, Putin’s threats in the Baltics and in Europe. And if Trump doesn’t form and listen to a team of Cabinet members and advisers who know about the Middle East and don’t look at it through the lens of enmity to Islam, he will be unable to formulate a clear Middle East policy and a larger U.S. strategy. Trump may be averse to use the ‘big stick’ sparingly and without hard thinking. But if he acts on the anti-Muslim statements of his campaign, if he shares Michael Flynn’s assertion that Islam is an infectious ‘cancer’ and Steve Bannon’s rejection of a multicultural, multi-ethnic society, if he follows policies, and endorses and doesn’t silence pronouncements that make Muslims all across the board feel that they are the hated enemy, he will be embracing the grim vision expressed by the Venetian nationalist demagogue in Michael Dibdin’s novel, Dead Lagoon: ‘Unless We Have What We Are Not, We Cannot Love What We Are.’ And this will isolate America and drag her into a clash of cultures and cultural identities fraught with military entanglements.”
-Muhammad Muslih, professor of political science
Q-Students of the LBGTQ community are concerned that their rights will now be endangered. Can you give these students any assurance and how do you foresee a Donald Trump presidency affecting this already disenfranchised community?

A-“Campaign rhetoric plays to the base, but it’s all different when it comes time to govern. I suspect this administration will not be a friend [to the LBGTQ community]. I don’t think at the end of the day there will be any rollback, status quo I suspect will be it.”
-Michael Soupios, professor of political science
Q-Do you believe Donald Trump will pose a threat to women’s rights and the rights of disenfranchised communities?
A-“Yes. Not personally per se, but through his appointments to executive and judicial positions. Obama had done much to shift the lower courts leftward, and even a wave of Trump appointees won’t entirely offset that. But the executive bureaucracy has a great deal of power, and much of it can be deployed in nefarious ways without attracting public attention.”
-Jeremy Buchman, professor of political science
Q-How can Donald Trump improve foreign relations with Israel and do you think he will?
A-“On Israel, so far Trump has been circumspect and cautious, either because he might be thinking that he wants to avoid taking positions that might compromise future efforts he has in mind to broker a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, or because he could be interested in working with Israel on what is in his mind the more important issues of fighting ISIS and reversing or modifying the Iran nuclear deal. And regardless of what Trump really thinks about how to correct Obama’s frayed relationship with Israel, this relationship is too deep and too multidimensional to weaken or fail.”
-Muhammad Muslih, professor of political science

After 38 years of teaching art at the university level, 23 of which were at Long Island University, Professor Neill Slaughter has decided to make this fall semester his last, but he does not plan on ending his art career.
Slaughter has had many accomplishments throughout his career, including 30 art exhibitions and art collections featured around the world, inaugurating an art program in the Duke of Northumberland’s castle in England, and many fellowship trips to places including India, the African continent, and England.
After studying in Georgia and Indiana, Slaughter went on to teach at universities in Philadelphia, Minnesota, and California before making his way to Long Island.
It was a break from school and a trip to Europe after the death of a friend that made Slaughter realize his passion for art, and knowing what he wanted to do with his life. “Once I went around all of those museums, and I saw a lot of these great masterpieces that I had seen in my art history classes, I came back suddenly focused,” Slaughter said. “Here today. Perhaps gone tomorrow. Better pursue what you have a passion for.”
Slaughter said he likes to “practice what I preach,” and as a professor, he has taken many students on short “introductory” trips to various locations in Europe, including Turkey, Italy, France, Scotland, and the Netherlands.
“I have found that the students who accompany me on these trips come back really fired up,” he said. “They want to go into the studio and do something new based on what they saw abroad.”
The history of art and the actual creation of art seem to go hand-in-hand for Slaughter. For example, in one of his current classes, he gave his students information about Paul Cézanne, who is known as the father of abstract art, before they started their own abstract projects.
In his art career, ties can be made between some of his own work and the work of Thomas Moran. As he explained, Moran was an artist in the late 19th century, whose paintings of the Western landscape helped lead to the preservation of the land and the creation of Yellowstone National Park.
Some of Slaughter’s early work also portrays social issues of today. His collection entitled Africa America Amalgamation is meant go against what is typically seen as civilized and uncivilized.
“I love sharing my enthusiasm for art,” Slaughter explained when describing his favorite part of teaching. He said that he has enjoyed his time as an artist and teacher and that he is grateful that he “lives to work” instead of “working to live.”
As for life after retirement, Slaughter said he is considering teaching one or two classes at Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, where he resides, but he plans to focus on drawing and painting in his two home studios full-time.
He is also very excited to have time to visit his daughter in San Francisco, and travel to places around the world that he has yet to see.

Dr. Cheryl Halliburton is in her final semester as a Post faculty member. After 24 and-a-half years of working as a faculty member in the Department of Theater, Dance & Arts Management, and a co-director of the Post Concert Dance Company, Halliburton will be retiring in December.
Halliburton began her career at Post as an adjunct faculty member, teaching African dance technique. She was offered a full time position five years later, in 1992, when the jazz class was in need of an instructor.
Halliburton worked alongside then-colleague Nancy Brier to create the Post Concert Dance Company in 1996. PCDC, which is now a company strictly for dance majors, was originally put together for students on campus who enjoyed dancing but could not study it. Students would audition to become members and participate in various performances such as free impromptu performances around campus.
The success of PCDC inspired the creation of a dance major, a project that Halliburton spearheaded with her department chairperson, Dr. Cara Gargano.
The new major meant new classes, most of which Halliburton took on. She has taught African, Beginning Movement, Dance 101, and Current Dance in New York. She has also helped Director of Dance, Davyd H. Suber, Jr., with the dance major company class on Fridays.
Alyssa Navas, a senior dance major who transferred from Nassau Community College’s dance program in fall 2015, has taken many of Halliburton’s classes.
“Cheryl helped me become a more knowledgeable and well-rounded dancer,” Navas said. “[Her African class] helped familiarize me with not only African dance, but the culture as well, both of which I hadn’t had exposure to before.”
In addition to being an educator, Halliburton has continued to further her knowledge. In 2012, she began writing a dissertation, “Reengaging Disengaged Adolescent Students Through Dance: A Case Study.”
During the spring semester of 2015, Halliburton took a sabbatical to continue her dissertation research. The research took her to England, France, and South Africa, where she was able to experience three very different cultures. She took this past summer to complete her dissertation.
The decision to retire comes from the importance of change. “When you do the same thing for so long, you forget there’s other things out there,” Halliburton said. Though she loves working with the dancers of the Post Concert Dance Company, she feels the department is in need of “fresh blood.”
Following the overdue sleep that has been put off, Halliburton looks forward to traveling and exploring life outside of her 24-year routine. Down the line, Halliburton believes her inspirations will take her to create a community arts center for adolescents that will include the visual and performing arts.
“For the first time I’m not making a firm plan. I’m just going to open up the possibilities,” she said.
In preparation for her departure, the Department of Theater, Dance & Arts Management has been interviewing potential candidates to fill her shoes. Halliburton is willing to help ease the transition for the new faculty hire once the decision is made.
Suber who has worked alongside Halliburton as she has co-directed PCDC, expressed the sentiments of many who will miss Halliburton’s contribution on campus.
“Cheryl has been the foundation of this department and company for its existence,” Suber said. “Cheryl, being the co-creator of the company, has created a very strong legacy that will be hard to match.”
As for the dancers, Halliburton wants to make sure they never give up or push aside any opportunity that comes their way. “Don’t blow off any classes or opportunities; you don’t know where you will be in 10 years.” Halliburton reminds her students that their opportunities are endless and Halliburton is ready to experience new ones herself.
