Lucid Motors(LCID) 
The electric vehicle industry is exploding, and Lucid Motors is no exception. CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson was previously the VP of engineering at Tesla, and was also the head engineer of the Tesla Model S. After working high up under Elon Musk, Rawlinson moved onto Lucid in 2013, and is now the main man on the business and tech side of one of Tesla’s top potential competitors. Lucid has jumped nearly 100%, almost doubling in one month, and now sits at $44 a share with a market cap of $72 Billion. Lucid is still yet to sell cars on the road, but have been test driving the Lucid Air and Lucid Air Dream, with all of their production models sold out. These units should be given to the public by early next year, as well as 20,000 additional units manufactured, sold, and put on the road.
Coinbase(COIN)
With the Crypto market cap eclipsing over $3 trillion, the top exchange in the world is seeing the benefits. As Bitcoin and other cryptos eclipse all time highs, more people are looking to get in on the action. After fluctuating back and forth since its IPO on April 14, Coinbase is up over 50% in a little over a month, now listed at $357 a share, with a market cap of $93 Billion. 
Visa(V)
On the other hand, Visa has been taking a tumble it’s all-time-high over the summer. However, this does not seem to be something worth stressing over for shareholders, as retail and blue chip stocks have their down quarters every once in a while. We saw quick rebounds for Visa during the pandemic when people got back to work, and continued to use credit as interest rates went down tremendously last fall. Visa is trading at $213 a share, with a market cap of $465 Billion. 
Litecoin(LTC)
As previously mentioned, the crypto industry is soaring, and the hype around alt-coins(alternatives to Bitcoin) is going up with time and knowledge of the sector. Litecoin is one of the oldest alt-coins with a strong backing and history. Litecoin is up nearly 45% in the past week alone, and is stretching towards its all-time-high of $412. After taking a tumble in May, we have seen slow steady growth up to $266, and a market cap of $19 Billion. The longevity and consistency of Litecoin looks to be good long term.

Students began protesting the university’s decision to freeze various art majors on Thursday, Oct. 28. The protests take place outside the East Gate on Northern Blvd. on select dates.
Many students made signs in support of arts programs at Post, and advocated for the continuation of their majors. Some students play their instruments to garner the attention of cars passing by the university gates.
The recent freezing of dance, arts administration, music education and art therapy follow years of consecutive freezing of other majors in the college of liberal arts and sciences.
“The music education program at Post is extremely well-developed and has been in existence since the 1960s,” senior music education major Julia Bremer said. “The faculty at Post in the music department is beyond what anybody could ask for. They are dedicated. They spend hours upon hours dedicating their time to helping us. The professors are helping shape me into who I am. They prepare me to be a musician and an educator at the same exact time.”
Students at the protest all reiterated the same point: they are shocked that their majors have been frozen and hope for clarity and assistance from administration.
“I am devastated and heartbroken that a school that had such an amazing reputation for [the arts] is being throwing [these majors] out the window all of a sudden … It’s not right,” Bremer said.
Other students agree that these programs are important to the university.
“The majority of our classes have more than ten people and are able to run. There’s really no logical reason why they are freezing this program,” senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said.
Students held signs that read “Fight for the arts” and “Save the arts”, echoing memories of the save the arts movement in the mid 2000s. 
“A lot of people on campus don’t know that these majors are frozen. Our job here is to educate the campus on what’s going on and the way that [administration has] treated us recently,” Sottung said.
Bremer and Sottung hope that by raising awareness to this issue, students in and outside of the arts programs will advocate and fight for the future of these programs.
University officials headed down to the East Gate to talk with students after hearing about the first protest, and the students were able to express their concerns and issues with the freezing of majors. Sottung said that the school officials told her that they will work to get the students answers about why these majors have been frozen.
Students are upset with the cuts, and argue that their enrollment is not a problem and therefore, no cuts should have been made.
“Truly, our enrollment was growing. We are a small number, but there are about 50 of us, not 10. Classes were still being filled,” junior music education major Annie Rodriguez said.
Students feel betrayed by the university for these decisions.
“They ask us to sing here. They ask us to perform here for LIU and represent LIU. I dont think it’s fair if they’re going to use us for what we do here and then throw us out,” Rodriguez said.
Speculation is also growing among students about the future of the theatre arts program, as well as the university.
“[I think that the university is] also planning on turning this school into a trade school. They’re planning on getting rid of all the arts, so theatre is included in that,” Rodriguez said.
So far, these claims are just speculation by some students. Administration has not made any announcements regarding the future of the theatre arts majors, nor about transitioning from being a liberal arts school to a trade school.
Students also say that they have the chance to keep the enrollment in these programs high.
“We have a bunch of ways to recruit people [for our programs],” Sottung said. “We’re actually going to perform in New Orleans in May. There’s plenty of opportunities for us to go out there and recruit these students. There’s a lot of students interested in coming into the music education program, but unfortunately it’s frozen at this time.”
Students still await answers from administration about their futures at the university, as well as the future of their programs. More information will be provided by The Tide as the story develops and administration comments on the frozen majors.

Scorpios are born from Oct. 23. to Nov. 21. It is the most common sign of the zodiac, having the highest frequency of birth in the United States at 9.6 percent. This is almost 50 percent higher than the rarest sign Aquarius, with 6.3 percent of births.
Scorpio is a water sign, sharing its element with sister signs Cancer and Pisces. Scorpios are represented by the scorpion. They are known for their reputation of being dark and mysterious, as well as closed off.
“Yeah. They’re fine. I’ve known only three scorpios. One was a weird kid in middle school who I was friends with. The other was my friend’s ex-boyfriend. One is a girl I met in college who became one of my first friends in college. I have no ill will towards any of them. I’m pretty neutral. They are pretty normal people,” sophomore English major Jay Ebhomielen, a Leo, said.
Many people say that scorpios are passionate people. This passion is expressed in good and bad ways.
Scorpios are most compatible with fellow water signs Cancer and Pisces, as well as earth signs Capricorn and Virgo. Scorpios are least compatible with air signs Gemini and Aquarius, and fire sign Leo.
Scorpios have also produced the most American Presidents of any sign. John Adams, James K. Polk, Warren G. Harding, James Garfield, Theodore Roosevelt, and Joe Biden were all born during this season. 
Scorpio was tied with Aquarius for most presidents until the election of incumbent president Joe Biden, a November scorpio.
Astrology social media accounts are all the buzz nowadays. TikTok is full of zodiac sign jokes and memes, with people poking fun at the signs. These jokes usually make Pisces, Gemini, and you guessed it, Scorpio. 
“We don’t suck, we just get a bad reputation for no reason. Just because we are intense, it doesn’t mean we are mean. I feel like when we are passionate, it is perceived as being overbearing and controlling,” junior journalism and theatre arts major Alyssa Spagna said.
Instagram is full of zodiac sign jokes, as well as serious horoscope posts for each sign.
Astrology fashion is also becoming trendy now. Shein.com is selling zodiac sign rings for only $1.50. 
“I always find myself surrounded by sagittarians,” Spagna said.
Scorpio and Sagittarius are not compatible signs, arguing the validity of astrology.
Zodiac compatibility states that air signs (Aquarius, Libra, Gemini) are compatible with each other and fire signs (Leo, Aries, and Sagittarius), and that earth signs (Capricorn, Taurus, and Virgo) are compatible with each other and water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces).
Scorpio is the most common zodiac sign, which could contribute to them having such a prevalent reputation. Or maybe it could just be Scorpio season falling nine months after Valentine’s Day.

     On Friday, Oct. 29, The Post Theatre Company (PTC) gave the first of 5 performances – spread over the course of the weekend – of “The Laramie Project.” Directed by Gabriel Vega Weissman, the show featured 20 performers portraying more than 60 characters; each actor inhabiting multiple characters.
“The Laramie Project is a show based on true events. The show was created in response to the brutal murder of Matthew Shephard, a 21-year-old college student, in Laramie, Wyoming. The play was created by the Tectonic Theater Project, and was first performed in February 2000. Tectonic went to Laramie [and] conducted  over 200 interviews [with the] goal of collect[ing] the testimonies of the people living there,” read the dramaturgical note by junior musical theater major Liv Magaraci. The transcripts of these interviews were transformed into the play “The Laramie Project.”
Twenty years after its first performance, “The Laramie Project,” and the concepts and conversations it highlights, still hold significance in today’s society.
“It is a play about people and community and how life affects a community and the many different dimensions to community. […] I think it’s a conversation of listening not to react […] Listening to understand and speaking to be understood. Focusing on empathy is a major theme of the story,” junior musical theatre major Saffron Cooper, who plays the roles of Zubaida Ula, Anonymous friend of Aaron McKinney, Tiffany Edwards, Lucy Thompson and Email Writer in the show said.
Other members of the cast shared similar thoughts on the importance of the theme of community in the play.
“I think it’s trying to get people to talk about a hope for change and this idea that we need to come together; that community is stronger than anything,” senior musical theater major Devin Butera, who plays the roles of Doc O’Connor, Matt Mickelson, Conrad Miller, Russell Henderson and Juror in the show, said.
Playing multiple characters in one play and making them distinguishable from each other, without any wardrobe or makeup changes is no easy feat. The actors had a lot to say on this challenge and how they overcame it.
“It makes the show fascinating. It requires physicalizing differences; changing body stance and voice and speaking patterns. [..] The narrators help in translating to the audience what’s happening. […] The Tectonic Theatre Project did a great job of capturing differences between characters in writing. This helped me become more texted oriented as an actor. Empathy is very important. Removing judgement is the only way you can make your character a real person. It takes digging and really listening to the page,” Cooper said.
“The Laramie Project” deals with heavy subject matter as the gruesome details of Matthew Shephard’s murder are recounted in the play and the raw emotions of members of the Laramie community are vividly portrayed by the actors. The actors shared their thoughts on the importance of the play and others like it that explore complex, dense and important concepts. 
“I think material like this is important and has a really strong impact if done correctly. Would love to put myself into projects that are raising awareness for change. All artists are trying to use their art to make beautiful change,” Butera said.
However, fully immersing oneself in the world of a play that deals with such heavy subject matter is not an easy job for actors. The actors in the show shared their thoughts on what is required of them to transform into their characters and how they prevent it all from being too taxing on their mental health.
“I’m required to bring who I am as a person and my life experiences to the table. I have to relate circumstances and the sensation of those experiences and allow them to come into the character. We have to allow openness to what’s happening, it can be overwhelming but, we have to live in it. […] I can’t shut myself down and try to control everything or it wouldn’t be a truthful performance,” Cooper said.
Butera connected his body and mind to the text in order to stay grounded during this show. 
“I take a lot of the words and put actions into the lines; connecting them to my body physically and trying to find intention in the lines. A lot of personal sourcing was required to put myself into the same headspace my character is in, but not to a point of distress where it becomes overwhelming and I can’t work,” Butera said.
As important as it is for the actors to transform into their characters, stepping out of that world and giving themselves time to unwind is equally important.
“At the end of the day it’s acting. […] You have to have a level of desensitization. Just as you allow yourself to feel, you have to be objective and say this is a real thing that happened but, we have to move forward. It’s exhausting to relive it every night but you need to put as much energy to get yourself out of it or you’ll go to a dark place,” Cooper said.
The actors have also credited director Weissman with a key role in getting the best performances out of them and cultivating a safe and professional space.
“The way the director sets up the space, he sets a very safe, warm environment for everyone. […] He gave actors time to process what was going on.” Butera said.
Though challenging, being in the play has been a rewarding experience for the actors.
“It’s been a great exercise in faith in the process […] Experiencing and seeing this all first hand has greatly evolved how I view the work we do here. […] Exploring theater as a vehicle for change and being able to live it. It’s helped me become a stronger, more understanding artist and made me more empathetic,” Cooper said. 
Butera has discovered much about himself through the process as well. 
“I have developed my own awesome and articulate process for dealing with text, especially heavy text. I’ve gained so much knowledge on how I work in a play environment. […] I’ve developed a different perspective on the idea of community. It’s been a hectic but rewarding experience,” Butera said.
There is a lot to be learned from and understood about “The Laramie Project” and the actors shared their thoughts on the lessons of empathy and importance of community they hope audience members gain from their viewing experience of the play.
“It’s hard to gauge expectation as a creator […] and audience has different intentions of what they want. But my intention behind doing this play is that people see how the conversation isn’t black vs. white or gay vs. straight or liberal vs. conservative, it’s about being a human person and every person has both good and bad in them; we are all made of both light and darkness. It’s a spectrum; a sphere. We are not limited to one dimension of our beliefs and people are so much more complex than that.[…] Art exists to promote empathy in a world that is ever judgmental.” Cooper said.

The Student Body Boutique (SBB) hosted a fall festival that showcased student creators and campus organizations on Nov. 3 during common hour in Hillwood Commons. The festival had students selling clothing from their small businesses and a few student-run organizations that are raising funds for their club. Whether charitable or profitable, the students involved with The Fall Festival enjoyed their time interacting with the student body.
The Student Body Boutique is a student-run organization nestled into Hillwood behind the concierge counter and the ever-known Starbucks.The fall festival is an idea both brought up and brought to fruition by junior marketing major and vice president of public relations for the SBB, Emma Robinson.
“The fall festival exists due to the determination and brilliance of Emma,” sophomore finance major and creative director of the SBB, Emily Szalkowski, said. “This wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for Emma.”
The boutique hosted this event as a fun way to give back to the community on campus, and hosted it in a popular area of Hillwood to garner students’ attention.
“I was on my way to Starbucks, when I noticed the pastries and the cute pants,” senior musical theatre major Ricky Dobbs said. “I think it’d be super cool to experience something like this annually.” 
The fall festival had many eye-catchers. Attracting passersby within every few minutes. With the exposure and funds that they had received, the boutique and the organizations that participated in the festival are eager to set up a table once more in the near future.
“Eventually, I would love to host it twice a year. Especially in the spring,” Szalkowski said.
 Clubs at Post reacted exuberantly to the festival being held annually. 
“I definitely would like for it to happen annually. I think It’s a great opportunity to raise awareness for our cause,” vice president of the vet tech club and junior vet tech major Sarah Henderson said. “[The vet tech club is] tabling to fundraise and raise awareness for North Shore Animal League with cat and dog baskets.”
Since it is a brand new function and this past Wednesday was essentially the first event of its kind, constructive criticism from students is crucial for the SBB.
“I think this whole thing is amazing, but I will admit that I would like to see more options [for vendors],” Dobbs said.

Toy companies have nearly always used gender to market their products. From the original Barbie in 1959 to Hot Wheels in 1968, it is standard practice for companies to target a specific gender and to stereotype these genders.
California state Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill mandating stores that exceed an employee headcount of 500 to include a section of toys that is gender-neutral. This mandate will affect department stores such as Walmart and Target, and includes toys and “childcare items”, but not clothing. 
Students believe that the mandate is a positive change for California, and hope that more states, like New York, will also mandate similar protocols.
“I think it will [have an impact on the generations growing up],” sophomore environmental studies Noah Perez said. “My generation might see it as different because what they see as different is what they don’t know. We are the stepping stone between the younger and the older generation. I think this is a good thing for California because to have the option of gender neutral toys gives people the option to choose.”
Graduate student Johnathan Rentes agrees with Perez.
​“Genderless toys shouldn’t have any type of problem or implication on the child’s future. There is bias when it comes to certain toys [that they] should be made only for boys and certain toys should only be made for girls,” he said. “I think psychologically it may have an impact, due to the fact that it allows for say borderless playing . . . it will definitely merge the boys and girls together when it comes to playing, instead of boys only playing with these types of toys and girls only playing with these types of toys. It will create a type of uniformism.”
​​​One of the effects displayed with having gender-marketed toys is that it creates a preset of rules that the children are subconsciously influenced by; boys wear blue, like dinosaurs, play with race cars, etc. The stereotyping of toys translates into the stereotyping of people, not giving them a chance to learn their own preferences, and excluding any other types of thinking.
“If they have toys for kids that are genderless, it might open the eyes of the past generations,” Perez said. “I think it will[ have an impact on the generations growing up]. My generation might see it as different because what they see as different is what they don’t know. We are the stepping stone between the younger and the older generation. I think this is a good thing for California because to have the option of gender neutral toys gives people the option to choose.”

For almost 52 years, “Sesame Street” has been at the forefront of children’s television, and is seen as one of the most influential shows of this generation. 
The popular children’s television show has been entertaining and educating young children for over half a century, and continues to make new episodes to this day. 
While “Sesame Street” has been widely successful, few people have heard of it’s successor that debuted a little over 50 years ago, “The Electric Company.” 
Children’s Television Workshop (CTW), which is now known as Sesame Workshop, produced the first season of “Sesame Street” in 1969. The goal of the show was simple: create an educational show for the disadvantaged youth between the ages of 3-5. 
During the 1970’s, there was a wide disparity in education, and CTW sought to help lower class children through “Sesame Street”. 
In its early years, “Sesame Street” was a success, which led CTW to create a new show to help reach an older audience, “The Electric Company”. 
The goal of “The Electric Company” remained the same as its predecessor, but the show was tailored to elementary school students who had difficulty reading. 
At this time, the federal government was invested in the issue of underprivileged education, which led CTW to get the grant money necessary to fund both projects. 
Dr. Barbara Fowles, a communications and film professor at Post, was a researcher for “The Electric Company,” and played an influential role in helping to create the show. 
After graduating from Yeshiva University with a doctorate in developmental psycholinguistics, Fowles was hired as one of the lead researchers for the show. Her job was to essentially gain information about the show’s effectiveness, and advise the writers, producers, and actors. 
When discussing her work, she recalled the strenuous task of testing the show on children.  
“[My research team] went to public schools in Manhattan to try and get to as diverse neighborhoods as we could,” she said. “We watched them view it and asked questions. We then went to the writers and producers and explained what parts that they didn’t understand and offered suggestions.” 
After gauging the effectiveness of the show on children, Fowles described what she believed was a “battle”; critiquing and advising the show’s writers. 
“There was only one woman, and the rest were guys who wanted to be funny. I had to remind them they are little kids, and that you can’t make these jokes because they won’t get them,” she said. “It was difficult because they often didn’t get it. A couple of times, we dragged writers to these schools, so they could see these little kids, who often didn’t have breakfast, didn’t sleep, and weren’t well cared for. They had to realize what they were dealing with.”
Following all of that behind the scenes work, the show finally aired in October 1971, and featured a lot of celebrities. Although most only made an appearance on a few episodes, famous actors such as Morgan Freeman and Bill Cosby were heavily involved in the show’s production. 
“The Electric Company” was successful early on, winning two Emmy’s and airing on over 250 TV stations nationwide. Utilizing a blend of creative graphics, animation, and clever humour, the show was truly ahead of its time, and gained viewership as time went on. 
However, “The Electric Company”’s time on air was short lived. After 780 episodes in 6 years, CTW had to make the decision to cancel the show at the height of its popularity. While this came as a surprise to many at the time, the reasoning behind it’s cancellation was quite simple: money.
By 1977, the government lost interest in the projects and stopped funding the CTW. With only enough capital to continue one of the shows, CTW made the obvious decision of putting all of their resources towards “Sesame Street,” as it was more popular and possessed the “product opportunities” that made them a lot of money. 
“You can’t make a Morgan Freeman doll the way you could make products for the “Sesame Street” characters,” Fowles said.
In the years following the cancellation, “The Electric Company” lived on through re-runs and a few paperback books until the 1990’s. While the show didn’t run for very long, Fowles believes the impact of the show can still be seen today. 
“I believe [“The Electric Company”] had an impact on some of the shows you see now on PBS, especially “Blues Clues”, which was very influenced by it,” she states. “I think both “The Electric Company” and “Sesame Street” laid the groundwork for education in children’s shows, and it is hard to separate their impact.”
Clearly, “The Electric Company” had a tremendous impact on the future of children’s television. But what about it’s impact while on air? 
Based on research by the Educational Testing Service’s in 1977, the show was found to be “an effective instructional supplement” for children. 
Contrary to these findings, after reflecting on it’s influence over the last few decades, Fowles believes that the show failed to reach its target audience; the underprivileged youth. However, she found that the show heavily resonated with another, unexpected audience. 
“We later found that upper and middle class kids who were really smart and had a good sense of humour loved it, and so now there is a whole group of people in their 40s and 50s who were big fans and think it was the best thing ever,” she said. “Obviously that wasn’t who we meant to reach, but they were the ones who got the jokes and really enjoyed it.”While “The Electric Company” is often forgotten when discussing the history of children’s television, the show had a tremendous influence on the industry. Through the hard work of Fowles and the entire team at CTW, “The Electric Company” will forever be remembered as one of the pioneers of education in children’s television.

       Apple released the new MacBook Pro powered by brand new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips – the first pro chips designed for the Mac, on Oct. 18. This product is unrivaled and is among the strongest lineups of pro notebooks ever made.
         The performance of the new MacBook Pro is unmatched. The new features include longer battery life, Liquid Retina XDR display, a wide range of ports for advanced connectivity, a 1080p FaceTime HD camera and a top-rated audio system. Models come in 14 or 16-inch sizes with prices at $1,999 and $2,499.
         “The new MacBook Pro simply has no equal and is by far the best pro notebook we’ve ever built,” Apple’s senior vice president of marketing Greg Joswiak said in a news release.
         So far, customers are ecstatic about the features and capability of the new super-powered device. It has an almost retro exterior, but offers something new on the inside for consumers. The features most talked about are the crisp displays, battery life and overall improvement of the M1 chips. The MagSafe charger is also making a return along with USB-C, SDXC and HDMI ports added on. Apple is fond of changing charging ports, but this device allows for more than one type to be used. Now that video meetings and calls are more popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the camera on the MacBook is sharper than ever. The days of using 720p are over now that this laptop offers 1080p.
         Senior sports marketing major Ashlee Garrett is a fan of the new computers.
 “I have always used Apple products and the specs of the new MacBook Pro look incredible,” she said. “They really created a unique device for all users. I am looking into buying one – how could anyone say no to this level of masterpiece?” 
Students believe that Apple continues to improve the features among their technology products, and that’s why they keep buying the new releases. 
“This new laptop really changes the game, even for students. I think the camera improvement is a huge bonus given that most people participate in video chats. As a whole, the new upgrades make it untouchable,” junior accounting major Juliana DeLeon said.

Tragedy struck the set of “Rust” on Oct. 16. where a freak accident occured in the filming of a scene that called for the use of a prop gun. The gun, later found to have had live ammunition in it, was fired when Alec Baldwin accidentally shot two on set staff. 
Acting director on set at the time of the incident, Joel Souza, was injured, but will be making a recovery. The other victim, cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, was fatally wounded by the gun shot. 
Although the firing of the gun was a mistake, investigations are still ongoing surrounding the unanswered questions. 
The set armorer is critical to movies that feature weapons; they are personally responsible for the storage, distribution, and maintenance of all on set weapons. On set guns must always be checked by the armorer, who in the case of “Rust”, was 24-year-old Hannah Reed. The gun given to Alec Baldwin, was left unchecked before the incident occured. 
“I don’t think that should be a thing on movie sets, where real [weapons] are used to film a scene. If there’s always a possibility of having no blanks in a gun, I think that it should be regulated,”  sophomore nursing major Keeran Thomas said. “There are definitely some fishy parts about it.”
Hannah’s defense team released the following statement;“Ultimately, this set would never have been compromised if live ammo had not been introduced. Hannah had no idea where the live rounds came from. . . Hannah was hired for two positions on set, which made it extremely difficult to focus on her job as armorer. She fought for training days, days to maintain weapons and proper time to prepare for gunfire, but ultimately was overruled by production. . . The whole production set became unsafe due to various factors, including a lack of safety meetings.”
“[Alec Baldwin] could have checked it himself,” freshman nursing major Gabby Norris said.
Reed was only one of the many variables that stand out in why the gun was loaded when Baldwin used it. However, Baldwin may have multiple accounts of contribution to the death of Hutchins, both on a physical and executive scale.
Physically, the method of drawing the gun from the holster Baldwin used, known as the “cross-draw”, where the subject draws the gun from the holster opposite to the side of the hand drawing, has been known to be especially dangerous for the amount of area the gun sees before seeing the actual target. 
This, along with breaking “every single rule of basic firearm safety that exists,” (according to the president of Gun Owner of Vermont), has presented reasons to hold Baldwin accountable alongside Reed.
The case has led to a reassessment of the standards placed on movie sets in regards to gun safety, inspiring ideas to reform the current laws.
“In government, we have checks and balances, where things have to go through many people to get something approved, so maybe they can have multiple people checking it over. Maybe have law enforcement checking it over,” Norris said.
The shooting has inspired celebrities like Dwayne Johnson and Angelina Jolie to speak on the issue.
“I can’t speak for anyone else, but I can tell you, without an absence of clarity here, that any movie that we have moving forward with Seven Bucks Productions — any movie, any television show, or anything we do or produce — we won’t use real guns at all,” Johnson said in an interview with Variety.
This story is ongoing. Baldwin and Reed are awaiting trials, and Baldwin has said that he will financially compensate the families of the deceased, as well as pay for all funeral expenses.

The 2021 MLB season came to an end on Tuesday, Nov. 2, when the Atlanta Braves defeated the Houston Astros 7-0 in Game 6 of the World Series. 
The Braves, who only won 88 games in the regular season, had the fewest wins of any playoff team but still won the NL East with a six-game lead over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
The Braves also went the entire playoffs without their star outfielder, Ronald Acuna Jr, who had 24 home runs in just 82 regular-season games with a .990 OPS before tearing his ACL on July.10 while trying to field a line drive in a game against the Miami Marlins. 
Junior digital art and design major Anthony Hines was very excited for this year’s playoffs. 
“The playoffs this year we’re exciting. We had historic matchups and a thrilling World Series. One of my favorite moments had to be watching Braves’ shortstop Dansby Swanson make the play for the final out of the first World Series championship for Atlanta In 26 Years,” he said. 
Hines was looking forward to seeing the matchup between two incredible infielders for the World Series teams. 
“I was extremely excited to see Freddie Freeman and Carlos Correa, two of the most dynamic players in our game,” he said. 
The Los Angeles Dodgers won the NL Wild card with 106 wins, one short of the San Francisco Giants, who won a franchise-record 107 games. The Dodgers Defeated the St.Louis Cardinals in the NL Wild Card and then matched up with the Giants in the NLDS, marking two of the best teams competing to move on and make their incredible regular seasons worth more. 
However, after the Dodgers defeated the Giants to move on in the NLCS, the Braves beat the Dodgers in six games to move on into the World Series. 
Hines believes the outcome these playoff matchups lead to will be one to remember. 
“This postseason was one of the more interesting ones, especially with the NLCS because most of us expected the Dodgers to steamroll Atlanta,” he said. 
As a Yankees fan, Hines is very pleased with the Astros elimination after all the allegations they’ve faced since their sign-stealing scandal came to light after the 2019 World Series. 
“I think I can speak for most baseball fans when I say that any day that the Astros lose is a good day, especially since they are essentially now the most hated team in baseball thanks to the recent cheating scandal,” he said.
After the Yankees fell in the Wild Card game, Hines believes that they will be looking to add some pieces this offseason to improve next year. 
“I think we’ll see a lot of free agent movement and big plays by GM’s. I say this because there are teams that are going to be desperate to add, trade, and add again to do whatever is necessary to win,” he said. “The Yankees are among these teams that will be vying for top shortstop’s Carlos Correa and Corey Seager. I expect to see a lot of free agent moves as the winter meetings nears.”
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher was shocked by a lot of outcomes throughout October. 
“Overall, the MLB playoffs we’re really unpredictable for the first time in a while. With the Red Sox beating the Yankees and the Dodgers losing, the real favorites were gone,” he said. 
Boettcher was happy for Braves’ 1B Freddie Freeman, who, after 12 years in the league with Atlanta, finally got his first World Series ring. 
Boettcher was not a fan of either team due to the Braves being a rival of the Mets, and the Astros confirmed to have stolen the 2017 World Series. 
“Personally, as a Mets fan, it hurt to root for either of the Braves or Astros, but I had a slight bias towards the Astros due to Alvarez and Greinke,” he said. 
Boettcher believes Astros’ Shortstop Carlos Correa will ask for more money in free agency due to his performance this season and in the playoffs. 
“As a result of these games, we know now Correa will get a real bag, much higher than the 5 years/160 million that was offered to him,” he said. “Along with that, it seems like there is a need for pitching everywhere, so I’d expect the trade market to be hot for players like Frankie Montas and Luis Castillo.”

LIU had a tough stretch early on in the season, but finally came through with back-to-back wins against Central Connecticut State University and Wagner College.
On Saturday, Oct.23, the Sharks came into the game with a record of 0-5, getting outscored 247-32 in those games. 
This all changed when the Sharks traveled to Central Connecticut to take on the Blue Devils, who won the Northeast Conference in 2019 while going undefeated in conference play. However, after sitting out the shortened spring season due to COVID-19, the Blue Devils have struggled early this year. Coming into the game, the Blue Devils were 1-5, with their only win coming against Wagner College. 
The Sharks cruised through the game before winning 30-13, finally eclipsing their first win of the season. 
It was a tough back and forth battle early on, with Sharks’ QB Camden Orth throwing an interception on their first drive and the Blue Devils leading 6-3 well into the second quarter. 
After the early struggles of both offenses, the Sharks would dominate the rest of the way. LIU scored 20 unanswered points, including touchdown passes from Camden Orth to Owen Glascoe and Derick Eugene. Paul Inzirello would also convert two field goals in between, including one from 47 yards. Inzerillo was named NEC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance. 
The Sharks would put the finishing touches on the Blue Devils with a 23-yard touchdown run from Kevin Wilson, putting the Sharks back up by two possessions with 1:46 remaining in the game. 
After all the struggles early on in the season, head coach Jonathan Gill was excited to finally get the team’s first win of the season. 
“I was happy for the players and the coaching staff. They’ve been working very hard, so it’s great for them to experience this success and see them celebrate after the game,” he said. 
The Sharks’ defense was firing on all cylinders, stopping the Blue Devils 12 out of 14 times on third down. Gill claimed it was only a matter of time before they all excelled together on that side of the ball. 
“They’re getting comfortable with slight adjustments and making things a little more simplified while playing fast with focus and confidence,” he said. “That will make you a tough opponent against anyone you play.”
The following week, on Saturday, Oct.30, the Sharks would defeat the Wagner College Seahawks 28-14. 
Both teams would swap scores two times each in the first half. LIU would get on the board first on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Camden Orth to Owen Glascoe. Later in the first quarter, the Seahawks would tie the game on a QB sneak into the endzone. 
There would not be another score until 3:20 left in the half when Orth would find Kevin Wilson for a 4-yard touchdown. After both teams went 3-and-out, Wagner started their drive at the LIU 44 yard line. 
In a matter of 27 seconds, Wagner would attain two rushes for 42 yards followed by another QB sneak into the endzone. 
However, the second half was all in the Sharks’ hands as they held Wagner scoreless the entire half, while the Sharks scored on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Derick Eugene and a 3-yard rushing touchdown for Jonathan Debique. 
Graduate student and Wide Receiver Derick Eugene has been one of the most reliable players throughout his years in the LIU football program. This year, he has five touchdowns, leading the Sharks. 
In an interview with WCWP’s Brendan Kaufman, Eugene claims consistency and preparation allow him to be at his best every game. 
“Being injured in 2019 and coming back, I was able to get better due to repetition and competing against guys every day,” he said. “Being out for a long time hurts because you have to get back into shape and get strong again faster and do it against other guys and not just by yourself.”
Eugene, along with all the veterans, believes making sure everyone else has the same vision as you is key to having a strong season and mentoring the underclassman for later on.
“I’m more of a lead by example guy going back to practice and competing and putting my best effort. There are other guys who lead us to our victory this weekend,” he said. “Having those guys around to hold myself accountable makes me better because I don’t want to let those guys down. We expect a lot from each other and want the whole team to celebrate a victory.”
Eugene stated the atmosphere throughout practice has been a key factor in the Sharks’ recent success. 
“Coach Gill talked a lot about confidence and toughness, and that was the energy going around that first week. We were much more focused in the morning before we even got to the field,” he said. 
Coach Gill had nothing but great things to say about Eugene’s leadership on and off the field. 
“I think Derick is a very passionate player. He practices hard, is very consistent and entails the qualities we like all of our players to embody,” he said. “It’s who he is as a person, and he’s very detail-oriented. Majority of the time, the lifestyle you live off the field is indicative of what kind of player you are. He prepares well and has a great sense of pride doing his job at a high level, and that carries over to the field.” 
The Sharks held the Seahawks to just 76 passing yards. Coach Gill continues to emphasize the success they’ve been seeing. 
“They’ve definitely improved a lot. The defense has gotten better every week and they’re doing their job at a higher level,” he said. “They’re playing more physical, they’re running to the ball, they’re tackling better, and the pass rush has gotten better, which helps out the pass defense.”
The Sharks did ultimately fall to Duquesne University this past Saturday, Nov.6. The Sharks lost 34-28, with it coming down to the last play of the game when the Sharks threw for a Hail Mary attempt which fell incomplete. 
Coach Gill believes that he and his team must finish out strong the rest of the way. 
“We can continue to do what we’ve been doing the whole season. We just have to stick to the plan and believe in it and fine-tune ourselves every day,” he said. 
The Sharks face Bryant University on Saturday, Nov.13 on the road.

Men’s hockey is one of the newest teams at LIU, as the program had its inaugural year during the shortened 2020-2021 season. In this opening season, the Sharks had a record of 3-10, and didn’t have a single home game. However, LIU has found its home this season at the Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow. 
After starting the 2021-2022 season on the road, the Sharks looked to snap their three-game losing streak in the first home game in the program’s history against Assumption College on Friday, Oct. 22. With fans, parents and other LIU student-athletes lining up to see their team play at home for the first time, junior hockey team player Brandon Perrone felt he was a part of history. 
“Being from Long Island, it was something I’ll never forget. To be able to be a part of history was awesome,” he said. “Playing in front of all my family and friends was such an amazing experience.”
The men’s hockey team used this home-field advantage, defeating the Assumption Greyhounds in a 7-0 blowout. Graduate forward Billy Jerry led the way with one goal and two assists, while senior forward Jordan Timmons scored two goals.
Freshman forward Isiah Fox, who also recorded an assist, felt that being at home helped give his team the needed boost to get their first win of the season. 
“Playing at home at Northwell was a super cool experience for all of us on the team,” he said. “The energy was unmatched, and it felt good having people cheering for us. I think the confidence boost was tremendous.”
Following the outstanding home opener, the Sharks looked to carry their momentum into their second home game against Post University the next day. In another one-sided contest, LIU was able to win their second consecutive game for the first time in program history by a score of 6-1. 
Graduate defender Carson Musser and senior forward Jordan Timmons had two goals each in the Sharks’ second home win of the season.
Goaltender Brandon Perrone, who earned his first win as a Shark in his 10 save performance against Post University, reflected on how important these home games were. 
“Having home games is always an advantage, especially when it’s the first time in program history,” he said. “I think everyone was very excited to play at home, and the energy from the crowd really helped.”
Fox agreed with Perrone, stating how much the fans helped fuel their two-game winning streak.
“The fans helped a lot throughout both games. The community has been waiting for some college hockey for years, and it was awesome being the first group to provide that for them,” he said.
Following two impressive wins, both Fox and Perrone are looking forward to building a culture and taking on big schools. 
“I am looking forward to playing more home games and also beating some of the top nationally-ranked schools in college hockey,” Perrone said. “I think we have a great group of guys who can do it. I’m excited to see what the future holds.”
Fox went on to add that there is so much more to accomplish along the way.
“Throughout the season, we are just looking to continue to build the 24/7 culture we have here,” he said. “We have a good group of guys that can knock down some big schools.”
The LIU men’s hockey team will look to continue their success at home when they take on Princeton University on Friday, Nov.12.
