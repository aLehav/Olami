Rhaamell Burke-Missouri, 2018 Post graduate, is casted as a dancer and the puppeteer of King Kong in the Broadway production of “King Kong.” He began his performances as a dancer and puppeteer on Friday, Oct. 5. Burke-Missouri graduated with a bachelor’s degree in dance from the School of Performing Arts.
Performing on Broadway is different than his life as a dance major at LIU Post. “It’s different in many ways, but one that really stands out to me is that at school you work hard because you want to be in front of this number or show out in class,” Burke- Missouri said. “On Broadway, you still work hard, harder than you ever thought possible, but this time your reasons change. Now it’s your livelihood, your art, your life.” One thing Burke- Missouri said school taught him was to make dance his life and Broadway makes that possible for him.
“Something else that I have noticed – at school you’re concerned about others. Don’t lie, it happens to the best of us,” he said. “But when you finally land that gig it’s all on you. No one is better or lesser than you. You just gotta show up and be on it every day for your reputation and consistency.”
The theatre professors at Post are proud of Burke- Missouri’s success post-graduation. “I am sure Rhaamell used the unique process of integrating the Suzuki and Stanislavski techniques that we teach at LIU to prepare for his audition,” theater professor David Hugo said. According to Hugo, this integration of techniques has been developed by professor Maria Porter and is the reason why students are having a great amount of success after graduating.
Hugo was invited to attend a dress rehearsal of “King Kong” and said “watching Rhaamell dance and sing and achieve one of his major career goals was the bonus check we never get as teachers. I wouldn’t trade it for any amount of money.”
Hugo assists students like Burke-Missouri in preparing for auditions. “I know the business and can talk to the students about how to navigate the business of being a professional actor,” Hugo said.
“Winning in this business is 85 percent perseverance and 15 percent talent,” Hugo said. “You need to want it and be willing to fight to get it. Winning in this profession is when opportunity meets preparation. The professors at LIU prepare the students, the students’ job when they graduate is to find the opportunity and to audition as much as possible.”
Before opening on Thursday, Nov. 8, the show went through various previews, and parts of the show can still be changed. Unlike rehearsals, previews are full run-throughs with an audience. Previews are experimental; what you see in a preview you may not see during a real performance. Once opening night happens, the show doesn’t change.
The previews have been “unreal,” Burke- Missouri noted. “It’s unreal how much your body grows and adapts to the work. Since I puppeteer and dance as part of the ensemble, everything is being challenged. Every part of my body is going to the extreme for the work,” he said.
“My performances have changed because our show also changes,” he said in regards to the previews. “Since the show isn’t frozen, meaning we can no longer make changes, we spend our rehearsals touching up and refining the production as a whole. That being said, my body hasn’t gotten used to the newest additions. It’s certainly something that I haven’t done before but I’m enjoying myself nonetheless.”
According to wired.com, King Kong is a 20 foot, 2,400 pound puppet with robotics within its’ face. Burke-Missouri felt it was something he never thought he could do. “It’s unbelievable. We have the responsibility to not only maneuver him around, but we also bring him to life. That goes for all those that work on Kong from automation, to voodoo operators, to us on stage. It takes a village to bring KiKo to life.” KiKo is the cast’s shorthand for King Kong.
The voodoo operators are the remote control operators in the lighting/tech booth who control the facial expressions and movement of King Kong’s face using a radio or Blue- tooth signal. They operate the servos placed throughout the robot’s head to control things like King Kong’s eyebrows and to create facial expressions for the puppet.
Burke-Missouri has advice for students on being a working actor. “Always be the hardest working person in the room. I’m here only because I sacrificed and put my best foot forward. Whenever there was a ‘no’ and I felt the weight of my dreams on my shoulders, I’d go to work. I’d sing or dance to allow myself to let go and remember why I started. Believe me, wanting to be on Broadway is easy, you can wish and wish to make it happen. It’s the work that will get you there. You work hard because at the end of the day, that’s the only way to make this happen for yourself. You remember where you [are] at any given moment and understand that you can always grow and do better.”
Working actors are sure to face disappointment about 85 percent of the time, according to Burke-Missouri. You may hear things about your talents and skills that make you want to give up, but Burke-Missouri said that at these moments, “you buckle down, stare that disappointment in the face and smile, because one day it will get better.”

Midterm elections were yesterday. Were students registered to vote? Does voting matter in the end?
Emma Anderson, a first-year musical theater student, was registered to vote and thought her vote mattered. “I want to always vote. Women worked hard to gain their right to vote; I’m going to use it,” she said before Election Day. “I want to hopefully help to put people in power who will be better able to represent me, [as well as] women and people of the LGBT community. Voting does help.”
Geena Anesta, a first-year special education student, was also registered to vote and planned to vote in the mid- term elections. “I’m Republican so I’m going to vote for the Republican Party,” she said. Anesta believes that “everyone should vote.”
Helen Flores, a freshman forensics science major, was registered to vote but had never voted before. “Right now I feel it’s important to vote, but I’ve never had time for it. In the future I feel like I would definitely vote,” she said.
“I feel voting is very [impactful] for our future so our vote [impacts] how our future’s going to be,” Flores continued.
Brianna LiCausi, a senior health and physical education major, was registered and planned to vote in the midterm elections. She believes more can be done. “[O]ne vote will not do anything alone, you need the whole community to vote. [I]f you vote, you can at least say you did something, but if people want change they have to go to the polls and share their facts and stand up for what they believe in.”
Victoria Boccella, a senior public relations student, was registered to vote and planned to vote in the midterm elections. “I think my vote’s meaningful; I think when you turn 18, and you can vote, it’s a waste not to,” she said. She planned to vote Republican out of her general agreement with conservative views, but would not discount voting for a Democrat.
Kalvin Orech, a junior broadcasting major, is apathetic about voting in general. He is not registered to vote. “I don’t care; it doesn’t apply to me,” he said. “I know it sounds ignorant, but I just don’t care enough to pay attention to whoever’s [running].”
Orech believes the political scene and its changes have little impact on him to pay attention. He will not consider voting in the future, but he encourages those who care to vote.
According to an April 3, 2018 Pew Research report, millennials comprised 27 percent of the voting-eligible population in 2016, while millennials as a generation consisted of 62 million eligible voters.

To the Editors:
As a former student of LIU Post, and as a former lecturer at Hutton House Lectures, I am shocked and dismayed at the sudden removal of Dr. Kay Sato from the directorship of Hutton House, a hugely self-destructive mistake on the part of the LIU Administration and an insult to Hutton House Lectures, to all the good people who work there, to its loyal adult student body, and, most egregiously, to Dr. Sato herself.
Under Dr. Sato’s guidance, the award- winning Hutton House Lectures became one of the most unique, most successful, and most admired programs on the LIU Post campus, a program that served thousands of adults every year and that could only have been improved by providing it with more rooms; for, unlike the situation on the main campus, enrollment continued to grow. But it is typical of Dr. Cline’s leadership that the program will now be destroyed, for within the first 24 hours of Dr. Sato’s firing, I personally heard from teachers and students alike who, like myself, resigned from Hutton House unless or until Dr. Sato is reinstated. The magic of Hutton House was the magic of Dr. Sato, and that is irreplaceable. It is also typical that Dr. Sato was ousted like some distrusted account executive in a paranoid corporation, her departure being watched as
if she might take “Hutton House” with her. Such behavior by any lieutenant of Dr. Cline is beneath contempt.
The fact is, the coffee machines, the refrigerator—all of the comforts provided for the adult student body at HHL were bought by Dr. Sato personally. But in a larger sense, Dr. Sato took Hutton House with her in ways that cannot be measured so easily, in ways that Dr. Cline cannot prevent, and in ways that will be regretted by this hugely destructive administration. Fortunately, it is within the power of the LIU Trustees to replace Dr. Cline, to reinstate Dr. Sato, and to save the reputation of a once-great university, not to mention the Trustees’ own reputations as members of the LIU Board.
This week I attended two strategy sessions with outraged sufferers under the leadership of Dr. Cline, focused around the firing of Dr. Sato from Hutton House Lectures but extending more broadly into a range of topics including the No Confidence votes by the main campus faculty, the plummeting enrollment, the utter lack of transparency, the roughly $28 million deficit, the smoke and mirrors PR, the firing of over 300 staff, the dismantling of programs, the gag order on the Post PIONEER and the attempt to shut it down, the shifting of numbers to present a successful appearance, the constant restructuring without prior study or consultation and thus the failure of one project after another, and the total lack of morale among faculty and staff. Among the dissatisfied individuals are some very angry, very smart, very persistent Life Learners who are collectively considering all forms of action. Near half the Hutton House faculty have resigned and are discussing a new collective venue elsewhere; students are demanding refunds upon hearing about the firing; donors are vowing never to give another dime; and, most impressively, 130 of the main campus faculty have signed a letter of protest against the firing of Dr. Sato. When I mentioned the chance of a work stoppage or slowdown to one of the main faculty, they said that such an action is already in effect because no one wants to volunteer for anything and no one has an ounce of stamina remaining.
I have a detailed document prepared by the Faculty Council last year, approved by every member of the Post faculty, and presented to certain of the Trustees but never acted upon. Since then matters have only worsened. My plan is to take it to the TIMES and to NEWSDAY as well as to Channel 12. Nothing in it is exaggerated or unverified. I am constantly asked the Trustees opinion of the rampant destruction of both campuses and I am at a loss. I am also asked what the Board of Trustees is doing about such a drastic situation. No one can accept that the Trustees are condoning what’s been happening. It’s impossible to know exactly how well informed all of the Trustees are, and given the inaction of the Board, most of the people I hear from prefer to assume that it simply doesn’t know how bad things are. But if that’s the case, that in itself is a drastic fault of the Trustees, and so I wouldn’t be surprised if the next No Confidence also addresses the Board itself. Does that need to happen?
Sincerely,
Peter Josyph

It is clear that many care deeply for the Hutton House Lectures, a long-standing program at Long Island University. We share the community’s love for Hutton House, and we are inspired by how it will evolve. We appreciate this opportunity to share the vision for Hutton House and the plans for the LIU School of Professional Studies.
Hutton House Lectures are known throughout our community for rich offerings that give seasoned learners new perspectives on the world around them. Under the leader- ship of Dr. Kay Sato, Hutton House provided insightful lectures with an emphasis on the liberal arts taught by accomplished scholars in their fields. The lectures are and continue to be a staple for area residents. We are appreciative of Dr. Sato’s efforts and thank her for her service to LIU and to the community. We envision building upon Hutton House’s solid foundation to create a nationally recognized school of professional and lifelong learning. We will be welcoming new lecturers, including former New York Times correspondent Lisa Pulitzer; USA Today travel journalist
William McGee; CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Association Tweed Roosevelt; former Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg; Consumer Reports’ Associate Communications Director Doug Love; and DNA Scientist Molly Hammell.
In addition to Hutton House, the core of the School of Professional Studies consists of the following programs:
· Global Institute, led by Trustee and Chairman, the Honorable Steve Israel, draws upon unparalleled experience in geopolitical policy and global affairs by accessing world leaders and experts in forums unlike any provided within higher education.
· Hornstein Center for Policy, Polling and Analysis conducts independent polling, empirical research, and analysis on public issues.
· Through the leadership and philanthropic support of T. Denny Sanford, LIU supports entrepreneurs, innovators, educators, and philanthropists through the T. Denny Sanford Institute for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, the Sanford Education Programs, and Sanford Philanthropy.
· Center for Gifted Youth is entering its 40th year in providing K-8 programming for gifted students.
· Professional Education provides programs for individuals who are looking to advance in their current career or transition to a new one. Programs will include certificate programs, enrichment courses, and networking opportunities.
We value your feedback. Our pledge to you is to serve the community by continually improving and expanding experiences for students of all generations.
For more information about the School of Professional Studies, please visit http://www.liu.edu/Post/Academics/School- of-Professional-Studies. We would love to have the opportunity to talk to you. If you have additional questions, please call us at 516-299- 2236.

It’s been almost eight years since a “Red Dead Redemption” (also known as “Red Dead”) game has been released. Besides Rockstar Games working on other games like “Grand Theft Auto,” in that long span of time, they must’ve been working on something good and they did, on Oct. 26 they released“Red Dead Redemption II.”

The story of the game is long; so it’s not worth talking about because what makes the game so great is the immersion. The game looks beautiful, like nothing ever seen before since “The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt” from rival company CD Projekt Red. “Red Dead” blows this out of the water in terms of immersion. Jordan Tyner, a senior film major, mentions the impact of the immersion,“It seemed overwhelming at first [the immersion] but I got used to it,” he said.
The game takes place in a fictional version of the United States, similar to some of Clint Eastwood’s western films or “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” starring Paul Newman, so it’s very wild, wild west.
Rockstar Games doesn’t push the envelope by shoving tumble- weeds down your throat in this game to let you know that this is a western. Instead, they showcase the setting with the characters’ diction, the lever-action rifles, and of course the horses. It’s pretty funny, if you steal somebody’s horse and a lawman sees it, there’s a prompt on the screen that says, “vehicle theft.”
While immersion is great, there are some times in the game where the actions just aren’t necessary. Getting from point A to point B can take a very long time in video game terms. For example, if you want to travel from Saint Denis to Valentine, that trip is going to take your around 10 minutes, depending on how many times bounty hunters come after you. The only real way to get from point A to point B in the game is if you ride a stagecoach, but you cannot have a bounty on your head and most people do.
Another issue is when you’re raiding an empty house for supplies, you cannot search an entire wardrobe quickly; you have to wait for your character, Arthur Morgan, to take his time to open each drawer one by one, which gets really annoying.
Tyner shared his overall view of the game so far. “As someone that hasn’t played “Revolver” or the first “Red Dead Redemption”, this game is excellent. It may be Rockstar’s best, but I may be speaking too soon. I haven’t finished the story yet,” Tyner said.
Overall, the game “Red Dead Redemption 2” is an absolute masterpiece, sure there are moments in the game where the realism is not necessary, but that still does not change the fact that the game is probably one of the best video games ever created.

Optional Materials:
It’s that time of year again where it’s not appropriate to be spooky, but still way too early for Christmas. For this week’s craft, we present to you – shaving cream leaves! The best part is that everything can easily be brought from the dollar store, so this is both a budget safe and festive project.

Step 1: Trace and/or freehand your leaves in various sizes on the card stock. All you need to draw are the silhouettes, so don’t worry about the details. If you need help, look up leaf shapes and you’ll have plenty of shapes to choose from. For an alternative method, you can print out the leaf silhouettes on the card- stock directly. Remember – no leaf is perfectly symmetrical or exactly the same, so don’t worry about the shapes too much. Then cut out the leaves and place them to the side.

Step 2: Take your tray and spray the shaving cream into it. Cover the entire bottom of the pan, and feel free to use the entire can.

Step 3: Take your paints and put a line of each color on top of the shaving cream. I added some metallic paints I had on hand to add some shine and glitter to the leaves.

Step 4: Take your stick/plastic silverware and begin to mix the shaving cream and paints together. Try mixing them together in multiple directions, but not so much that it becomes muddled. If you’re unsatisfied with the color mixing, add some more of the paint and just keep mixing.

Step 5: Take your card stock leaves and insert them face down into the shaving cream mixture. Make sure each part of the leaf is fully inserted into the mix. Allow the leaves to sit in the tray for about two minutes.

Step 6: Take one leaf out of the mix and place it onto the paper towels/towel with the shaving cream side up. Next, using either a stick, the blunt side of a plastic knife, or your finger, spread the mixture away from the leaf. If you see any white spots you wish to cover, add some of the spread off shaving cream and then spread it off again. Continue to do this for the rest of the leaves. Let the leaves dry for about a half hour.

Step 7: Take your dry leaf and poke a hole with scissors in order to insert it onto the cordage. Be careful with the scissors though, because you can very easily puncture yourself. Poke holes into remaining leaves.

Step 8: Take your cordage and cut it to your desired length. Then insert each leaf onto the cord. Voila! You now have your own leaf garland.
This craft can very easily be altered for any holiday and can be made into a variety of decorations. For my garland, I made pumpkins and jack-o-lanterns in order to add a little pizazz. You can also use this method to make a wreath. Simply follow steps one to six, and instead glue the dry leaves to a styrofoam, foam, or cardboard garland base. Have a festive fall!

“Across the Universe” by Beth Revis is the first book in a trilogy of the same name. The story begins in the nearby future, when a girl named Amy Martin is cryogenically frozen with her parents. They are put on the generation ship Godspeed that will take them to an earth- like planet in the Alpha Centauri system.

After hundreds of years, Amy is unfrozen fifty years before Godspeed is supposed to land. While frozen someone has tried to murder Amy, and has succeeded in murdering some of the other frozens. Amy must solve the mystery of the murders, and learn to survive on the strange world that is Godspeed.
Along the way, Amy meets Elder, the next leader of Godspeed who is infatuated with her. Amy also meets Eldest, the current and tyrannical leader of the ship. The people currently living on Godspeed are monoethnic, and a majority of them do not know much about Earth’s past. Eldest likes it that way, as it makes his job easier, and he is a constant threat to Amy’s sleuthing. As Amy and Elder struggle to uncover the mystery as to who tried to murder Amy, they discover other long kept secrets of Godspeed and the people that dwell in it.
Although the mystery is solved in the end, “Across the Universe” doesn’t quite sell the murderer’s justifications for his crimes. By the end of the book, the remainder of the journey to the Alpha Centauri system seems even longer than before. The expedition itself is brought up more in the sequels. The whole reason for being on Godspeed only seems to be brought up in this first book in order to frustrate Amy.
“Across the Universe” covers a lot of ethical questions, including subjects like cloning and controlling people with drugs. Sometimes these ethical plot points come off as preachy, or at least overused. But overall, it is an interesting science fiction story with dystopian tropes for those readers who enjoy futuristic tales of caution.

“Argue as if you’re right, but listen as if you’re wrong (and be willing to change your mind). Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective.”
– Adam Grant
A book I am reading, “The Coddling of the American Mind,” by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt, focuses on the issues regarding college campuses and the effects of certain speech on them. It raises the question of whether words, which some think to be “dangerous,” can really harm students. This problem then evolves into the need for safe spaces and trigger warnings.

The First Amendment guarantees us the right to exercise the freedom of speech. But how does this play out when people are forced to keep their ideas, perspectives and thoughts to themselves in fear that they will offend someone? Has the First Amendment become an empty phrase in a world where we worry that our speech will harm someone?
The quote by Grant is a great start to being able to speak your mind to others while respecting them and vise versa. When you are having a discussion with someone who has different views than you, there is no reason to preach that you are right and he is wrong. What is that going to solve? Why not offer your reasoning for your ideas and allow the other person to do the same. Keep your mind open and take in what others have to say; you might learn from them. We should not, however, fear that what we are saying will endanger others.
I believe in the importance of keeping the lines of communication open. Being able to converse with one another from different perspectives allows us to better understand each other’s thoughts and their reasoning behind them. Creating safe spaces and trigger warnings on campuses might seem like a good idea to some. But if we allow students to be shielded, how will they learn to respect the diverse opinions of others – when such respect is just what they want for themselves?

With the variety of clubs LIU has to offer, it’s hard to decide what club to join. From gaming to Greek Life, there’s a club for many interests.
As a commuter you might think twice about joining a club. You may wonder whether staying on campus for a club will lead to more traffic delays on the way home. And, do you really want to stay on campus until 6 p.m. to wait for a club when classes end earlier? Thoughts like these can make commuter students hesitant to join clubs.
For myself, clubs were easier to join at my previous college, Suffolk County Community College, due to the short commute home. Because of my two hour commute, joining a club at LIU is not as easy. Balancing school work, commuting and joining a club is challenging for me.
Other commuters agree. “I live an hour away, and now with clubs meeting at 6 p.m. and some- times with traffic, it’s not the best for a commuter,” Kyhara Jeanty, a senior broadcasting major, said. “I don’t have the time, but for a student who can fit it in their schedule, it’s good,” she said.
But joining a club can add to the college experience, and there are plenty of ways to kill time rather than waiting around. Study for a test or work on assignments; visit the tutor center for a little extra help on a subject; or squeeze in a quick work- out at the Pratt. Utilizing your time well is critical in college and can take you further than you think.
Clubs can be a huge asset in a college student’s career. You can meet new people and build connections – not to mention the free food most clubs offer upon appearance.
Not all clubs meet in the afternoon; there are a variety of clubs that meet during common hour. You can find a list of clubs that LIU offers online or find more information on clubs and events at the Promise office. Clubs can easily fit into any student’s schedule, it’s just a matter of arranging your week to make it fit.

The field hockey team continued their winning streak as they celebrated two wins during senior week. Their first game on Tuesday, Oct. 30 against the Owls of Southern Connecticut State University ended in a 7-1 victory for the Pioneers. They came into this matchup coming off a three-game road trip where they won two of three games.
The Owls came into the matchup looking for their first win of the season, coming out hot as they scored in the first five minutes of the game, stunning the Pioneers.
The Pioneers answered back with three goals in the first half; one by sophomore Sammy Bell with her 14 goals of the season to put the Pioneers on the board, and senior Emily Miller scored two before the end of the first to send the Pioneers into the half with a two-goal lead.
The second half was more of the same for the Pioneers as both Miller and Bell scored two more goals, giving them both a hat trick.
Bailey Martin, a senior midfielder, scored her first goal of the season late in the second half to give the Pioneers a decisive win over the Owls.
The Pioneers celebrated senior day at their final home game of the regular season against the Greyhounds of Assumption College on Saturday, Nov. 1. Coming off of a three- game win streak, the Pioneers are trying to keep their momentum going as they look to the Northeast 10 playoffs in a few weeks. The Greyhounds were looking for a win to try to get into the playoffs. The game was a defensive battle as both teams went back and forth. Both teams combined for a total of four missed shots in the first half, going into the half scoreless.
In the second half, both teams continued to play a strong defensive game, but it was the Pioneer’s freshman midfielder, Brianna Petruccelli, who scored a rebound. The lead didn’t last long, as the Greyhounds answered back quickly with a goal from the slot; the game was once again tied, and it would stay that way in until some late-game heroics from one of the Pioneer seniors.
In the last minute of the game, senior forward and midfielder Tarryn Morris scored a penalty corner with an assist from fellow senior Emily Miller, pushing the Pioneers up by one point with less than a minute to play in regulation. The Greyhounds tried to answer in a nail-biting final play as they were awarded a penalty corner with no time on the clock. Rachel Vellis, sophomore goalkeeper, stepped up with the save to give the Pioneers the win on their last home game of the season.
The Pioneers play their last game of the regular season on the road against American International College in Springfield, Mass. on Friday, Nov. 7.

LIU Post volleyball campaign is coming to an end. On Friday, Nov. 2 the Pioneer community witnessed the five graduating seniors’ last home game. The game ended in three sets with opponent Molloy College just coming out on top (25-21, 29-27, 26-24).
But with the merger for the 2019-20 season, the team will be relocated to Brooklyn; so despite the loss for the seniors and the rest of the team, this game marked the last to ever be played as the LIU Post Pioneers.
The gym was decorated in green and gold streamers, balloons and posters to honor the five senior athletes’ great contribution to the team. Giulia Genna, Rachel Londot, Elise Strange, Navah Evans and Kristen Bendy have all played significant roles in their time at Post, and from the cheerful reactions of their teammates on senior night, they made an impact in more than just the game.
Londot, outside hitter and double major in criminal justice and forensic science, thinks back to her last three and a half years fondly. “My time at Post has been great, it has really allowed me to learn about myself and grow as a person,”she said, whilst also commenting on the importance of friendships.
“Being a part of the volleyball team has helped me make lifelong friends and tons of great memories,” she said. “It has definitely played a huge part in making my time here so enjoyable, whether it was preseason practices, playing in big games, or just going to Winnick together. I couldn’t imagine my time here without having all of my teammates and the bond we form playing together.”
Defensive specialist and nursing major Navah Evans echoed Londot’s sentiment as she shared her favorite moment in the Pioneers jersey.
“Looking back now as a senior about to finish my collegiate career, I would have to say that my team in general has been the best memory I could’ve created,” Evans said. “It could be going to NCAA’s, or winning that tough game, but it’s the friendships that I’ve made that have made the biggest impact. Each person I met through my four years has taught me something and I am forever
grateful.”
The Pioneers take on No.2 seed, Molloy College again Friday, Nov. 9 in Amherst, N.Y at the ECC semi-finals. The winner advances to the ECC finals played at the same location, Saturday, Nov. 10.

The equestrian team will have the home- ring advantage for the first and only time this season on Sunday, Nov. 11. The Pioneers compete at the North Shore Equestrian Center against Columbia College, St. Joseph’s College, Molloy College, Stony Brook University, and Princeton University.
“[I enjoy] the experience of meeting different coaches and seeing all the different people ride,” Katherine Garcia, freshman vet tech major, said.
Team members are excited to compete with horses they’re familiar with. At other schools, “What makes it competitive is that we don’t know any of the horses that we get to ride,” Mallory Slack, senior biology major, said. There are approximately 130 horses on campus, and riders will be assigned one at random during the show. “We don’t get any warm up, nothing. We just have to go straight into the ring and jump around a bunch of fences,” Slack said.
Riders compete in different divisions with walking, trotting, cantering (“flats”), and jumping, aiming for a first-place score of seven points in each category. The goal is to make the horse look as attractive as possible. At some point, riders can expect challenges such as removing their feet from the stirrups. “We won’t have our irons, and we have to continue making it look pretty and put-together,” Slack said. They will have to adjust in a little as 30 seconds depending on the behavior of their horse.
“Jumping is all a connection between the rider and horse,” Grace Titus, freshman education major, said. “And sometimes that connection isn’t great, but that’s what our competitions are all about – making the best of it.”
To control the horses, doing flats means, “Getting them to listen to your legs and your hands which are the main aids in riding,” Titus explained. When jumping, riders ensure their horse looks nice as it lands at the appropriate distance. “The horse knows what it’s doing, but you really need to help them out a lot.”
The team meets three times a week to practice flats on Tuesdays, and meets on Thursdays and Fridays to practice flats and jumps. “It makes us have an advantage over other teams, the fact that we are so structured in our practices,” Slack said. “We are worked very hard.”
“The more practice you have, the better your show’s going to be, because you’re riding so many different horses,” Garcia said. She, among some of her other teammates, meet out- side of regular practices to ride on Saturdays.
“The horses need to be in training all week so that they get prepared for the shows on the weekends,” Titus said. The horses are bathed and groomed before the shows, and their equipment, such as bridles and saddles, are cleaned.
Many of the horses on campus come from show barns, where they’ve been trained at a young age in high level competitions. “We are very grateful to use them for our program,” Titus said.
Preparations begin the day before the show. The course designer, Susan Phillips, determines where the jumps will be placed. The fences will be repainted and decorated with flowers.
Titus is looking forward to the Pioneers’ only home show. “Our shows run very smoothly, there’s good turnout [and] all the horses are really well prepared, so I’m super excited for it,” she said.

While we may have some luring and enticing dining options on campus, like Subway and Starbucks, we often forget that even though the packaging advertises “fresh” and “natural” products, some of the offerings from these establishments may not be the healthiest for our bodies, though these venues do offer healthy options.
As young and developing college students and athletes, it’s important that we make informed decisions regarding what we eat. I’ve devised a food guide for some of our on campus eateries.
Many students are unaware that saturated fats, while required in minimal amounts in order to maintain healthy cholesterol levels, are like sludge in the body. Not only does it slow digestion, it also has a high tendency of placing itself in arteries and contributing to atherosclerosis, a.k.a. the stiffening of arteries. On a similar note, sodium, while required for proper fluid and electrolyte balance, contributes to high blood pressure and puts strain on the cardiovascular system. It’s recommended by the American Heart Association that we consume no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.
While the footlong chicken and bacon ranch melt at Subway may feel like comfort food, it has a tendency to elicit more harmful effects on the body than good and promote weight gain. With 1,220 calories, 2,580 mili- grams of salt and 20 grams of saturated fat, this meal in theory fulfills 61 percent of our daily caloric requirement, 107 percent of our daily sodium, and 100 percent of our daily saturated fat requirement, according to the American Dietetic Association. This meal choice is unfavorable, since it puts you at risk of overheating.
On the flip side, the cold cut combo foot long sub has a total of 720 calories and seven grams saturated fat, making this a better option. Since it goes well with added vegetables, this meal has a higher probability of meeting daily fiber requirements. Fiber is a vital component of food that over 85 percent of Americans are deficient in.
When visiting the campus Starbucks between classes, opt out of a caramel macchiato with a chocolate chip cookie as a snack and lean more towards a light roast coffee with a buttered eight-grain roll. This option has 23 less grams of saturated fat, six more grams of heart healthy fiber and more antioxidants, since light roast coffees provide anti-aging, health promoting properties.

This series follows musical theatre students going into their last year year at Post, and in most cases, watches them chase their goal for a big stage role. But for senior Cassidy Nelson, her time as a member of the Post Theatre Company has led her down a different path completely.
Hailing from Bellmore, Nelson accepted a place at Post following a summer honors camp between her junior and senior year of high school. “The biggest thing that attracted me to Post was that the professors really knew their students, you weren’t just a number in a class,” she said. “No matter what program I’m in, no matter what class I’m in, the professor will know my name.”
Once she had started at Post, Nelson quickly added a minor in arts management to her already time consuming BFA in musical theatre. It wasn’t until late in the fall semester of her sophomore year that Nelson made a decision that would change her path in the theatre program and shape her future.
Nelson decided to take on a minor in psychology, which meant she had to change her major to a BA in musical theatre. Juggling the two minors, her original BFA major and the honors college requirements would be impossible. “I couldn’t balance the very demanding BFA program along with two minors, so I had to give something up,” she said.
Nelson explained the biggest differences between the BA and BFA in musical theatre. “You’re done with most of your MT (musical theatre) classes the end of your sophomore year,” she said, which frees up time for her to meet the requirements of her minors.
This is the decision that led her to a career path that would most impact others, a future in drama therapy. “A lot of my class, all the power to them, are going out and auditioning and that’s great for them, but that’s not for me,” she said. “I can’t live that life, I am looking for something else. For something that would affect people everywhere and would change people, and that I can wake up and know that I have a purpose, that I am to change their life. That’s what I need to do.”
After graduating in spring 2019, Nelson will head off to start her graduate degree in drama therapy. Whilst here a Post however, Nelson hasn’t found her way all alone. She attributes her boyfriend for constant support, but also professor David Apichell for always advising her in what’s right and wrong.
The remainder of this semester and at the start of the spring, Nelson will be focussing on her graduate applications that are due in January, and finishing her honors college thesis that is due at the end of this semester. Nelson is writing about the importance of art education for children with special needs and general education students, which ties in with what she has planned for the future.
Her ultimate goal is an admirable one. After she completes her undergraduate and graduate education she hopes to develop an arts therapy establishment in NYC that caters to children with special needs where they can come to learn music, art, theatre, writing, and gain the assistance they need to thrive.
Nelson gives some advice too. “Don’t put yourself into a small box because you are capable of so much,” she said. “You can do anything if you just try.”

Mary Kathryn Breen, called Kate, the secretary for the English, philosophy and foreign languages department in the Winnick Mansion, is an unsung hero dedicated to helping students.
“Usually I wear the hat of problem solver,” she said. She learned this skill through her life and work, and through parenting. “Here, I think all the staff is finding solutions to help the students and faculty achieve their [academic] goals,” she said. “I always try to present a positive face of the department to anyone who comes in. With Dr. Lutz, we do a lot of outreach to other disciplines and departments so we can help connect students.”
Breen has held several jobs, in addition to staying at home for 10 years when her children were younger. “Immediately prior to working here at Post, I was a library clerk on the Brentwood campus,” she said. Breen began working for the university in 2006 while pursuing her masters in library science. In June 2012, she came to assist Dr. Lutz and the faculty in the English department.
Breen loves her job because she finds a lot of variety in her work day and admires the people she interacts with. “Every day is different and presents new challenges to assist people and to learn new software,” she said. The English department has been in the Winnick House approximately three years. Prior to that, the department was in Humanities. “A big part of my job has been to facilitate the move of faculty, facilitate set-up of the spaces in the Winnick House, so that all the faculty offices run well, and that the main office runs well.” Her work includes accounting for equipment and supplies as well.
Breen believes in the value of communication, something she has developed while working with Dr. Lutz. “We have to help keep all parties informed; if there are student issues with the course, the professors have to know,” she said.
Breen finds what she sees and what others may not notice at first sight valuable. “As a small liberal arts university, we offer so much to the students,” she said. “So I always try to make students aware of additional opportunities to expand their experience.”
She wishes there was a scavenger hunt for every first-year student so that they can find a different, and perhaps less-frequented area or department, on campus. “Some of my favorite spots are the gardens that Marjorie Merriweather Post plant[ed], the Reference Commons in the Library, and one of my favorite artifacts is the large black-and-white 1955 aerial photograph of Long Island, which is found in the Life Sciences hallway,” she shared. “I think some of these things may be missed by students.” Breen is also fond of the architectural details, history, and visual backdrops throughout the campus.
Breen’s office is in the Winnick Mansion, room 210. Her office has an open invitation to students to “come and visit any time.”

Dan Christoffel, an art professor and Vietnam veteran, was honored with a certificate of recognition for his service in the military. The honor was given by Maria Salazar, art therapy major and president of the Veteran Students United (VSU) club during the club’s veteran art exhibit on Monday, Nov. 5 during common hour.
“He deserved the award because Dan embodies the ‘esprit de corps.’ He is a loyal and giving of himself,” Salazar said.
She first met Christoffel at a workshop lead by him and Professor Frank Olt. The workshop introduced veterans to working with clay.
“I was fully enamored with clay after this workshop. As a fellow veteran, he always exhibits pride and honor and comradeship in the military of the United States, but his loyal spirit to serve is ever so present in his teaching,” Salazar reflected. “He is the kind of professor that really enjoys teaching you, and making sure that you are successful and proficient in your craft.”
Salazar served in the Marine Corps from 2002-2011 as a logistic specialist. She deployed to Iraq in 2003, and was honorably discharged as sergeant in 2011. Salazar stepped up to be president of VSU because of her strong belief in setting the veteran presence at Post. She wants to “tie in our time in military service and our willingness to continue to serve our communities and fellow veterans,” through VSU.
Salazar understands the healing potential of art making. After losing a Marine friend to suicide in 2012, Salazar went back to school to make a difference. “My goal and mission is to reach my fellow veterans suffering from PTSD and lend them a hand and guide them towards healing using art as our communication vehicle,” she said. “My hope is to lessen the number of Veterans that commit suicide daily.”
VSU has a number of events for Veteran’s week, including a clothing donation drive for the United Veterans Beacon House through Nov. 9; a “#22 pushup challenge” on Wednesday, Nov. 7, during common hour in Hillwood Commons lobby to raise awareness for Veteran suicide; a flag raising ceremony to celebrate 100 years of women serving in the Marines and a luncheon afterwards on Thursday, Nov. 8 during common hour; and ending with a Medal of Honor Challenge on Riggs Lawn during common hour on Friday, Nov. 9.
The Veteran Students United club meets every Thursday from 12:30 p.m. t0 1:30 p.m. in Hillwood Commons room 206.
