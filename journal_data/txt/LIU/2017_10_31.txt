At 6:57 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning, Oct. 30, an announcement was sent via email and text message to students and faculty notifying them that all Monday classes would be cancelled. According to the notice, “due to a power outage, all classes at LIU Post are cancelled for today, Monday, October 30. Faculty and administrative offices are closed. For Tilles Center call 516-299- 3100. Library closed.” Many parts of Long Island had lost power due to the heavy rains and winds throughout the night on Sunday.
The university sent a second email, an hour later, to inform students what services would be open on campus. “Public Safety, Facilities, Dining, and Campus Life staff are fully prepared to service the campus throughout the outage,” the email said. The shuttle bus service to Hicksville was operating on a regular schedule. However, the only available dining option for students was Winnick Student Center, which operated on an extended schedule from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Campus Life staff held activities to keep students occupied during the day, including bingo and Monday night football in the Winnick Student Center Gold Coast room. Members of the campus life staff and resident assistants were available in the residence hall lobbies throughout the day.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, confirmed the buildings affected by the power outage. “On Oct. 30, several buildings on the LIU Post campus were affected by a power outage due to an off-campus issue. As a result of the outage, most academic buildings, the Pratt Recreation Center, Library, and Hillwood Commons were operating on emergency power,” he wrote in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “LIU Post Facilities coordinated with PSEG to address the issue and return power to the campus. Without being able to open essential buildings, the decision was made to cancel classes for the day,” he said.
Sam Scarito, a freshman early childhood education major, lives on campus. “The power outage was pretty inconvenient for me. Post Hall was out for the majority of the night, and people were in the hallways doing their homework.
I wasn’t able to set an alarm and I honestly wondered if I’d wakeup for class or not,” she said. Notification of the school closure was sent via text message and email at 6:57 a.m., when many commuter students and professors were already on their way to their 8 a.m. classes. Jamie Leigh, a senior forensic science major, was driving to her 8 a.m. class when she got the notification. “I usually do not check my phone while I am driving but I had my phone propped on my dashboard while using a navigation app. I feel like this happens all the time. The school should know a significant amount of students commute to school and should have taken into consideration how far some students commute. One hour before the first set of classes is not enough time to notify students,” Leigh said. Freshman accounting major Amanda Norton was an hour into her commute to school. “I think they should’ve sent that message earlier. It’s dumb to wait until 7 a.m. when there [are] commuters with early classes who are already on the road. I wasted my time and gas,” she said.
Michael Semler, a junior international business major also leaves early in the morning to get to classes on time but feels that this power outage could have been prevented. “[The university] should make sure that anything at risk, like equipment servers, [are] secured and contingencies should be in place when equipment fails,” he said.
The Pioneer has previously reported on hurricane preparedness. In “Storm Preparedness In the Wake of Hurricane Nate,” By Jada Butler in the Oct. 10 issue, the Pioneer reported that many buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the event of a power outage. “Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls,” according to the Oct. 10 article. “All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.”
According to Berthel, the outage was not caused by an on-campus issue. PSEG, the electric provider for Long Island, was responsible for repairing the power lines to restore power to campus. Power was restored at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. Classes resumed on Tuesday, Oct. 31 on a regular Tuesday schedule. Students have not received any notification about whether the Monday classes will be made up.

On Wednesday, Oct. 25, students were able to “pie” a Campus Life employee in Hillwood for $1 to raise money for Move-A-Thon.
The Move-A-Thon fundraiser benefits the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation to ght against pediatric cancer. The event will be held on Nov. 16,from 7 p.m. – 12 a.m.in the Pratt Recreation Center. The Move-A-Thon keeps students moving the entire night with dancing, a bounce house, a dodge ball arena, obstacle courses, food, and raffles.
In the fundraiser held Wednesday, students shoved plates filled with shaving cream in the faces of Campus Life: Ashley John, Matthew Blanar, Julia Pagano, members of the Move-A-Thon committee, and student employees of Campus Life. For $1, students were able to throw the plate at their faces during common hour.
The volunteers getting pied wore raincoats, yet they were still covered in the shaving cream.
“The Don Monti foundation raises money for pediatric cancer research, and this is our third year partnering with them for Move-A-Thon. We want to raise money in a fun way, and the pieing in the face adds a shock factor that makes people want to stop,” Theresa Kelley, a junior double major in music education and Spanish, and a member of the Move-A-Thon committee, said.
Last year, Move-A-Thon raised $15,250. This year, the members of the committee hope to raise between $12,000 and$15,000 as well.
Students can register for the event at tinyurl.com/moveathon17.

The Omicron Delta Kappa National Leadership Honor Society (ODK) has sent letters of acceptances to 53 students.
ODK, an organization created in 1914 and established at LIU Post since 2015, has inducted 217 members on campus. The requirements to be considered for the society as an undergraduate are: junior and senior standing, having a minimum cumulative 3.5 GPA, a full time student, and active involvement in athletics, campus/community service, social/ religious activities, campus government, creative and performing arts, journalism, speech and mass media. Graduate students are allotted similar requirements for the society.
Joseph Vernace, chair coordinator of ODK, and associate director of Campus Life, is eager to induct students into the society. “I could not be more proud of this group and their amazing achievements, or more excited to see what the future holds for our members and our Circle,” he said.
Junior adolescent education major Kathleen Kumpas is honored to be inducted. Kumpas, a commuter, is a member of the Green Key Society’s peer mentor program, Who’s Who in Among Students in American Colleges and Universities. She was previously involved in the Student Athletic Advisory Committee. “I am so grateful that I have been involved in various parts of the campus. I feel that my involvement shows how I had developed as a student leader over the past two years at LIU Post,” Kumpas said.
Kristina Huderski, senior broadcasting major, received her acceptance to the society via e-mail. Huderski is the features editor for The Pioneer and one of the music directors at WCWP radio station. She is ecstatic about being selected. “My family is so proud of me, and my accomplishments. They see how hard I work and cannot wait to see me be inducted,” she said.
The induction ceremony for the new students will be on Dec. 11 at 7 p.m. in the Tilles Center Atrium. Invitations have been sent to families.
Students interested in ODK can apply for fall 2018 at www.tinyurl.com/liupostodkapp

Although the original notification informed students that the library would reopen at noon on Friday, Oct. 20, students did not receive a notice that the library had reopened until 2:13 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 20. The notice sent by Public Safety via the LIU Alert email system, stated that the library had reopened, thanked the community for its patience, and informed students and faculty that the library had resumed normal operating hours.
During this three and a half day library closure, students had to find other places to study, have internet access, and print out work. They were unable to take out books or use the library’s reference services, other than by email. Dean of Students, Michael Berthel informed students by email that the library maintained virtual reference services to answer reference, catalog, and database questions via post-ref@liu.edu.
“The library faculty did a great job maintaining the online chat reference and email reference services,” Thomas Walker, associate dean of the college of education, information, and technology, and director of the Palmer school of library and information science, said.
The library staff responded to 20 chat reference questions and eight e-mail questions from students during the closure, according to Louis Pisha, head of reference, and Elizabeth Mezick, a library faculty member.
Hillwood Commons served as a makeshift study zone, with several rooms reserved for “quiet study” and the Career Bar reserved as a computer lab and printing source.
In the small alternative spaces provided, some students found it difficult to efficiently complete their work, and computer and printer access was not always available. “Everything was full,” Anthony Cavarretta, a freshman broadcasting major, said. “I had to do a project and I couldn’t, so we were pushed back.”
“It was frustrating that the clubs that had reserved rooms prior to the library closing had to relocate to other buildings for their meetings,” Alexa Kaplan, junior business marketing major, and social media manager and secretary of Hillel, said.
The library staff was satisfied with the alternatives provided, though. “We worked around the disruption quite well,” Walker said.
“Library faculty continued to do research or to work on tasks that could be completed outside the building – thanks to the internet.”
Students received no further notifications regarding the measures taken to remove the bees. Then the following week, on Wednesday, Oct. 25 at 9 p.m., the library was closed again for the rest of the night. Michael Berthel, dean of students, claimed in an email sent to the Pioneer, that this was done out of an abundance of caution after Public Safety received a report of a bee sting.
Facilities services and two exterminating companies responded to the report. They conducted full inspections of the building and found no issues, according to Berthel. “Additional precautionary measures were put in place to ensure the continued safety of the community,” Berthel said.
Director of Public Safety Michael Fevola called the bee issue an “ongoing collaborative effort between public safety, facilities, and campus life,” yet did not respond to inquiries of the additional precautions.
Roy Fergus, head of facilities services, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the most recent closure. The library resumed normal operating hours Thursday, Oct. 26.

Standing at an average height and wearing a ponytail with a baseball cap, J. Fordsman is just another one of the guys. No one would suspect that he is one of the most courageous students on this campus. “They or Them” and “He or Him” read the buttons on his shirt.
Fordsman, a freshman in the honors college double majoring in psychology and criminal justice, has made history on the LIU Post campus, becoming the first student identifying as transgender to be inducted into a fraternity. “Our organization is excited to support all of our new members through the bond of brotherhood. We’re just excited to see J and the rest of our Gamma class get initiated in December,” Phi Sigma Kappa President Nicholas Sieban said.
From a young age, Fordsman knew he was not quite like the other girls around him. Identifying as female or male goes far deeper than just your physical attributes or your biology, and Fordsman was aware that there was a disconnect between his mind and biology. After first identifying as bisexual in high school, he continued to be active in the LGBTQ community and began meeting and speaking with people to get a better understanding of who he was. “I eventually came to the conclusion that I’m something that’s NOT a girl,” he said, and decided that “trans man” was the appropriate title.
Fordsman said that he was immediately welcomed on campus when he arrived at college this fall and has not felt out of place or targeted. The idea to join a fraternity arrived during the summer. At orientation, he attended a “Meet The Greeks” event and simply asked Joseph Vernace, associate director of campus life, if there would be any problems with joining. “The most hesitation there was, was introducing myself at orientation, but once I went to the open house and met everyone, there were no questions asked,” Fordsman said. After meeting and bonding with several frat members during the summer, Fordsman ultimately decided that Phi Sigma Kappa was the fraternity for him.
There is often a negative stigma associated with fraternities and how open-minded they are – or are not. “I know people have a certain idea of what they associate with fraternity life, so this is something that I feel is going to be a good turn around for us,” O’Dell Alexander, a senior student and member of Tau Kappa Epsilon, said.
Across the country, fraternities are slowly becoming more inclusive. As of 2016, Delta Tau Delta passed a nondiscrimination policy stating that they “do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.” This is a huge step in the direction of equality, tolerance and acceptance.
Many of Fordsman’s peers wanted to protect him and make sure that he wasn’t putting himself in a position to be ridiculed or targeted by being so public about his gender identity in this article. Fordsman is confident that there will be no problems and is adamant and excited to share his story to hopefully encourage or inspire some other students. “I just want them to know that this is a safe campus, and that absolutely everyone is here for you. Promise is here for you. Campus Life is here for you. I’m here for you. Everybody is here for you.”
Along with being a member of PSK, Fordsman also enjoys attending Be the Change Club events and meetings.

Last fall, undergraduate students were informed that even if they entered LIU Post in a 129 credit degree program, they could choose to graduate with either the 129 credits or 120 credits. This switch sounded like it should have been easy. Yet, it has been proven quite a struggle for me. The biggest problem lies within the advisors. During my almost three and a half years at Post, I have had three different Promise Coaches.
Each year, these coaches meet with students to help them register for classes. Students really need to be on top of their game when registering for classes, since, in my experience, the Promise Coaches are almost always new and don’t fully know the courses or requirements for the various majors. So what exactly are these Promise Coaches promising? That I’m not exactly sure.
I made the decision to switch to the 120 credit degree so I could devote more time to the Pioneer, my senior project, and finding a job after graduation. Switching to the 120 credits would mean less classes for my senior year with the same degree, less stress and a weight off my shoulders. But it has so far proven to be more stressful, not less.
Finding out my degree audit didn’t show up correctly online was the first problem; getting it fixed required going to the Promise office multiple times. After being told different things by different promise coaches and being more confused than ever, at the suggestion of the chairperson of my department, I headed to Kumble Hall for an official degree audit. After waiting for 45 minutes for someone to look over my degree audit, I still wasn’t provided with the answer I needed. I was told that someone would call me to go over my degree audit, but four days later, that phone call never arrived. I took it upon myself to reach out to the director of the Promise Office. I was told to make yet another appointment later in the week.
Finally, after two weeks of frustration, the chairperson of my department reached out to Kaitlin Seewald, the assistant registrar and coordinator for academic standing, and she was able to provide me with the information I needed all along – thank you!
Encouraging students to switch to the 120 credit degree without fully giving the administrators and staff who would be helping students the tools or understanding they needed to make this change was a mistake.
LIU Post prides itself on having these Promise Coach Advisors to help students in their journey through school, but, at least in my case, they have made it more difficult by being unreliable. It would have been much easier and much less stressful had I been assigned, throughout my college years, one promise coach who was familiar with my major and degree requirements. This type of program has the potential to be a valuable resource for students, but needs to be handled in a more organized way, with perhaps a bit more training.
As of today, I am on track to graduate with my class on May 11. I may have a countdown written on my phone because I’m so excited to see what the future will hold for me after graduation.

On Thursday, Oct. 26, students came together to participate in the annual Midnight Madness event. Every fall, the event showcases both the male and female basketball teams. Admission was free to students who presented their LIU ID card.
Alumni were also invited to come back to campus and partake in the event. “As a college student, I always looked forward to the events that Campus Life and the school community put together. So when I graduated it just felt right for me to come back and witness the excitement again,” Jameel Cooper, a Post alumni, said.
“I think it’s a great event because not only do they show off my friends on both teams but they also give us students an opportunity to win prizes and money,” Keolani Williams, a senior forensic science major, said.
Awards and prizes, ranging from Amazon are given out to students through various contests, ranging from blind-folded money searches to dance competitions. “I’m extremely shy, but when I saw that the dance competition was going to lead to a prize, I raised my hand,” Motun Olusa, a senior business administration major, said.
The dance team and cheerleaders also performed during the event. With standing ovations both shows seemed to wow the audience. “I wasn’t expecting the event to start off with such a bang but I was surprised at how eccentric and awesome the dancers were,” Jazsmine Kerr, a senior musical theatre major, said.

Be prepared for a night of fun and games, the third annual Move-a-Thon is coming up on Nov. 16 and will last from 7 p.m. to midnight at the Pratt Recreation Center. Many students have been looking forward to the event and Campus Life has been hard at work preparing for a night fulfilled with festivities.
Several fundraisers have been held to raise money for the Move-a-Thon’s cause. “Some have been pieing Campus Life staff members, selling t-shirts during homecoming, hosting a scavenger hunt in Hillwood, and having RA’s hold programs within the residence halls to raise money,” said Julia Pagano, campus life coordinator. A trivia night fundraiser will be held on Monday, Nov. 6 at 7:30 p.m. in the Hillwood Cinema. All of the donations go to Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation to fund research and provide care for patients battling cancer.
The Move-A-Thon Committee consists of students and staff who have been reaching out to the community, advertising, scheduling, and choosing activities and raffles for the event. The Move-a-Thon will feature  several attractions such as inflatables, super-sized sports and arcade games, virtual reality pods and opportunities to win prizes. “We’re making it more activity-oriented this year,” Olivia Kavanaugh, junior art education major, said, “We’re trying to get more high-paced activities to keep students involved from the moment they walk into Move-a-Thon to the moment they leave.” Attractions at last year’s Move-a-Thon included a miniature golf course. This year, bungee jumping and go-karting will be available at the event. Refreshments will be served throughout the night.
“I went to Move-a-Thon for the first time last year, and I think it’s a really great community event that brings us together,” Adam Silverstein, sophomore social work major, said.
The coordinating committee has high hopes for the event this year. “Last year, we raised about $15,000. We’re hoping to match or exceed that,” Kavanaugh said.
Will Bruner, owner of Enjoyable Entertainment will be DJing the event. “He has DJ’d for several other events such as orientation, pep rally, Relay For Life, and previous Move-A-Thon events,” Pagano said.
A registration fee of $10 can be paid either at the door or online at tinyurl.com/moveathon17.

The Pioneer interviewed Edmund Miller, senior professor of English, on his interests in literature as well as his current projects. Miller was a student at Post from 1961-65. He has taught at LIU Post since 1981, and he was the Department chairman for eighteen years (1993-2011). In addition, he was the Features editor of The Pioneer in 1963. He was also also managing editor of Opticon and editor of the literary magazine, then called The Little Review. This semester, Professor Miller is teaching freshman Honors English, the first half of the British Literature Survey and the the first half of the World Literature Survey.
The Pioneer: When did you discover your love of English literature?
Edmund Miller: I probably discovered my abiding love of literature in high school. I was a great reader even as a child, but I had one very good teacher in high school who allowed me to see reading as a calling, a kind of life’s word. As early as eleventh grade at least, I knew I wanted to major in English when I got to college. I didn’t have any particular career goal in mind. In those days one just went to college and followed the siren call of an academic discipline. Most students don’t realize this, it is still true of most professions today: doing well in a major you like for its sake prepares you better than seconding guessing the job.
TP: Is there any issue or area of interest that you’re currently exploring and doing work in?
EM: I have a wide range of interests. The year before last, I published an article on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a medieval poem. This past year, I published two creative books: a poetry book called The Screwdriver’s Apprentice and the creenplay Dueling Lady that won publication in a contest [the Dizzy Emu contest]. I also have some long-range scholarly book projects in the works, one about Shakespeare’s late plays and the other about English nonsense writers.
TP: Where are you from? Where did you study as for higher education?
EM: I grew up on Long Island. The high school I mentioned was Hauppauge. I went to LIU Post as an undergraduate and earned a BA summa cum laude in English, of course. I have an MA from Ohio State University and a PhD from Stony Brook University. Drudgerie Divine: The Rhetoric of God and Man in George Herbert is an expanded version of my doctoral dissertation.

Gina Cammarata, a senior business management major, is the proud owner of Minnie, a two year old mini boxer, who is half king charles and half boston terrier. The Cammarata family got Minnie from Love my Puppies in Wantagh.
Minnie is extremely energetic and loves playing with her new sister, Daisy. Cammarata said there is nothing she loves more than coming home to Minnie and playing with her. When Cammarata is stressed out between work and school, she loves cuddling with Minnie and just looking at her. “She’s so therapeutic looking,” Cammarata said.
Minnie and Cammarata love being outside together and playing fetch. “When it’s nice out, Minnie and I love going outside in the backyard and playing fetch! It is her favorite game and she is always so excited,” Cammarata said.

As exams roll around, the stress kicks in. When you are a college student, you often feel as if you don’t have time for anything, let alone studying. This is why we need ways to stay focused and manage our time. We all have different ways to go about studying and some ways tend to work better than others. If you are struggling to figure out what works for you, just try as many methods as possible. Being able to keep your study skills intact and organized will keep you happier instead of being stressed and upset when it comes time to study.
College athletes have the additional pressure of a sport, including practices, workouts and games. Lacrosse player Trish Brisotti, a junior criminal justice major with sociology minor has found ways to overcome the pressure of balancing schoolwork and lacrosse. “There was definitely an adjustment period for me when I first came to school,” Brisotti said. “Experiencing college classes as well as playing a collegiate sport was all new and quite demanding.” She has figured out how to prioritize her time and also has the help from her coaching staff. Brisotti prefers to stay in her dorm room to study rather than go to the library because it is more convenient and less distractions. For some people going to the library helps with getting out of your room and being in a different environment.
Flashcards are a great way to memorize important concepts. Rewriting your notes also helps ingrain the information into your head. Make sure to organize the information you are studying. Know what’s important and what’s not. Take the important notes and focus on them. Look for practice quizzes or tests online on your topic and continue to retake them until you feel confident with the material.
Take breaks! Don’t forget to take time to rest in between studying. Overworking yourself will lead to exhaustion, which will hurt you in the long run. Having a happier more positive mind while studying can help make it more enjoyable. Keeping your work organized and knowing what you have to do. We also tend to get distracted and think we can multitask by doing other things while studying. Put your phone away, turn off Netflix and hit the books!

According to my Critical Health Issues class, stress is defined as “The nonspecific response of the body to any demands made upon it”… how much more general of a definition can we get!? The “nonspecific response” to “any demands”? That sure encompasses a lot of things and aspects of our lives. We all know that stress, unless it’s a positive stress like being surprised on your birthday or getting into a new relationship, is bad and can lead to undesirable emotional and physical symptoms.
With that said, it’s important to point out that there’s a large and underrecognized dimension of stress that primarily afflicts school goers, college students in particular due to increased financial and time burdens- EXAMS! Midterms, finals, pop quizzes, all of these things often send a jolt of panic through our bodies. “Did I study enough?”, “Dang, I remember reading SOMETHING about this…”, “Why don’t I have a photographic memory?!” Sound familiar? If so, you’re not alone, and hopefully the information in this article can help both of us shape up, organize ourselves and time, and dodge unnecessary stress.
First off, we should think about why we’re stressed and what’s at the center of our daily irritations. Based on interactions with my classmates and by my own life, in college, stress is often driven by being unprepared. Whether it’s for a class, a test, or for practice, being unprepared seems to be a common denominator. Students are often unprepared because of a lack of time. Time is tricky, and a big issue comes into play when there are two things we have to do at the same time, like work and study for an exam. It’s no secret that money is hard to make and easy to spend, but when it comes to college, we all seem to be in a jam.
Christopher Haynes a junior who works 30+ hours per week at two jobs, is enrolled in a full time schedule, and maintains above a 3.0 GPA. I asked him what his secret was to managing his time so that he doesn’t feel overwhelmed with work and studying, he says that he “studies in chunks throughout the week, usually in 15-20 minute intervals, that way it doesn’t take away too much time at once and by exam day [he] would have studied a good hour to hour and a half and [is] feeling prepared.” He says however, that “it’s important to take good notes in class and be totally engaged so that what is being taught sinks in, but take the notes by hand, that way you’re kind of learning it again.”
You may be wondering “what about other responsibilities and free time? Sure it’s easy to juggle work and school, but there’s a lot more going on than that in life.” That’s what I thought too, which is why I asked Haynes how he fares with free time and if he ever feels overwhelmed. “Sure, I get overwhelmed with the planning and scheduling of it all. It’s hard to have something you want to do but can’t. But when it comes down to it, we have to make time. Like every other Tuesday I go into Queens with my family to visit my brother…I try to see my girlfriend 3-4 times per week. These things are important to me, so I find time. The last thing I need with a busy and sometimes stressful schedule is to feel like I’m not maintaining healthy relationships.”
I think we can all try to implement these small changes in our busy schedules. Study piecemeal throughout the week like on breaks at work and even in the car when carpooling with someone. Try to take notes by hand to get some extra brain power going on in class, too. And if both of these aren’t enough to prepare you more and take away some pressure, try to readjust your work schedule or reach out to campus services like the Learning Support Center and Academic Workshops often held in Hillwood Commons.

One of the many ambitious students at LIU Post has recently mastered the art of storytelling as she is soon to release the film, Homecoming. Brittany Ramjattan, 20-year-old senior and honor’s film student has committed one year of herself in creating a “honest film” entitled, Homecoming. “I wanted to make sure it wasn’t overly dramatic, but a story told in a nuanced way with realistic humor,” Ramjattan said. The film is about a cultural struggle. An Indian-American boy, Dave, going to college to become a photographer and his mother, who he ran away from when she didn’t support his dreams. After needing some of his old photographs for a gallery, he breaks into his old apartment, where he’s forced to face the baggage he ran away from.
The inspiration behind the film is immigration and immigrant psychology. “I was motivated to tell a story that captured the essence of the immigrant experience, but that everyone could relate to at the same time,” Ramjattan said. Immigrant matters are what Ramjattan holds close to her heart. She uses Homecoming as a vehicle to show the day in the life of an immigrant adjusting to the American culture while simultaneously wrestling with day to day situations. She also believes it is important for girst-generation immigrants to have an outlet to relate to, pushing Ramjattan to not only start the film but finish the film.
Ramjattan began working on Homecoming about one year ago and started to refine the script in the fall of 2016 with LIU Post Professor, Lisa Robinson. “She helped me find and carve out my story, and she was especially helpful in helping find bigger and better conflicts for my characters to deal with,” Ramjattan said. In the spring semester of 2017 she also worked diligently with Susan Zeig, the head of the film department, to finish the script and produce the film. “It’s been quite a process, I look forward to seeing the final product,” Zeig said. In post production, Ramjattan used her peers as a resource to finalize the film. “It took a lot of work to balance the necessary elements of making the plot without distorting the message.” Keeping the message in its raw state did not become easier in the editing process. “It’s a lot to balance: staying true to the message, entertaining an audience, and not misdirecting the viewers,” Bernarr Merriett, senior and film major said.
Film has not always been Ramjattan’s first love, in fact she initially thought her career would be scientifically influenced and that she would work in medicine. It is not until her freshman year of high school when film caught her interest. “I joined a comic club and one of our assignments was to write a script for a contest. It was suppose to be a graphic novel script, but I chose to write a screenplay and won third place in the region for the contest,” Ramjattan said. It is at this moment when she fell in love with film and she has been “determined” to be a great influencer in the film and television industry ever since.
After graduation, Ramjattan plans to work in television development and to be a script writer. In the mean time, she works at a production company and interns at a television production house doing research and both pre-production and post-production. “We have a show we’re working on for Travel Channel, and some of my research has been incorporated in the pilot,” Ramjattan said. Ramjattan has also had the opportunity to work as production assistant on formal television sets such as WeTV with actors Jack Thriller and Tahari Jose.
Ramjattan encourages her fellow seniors to do their best while working on a senior thesis and to remember that “not everything will go smoothly” and there will be challenges. She explained that the standard that is often created in one’s mind may not be perfectly executed and that’s “one-hundred percent natural,” she said.
Her advice to students pursuing film is, “It doesn’t matter how much experience you think you have or if you’re worried about not being creative enough, everyone learns something from working on a film,” Ramjattan said. Film includes every facet of artistery such as sound, imagery, and story-telling. “You can make a career out of any aspect of film and there is something for everyone. There really isn’t another major like it,” Ramjattan said.
While working on Homecoming, Brittany Ramjattan has learned the importance of not only going through life but rather growing through life. She values the stage that she is currently in and realizes that she is still in the ‘early life’ section of her Wikipedia page. Ramjattan does not put too much pressure on herself because she knows just like in her film, life is also the art of storytelling.
After submitting her thesis to New York based, south-east asian and comedy film festivals Homecoming, will be available on Vimeo and YouTube next January.

On May 7, 1946, Germany surrendered and signaled the end of WWII, but in the “Wolfenstein” timeline, things are a bit different. 
In the video game “Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,” the Nazi’s were never stopped. In fact, they invaded the United States. In the game, you play as William “B.J.” Blazkowicz during his recovery from a 5-month coma, leaving him paralyzed for the first hour of gameplay. Even though Blazkowicz is paralyzed, he still gets around in his wheelchair to deliver a beating to the Nazis. Irene Engel, a lieutenant general and the primary antagonist, is out to get Blazkowicz after killing her lover, Bubi Engel, in the previous game, “Wolfenstein: The New Order.”
In the game, Blazkowicz and his resistance network known as the Kreisau Circle, a paramilitary group, collaborate with the American Resistance. Their goal is simple: destroy the Nazis and reclaim their land from them. The story brings you to many places, such as New York City, Roswell, N.M., New Orleans, and even Venus. New York and New Orleans are nuclear wastelands, while Roswell is left clean. However, there are Klu Klux Klan members patrolling the area alongside the Nazis, giving off an unsettling feeling as they form a congregation of evil.
The objective of the game is to hit Engel and the Nazis where it hurts. The storyline follows the resistance’s efforts to do just that. “Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus” is more of an interactive movie due to Blazkowicz’s internal monologue and the healthy amount of cut scenes. Recently, a lot of video game companies are using this style of narrative to immerse the player into the story, which is what the “Wolfenstein” series is all about.
There are only a couple weak points in “Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,” and one of them is what happens after you finish the game. There’s not much to do except eliminate any remaining Nazis, and you can’t go back and replay missions. The second weak point is the game’s emphasis that the player must sneak around while doing such doesn’t have an effect on the outcome of a mission. Sneaking is incredibly difficult, even if attempted on the game’s lowest difficulty setting. This creates a hassle for players more inclined to take a stealthy approach to winning the game. “Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus” is more of a history lesson of an alternate universe. It answers the question, “What if Germany won WWII?” This motivates the player’s mission to do whatever it takes to keep fascism from spreading, even in a fictional world.
This game is available on www.amazon.com and in Best Buy stores for the Xbox One, Playstation 4 and PC. “Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus” is Rated M for Mature.

Have you got what it takes to be desirable? This November, you can find out just how “DeZirable” you really are.
The sorority sisters of Delta Zeta are entering the final preparations for their annual philanthropy event, Mr. DeZirable. Campus Life has rated the event “Most Outstanding Philanthropy Event of the Year.” The night is structured like a male beauty pageant, complete with a panel of judges picked from various campus life personnel. 
Those who wish to participate need an application, available at the DZ table in Hillwood Commons every day from 12:30-1:50 p.m., and a sponsor. Participants and sponsors need not be a part of Greek Life, any male Post students are welcome to apply.
Once applications have been handed in, prepare for the pageant’s three rounds. The first round is the “Dress to Impress.” In this round, contestants choose their very best formal swear to model for the audience. While the participant exhibits just how well they can clean up, the MC for the evening will introduce the contestant to the judges and the audience. The introduction should be written and provided by your sponsor.
The second round showcases the contestants’ talents. Each participant will have no more than two minutes to wow the crowd. Just about anything goes: singing, dancing, playing an instrument like guitar or piano, or maybe even reenacting the Jingle Bell Rock skit from “Mean Girls.”
Finally, the third round is the outfit of choice and trivia round. Contestants get to showcase their eye for fashion with an outfit of their own choosing, as long as it is appropriate for the public eye. Once out on stage, the MC will ask the contestant a single trivia question. The contestants will answer as they see fit.
At the end of the last round, the judges discuss who they believe displayed the best overall performance. The contestants are then brought back on stage for the MC to announce the winner. The first-place winner receives a $100 Visa gift card.
All proceeds for the night go to the Starkey Hearing Foundation, an organization dedicated to bringing the joys of sound to those who cannot hear. Last year, the sisters of Delta Zeta raised around $1500; this year they are looking to raise about $2000.
Mr. DeZirable takes place on Nov. 2 at 8 p.m. in the Hillwood Lecture Hall. Tickets are $5 if bought before the event during common hour at the Delta Zeta table, or $7 at the door the night of the event.

Prepare for an evening of diverse classical music played by the music department faculty ensemble, the Pierrot Consort. The consort will perform songs by five different composers including Claude Debussy, Dmitri Shostakovich, Arthur Foote, and Robert Schumann. “The concert has a good variety of music; there’s a lot of different styles and combinations of instruments,” music professor Susan Deaver said, “Along with Foote’s Nocturne and Scherzo, we’re also doing a romantic composer, Schumann.”
Originally formed in 1981, the consort has undergone several member changes. Formerly consisting of a flutist, violinist, cellist, pianist and vocalist, the group now features Deaver, who is a flutist, violinist Dale Stuckenbruck, violist Veronica Salas, cellist Maureen Hynes, and pianist Heawon Kim. Only Hynes and Deaver remain from the original lineup. Kim joined the consort in 1989. “Now we know each other so well and we’ve been good friends, not just playing partners,” Kim said, “If you don’t have a good relationship then you can’t work well together as a group.”
Raoul Pleskow, former music department chairman, came up with the name for the Pierrot Consort, taking inspiration from a piece by Arnold Schoenberg called “Pierrot Lunaire.” The combination of instruments necessary for performing the piece were nearly the same as those the consort members played, lacking only a clarinet. “We will look for pieces that are written specifically for our instrumentation,” Deaver said. The consort will even split into smaller groups to perform specific pieces. They will do this to perform the Debussy piece consisting of violin, cello, and piano.
Stuckenbruck does not differentiate classical music from other styles, it simply happens to be a genre of music that he favors. “I love many kinds of music from all over the place; anything that is thoughtfully put together is music that I’d love to listen to,” he said. Kim has been surrounded by classical music her entire life and finds this style of music to be the most natural to play and hear. Everyone has a difference preference for their favorite music, and both Kim and Stuckenbruck find this fact of diversity to be one of the things that makes music so amazing.
“God forbid the day there would be no music,” Stuckenbruck said, “Classical music is very special; the sounds, the textures, the way it’s combined, is like a great piece of literature.”
The consort hopes for students attending the event to not only feel an impact from the music being played, but also gain a better understanding of music skills and learn from watching their professors perform. “Through my experience hearing your teachers perform, you just really compare it to your private lessons,” Kim said. Students may learn a lot in lessons, but hearing the skills executed in performance could greatly help their understanding. “We’re always pushing our students to strive for music excellence, so we think it’s really good for them to also see us do the same,” Deaver said.
The concert will be held on Nov. 2 at 8:15 p.m. in the Great Hall, with free admission. “It’s so intimate there, and that’s the best way to listen to music because then it’s personal,” Stuckenbruck said, “We tend to think everything has to be big to be good.” By performing in a smaller space, “We get to experience the subtleties of music in a personal manner.”

From Oct. 23-28, the Student Art League (S.A.L) Gallery showcased the work of graduate art student, Thomas Alma. He uses painting as creative outlet and a way to escape the world into his imagination. Alma showed several of his paintings, most of them being some of his older works. A reception was held on Wednesday, Oct. 26 from 5-8 p.m.
This was Alma’s first solo art exhibition, “It’s really overwhelming and the space is kind of intimidating,” he said. In the past, Alma had been chosen from hundreds of artists to have his work featured in a show by Long Island Art Educators.
As a resident of Long Beach, he gets most of his inspiration from the ocean. It is the primary subject of his series “Shore? Sure!” “A big part of my being is the ocean and being by the water,” Alma said. Whether it is in the hot months of the summer or in the cold of winter doing a polar bear run, the beach is where you can find him. “Knowing him as a friend helps you to be able to see and understand the different aspects of his life coming through his artwork,” Bryan Murphy, Alma’s friend, said.
He primarily works with acrylic, arranging it in an array of different colors and techniques. Some of his favorite styles of art include impressionism, post-impressionism, abstract art and cubism. Alma favors the artist Pablo Picasso. “He’s so brave in trying to remain innocent without actually being innocent,” he said. Alma does not focus on reaching a specific end result with his artwork. “I enjoy the process and the emotion involved with that process,” he said.
Seung Lee, director of fine arts and graduate students, taught Alma for the past two years and noted his growth as an artist. “Someone who has done as much work as Thomas should be able to showcase his pieces in a professional setting,” Lee said, “It is important that artists know how to promote themselves and their works.”
“It is commendable the things that he can do within his artwork and how well he works with color,” Mark Webster, artist and friend of Alma, said. As he continues to influence the young minds of tomorrow, this may be his first solo show, but not his last.

Materials:
Glass containers or mason jars
Real or artificial craft leaves
Mod Podge ($1.49 at Michaels) or hot glue gun Sponge brush(optional)
Rubbing alcohol
First, make sure the outside of the jar is clean. Wipe it gently with rubbing alcohol to remove any grease or dust; the leaves will not stick if the jar is dirty or oily. Then, if using fabric leaves, bend the leaves to loosen them up enough to be easily manipulated. For real leaves, dampen them with mod podge.
To decorate, dip your brush in the mod podge and paint a thin layer on a section of the jar. Once the layer becomes tacky, attach a leaf to that section. Paint more mod podge on top of the leaf in thin layers. Make sure to atten the leaf by starting at the center of it and smoothing outward toward the edges. When using artificial craft leaves, you may choose to use a hot glue gun to carefully apply adhesive.
Repeat this process to layer more leaves on top until you achieve your desired look. Once all the leaves are in place and covered, allow a few hours to dry. This is a simple and fun fall-themed decor, perfect for a dorm or bedroom. The decorated container can be used as a candle holder, pencil jar or anything else you see fit.

The day after the football team defeated Southern Connecticut in it’s annual Homecoming game, 52-35, the women’s swimming team began its season with a win, adding to LIU Post’s successful sports week.
The women’s swimming team scored a 110-89 victory over Central Connecticut State University, at the Pratt Recreation Center on Oct. 21.
The Pioneers had a historic outing, breaking the 200-yard medley relay pool record set in 2015. Senior Laura Benfeldt, junior Caitlin Johnstone, junior Karis Fuller, and sophomore Tove Sparrman defeated Central Connecticut by nearly five seconds (1:43.73), breaking the 2015 record by one second.
Karis Fuller, a double major in sociology and journalism from London, England, said breaking the record was a pleasant surprise. “Taking down the pool record was a nice surprise, especially so early in the season,” she said. “It set the tone for the meet and hopefully the year to come.”
Johnstone, Fuller, and Bendfeldt remained perfect throughout the meet, dominating Central Connecticut in five events. Fuller and Bendfeldt earned first place finishes in the 200-yard freestyle (1:56.15) and the 50-yard freestyle (23.79). Additional first place finishes from the trio came in the 200 IM (Johnston, 2:09.99), the 100-yard free (Bendfeldt, 51.53) and the 100-yard backstroke (Fuller, 56.87). “Since doubling the number of girls on our team from last year, we have become competitive in race times and numbers. Central Connecticut is a tough D1 team, but we felt so confident going into the meet and got the win,” said freshman public relations major Alex Cordova, who swam in three races, including a third place finish in the 100-yard butterfly. “I would give our first meet an A+. We swam out of our minds and did it as team; the atmosphere was energetic and fun, which we will bring to every pool deck we walk on to.”
The Pioneers return to the swimming pool on Saturday, NOV. 4 at 1 p.m. at the University of Bridgeport.
