The Bowling Club is the newest addition to the many clubs and activities on campus. It sets itself apart from the Division I Bowling Team because it offers a fun way for students to enjoy the sport without the stress of competition.
“We are mostly for fun,” Michael Mele, sophomore accounting major and president of the club, said. “We’re also going to try to do some tournaments, but the big thing is our weekly meetings. That will just be for fun, if you want to come and learn, anyone will teach you.”
The NCAA does not recognize mens bowling as a sport, so any male bowling teams needto be recognized by the United States Bowling Congress in order to participate in tournaments. This limitation is what originally inspired the creation of the club.
“When I came here there was no bowling team or anything like that for the boys,” Melesaid. “We know that there is one for girls, so we founded it with the intention of giving boys a place to show their skills.”
The club hopes to become an officially recognized team in the future, but will remain arecreational activity in the meantime.
The Bowling Club is not exclusive to male students. Anyone is welcome to join regardless of gender or skill level.
The club meets every Friday at 2.p.m. at Levittown Lanes. Students can contact Michael Mele at Michael.mele@my.liu.edu or follow the club on Instagram @liubowlingclub for more information.

The Fashion Network will host its third annual fashion show on Thursday, April 23, at8 p.m. in the Fish Bowl.
The theme for this year’s show is New York City streetwear. Models will wear casual clothing such as hoodies and jeans as they walk the runway, showing off their style with a New York flare.
This year’s show will differ greatly from previous years as it will feature designs made by students from Post and other universities. In the past most of the clothes for the show were donated from local boutiques. The Student Body Boutique will also contribute clothes for the event.
Members of the Fashion Network are attempting to get all kinds of students to model in and attend the show. In the past, students who modeled in the show were mostly female, according to Hema Chimpidi, junior fashion merchandising major and president of the Fashion Network. Since streetwear is a unisex, theme she hopes that more male students will be able to model this year.
Admission to the event will cost $5 for students, and $10 for non-students. This year 15percent of proceeds will be donated to Delivering Good, a nonprofit organization thatgives items such as books, clothing and toys to children in need.
If any students are interested in designing clothes or modeling for the event ,they cancontact the Fashion Network at Post-fashionnetwork@my.liu.edu.

Editor’s Note: Jason Glickman is a staff writer for the Pioneer.
Legends are not invincible is a realization that struck students across campus when basketball star Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26.
Kobe Bryant was considered an inspiration and a leader. After being drafted in 1996 by the Charlotte Hornets, he was immediately traded to the Los Angeles Lakers where he remained for his 20-season career. Bryant accumulated eight awards throughout his years playing pro ball and was an 18-time All-Star athlete. He holds the second most points ever scored in a single game, 81 points playing for the Lakers versus the Raptors in 2006, and he holds the fourth spot for most points scored over a career.
He also appeared in the NBA finals seven times, and of those seven appearances, he won five championships. Out of the five finals, Bryant was awarded MVP twice. He also was a 15-time member of the All-NBA team, and a 12-time member of the All-Defensive team. In 2008, he won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. All of these accolades have cemented Kobe Bryant as one of the best athletes to numerous fans.
Bryant passed away tragically with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven other people while traveling to a charity basketball game.
The event swept the nation in disbelief, and has left people heartbroken, including students.
James Waldof, a junior broadcasting major, was one of those affected by Bryant’s death. “[Kobe] is one of the biggest legends that I’ve grown up to know, and to know he passed away in such a tragic way, in a helicopter crash, and to know that his daughter was with him is absolutely awful,” he said. “When I heard about it, I got so upset that I cried for like two hours. I couldn’t get over it, for him to go out like that is bad because he was just starting his family, he retired a year or two ago. It’s just awful.”
Bryant’s death has touched several students, even those who aren’t basketball fans.
“It’s still a human life, regardless of whether or not you’re a basketball fan, he was still a really big guy in the industry,” Jason Glickman, a junior broadcasting major, said. “Even as a sports fan, not necessarily a basketball fan, this is one of the biggest surprising deaths, at least in my lifetime.”
Within the campus community, faculty members also felt his death to be near and dear to them. Deirdre Moore, the former head women’s basketball coach, was especially mourning the loss of Bryant.
“When I came out of traffic, I had 65 text messages about Kobe Bryant passing away,” she said. The messages came from former students, even going as far back as the class of 2012. “The emotions were just very strong. I didn’t want to believe it,” she said.
“Every time I see [a tribute], I have to fight back tears,” Moore said. “He meant that much to so many people, to see that kind of effect on so many people, it puts sport into a different category. People feel like they have lost someone they knew, even if they might not have known him.”
Moore took Bryant’s death as a reminder of our own mortality.
“It just let’s you know you’re not invincible. You should spend time with the people that matter most. You should keep the little things little,” she said. “Sometimes we let things escalate and build up and we’re so upset, and life ends and it wasn’t really that important; It’s just a part of life.” Moore hopes that Bryant knew how adored hewas before he passed away.
The death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna have touched the hearts of many. As Ayinde Johnson, a freshman journalism major, said, “Heroes come and go, but legends are forever.”

“Alice in Wonderland,” “Murder Mysteries,” and the campus’ gardens all have something in common this semester. They’re each a part of the Emerging Student Theatre Artists’ (ESTA) spring 2020 season. ESTA is the student-run theatre organization on campus where students propose, direct, choreograph, and star in their own productions every semester.
“We take submissions from people in the club. Once all the submissions are in, we then meet as a board. We read through their submissions and we have to see if it’s right for our club. We then decide as a board what’s going to be best for the season and try to schedule it out,” Anna Gwaltney, senior musical theatre major and president of ESTA, said. This detailed selection process is what shapes each unique season of student-produced shows with a variety of plays, musicals and student-written pieces. ESTA also consists of an improvisation troupe within the club called “No Control.”

“I love that we get to provide a place for people outside of the work that they do within the department,” Kevin DiCarlo, freshman musical theatre major, said. “Even people who aren’t in the department get to create, express themselves, and try things they don’t normally get to do.”
DiCarlo said that participating in ESTA productions has changed his life. He starred in the fall 2019 musical “25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.” He’ll be directing the musical “Alice,” staged in the Rifle Range Theatre on Saturday, Feb. 29 at 2 p.m. and Sunday, March 1 at 8 p.m.
Any student is welcome to join ESTA. Gwaltney described the 2020 season as “bold.” Their upcoming performance of “Murder Mystery” directed by Steele Whitney and Jules Rivera will take place on Saturday, Feb. 15 at 8 p.m. in the Great Hall. The 24-hour play festival is an event where a group of playwrights, directors and actors work together for 24 hours to write, stage and perform plays. It will take place on the Little Theatre Mainstage on Monday, Feb. 17. The first No Control Show of the season will be on Friday, Feb. 14 in the Hillwood Commons Cinema, a time has yet to be announced as of Sunday, Feb. 2. “The Space we Take,” directed by Kylie Brown will take place on Feb. 22 at 9 p.m., and the Secret Garden will take place in the campus outdoor garden at noon on April 25 with a rain date for the following day.
For more information, students can check out the club’s Instagram @esta.liupost

Guess who’s back, back again? Eminem dropped his 11th studio album, “Music to Be Murdered By” on Friday, Jan. 17. He released the album without warning; it seemingly came out of nowhere, similar to how he released “Kamikaze” back in 2018.
Even though the album attracted instant attention on social media,  some dismissed it since it came out at the same time as the late  Mac Miller’s album “Circles.” Others dismissed it because his music’s style has changed.
Some students didn’t finish listening to the album or even start listening to it at all. “Listening to Eminem in 2020? Couldn’t be me,” Jada Harrison, a junior broadcasting major, said.
The album features multiple younger artists, such as the late Juice WRLD, Ed Sheeran, Anderson .Paak, Don Toliver, and Young M.A. While the younger artists delivered flashy verses and catchy hooks, Eminem supplied a flurry of lyricism and double entendres to complement.
Of course, it wouldn’t be an Eminem album without controversy. He brought up the Manchester bombing at the Ariana Grande concert that happened back in 2017. The mention came on the second track of the album, “Unaccommodating,” which served as an intro to the hard-hitting “Darkness” five songs later.
However, some students appreciate the controversy. Freshman nutrition major Adriana Ciminelli loves that Eminem says what he thinks. “It’s so raw and honest,” she said. “He doesn’t sugar coat anything at all and just says it how it is.”
One of the most impactful of the songs on the album was “Darkness,” where Eminem wrote from the perspective of the Las Vegas shooter from 2017 while drawing parallels to his younger, drug-addicted self. At the beginning of the song, Eminem uses lyrics such as, “If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka, that’s a lot of shots, huh?” That could refer to either his younger self abusing alcohol, or to the shooter.
As with all music, some like the album, some dislike it. Overall, Eminem has done better in the past, but this album is still significantly better than 2017’s “Revival” or 2018’s “Kamikaze.” If a student has some time to kill and wants to listen to some new music, they can put on some headphones, and listen to some “Music to Be Murdered By.”

Members of the Photography Club are celebrating their artwork via a gallery showcase titled “Resurgence,” on display in the SAL Gallery located in the B. Davis Schwartz Library from Jan. 28 until Feb.9. The Photography Club is not exclusive to photography majors, and to this effect, the gallery features pieces from students of all years and across all majors, and is open for all to attend.

Students in the club are excited to have their work featured in a public forum. This is the first event hosted by the Photography Club in the spring 2020 semester after a fall 2019 semester filled with events, so club members areeager to show their work off to the public.
A variety of topics are covered in the photos lining the walls. Some photographers have chosen to focus their art on the natural world, while others snapped pictures of friends and some even took self portraits. Each photographer has a set of three pictures on display, each one connected to each other to convey their meaning.
For freshman art therapy major, Kelcey Dilling, this is her first time showcasing her work in a formal gallery setting. “My series is called the ‘Self Reflection’ series, it basically is about somebody reflecting on something that made them a different person, and spending the time by themselves to really grow from the experience they’ve had in the past,” she said.

This is also a first time experience for freshman photography major, Stephanie Varone. “Since the topic was resurgence and regrowth, I did a couple different models and had them view themselves how they wanted to be perceived, and also a more natural side of them,” Varone said. In some photos, the model iswearing makeup, and in contrast, the same model is portrayed without makeup and with their natural hair. “[It shows] their natural beauty in a way, and how they’re going to grow this year.”
James Brennan, freshman art therapy major, created a collection called “Where Flowers Can’t Grow.” “It was my final project for last semester, and I thought it connected with the theme of growth, because the concentrationwas connecting flowers and people and growing in places that they’re not really meant to thrive,” they said.
There is also a significant individual connection artists have with the work they create. Brennan’s personal experiences led to the inspiration of their collection. “It kept going through my head of flowers bursting out something or growing in concrete, I thought that was really pretty,” Brennan said. “I’ve been through a lot, and the idea of flowers being able to thrive in those places kind of inspired me to thrive in places I was struggling in.”
The artists went through their own processes for creating their individual series. “I took [photos of] my friend Katie back home in Massachusetts, and I decided that I wanted to incorporate flowers and snow and have a white background, and take her places in Massachusetts that are important to me,” Dilling said.
Varone went through several different ideas before arriving at this one. She considered the concept of growth and how to portray it in\ winter. “How can I show not just nature, but how someone themselves can grow during the year,” she said.
Varone also took this opportunity to practice a method of editing photos so that different layers could be added. “In one picture there’s three of the same person, so I was able to edit them all together to show the different sides of them but all in one picture,” she said.
Brennan is a special effects artist, so they worked with makeup, latex and craft materials to achieve the final image of flowers growing from a human arm. After attaching fake flowers to their own arm, they edited the photos with photoshop to adjust the lighting.
“Resurgence” is the first of many events from the Photography Club in the spring 2020 semester and is free to attend.

Professional music artists, The Shanghai String Quartet, will perform for students at a music department convocation on campus, and personally work with the students to help develop their skills.
Laura Bogen, a junior music major, has worked with the group before and is looking forward to their visit to campus. “The Shanghai are a highly world renowned classical ensemble quartet who are famous worldwide for their exceptional skill, musicality and their cohesiveness,” she said. “They are an incredible ensemble to experience and to work with.” She got the chance to work with the Quartet in spring 2019 and back in high school. “They came and they listened to our string ensemble play, and they gave us tips.”
The Quartet has performed professionally since 1983, and provides students with a sounding board and tips in furthering their music careers. “I actually performed two pieces for them and it was great because I got feedback.” Sarah Bogen, first-year music performance masters student, said. “They’re always surprising and they always interpret the music so beautifully that you just get lost in it,” Sarah said.
The Quartet has had a long relationship with the Tilles Center and has worked with and performed for students and faculty at the university for over 10 years. “It’s a wonderful opportunity for our students to have interactions with them,” Maureen Hynes, director oforchestral and string studies, said.
The group is a great example of a role model for aspiring performers, according to Bogen. “As music students who want to pursue this in their lives, it’s good to see people who are in this field and are successful in it, and who love what they do,” she said.
“[They are] inspiring because every time I hear them I just want to go home and practice for six hours.” Bogen said. “The only word I can say is ‘incredible’ because they just pay so much attention to every little detail that most people wouldn’t notice.”
The convocation will take place on Monday, Feb. 10 at 12:30 p.m. in the Krasnoff Theater, and all students are welcome to attend. Students can anticipate another performance from the Quartet at the Tilles Center on Sunday, March 22.
Hynes encouraged all students to attend. “By all means come, because they are great performers. What they bring will be a wonderful introduction, and I think watching any live performance is inspiring to people,” she said.

The baseball team is ready to kick off their inaugural season, with their first game being played in Spartanburg, SC on Friday, Feb. 14 against the Spartans of University of South Carolina Upstate.
Head Coach Dan Pirillo, former head coach for Brooklyn Blackbirds, will lead the team together with pitching coach Tom Carty, who worked under Pirillo for The Blackbirds, and hitting coach Mike Gaffney who is the former head coach of the Pioneers. The Sharks have a balance of experienced and new players on the roster which consists of 15 players from Brooklyn, seven players from Post, eight freshmen, and five transfer athletes.
Despite being newly branded Sharks, Coach Pirillo states his expectations are the same as always. “Our expectations every year are to go out and compete in the conference, [and] get back to a NCAA regional,” he said.
All players, whether from Brooklyn, Post, transfer students or freshmen, will all come together for the common goal to win according to Pirillo. “Baseball unites people and that’s something our team has embraced from day one,” he said. “It didn’t matter what gear or what team they were on, they all got a chance to play between the lines and compete together as a baseball team and stay together through the fall.”
Coach Pirillo is most excited about all the competitive teams they will play during their non conference matchups, and all the new rivalries they will create. “We get to play Army, St.John’s, new local matchups such as StonyBrook and Hofstra, and the addition of Merrimack to the conference,” he said.
Coach Carty has a similar take on the team’s expectations. “Getting to the NEC tournament is first off. Opportunities to play in the NCAA is the ultimate goal, but we have to secure a top 4 spot in [the] NEC,” Carty said. He also said he is very excited to see his three senior pitchers in action this season, and hope they step up in their final year of collegiate play. “Patrick Clyne, Jackson Svete, and Rob Griswold are three senior pitchers who have been in big moments in their career, and as sophomores were pitchers who got big outs in the NCAA tournament,” he said.
Coach Gaffney is ready to take his winning history and tradition from Division II to Division I. He said one challenge this year is “seeing better competition on a more consistent basis”, but also thinks the blending of the three groups will give them a great opportunity to compete and win at the Division I level.
Ryan Neuweiler, a redshirt sophomore sports management major, who is excited to get back on the field and compete in the NEC hoping to experience a winning season like he did his freshman year when The Blackbirds won the conference. He remembers the chemistry the team had that year and the feeling of “running out after the final out on the mound for the dog pile in celebration.”
Nick De Salvo, a junior sports management major who played for The Blackbirds before the merger, hopes the players’ experiences of winning will be to their advantage. “We got to win the conference my freshman year and Post won the conference last year, so everyone has that winning mentality and I hope it transfers to this year,” he said.
Cooper Shearon, Davyn Adamsheck and Cade Biddle are all junior sports management majors who transferred to LIU this past fall. They all believe the team can be on the top of the conference as long as they stick togetherand work hard. “We can do a lot of damage,” Shearon said.

The women’s lacrosse team currently puts together the final pieces to prepare for, what they hope will be, a successful season.
The 2020 spring season will be the first time the team competes in the Division I North Eastern Conference as the Sharks, and for some of the players, it will be their first time competing as Division I athletes.
Sophomore attacker Emma Cantwell, who played for the Pioneers last year,said she is excited to take on the new competition that awaits at the Division Ilevel. “The team is ready and [we] can’t wait to prove that we are a team that will be tough to beat,” Cantwell said.

Maddy Schaefer, a sophomore attacker and midfielder, agrees. “I am excited to face the challenge of stronger opponents and stronger competition in anew conference,” she said.

Kelly Hughes, a sophomore defender, also looks forward to the new season and to be able to bond with her new teammates and create program history. “Ihonestly feel so blessed to be part of the new LIU family and I hope to impact the way the program is going to be run for years to come,” she said. “I am looking forward to bonding with all of my teammates as we become stronger as one program,” Schaefer added.
The Sharks started their training in the fall where practices “involved moreconditioning of the body” according to Cantwell. Now when the team is in season, the practices are more focused on “team development and play execution,” she said. “Fall training was less intense, but our goal to prepare for the season remained the same,” Schaefer added.
The women’s lacrosse team will play nine games total before conference playbegins. Their first conference game is on Friday, March 27, at 4 p.m. at theBethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville where The Sharks will face Mount St. Mary’s.

The women’s rugby team is looking for new team members. Head Coach Colleen Doherty will hold informational meetings on Tuesday, Feb. 11 at 5.30 p.m. and Wednesday, Feb. 19 at 12.30 p.m. The meetings will provide details about tryout dates, as well as introduce both new and experienced athletes to the game of rugby.

The reason for tryouts is to “increase numbers and round out the roster with crossover athletes,” Doherty said.
Tryouts will be geared towards prior athletes, including former high school athletes or collegiate athletes. However, anyone is welcome to try out; there is no experience necessary.
“We want all people thinking about coming to the informational sessions,” Doherty said. “We have several members on the team who never played rugby before college, but often did a variety of sports in high school.”
Doherty encourages out-of-season athletes or fall senior athletes who are finished with their season to come to one of the informational meetings.
Any further questions about tryouts can be emailed to Doherty at Colleen.Doherty@liu.edu.

The women’s ice hockey team won their final regular home game of the inaugural season with a score of 7-1 against Post University on Friday, Feb. 1. The Sharks dominated the entire contest, outshooting the Eagles of Post University 67 to 39, with 45 to 24 of those shots being on goal.
The blue and gold took a lead midway through the first period and never looked back after freshman Renee Hoffmann scored her 11th goal of the season, assisted by her sister Julia Hoffmann, and Carrigan Umpherville.
The Sharks scored two more goals before the end of the first period, as freshman Matilda af Bjur and Grace Dima both scored to give The Sharks a 3-0 advantage. The lead stretched to 4-0 early in the second period when Umpherville scored on a feed from behind the net by Renee Hoffmann.
Post University answered in the second period as their Sadie Storm ripped a shot in power-play. The Sharks answered with back to back goals from freshman Alva Johnson, Abby Latorella and Umpherville. Umpherville thereby scored her team-leading 12th goal of the year.
Freshman Saige McKay netted her third goal of the year to close out the game. Freshman goalkeeper, Mia McLeod stopped 23 shots on the day.
The win places the women’s ice hockey team at fourth place in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance standings and they will host the number five seed Saint Michael’s College in the first round of the playoffs. With the season winding down, the team looks to enter the playoffs strong, but it will require great teamwork and them paying attention to the details.
“The team needs to stay bonded and focus on the little things to have success in the playoffs,” forward Megan Bouver said.
The Sharks will close out the regular season with four road contests over the next two weeks, beginning with a two-game set in Winchendon, Massachusetts against Franklin Pierce University. The first game will be played on Friday, Feb. 7 at 7 p.m. at Jason Ritchie Arena.
