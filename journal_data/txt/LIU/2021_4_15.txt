New York has become the first state to introduce a “covid passport” system. Covid passports are apps that verify the vaccination status of an individual. 
The NYS Excelsior Pass Wallet, New York’s version of the passport, was announced last month by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The mobile app is a voluntary system that can be used to gain entry into participating establishments. The app will be updated to include the users vaccination status, as well as their last negative test result, according to the New York state website.
The new technology is not being adapted everywhere, as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis banned their use in the state and will forbid any businesses from requiring them. 
“It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society,” he said during a press conference.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed an executive order limiting the potential use of vaccine passports in the states. The order will not allow state agencies or organizations that receive state funding to require proof of vaccination.
“Government should not require any Texan to show proof of vaccination and reveal private health information just to go about their daily lives,” he said in a video posted on his Twitter page.
The new technology won’t be federally mandated according to President Joe Biden’s Chief Medical Adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, leaving it up to the states to decide how it will be used.
Passports showing proof of vaccination could speed up international travel re-openings, but the idea of requiring immunization credentials has become a point of contention among the public.
Alexandra Ferragamo (‘20) believes that the Excelsior app is an overstep, and will interfere with people’s right to privacy.
“Why should others have to inform the public if they were or were not vaccinated,” she said. “Does it somehow make you a better person if you did [or] didn’t?”
Charli Beshers (‘20) believes that the Excelsior app is a necessary step in bouncing back from the pandemic, but doesn’t think that a vaccine should completely exempt anyone from social distancing procedures.
“I think definitely that we should be careful about not giving too much leeway, like just because you are vaccinated and either can’t get it or can’t die from it, doesn’t mean you’re not a carrier of it still. So I mean, you still have to be careful with taking precautions but that should be common sense about looking out for fellow humans,” she said.
Sophomore occupational therapy major Gabbi Laech agrees with Beshers that the app is essential in today’s society.
“I think in the past I would say it’s a breach of privacy, but I think right now that it’s probably necessary,” she said.
 The NYS Excelsior Pass Wallet is available for download on IOS and Android devices.

Spring weather and vaccinations have given students a chance to show off their personal style on campus and at home. 
Some students focus their style on what’s trendy and new, Sophomore fashion merchandising major Ashley Forestal keeps up with the trends, but doesn’t let them limit her style.  
“I love following and keeping up with the latest trends. I keep them in mind when putting outfits together, but if something isn’t considered to be “in” at that exact moment, I don’t let that stop me from wearing it,” Forestal said.
 Freshman business major Emily Szalkowski likes to blend trendy pieces with her own personal style when getting dressed for the day. 
“Since quarantine started it’s become trendy to express yourself and be unique. You can wear literally whatever you want, and it would be hot,” Szalkowski said. “When I get dressed for the day I always think about the image I want to give off. The way you dress says a lot about your character.”
COVID-19 has affected the fashion industry greatly as many have had to work from home and shopping centers and retail stores slowly opened back up. 
“The fashion industry was disrupted and impacted greatly over the last year, but that hasn’t stopped new trends from emerging,” sophomore fashion merchandising major Ashley Forestal said. “The latest trends I’ve noticed are wrap skirts, mini bags, and puffy sleeves.”
Sophomore fashion merchandising major Cassandra Cerbone reflects on how the pandemic has altered the state of fashion. Since a lot of time is now spent at home, cozy sets have become her go-to. 
“Cozy clothing has become such a trend due to corona,” Cerbone said. “I used to work in a boutique, and we would get more matching sets than dresses and blouses.” 
Repurposed fashion is another trend Cerbone has noticed this year. She has incorporated this trend into her small business, “Tailgate Apparel USA” where she upcycles college gear and other clothing.
“I love to make elastic crop tops for myself and my small business, “Tailgate Apparel”,” she said. “I feel like it adds a little extra detail to a basic outfit.”
Freshman business and marketing major Gianna Pelella is also a small business owner who keeps trends in mind when designing for herself and her customers. Pelella believes that confidence shines through whatever you’re wearing.
“Right now I feel like urban styles, comfortable clothes, and a lot of early 2000s looks are really popular,” Pelella said. “I try to pay attention to which graphics and styles are trendy so that when I design logos and designs to put on clothing for my customers, I know the customer will love it and be in style.”
Clothing from “Custom By Gia” and “Tailgate Apparel USA” are available online.

The time has finally come for Swifties, “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” has dropped, featuring 27 tracks. Many songs were on the original “Fearless” album, and others are never before heard and “from the vault.”
On Feb. 11, Taylor Swift announced on her Instagram that she would be undertaking this project, leaving fans anticipating the April 9 premiere date. It wasn’t until week that she told her fans what tracks would be on the album.
Swift is re-recording her old songs in order to reclaim the rights to her own music. Currently, her old manager is making the money from the streams Swift’s music gets. After re-recording, Swift will be the primary owner of her own lyrics and melodies, after over 10 years.
Students are listening to the album on repeat and feeling the nostalgia they’ve been gearing up for since the Feb. 11 announcement. 
“It’s beautiful, I’ve been obsessed with all the little differences between the old and new versions. Her voice sounds so much more mature now,” junior musical theatre major Ellie Lauthner said.
Lauthner has been a longtime fan of swift and has kept up with her music and news. She was excited when Swift posted the song list a week ago.
“I was super excited, It was cool to see all of the new songs, it was cool to see all the artists she [is] collaborating with,” Lauthner said.
Swift is collaborating with artists such as Colbie Caillat, and Keith Urban.
“I am really excited to listen to change, and breathe, she’s collaborating with Colbie Calliet again, and I’m excited to hear how both of their voices sound together now that they’re older,” Lauthner said.
Lauthner loves Swift’s music and even sang “The Way I Loved You” for one of her midterms in her musical theatre class recently.
“The setlist made it more real, and the new album cover too, it makes me nostalgic more than anything,” Lauthner said.
Swift recreated her album from the original “Fearless” album with her own personal 2021 style.
Swift’s music captures the hearts and ears of others, even those who aren’t superfans.
“Her songs just got so catchy that I eventually ended up liking them,” sophomore forensic science major Tyran Williams said.
Williams never set aside time to listen to Swift growing up, and no one in his family did either, but sometimes her music played at his school.
“I’m all for artists being independent,” William said.
Williams learned about the struggles Swift has been facing and immediately took her side. He acknowledges that the music industry can be evil and can take advantage of younger artists.
“I’ll be more inclined to listen to the re-releases rather than the new songs,” Williams said. 
Like many, Williams will be listening to “Fearless (Taylor’s Version).” In just the first 24 hours of the album’s release, Swift surpassed 500,000 worldwide sales.
In an Instagram post with over three million likes, Swift posted a picture of herself with the caption, “It was the night things changed. Fearless (Taylor’s Version) is out now.”

Volleyball has made postseason competition and will be taking on the 18 Seed University of Pittsburgh Panthers in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The tournament is held in Omaha, Nebraska, and the two teams will face off on Wednesday, April 14 at 10:30 p.m. on ESPN 3. This will be the third time that Pitt and LIU have met at the Division one level, with the Panthers holding a 3-0 advantage in the all-time series. The winner of this match will take on 14 Seed Utah in the second round of competition on April 15. 
This is LIU’s first NCAA Volleyball Tournament appearance since 2017. Head Coach Ken Ko credits the team’s willingness to play and different experiences as to why they made the tournament. 
“Well, it’s a huge accomplishment, and I’m just grateful that everyone showed up for practice. We couldn’t have a team if we didn’t have people opt-in, and so that was really important for us in the beginning,” he said. “The other part is we have eight players on the roster that never played Division I volleyball before, and we have six returners with one who has tournament experience. So we are very young, and I think just being here and being together is a real honor and we’re excited for it.” 
For NEC Defensive Player of the Year, junior libero, Anastasia Scott, having the opportunity to compete is an honor.
 “Overall, we’re just very happy that we get the opportunity to play any game, and this year being such a unique and tough year, we’re super excited to be one of the few teams selected to go to the tournament,” she said.
When it comes to preparing for the tournament, Second-Team All-NEC sophomore middle blocker Miranda Strongman feels that preparation off the court can help their performance on the court.
 “We’re focused on maintaining our physical health and making sure we eat properly and stay well-rested. We did have to travel, but making sure that we’re taking care of ourselves and our bodies and our mental health and getting all of our stuff taken care of, so that we can take care of the volleyball,” she said.
Coach Ko helped to put the steady mindset of the team into perspective.
 “Our goals are to control what we can control. Pitt is obviously an amazing team and experienced, but we have an opportunity, just like every other team has when the first whistle blows, to play the game the best that we know we can,” he said. “We’re still learning what that is for us, so we have a game plan in place, and we will determine our success based on how well we can handle the magnitude of the situation, how we work together and how resilient we are. We’re playing one of the best teams that we have faced this year, and I can’t wait to see what we do in those circumstances.”

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill legalizing the recreational use of marijuana on Wednesday March 31. After years of failed attempts at ending the widespread use of drugs, New York is expected to be one of the largest legal cannabis markets in the country.
State legislators passed the bill voting 40-23 on March 30. After it was signed by Cuomo, certain aspects of the law became effective immediately. Currently the state allows any persons aged 21 years and older to legally possess up to three ounces for recreational purposes as well as 24 grams of concentrated cannabis oil. New Yorkers are also now able to smoke marijuana anywhere that tobacco use is allowed except for vehicles.
“For too long the prohibition of cannabis disproportionately targeted communities of color with harsh prison sentences and after years of hard work, this landmark legislation provides justice for long-marginalized communities, embraces a new industry that will grow the economy, and establishes substantial safety guards for the public,” Cuomo said in a press statement. “This is a historic day.” 
 Previous attempts at legalization fell short as lawmakers were unable to make agreements regarding tax revenue. This new legislation will end the disproportionate amount of Black and Latino people incarcerated and criminalized for the usage, a point made by senators such as Liz Krueger. 
“My goal in carrying this legislation has always been to end the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana prohibition that has taken such a toll on communities of color across our state, and to use the economic windfall of legalization to help heal and repair those same communities,” Krueger said in a press release. 
Forty percent of tax revenue is said to be redistributed into Black and brown communities that have been affected. Focusing towards education and drug treatment and prevention programs, as well as expunging the records of those with marijuana related offenses that are no longer criminal. 
Students, like senior broadcasting major Jason Glickman, feel that this is a positive step forward for New York. 
“It’s about time, I mean people are going to smoke it anyway,” he said. “At least now they can do it safely, the legalization will do more good for the state economically and socially than arresting and convicting certain groups of  people more than another.” 
The industry is projected to bring in up to $350 million in tax revenue, the retail sale will tax a nine percent state tax and four percent local tax.
The swiftness surprised students like junior nursing major Jahaila Harley. 
“I was shocked that the state moved fast with the legalization,” she said. “I remember hearing talks about it before, overall I’m happy because this is a positive direction for healthcare and science.”
 Harley does have some reservations about the states handling of convicted people. 
“This is great to combat biases in the system but what do they plan to do with people who are already serving time because they were convicted before?”
Glickman and Harley both agree this is a step in the right direction towards a more progessive state. A 2018 New York Times analysis showed that Hispanic people in New York City were five times more likely to be arrested on low level marijuana crimes than white people. The numbers for Black people were a lot harsher at 15 times.
“This law comprehensively addresses the harms of overcriminalization and establishes one of the most ambitious marijuana legalization programs in the nation,”
State Director of the Drug Policy Alliance Melissa More said in a statement. “Through this sweeping legislation, New York is delivering reforms that place community reinvestment, social equity and justice at the core of the law.”

Pokemon has been capturing the hearts and minds of kids and adults alike for the past 25 years. What once started as a simple video game on the Game Boy has now evolved into a massive multi-media franchise including an ongoing trading card game, an anime currently in its 23rd season, a massive amount of merchandise and millions of copies of video games sold. With how much of an impact the franchise has had on pop culture, it should be no surprise that plenty of people on campus had their own memories of the series to share.
Steele Whitney, a theater major, was and still is a fan of the franchise. As a child, he had distinct memories of watching new episodes of the Pokemon anime on weekends and of sinking hours into “Pokemon Colosseum,” a 2004 Nintendo Gamecube game. Most importantly, Steele has always had an affinity for Pokemon trading cards. 
“As a kid, every time my mom and I would go to Target, I would always insist on getting Pokemon cards because I loved collecting them and still do,” Steele said.  
Professors Ashok and Alessandro also had fond memories of the franchise from when they were young. Alessandro owns a collection of  VHS tapes that contain the first 100 or so episodes of the Pokemon anime. 
“I would pop them in and watch them all the time and I still own them to this day,” he said. Meanwhile Ashok has memories of standing in line for the release of 1999’s “Pokemon Yellow” and of watching the first Pokemon movie in theaters. “I cried at the part where Ash turned to stone because I thought he died,” Ashok said.
Another student, named Thomas, has very strong memories of the franchise as a child. He grew up watching his brother play “Pokemon Red” and was an avid collector of the trading cards. One of the cards he owned was a holographic Charizard. This card is one of the rarest in the trading card game as it is worth several thousand dollars. “Probably my strongest memory was my younger sister ripping my holographic Charizard card in two,” he said “years later she apologized after figuring out how much it was worth.”
The Pokemon franchise’s storied history remains true in the hearts of not only our fellow students and staff, but of people of all colors and creeds all over the world. As the franchise enters its 25th year and beyond, people all around the world will continue to catch ‘em all for years to come.

The Black Student Union (BSU) and Promise hosted a series of panels to discuss Black business from Monday, Feb. 15 to Friday, Feb. 19.
Each day of the week highlighted a different business owner who spoke about their business and their particular field of expertise. Speakers featured ranged from owners of clothing and cosmetic companies, such as PrettyEyez Cosmetics LLC, to entrepreneur’s. 
“We used our resources and connections to reach out to the different companies,” a representative from the BSU said. “We explained what we wanted to accomplish and worked out availability for each day of the week.”
On Wednesday, Feb. 17, DeAndre Smith, a former Post student, spoke about his clothing brand X Nihilo. The brand, pronounced “Ex Nihilio” means “out of nothing” in Latin. 
Smith spoke about the process behind starting his own brand, and his motivations. He said that he is “not in it for the money” and that he only designs clothes that he would personally wear. 
The event was part of a series of ongoing events hosted by BSU and Promise to celebrate Black History Month.
“We feel as though the Black Business Development Week was successful,” a representative from BSU said. “We definitely would like to do this event again next year and have more businesses on the panel.”
