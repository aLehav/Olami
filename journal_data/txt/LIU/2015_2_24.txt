The Model United Nations club is going to participate in the National Model UN conference in New York City from March 22 – 26. Alongside over 5,000 college students from around the world, they will discuss and attempt to solve global issues. Sixteen members have registered for the National Model UN Conference in March, and the LIU Post club will represent the Republic of Moldova. With less than a month left, the club members are striving towards becoming representable UN delegates.
“I yield my time to the chair,” said junior Political Science major Siri Birkeland, as she wrapped up her speech about including vulnerable populations in economic and social development. She was one of the first club members – who are also known as international delegates –to get the formal ending line correct during the club’s mock conference.
Formalities, such as how to speak to the chair and other delegates and keeping speeches within the time limit, seemed to be the most challenging obstacle as the club members hustled through the session, which was held on Feb. 12 during common hour in Hillwood.
“Today was a very quick mock session; it usually lasts for a whole day, so we tried to make it very simplified,” said Nigina Khaitova, Founder and Co- President of the Model UN club at LIU Post. She said today was the first Model UN experience for many of the delegates, and that some of them are still frustrated about how to behave in the given context. “But we will practice more, and we will get prepared,” Khaitova said.
Khaitova, who is a freshman International Studies major from Uzbekistan, started the club with fellow freshman Stacey Wells in Oct. 2014. By then, she already had great experience with the UN. She has started three Model UN clubs in different universities in her hometown, interned at the UN Information Office in Uzbekistan, and was a UN Youth Ambassador of Uzbekistan.
In addition, she served as host and producer of her own weekly podcast, “UNews Weekly,” where she discussed the work of UN Agencies in Uzbekistan.
Khaitova explained that the club’s mission is to make more students knowledgeable about the UN system, create more opportunities for them to practice diplomatic debates, and obtain good contacts with the UN. That includes learning how to create position papers, how to debate, and what language to use.
“I joined the club to learn more about the UN, and how the organization work[s]. It’s exciting to learn more about public speaking and how to debate,” Birkeland said. She also described the opportunity to participate in the National Model UN Conference as a great experience.

The club, which is open to both undergraduate and graduate students of all different majors, currently has 30 members. Khaitova said that although students might not aspire to work at the UN or with global issues in the future, being a part of Model UN is a great way to obtain knowledge about some of the many different topics and fields of human life that the UN covers such as healthcare, nuclear disarmament, politics, linguistics, and others. In addition, members will obtain a UN certificate that will be beneficial for their future careers.
In the future, the Model UN club wants to work closely with the UN Headquarters, and are planning to invite guest speakers from the UN to come and talk to students, said Khaitova. The club also aspires to collaborate with the Model UN club at LIU Brooklyn to organize Model UN conferences between the campuses, as well as participate in Model UN conferences abroad.
For more information about the club, contact Khaitova at: modelunpost@gmail.com.

Due to the frequent storms, 8 a.m. Monday classes have only met one time in the last five weeks of school. Excessive class cancellations due to inclement weather can cause delays in the curriculum, and raise questions about how students and faculty will be able to make up for lost time.
“LIU faculty members have the freedom to determine how makeup classes are scheduled in the event of campus closures, taking into account what is best for all students in the class,” said Beth Wilkow, Associate Dean of Enrollment Services and Registrar. Options include holding extra classes prior to final exam week, during common hour, online classes, or on Fridays, when there are fewer classes generally held, according to Wilkow.
Many students believe that the cancellations were handled properly, and without significant consequences to their schedules. “I’m unaffected by [the cancellations] because my professor has already moved the tests to a later date, and he said we might use make-up days, which I don’t mind either,” said Anthony Chung, a junior English major.
However, other students feel as though notifications about the cancellations were made too late. “I am generally already halfway to school by the time I receive the text [from the Emergency Alert System],” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. “Because we are a largely commuter school, you would think there would be more consideration in that respect. Fortunately, I am only a little over a half an hour away, but what about the people who take the bus? Who travel over an hour to get to school? It’s not fair for the people that risk coming to school when the weather’s bad, only to find out that class was cancelled an hour or less before class even starts.”
Despite the fact that classes were cancelled on Jan. 26 at 7:08 a.m., less than an hour before classes would have begun, Chung does not believe that the cancellations were made too late.
Because the add/drop period ended on Feb. 4, questions arise on how these class cancellations will affect students in regards to being able to drop the course. “There are no classes that only meet Monday mornings at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m.,” Wilkow said. “These classes meet Mondays and Wednesdays, so students would have enough time to determine whether they wish to add or drop a course.”

The Relay For Life Committee and the Commuter Student Association hosted Battle for More Birthdays, a student talent show, on Saturday, Feb. 21. The event, which was held in the Hillwood Lecture Hall, was set to raise awareness and money for cancer research.
“It’s all about awareness, about cancer, about how to help, and about the talents of our student body.” There were fourteen acts scheduled to perform in the talent show,” said Jack Thedinga, a senior Political Science major and marketing leader for LIU Post’s Relay for Life committee.
“Throughout the course of the night, there will be a variety of different talent acts,” said Nicole Cunningham, a first year graduate student studying literacy, and president of CSA. “Some of our acts included singing and rapping performances, a live band performance, and also a Bollywood dance,” she said. “A night of fun and talent and all for an excellent cause.”
At the end of the show, the audience got the opportunity to text in their votes to determine the winner of the talent show. The talent show winners were Sharon Sextus and Neah Narvekar, who performed the Bollywood dance. Singer Ben Brinton came in second, and Rich Grillo, who did stand-up, placed third. There were also raffles available, which were generously donated by other clubs and organizations on campus. All of the night’s proceeds went to Relay for Life.
“The primary goal in any Relay for Life event is to raise awareness and money for cancer research. However, it’s also important for us as students here to help people get their talents out there for everyone to see and appreciate,” Thedinga said. “My father was diagnosed with cancer four years ago, but has been in remission for the last two years, so this is something I hold very close to my heart.”
Cunningham believes Battle for More Birthdays is an important addition to established events at Post. “With this event, our ultimate goal is to help support the cause [raising money for Relay for Life] that has become so important to many students on our campus.”
Thedinga hopes that students who attended to see their friends perform went to support the fight against cancer at the same time. “Mostly we just want people to have a great time and come out to support their friends, as well as Relay For Life. [I]t’s such a great cause,” he added.
This is the first Battle for More Birthdays, but both CSA and Relay For Life are hoping the event will be held again. “Relay has partnered with other organizations to hold various events, but this is our first talent show hosted by and for Relay For Life,” Thedinga said. “The Commuter Student Association was instrumental in helping set up this event, and I don’t think it would be possible without their continued support.”

**The following is a letter from Mary M. Lai that was addressed to Staff Writer Chloé Margulis
Dear Chloé,
I just finished reading the review of “5o Shades of Grey” in The Pioneer. I looked up to see who had written it. I thought it was written by a professional film critic from one of the media. Instead I saw it was written by a student – a staff writer. I am so proud of you.
It is an excellent review – so well written – balanced. I have not (nor do I intend to) seen the film. However, your review made me feel as though I had seen it; it’s good and bad parts.
You certainly will become a famous film critic when you graduate. God blessed you with a wonderful talent. Thank you for using it so well.
Fondly,
Mary M. Lai

There are several fresh and talented underclassmen on the LIU Post wrestling team, and then we have Johnny Brush. With a team consisting of mostly freshmen, the 32-year-old former marine sergeant is competing against athletes slightly over half his age.
While serving in the Marine Corps and working as an electrician in Local Union Number Three, Johnny Brush had the opportunity to be a Training NCO, where he was responsible for all aspects of his training. It was then that Brush realized his desire to teach.
“I felt teaching was very rewarding: it was a simple decision to go back to school to become a teacher,” Brush said. His previous work as an electrician also kept him away from his family for long stretches of time. Once Brush started school to earn his teaching degree, he had the chance to enjoy the special opportunities with his children, such as coaching their teams or simply spending a full day with them.
“When I first spoke with Coach Patrovich about wrestling for the LIU Post team, I’m sure he had some reservations. Not only am I twice the age of some of these athletes, but I haven’t been on the mat in almost fifteen years,” Brush said. As the season started, the ex-marine surprised a lot of people, including his teammates and coaches, with how hard he was willing to work as well as his dedication to the team. He believes this is why Coach Patrovich chose him as one of the team captains.
LIU Post students have mixed opinions on having Brush as the captain.
“A 32-year-old man against any college student automatically has ten or more years on his opponent. But, in his defense, he served our country and he decided what he wanted to do before he went to the military. This may bring up controversy because of his age and being an ex-marine, but I don’t see a problem with this as long as other schools do not look down upon it,” said Drew Abrahams, a sophomore Broadcasting major.
“I think it’s a fantastic thing. If someone who is older is going against younger guys, I think that it’s good for both him and the team because I’m not nearly as fit as I was when I was 18, and I’m 21 now. I can’t imagine how out of shape I’d be if I was 32. Good for him, and let him keep pushing onwards,” said Charlie DeRiso, a senior Accounting major.
Brush’s teammate, freshman Physical Education major Joe Calderone, feels like Brush has been a tremendous help along with being an excellent role model. “He shows us what hard work really is, and he’s just an amazing person. It’s exciting to see him wrestle,” Calderone said. The freshman also feels that Brush is a perfect fit for captain of the team because of his great work ethic.
Brush began wrestling when he was 11-years-old. He wrestled through high school at East Meadowbrook, where he was captain during his senior year. Brush attempted to wrestle for the All-Marine team, but was kept out due to his deployment.
“I knew teaching physical education was what I wanted to go back to school for, and Post has a great Health and Physical Education program. The staff here at Post [has] been nothing but supportive and encouraging through my entire time,” Brush said.
As a student teacher, Brush had the opportunity to study under some amazing professors and work with some great students. “Finishing off my last year at Post and being able to wrestle is more than I could ever dream of, especially competing for [the] outstanding coaching staff…Joe Patrovich, Ryan Patrovich and Mike Zimbler,” the ex- marine said.
Despite the age difference, Brush and all of his teammates get along extremely well. He’s already developed some strong bonds and friendships with the other wrestlers. Many of the younger athletes look up to him as a leader. The senior captain explained how he’s had several conversations with them either one-on-one or as a team in general about how to learn and develop more confidence on the mat.
“I think there are a lot of expectations for adult athletes, however; going out there and giving it your all is all we can really do,” Brush said. Adult athletes are expected to set the bar high, and Brush accomplishes that every time on the mat. Although Brush and his teammates have developed excellent chemistry, injuries and obligations with student teaching at Post have kept him from being around his team more, which weighs on him every day.
After he graduates from Post in May, Brush is hoping to find a job as a health and physical education teacher. Brush is currently the head wrestling coach at Island Trees Middle School, and he plans to continue coaching throughout the rest of his career.
“Wrestling is by far the most difficult and challenging sport there is. It takes more dedication and determination than any other sport, and when you go out there and wrestle, you have no one to blame but yourself for a loss, and no one to give credit to but yourself for a win,” said Brush.
Brush served in the Marine Corps from 2000-2009. He and his wife Alison have two children JJ, 9, and Ryan, 5.

Two Greek organizations are joining LIU Post’s Greek Life during the spring 2015 semester. Delta Zeta (DZ) and Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) have officially been invited by the Greek Life Directors to colonize at LIU Post.
Delta Zeta is a sorority that was founded in 1902, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon is a fraternity that was founded in 1856. Both are now recruiting their first pledge classes who will be the Founding Mothers and Fathers of the newly formed chapters.
Katherine Wieme, Greek Life & Student Involvement Director employed by LIU, said that she believes that these new additions will complement the present Greek community on campus. Both DZ and SAE emphasize scholarship, service, brotherhood/sisterhood, and leadership, according to Wieme.
DZ and SAE are currently holding recruitment events everyday in the main lobby of Hillwood Commons during common hour. In order to officially begin colonization on campus, the recruitment total for each organization must be 15 committed individuals.
The colonizing class of DZ will have girls from the other sororities as their “bigs” and the new DZ girls will be their “littles.” Each “big” could be assigned anywhere from one to three “littles” for this chapter. DZ will be the only Greek organization on campus to have an environmental movement through “Pink Goes Green” (www. dzpinkgoesgreen.org). SAE will not be looking at other fraternities for Greek Life influence, and will use current members of SAE to lead the new brothers in colonization and teach them about the fraternity.
Breana Martinez, a junior Journalism major and Vice President of Recruitment and Marketing for the Inter Greek Council for Alpha Xi Delta, signed up to be a friend of DZ and a Panhellenic “big sister” to one of the Founding Mothers of DZ. Martinez and other sorority sisters will be showing the incoming sisters of DZ the ins and outs of Greek Life by hosting events together and educating the new members of what Greek Life has to offer, as well as the benefits of being part of a sorority.
“We are expected to treat the girls as if they were littles from our own sorority,” Martinez said. “We are supposed to host events side by side as sororities and spend time with each other, which isn’t exactly a chore.”
DZ will have their “Big and Little” reveal on March 4. This will also be the start of initiation, which is a private event where the girls will be officially welcomed to the sorority and to LIU Post Greek Life.
Adam Beckerleg, Coordinator of Expansion for SAE Fraternity, has been leading the recruitments at Post, and will be the one to educate the incoming class of brothers. Beckerleg said he wants to emphasize campus and community involvement, as well as interacting with other fraternities on campus. Beckerleg also said this fraternity is a great opportunity for students because they will be the ones in control of this chapter. He compared the experience of starting this chapter to starting a business. “Students are in charge. They will be recruiting new members, and gaining leadership skills.”
For more information, log onto the fraternities national websites at www.deltazeta.org, and www.sae.net.

There were originally only six success coaches when LIU Promise began in fall 2013. One recently left, and many more were added to the Promise staff, totaling 11 success coaches: Dan Lauterman, Katelin Townsend, Alissa Karcz, Leslie Bai, Saadia Rafiq, Susan Sadkowski, Mikki Rosman, Gregory Schimmel, Kaitlin Jensen, Samantha Gottlieb, and Ali DiBona.
Of these 11, Dan Lauterman, Saadia Rafiq, Alissa Karcz, Kaitlin Jensen and Ali DiBona are five of the original six coaches. Daniel Carlos, who was one of the six original success coaches, and formally an advisor, left LIU Post, effective Nov. 26, 2014, for another job.
Since Carlos’ departure, his students have been assigned to new coaches. Those students will now have to familiarize themselves with a new coach, and that coach will have to quickly learn about their students in order to efficiently advise them.
Ali DiBona, Senior Associate Director of LIU Promise, works as a success coach as well. “I have a small caseload of students,” she said.
“Each success coach has a caseload of no more than 150 students. This allows each coach to form close relationships with their students. The LIU Promise model provides students with one point of contact at the university. A success coach ensures that their students are engaging in the campus community, meeting their academic and career goals, and succeeding at LIU,” DiBona said.
“My success coach has been a great help providing me with assistance with all my questions. She can help me with all my questions concerning the classes I’m required to take for [my] major. She helped me with the process of signing into a class and changing my major. She also helped me explore different majors and minors,” said Perla Marte, a freshman Criminal Justice major.
The success coaches have replaced the previous academic advisors. “All success coaches and enrollment counselors assist students with their course selection, developing a four-year plan, assisting with financial aid, and helping students succeed,” DiBona said.
“In my experience, my success coach has been good at helping me map out a path to get to where I want to be and help me figure out what classes I could take to fill my requirements, [and] also fit my interests,” said Aida Enamorado, a freshman Psychology major. “On the other hand, success coaches should know more about the professors and their teaching styles because not everyone learns the same way, and [all] professors don’t teach the same way. For example, I’m a visual learner and it’d be great if my success coach could tell me which teacher would be a better fit for me based on that.”
DiBona stated that success coaches receive ongoing training in order to assist students with their questions. “We have ongoing [training] throughout the semester in all necessary areas. For example, the success coaches are receiving training on advising, financial aid, career development, conflict resolution, student engagement, etc.,” DiBona said. “This is process ensure[s] that all success coaches have the tools they need to succeed and help students accurately,” DiBona added.
All of the success coaches are cross-trained in all of the academic areas; however, some have specialty caseloads. “For example, Susan [Sadkowski] sees the School of Visual and Performing Arts students, and works closely with the departments within SVPA,” DiBona said. “Some of the other coaches have these specialty areas; however, all of the success coaches are encouraged to learn all majors/programs to provide assistance to all students. This is why we have to constantly have ongoing trainings to ensure we are staying up to date on departmental, course, and other various changes.”
Students who came to Post prior to fall 2013 do not have a success coach, but instead have an enrollment services counselor in Kumble Hall. “I guess since I’m a transfer student, nobody told me about them [success coaches],” said Samantha Fare, a junior Public Relations major. “I guess having a success coach wouldn’t make a difference to me since I feel the academic advisors do nothing for me. I would only go to a success coach if the campus strongly urged me to,” she said.
Success coaches are given to new freshmen when they enroll, and will continue to work alongside them until graduation. Current freshmen and sophomores have an assigned success coach. If a student is transferring into Post as a first-year, they too will receive a success coach.
“All of the success coaches are encouraged to get involved in activities, clubs, Greek life, athletic events, etc., as another way to interact with their students. We don’t consider a traditional advising appointment as the only way for the success coaches to interact with their students,” DiBona said. Coaches will relay any vital information to their students, whether in person or via email. If there are any events or opportunities available, success coaches will provide students with the necessary details and any assistance they may need.
“Success coaches are very passionate about their role at the university; they are a great resource to students, and are always willing to help. Although each success coach has their own caseload of students, we have a very open office environment that fosters communication and collaboration. If one student’s success coach is out of the office, every success coach is willing to step in and help all students,” DiBona said.
Students initially meet their success coaches at registration events throughout the spring and summer. Success coaches also attend orientation, and urge their students to schedule a meeting time as soon possible at the beginning of each semester. Students can check their My LIU account to find out the name of their assigned success coach, or go to the LIU Promise office on the second floor of Hillwood Commons.

Students must complete several competency exams over the course of their academic career in order to graduate. These exams, computer literacy competency, the library competency, the writing competency, and the oral competency, must be completed before students have 60 credits, according to LIU Post website. If a student fails to complete these competencies prior to their junior year, or when they have reached 60 credits, they are required to take either a non-credit workshop to fulfill the needs of the competency, or they must take a course that fulfills the requirements needed.
The system for taking two of the four competencies is being revamped. As of fall 2014, LIU has added the library competency to all College 101 courses, and as of fall 2015, the computer literacy competency will also be added to the College 101 curriculum. “Freshmen will take both the library and computer exam in their College 101 class,” said Patricia Seaman, Coordinator of the Academic Standing Committee. By adding these two competencies to the College 101 curriculum, students will no longer have to worry about completing the exams on their own since they will be completed through their mandatory freshman classes.
Students view this as beneficial. “I think it’s better that you take the exams through the College 101 class, especially for people like me because I constantly put it off,” said Christina Kotarski, a junior English Education major. Kotarski did not have the opportunity to fulfill any of her competencies in her College 101 class. Students like Kotarski must register online for the library and computer literacy competency exams by emailing post-compexam@liu.edu.
For students who did not take the competency exams through their College 101 course, the computer literacy competency may be completed in several ways. First, a student can sign up for the exam itself and must pass it. These exams are offered every semester, according to LIU Post’s website. Second, students may enroll in the five-week non-credit workshop, COM 101, offered by the Computer Science Department. This once a week workshop normally is the last resort for many seniors. Third, students may enroll and complete classes CLA 6 or CS 6, which are both three-credit courses.
The same rules apply for the library competency. Students must either take the test itself, or enroll in the non-credit library workshop, LIB 101, offered by the school library. This workshop lasts seven weeks, and meets once a week during the semester.
The writing competency and the oral competency are not being added to the College 101 curriculum. Students fulfill their requirement for the writing competency after taking ENG 1 or ENG 2; both courses are a requirement for the core curriculum at LIU Post. Similarly, enrolling in ORC 1, ORC 2, or SPH 5 cover the oral competency exam. If a student is not enrolled in any of these courses, one may register for the oral competency exam through the Communication Sciences and Disorders Department by contacting the department by phone and scheduling an appointment.
Many students face a similar dilemma in that they are unable to pass specific competencies. Other students, however, may have missed the opportunity to take the exams because they have failed to enroll on time. “The exam is offered ten times a semester, and only the last few exams are ever filled to capacity. If students register early, they will be able to enroll in one of the scheduled exams,” Seaman said.
Since maximum capacity for these exams is 28 students per session, students should register early in the semester. “The first three to four exams are usually not filled. The last three exams scheduled are usually booked well before the deadline. The best times to take the exam and be assured a spot are the earlier exams. One shouldn’t wait until the last minute to schedule their exam,” Seaman said.
Students have found that it is difficult to access the information about the tests, including when each exam is held. Many students have found that they missed the opportunity to take their competency exams because they were ill informed, not realizing they had to take them in the first place.
“I found [obtaining] information about these competency exams a very difficult task. There is no information [around] the school that notifies students about these exams, unless you specifically ask your advisor if you decide to meet with him or her,” said Sal Vitale, a junior Marketing major. “Most students I know do not know about the exams until the spring semester of their sophomore year. Although it is achievable by planning ahead and being informed earlier, it is still pretty difficult.”
Seaman, however, said that information about the exams is readily available to students. “The exam schedule is on the website, and paper copies are available in the Library and Kumble Hall,” she said.
Adding a non-credit workshop to a full course workload may be difficult for students to balance. Alternatively, some students have found that it is difficult to pass an exam because they aren’t sure what they are being tested on. Although LIU Post offers study guides for each exam, many students do not know about them, or where to acquire them, and without these study guides it may be difficult to pass.
“When I had to take the library exam, I felt that it was very hard to ask questions regarding where the test was and what time the test was. I felt like I had no guidance [with] this test,” Vitale said.
In order to prevent the confusion as to whether or not it is too late to take any of the competency exams, it is important for students to keep track of the amount of credits they have reached per semester, as well as if they have already fulfilled the requirements for the competency exams or not.
All competency exams are offered in both the fall and spring semesters. If students are struggling to pass one of the exams, they must be sure to acquire a study guide from LIU Post website, or the library, in order to prepare.

The fire alarm went off twice at Pell Hall and the Life and Science building while classes were in session on Wednesday, Feb. 4.
The first alarm went off at 2:26 p.m., forcing students to wait outside in 35 degrees for over 30 minutes, without any information regarding what caused the alarm to sound. The alarm stopped at 3:02 p.m., and students were allowed to re-enter the building. A second alarm erupted shortly after the first, at approximately 3:15 p.m. About half of the students did not bring their jackets when they rushed outside, assuming it was a fire drill.
Danielle Giaccotto, a senior Psychology major, left her class and waited outside without a coat. “I was in my Earth Science class when the fire alarm went off. The whole class went outside thinking it was just a fire drill,” Giaccotto said. We waited outside with no information, and were still unable to return inside; we were freezing! It was very frustrating not knowing what we should do. We searched for our professor, and she let us go home early. So, in the end, we kind of lucked out.”
Other student where displeased about the uncertainty of whether it was a fire drill or an actual fire. “The alarm went off during my Earth Science lab, about 25 minutes into class,” said Nicole DiGiovanni, a senior Photography major. “We immediately closed our books and ran out back with the professor. We had no idea what was going on, and pretty soon the rumors began. Was it or wasn’t it a fire drill? The drill, or whatever it was, ended after about 40 minutes, and by that time, the entire class scattered. Only five students made it back to class; only to have another fire alarm interrupt us once again.”
Heather Weiland, a junior Biology major, explained how the timing of the two fire alarms could not have been more inconvenient for her and her classmates. “I was in [my] Physics class when the first alarm went off, just as we started a quiz. And moments after getting back in from the first alarm, a second went off, not only causing my class to freeze, but dragging our quiz out for over an hour.”
Zack Murov, a senior Political Science major, had a different reaction, and was pleased with how the situation was handled. “Once again, Facilities did a great job taking care of a stressful situation on campus.”
“It was impressive how orderly the evacuation of Pell Hall and the Life and Science building took place when the fire alarms went off,” said Dr. Lillian Tanguay, a professor of Geology. “It’s great that the alarms work well, and hopefully everyone takes evacuation seriously, especially in science buildings where emergencies could result from fire, electrical shortages, or toxic chemical spills.”
The Offices of Public Safety and Facilities would not comment on the situation despite repeated requests. Students and faculty involved remain unaware of the cause of the fire alarms.

Greek organization Tau Kappa Epsilon will be holding a money management and responsible spending workshop on Feb. 26, with the help of professor Manoj Dalvi from the Finance department. The event will take place in Humanities Lecture Hall from 1 p.m. – 1:50 p.m., and all students are invited.
Throughout this lecture, Professor Dalvi will be teaching students the importance of managing their money and investments.
“Professor Dalvi is very knowledgeable, and very personable,” said Eric Simonson, president of TKE. “He makes everything understandable, so he would do a great job in giving all the materials to these students and making everything understandable and easy to implement.” He mentions how many students end up in debt that gradually becomes harder to get out of.
In general, TKE has a motto of “better men for a better world.” They try to find ways to help give back to people around them. TKE has two main goals: to develop their members by giving them the skills they need, and to take those skills and give back to the community.
“My goal is to implement and make events come to life that would help the student body as a whole and not just a single fraternity or a Greek life,” said Jake Lubin, a junior Political Science major and the programming chairman of TKE.
Tau Kappa Epsilon was founded in 1899. A chapter at LIU Post was founded in ‘60s and was later removed from the campus in the early ‘90s. A colony was recently brought back in Nov. 2013, and currently has 31 members. In less than two years, LIU Post’s colony of TKE has been ranked fourth in the nation by the fraternity’s office of the Grand Chapter, first in New York Metro province since June 2014, and first in the Northeast region. Although they are only a colony, they are striving to become a complete chapter.
Simonson thinks longevity is key when it comes to his fraternity. “I want to be able to come to homecoming in 20 years or so, bring my children and have talks about TKE, still be here and still thriving in creating as much opportunities for students,” Simonson said.
Last semester TKE held a workshop on study skills and time management. They also did a fundraiser where they cut off Lubin and his brother’s hair for every donation they got, and within three days the fraternity had raised over $1,000 for St. Jude’s. In addition, they continued their fundraiser for St. Jude’s by selling blankets to collect additional money.
In the future, TKE plans to have an event on web and social media etiquette, which will discuss what things to write and what not to write online. This is happening towards the end of this spring semester or the beginning of fall 2015. TKE plans on holding another workshop on how to write emails in a professional environment.

We are constantly surrounded by mediated communication today. From sharing pictures on Facebook, to posting our opinions on Twitter, to finding ourselves texting all the time, we heavily depend on these communication tools. Without smartphones, most college students would find themselves lost.
With the convergence of mobile phones and Internet into a single device, communication is made possible in ways that older generations wouldn’t even think of. This can be a positive thing, since it has allowed the world to evolve and move forward technologically, but at the same time it can have negative effects. Being able to basically do anything you want on your phone has turned many of us into addicts to these devices, which is not necessarily a good thing. People have lost the ability of hold- ing a conversation face-to-face with someone without constantly looking down at their phones.
I am not going to lie; I myself am guilty of constantly using my phone. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, texting, Snapchat, and so many more apps just take over our attention. We think we are communicating, but are we really? I like to think that we are, especially when our phones allow us to talk to friends or family that might be far away from us. But, then again, when you spend every five minutes on your phone, you’re missing out on real face-to-face communication.
There are positive benefits to communicating in person with someone that texting lacks. For example, when you talk to someone face- to-face, you are sharing the same physical context; you’re influenced by the same environmental distractions that may be occurring. You can also actually see the facial expressions and body movements of the person you’re talking to.
“I don’t think people being obsessed with their phones mean they are not communicating, since that’s basically what phones are all about,” said Kat Kazaba, a junior Public Relations major. “However, I do think people have lost the ability to hold an actual face-to-face conversation. I agree that phones have turned into a drug-like device that most people are highly addicted to.”
In some cases, phones can bring people closer together. They do allow people to strengthen their ties. In fact, a big amount of the communi- cation that takes place on social media apps on phones is mostly with friends and families. I hold the view that the more we obsess with our phones, the more individuals become lonelier because we are just con- stantly alone. We aren’t paying attention to what’s going on around us. We are in our own little world looking down at our screen. If you go out for lunch with your friends, in a matter of seconds, I can guarantee you that everyone around the table will be checking their phones to see what new thing has happened in the past five minutes.
“People just don’t put in the effort in their relationships anymore. We don’t make time for face-to-face communication,” Kazaba said. “When we communicate with our friends, family, or even co-workers, we constantly find ourselves ‘multitasking,’ sending texts and emails through our phones while we are in meetings, checking our Facebook feed while we are in class, even texting while we are eating dinner with our family,” she added.
There needs to be a moment when we take a step back and look up from our phones to realize that we have all lost our capacity to keep a real, authentic conversation going.
Finally, I do believe we are highly addicted to our phones and because of this we no longer appreciate face-to-face communication. A way this can be fixed is by taking that step back and starting to detach from these devices. When you are at social event, put your phone away and actually talk to the people around you. We must make an effort to actually communicate and have real conversations where our phones won’t be a distraction.

There is no question that technology has expanded opportunities for one to explore and come in contact with information outside of people’s homes. The Internet does not only offer statistical data, but also leisure activities. This leisure has been taken advantage by the babies of the nineties — the generation of smartphones, tablets and laptops.
These sources of technology provide access to streaming. Some popular outlets of streaming are YouTube, Crackle, Amazon, Google Play, and Hulu, which all can be used to watch movies and television episodes conveniently. Streaming and television contain positives and negatives that have elevated our nation to another level of quick entertainment overall.

With the growth of streaming, the TV broadcasts have lost viewers due to streaming’s pervasive accessibility. “The average person watched about 141 hours of live television per month in the third quarter of 2014, compared to 147 hours in the third quarter of 2013.” (Time Magazine, 12/3/2014). Apple products provide an application for streaming, which has become more popular as the demand for Apple products increases. Applications are also available with Android and Windows Phones — all suitable for the film or television program of the user’s choice.
“I prefer streaming because of its ability to be ubiquitous,” said Marlin Slack, a sophomore Musical Theater major. “I think streaming gives you the opportunity to experience in simple ways, such as with a cellphone and in the comfort of your own home.”
Entertainment is made easy with handheld technology, making the experience more enjoyable and relaxed. Before streaming, DVD’s were purchased. These are now overlooked, because the products are heavily stored. The small devices used today allow an individual to be entertained while traveling, as well as being a way to save money by not having to go to the theaters and/or buying DVD and DVD players.
“I really only use Netflix,” said Robert McGrath, a sophomore Musical Theater major.
“My family uses it and I think it is accessible and convenient,” he added.
Despite of the popularity arising from streaming, there are still people who enjoy watching TV. The television provides a wider screen and multiple effects such as LED, LCD, flat screen, curved screen, three- to four-dimensional cinema effects, surround sound, configuration, and screens that can be customized to a size of your choice. However, streaming providers have made it possible to connect the computer up to the TV and stream directly from the computer to the TV.
“Personally, I choose television because of the advantage of a bigger screen,” said Kymani Green, a junior Biology major. “With streaming on my laptop, I am not always accessible to wi-fi.”
No wi-fi or Internet connection becomes an inconvenience because not all areas provide wi-fi. If they do, it is not always guaranteed that it is free of charge.
Watching that favorite TV show or movie in the comfort of one’s home is more personal and special than watching entertainment on a handheld or laptop device. By watching from home, I believe the mind settles in faster and allows the body rest.
Streaming is a great way to stay connected with one’s favorite TV programs and movies while being away from home, as they are quickly accessible from the smartphone and tablet. Hence streaming becoming popular because of the high demand of smartphones. The TV provides an enticing experience and makes viewers feel as if they were in a theater, and has not gotten old because of its easy maintenance.
Technology has created a way that enables one to enjoy both of these useful resources when the time is appropriate. Through the use of smartphones and applications, entertainment is at the fingertips of those who long for a good laugh and/or cry. Streaming and the television are constantly evolving to meet the standards and needs of today’s people. Each source of entertainment assists each individual in ways that are comforting for every person, depending on one’s preference.

As a Psychology major, the subjects of stress, depression and psychological illness come up often. These are the reasons why I chose Psychology as my favored subject. I am intrigued and fascinated with the immense power the brain and psyche have on your physical body.
Last week, while watching a video from the ‘70s about stress in psychology class, I realized how stress has the ability to make you ill and deplete your immune system.
At this time of the semester, with stress levels rising around the fortress of Pioneer country, I want to help all of the international students, as well as anyone else reading this week’s column, including myself, to overcome falling into the abyss of stress.
 
We need to make sure we look after our minds and bodies, that way we can get the best performance when it comes to revising essays or completing tests. Stress is something that everyone feels is a part of life that can’t be controlled, but as the video that I watched in Psych said, “We must control our stress levels to decrease blood pressure and release the anxiety we may encounter.” (This was said in a very cheesey ‘70s, with a deep and serious voice, almost comical!)
Despite the humorous tone of the TV presenter, the point stands: whenever we get overwhelmed with work and our stress levels rise, a hot flush infests itself around the body and we begin to panic, “s**t, I have so much work to do!! And I have to revise for my test tomorrow!”
All of us just need to relax, take a break with a few deep breaths, and have a cup of tea (well, I guess for a lot of you, it’s coffee, right?), and just chill out for five minutes. I would suggest not having coffee, because it actually raises your heart rate and blood pressure, making it more likely for you to suffer from anxiety. But you guys may say the same for my beloved tea. So, if not coffee, have a glass of water or even hot chocolate (I have heard Norwegian hot chocolate is a thing of beauty!), and stop your work, let the fluster pass, and relax. Resume studying or writing that essay when you feel you have the power back in your hands.
I am not saying that stress can be completely taken away; stress in our society is a frequent thing that we all have to come to grips with. We have school, social media, work — a constant rush throughout our days — and if we compare to what cavemen had to deal with, it’s almost comical.
Imagine an odd, stressful encounter with a wolf, followed by a nap on the luxurious stone sofas, before having that very wolf for dinner! Whereas our generation has almost been born into a world of stress, right?
One way we can prevent stress from taking over our lives is through exercise! Going to the gym or playing a sport for a few hours a week has been proven to not only release all the stress and tension you have built up in your mind and body, but to improve your mood as well. Thus creating a better environment for you.
A second important way in which we can reduce stress is to be organized. For me, a to-do list is a thing of immense importance! If I haven’t put everything down that’s in my head throughout the week, I get overwhelmed and pissed off (which, for you guys, may mean annoyed). So if you blotter down all the subjects and assignments you have to complete on a to-do list, it makes it easier for you to organize your time, releasing the anxiety and stress of forgetting something, as well as helping you to concentrate, taking one thing at a time.
Finally, it is crucial to get out of the stressful school or work environment for a period of time. Do not work yourself too hard! You have to leave yourself some time to play and have fun. This can vary from watching Spartacus (which I am addicted to at the moment!) or going to Manhattan and exploring what the “City that never sleeps” has to offer! These are the best times of our lives, while you have how many years of work and deadlines ahead of you?
Of course, getting your work done at an A-standard is extremely beneficial, but you also need to remember that we are too young and vulnerable to run ourselves into the ground and allow stress to beat us down. If we work extremely hard to achieve our equilibrium, we need then to rest and chill out! It is good to balance fun and hard work, especially when midterms and exams come. So, make sure that you work hard and play hard to achieve that equilibrium. It will make you better, and won’t leave you in the firing line for illness. How could you possibly complete that test or hand in that assignment if you are sick?

There is often a preconceived notion that college life is filled with an abundance of alcohol and parties. Due to this notion, many students anticipate turning 21, where the restrictions to alcohol no longer exist. As a junior, this is my first year where I felt that I can possess alcohol freely, without having to worry about breaking any student conduct rules.
Yet, as I walked into my dorm hall carrying my own supply of alcohol, a residence assistant stopped me. I wasn’t surprised when I was asked for ID. However, I was taken by surprise when two of my friends, who had accompanied me, were also asked for ID. Although they were also both of age, and the alcohol was going to be taken to my room, I was told by this RA that if I brought in two guests who were not of age, I would have received a dorm violation written warning. After this experience, I was prompted to look at the university’s student handbook to find out the exact rules regarding alcohol on campus.
After reviewing all the guidelines, I realized how many restrictions students still have to meet, despite being of age on what the university calls a “wet campus.” According to the student handbook, consuming alcoholic beverages is not allowed on campus property, except in areas or functions approved by the dean of students or her designee, which includes residence hall rooms of students over the age of 21. In other words, students of age are only allowed to drink in their own dorm rooms, or designated areas approved first by the dean.
It also states that students under the age of 21 are not allowed to be in an environment with alcohol. The handbook says that parties in which alcohol is served will not be permitted anywhere on campus, unless the dean approves of it. If students plan a party at a residence hall room or lounge, it needs to be registered, which means that the student hosting the event needs to alert a campus life coordinator before going forward with their plans. If any attendee is under 21 at these particular parties, alcohol cannot be permitted.
Due to these strong alcohol regulations, other students have agreed that despite alcohol being permitted on campus, the university feels more like a dry campus than a wet one. Senior Accounting major Vincent Tavernese believes that the school should loosen some of their drinking restrictions. Tavernese, who happens to be of drinking age, mentions that he has gotten written up while drinking and being in the company of others who were under the age of 21.
“Because I am of age, if I am having a drink with someone who is not of age, I should not be held responsible for their actions, especially when I am not the one supplying them with alcohol,” Tavernese said. Apart from the write up, he was also required to take an alcohol education class, which is a course that educates students on substance abuse.
“I think that it is absolutely absurd that I was penalized for drinking when this is a wet campus and I am of legal drinking age,” Tavernese said. “The rules are way too strict. I understand why the rules are created in the first place, but the school focuses too much on making them and not enough on making it fair enough for everyone.”
Junior Math major Natalie Post also believes the university should be more lenient in terms of regulations for where alcohol consumption takes place. Post, who will be turning 21 in a few days, argues that the school will create a safer community if students of age had a place on campus where they can drink openly, instead of looking for that environment outside of school perimeters. As a commuter, she states that having a place to enjoy some drinks on campus after class seems beneficial, especially in a place like the student lounge.
“I studied abroad in London last semester and the school I stayed at had an on campus bar [that] everyone enjoyed,” Post said. “I just feel that if the student bar served alcohol, it may draw in a larger crowd. Also, I know that LIU had a student bar on campus many years ago, and a large portion of students at Post are over the age of 21, so that option should still be allowed.”
Although the university continues to be a wet campus, due to the many restrictions students will feel obligated to find fun elsewhere. In doing so, this causes a problem with keeping students safe, while the university gains a negative reputation amongst students.
If you have any input on the student-alcohol matter, please let us know at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

Drake’s latest music compilation, “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,” was released worldwide on Feb. 12, continuing his victory lap that began with “Nothing Was The Same,” which surpassed over one million copies sold, according to billboard.com.
Drake pulls no punches on this album, and makes extremely clear what he has become. In “No Tellin,” he says, “Please do not speak to me like I’m that Drake from four years ago, I am at a higher place.” Drake flexed his muscles again on “Used To” with the opening line, “When you get to where I’m at, you got to remind them where the f*** you at.”
Although he is puffing his chest out, he hasn’t lost touch with his witty word play and clever rap skills. He gives you this throughout his album, but it is most obvious in “6PM In New York.” This song has the most backpack rap feel out of any of the songs on the mix, as he switches from topic to topic without a hook on a simple beat. This is just a progression from previous songs such as “Tuscan Leather,” “The Ride,” and “Light Up,” where he airs out his honest feelings and thoughts.
The days of Drake being criticized for being overly emotional and sincere in his music are over, as this formula has built an empire. This album features a few, slower R&B songs that are not as commercially friendly, but still personal and quality music.
The album is filled with energy. Most of the beats aren’t oversaturated with bass – they mostly have a slow tempo – at the same time, they still have a bounce that makes you want to break the speakers in your car. The only fast tempo song on the album is “6 Man,” which is my favorite song, mostly due to the arrogant lyrics. Hip-Hop is one of the only places where arrogance is accepted and promoted, and Drake feeds off this. Also, in “6 Man’s” second verse, Drake uses his flow that begins with an authoritative delivery of words, then finishes the flow by singing the last few words. Drake has mastered this flow, and has inspired several attempts from other artists trying to follow his lead.
Speaking of following the leader, Drake, like J Cole two months ago, released his album without any promotion, or any radio singles to build up a buzz. The rapper released the album without any notification. J Cole, on the other hand, let it be known in the upcoming weeks that he would be releasing an album. This surprise album release is great for music. When Drake’s album released, I got to hear 17 completely new songs, with the exception of “6 God”. In the past, by the time the album was available, you could have heard a quarter of the project.
“If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” is a great body of work that will have replay value like most of Drake’s music. The rapper is in his prime and he knows it, saying, “The game is all mine and I’m mighty possessive, Lil’ Wayne could not have found him a better successor.”

It was a déjà-vu weekend for the women’s swimming team as it defended its third straight Metropolitan Conference Collegiate Championship on Sunday, Feb. 22, at Rutgers University, N.J.
Senior Johanna Pettersson was recognized as the most outstanding female swimmer of the event, awarded the 2015 Joe Stetz Prize. Pettersson snatched many points over the weekend to fill up the Pioneer account. For one, she topped the 100-yard backstroke event ahead of her fellow teammates juniors Meghan Brazier and Seren Jones. All three swimmers noted NCAA “B” qualifiers, as they clocked at 54.73, 56.06, and 56.28, respectively.
“We had some phenomenal swims, especially since some of our swimmers weren’t fully rested,” Jones said.
Senior Carolin Rademacher also shone on top as she finished off her last ever Conference meet with an overwhelming 400-yard individual relay time of 4:22.56. Freshman Christina Garcia Mauri hit the wall eight seconds later in the same event.
Reigning National Champion Joyce Kwok delivered a NCAA “A” qualifying time of 1:59.52, which lead her to a first place in the 200-yard butterfly event. Freshman Erika Hultman came in third with a time of 2:09.05.
The Green Machine totaled 1,235 points throughout the three- day meet, but not all of the points earned came from individual events. The Pioneers showed collective spirit, as well, with many medley relay victories.
Perhaps the most impressive effort did not go all the way to the first-spot in the 800-yard medley relay, although it will stand high in the record books. Pettersson, Rademacher, Kwok and freshman Laura Bendfeldt scrambled together a new school best at 7:32.37, beating the one set two years ago at the Metropolitan Championships.
Head Coach Maureen Travers, who also got recognized for her dedicated work as the 2015 Dick Krempicki Women’s Coach of the Year, will gather the group once more before the team tunes out for off-season. Seven swimmers made the National Championships, which will take place on March 11–14, in Indianapolis, Ind.

The men’s and women’s indoor track & field teams completed the East Coast Conference Championships at Saint Anthony’s High School on Saturday, Feb. 21, by finishing sixth and eighth.
The women’s team scrambled together 39 points in total, after winning the distance medley race over 10 seconds ahead of the runner-ups from St. Thomas Aquinas College. The first-team with freshman Lauren Hoffman, freshman Talya Williams, junior Elizabeth Stirling, and graduate student Robin Lynn slotted a time of 12:40.10.
The four members also earned points individually. Williams placed third in the one- mile run, at a time of 5:22.21, and Hoffman finished six seconds later in the same event, good enough for fifth place. Lynn placed second in the 1,000-meter event, as she marked a 3:10.08-time and Stirling notched a third- place finish in the 3,000-meter. She clocked at 10:50.01.
Freshman Danae Glover also marked ground in the Championships for the Pioneers; her body hit the sand at 10.69 meters in the triple jump event, which was good for a third place. Glover also finished among the top-14 in the 200-meter event, timed at 28.29.
With three first-spots during the day, the men’s team totaled 42 points. Much like the women, the men’s team topped the distance medley relay in a comfortable manner. Graduate students Dale McDonald and Joseph Lasher combined with freshman Thomas Flynn, and red-shirt junior Steven Arnone to record a time of 10:44.51.
McDonald then raced to another victory in the 400-meter event, clocking a time of 51.22. He also finished sixth in the 200-meter dash earlier on that day.
Red-Shirt sophomore Mike Scott recorded the last Pioneer win as he spurted through the 3000-meter event at a time of 8:52.79. Arnone posted sixth in the same event.
Roberts Wesleyan won the ECC Championships on both the men’s as well as the women’s side.

On Wednesday, Feb. 18, the women’s basketball team (15-10) returned to action when they took the court against the Lions from Molloy College (11-13) from Rockville Centre, N.Y. The wire-to-wire victory for the Pioneers was powered by senior guards Chelsea Williams with a game-high 26 points, and Ashley Castle who dropped 22 points.
The Pioneers came out of the gates swinging and went on a 17-2 run to start the game. During that span, Castle and junior guard Quanisha Ratley both scored five points while Williams earned her way to the free throw line for some easy points. The tone of the first half was set by that run and the Pioneers were clearly in control. They were the aggressors in the first half, able to get good shots and play solid defense at the other end. At halftime, the visitors were up 41-32.
The Green and Gold matched their energy output and overall level of play from the first half in the second half as they outscored the Lions by five. Williams and Castle led the team down the stretch with 15 and 12 points, respectively, as the Pioneers cruised to a 76-62 victory. They out-rebounded their opponents by 14 and held the Lions to just 37 percent from the field. Junior forward Nyasia Davis recorded another double-double in the victory while Ratley finished with 11 points.
The Pioneers returned home to Brookville, N.Y., on Saturday, Feb. 21, when they welcomed the Queens College Knights (18-6) to the Pratt Recreation Center. The contest was a back-and-forth battle with the lead changing hands multiple times. An extra period was needed to decide a winner and the Knights came out on top.
The Pioneers were led in the first half by Davis who grabbed eight boards and scored eight points while holding down the paint on the other end with three blocked shots. The Knights were up for most of the first half, but never pushed their lead passed seven points. They were led by sophomore guard Madison Rowland who scored 12 points in the first 20 minutes. Rowland, along with Davis, anchored both defenses and set the tone for the afternoon. At the break, the Knights held a slight advantage, 25-22.
Rowland continued her terrific play in the second half in route to her game-high 25 points, but the Pioneers did not back down. Instead, down by two with just under 18 minutes left, LIU went on a 24-10 run to pull ahead 49-36. The Knights, however, responded and went on a run of their own. They closed the second half on a 15-2 run and tied the game with free throws at the 18-second mark.
The overtime was dominated by the ladies from Queens College, as they held the Pioneers to zero makes from the field and went to the line 13 times. The 63-55 overtime loss is the second loss to the Knights this season for the Pioneers and their first loss in the extra period of play.
For the game, Davis finished with 12 points and 18 boards while Williams scored 12, grabbed seven rebounds, and dished out four assists. For the Knights, Kristen Korzevinski finished with 14 points while Rowland poured in 25 and snagged 13 boards.
Coach Deirdre Moore and her squad will return to action on Friday, Feb. 27, when they play host to the Daemen College Wildcats on Senior Night. Tip-off is scheduled for 5 p.m.

With just 17 seconds remaining in regulation, senior forward Tyuan Williams sunk a go-ahead lay-up that sent the men’s basketball team (14-11) to a critical 61-56 win against Molloy College (13-11) in an East Coast Conference showdown at Quealy Gymnasium last Wednesday, Feb. 18.
Senior forward Charles McCann and junior guard Devon McMillan sealed the deal for the Pioneers at the charity stripe, watching three out of their four combined free throws fall in the closing seconds. Although the Lions kept storming back from several deficits, the Green and Gold’s clutch foul shooting propelled them over the hosts.
Williams recorded his fifth double- double of the season, scoring 18 points and grabbing 15 rebounds in the victory. The senior finished 5-of-13 from the field and 8-of-12 from the foul line while senior guard P.J. Torres continued to shine off the bench, scoring 13 points and hauling in five rebounds. Junior guard Dillon Burns corralled seven boards and dished out two assist while McCann tallied five points and five boards.
On Saturday, Feb. 21, the Pioneers returned to the floor as they mounted a comeback after digging themselves into a 15-point first half hole to capture a 62-46 win against Queens College (6-18) in another East Coast Conference tilt at the Pratt Recreation Center.
After falling behind 17-2 in the opening stages of the contest, the Pioneers responded with a thunderous 29-3 stretch to grab a 31-20 cushion heading into the locker room. Sophomore forward Greg Dotson collected 16 points, featuring three dunks, one of them at the buzzer. Torres and sophomore guard Jared Hall accounted for five points apiece during the spurt. LIU dominated points in the paint, second chance opportunities, and bench points during the first half.
During the latter stanza, the Knights reduced the deficit to seven points, but a quick 10-2 burst by the hosts sent the visitors packing. McMillan capped off the sequence for the Pioneers with a fade away jumper.
Dotson had an amazing performance, collecting his third double-double of the season. He scored a season-high 24 points, shooting 10-of-17 from the field and hauling in 10 rebounds in 28 minutes of action. Torres racked up 13 points, eight boards, four assists, and four steals. Williams contributed 11 points and nine rebounds while McMillan recorded five points, one assist, and a steal.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and his Pioneer squad look to continue their winning ways when they host Daemen College on Senior Night Friday, Feb. 27. Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m.

The men’s lacrosse team beat Roberts Wesleyan, 14-7, in their 2015 season home opener on Sunday, Feb. 22. Stat-leader of the day, junior Matt Belando, notched an impressive three goals and three assists in an otherwise team effort that colored six different Pioneer names on the scoreboard.
The guests fired away to gain the lead early on, but the Pioneers shook it off, straighten their uniforms, and turned the tables around.
Junior attackman Ryan Slane lead the way in the first half with his three goals. Slane also feed his teammates twice to collect a total of five points that afternoon, hiding in the shadow of Belando’s six.
The hosts kept going and scored eight unanswered goals. Going into the locker room at half time, LIU Post was up 9-2.
The latter stanza saw both teams producing five goals, which made the seven-goal lead stand for the hosts. Senior defenseman Dan Jeannotte shut off ground in the back by winning 10-of-13 faceoffs.
To his assistance, junior goalkeeper Adam Winne played his role between the pipes, as he stood in the way of flying Redhawks counterattacks and recorded six consecutive saves.
The Green Machine got its game-receipt published online just the day after its promising season start when the weekly release of the Nike/ Lacrosse Magazine kept the squad at second place in the Division II Top- 15 Poll.Next up for the Pioneers is a series of events in the North Florida College Lacrosse Face-Off this week. The just-started East Coast Conference will take some days off, as the Pioneers head down to North Florida for a series of events.
The team will play two non-Conference tilts as part of the Wounded Warrior Project. The first game against Saint Leo University is set for Feb. 27, at 7.30 p.m. Thereafter, on March 1, the Pioneers battle against Lynn University, scheduled at noon.

Freshman Joseph Calderone is one of the many fresh faces on the newly re-instated LIU Post wrestling team, currently on its first season. Calderone is a Physical Education major with a minor in Psychology from Huntington Station, N.Y., and one of the team’s standouts on the mat.
Q: How have you grown since the beginning of the season?
A: In the beginning, I was very nervous and I didn’t know what to expect. It’s normal for most freshmen to feel that way, but I feel like I’ve matured a lot since I’ve been here. I’m a lot quicker, stronger and smarter on the mat. The sport has become a lot more fun for me.
Q: What are some of the strengths and weaknesses of the team?
A: I think we’re a hardworking team with a strong work ethic. The down part is that we’re a young team and I don’t think we have the confidence that we exactly need yet, but it’s starting to come around.
Q: What’s your opinion on having Johnny Brush as the captain of the team?
A: John’s been a tremendous help and he’s a great role model for us. He shows us what hard work really is and he’s just an amazing person. It’s exciting to see him wrestle.
Q: As a freshman, how do the upperclassmen help you prepare for matches?
A: They never show any fear and they just go out there, wanting to win. That trait definitely carried over to me. I saw how confident they were out there and they just wanted to compete.
Q: What brought you to LIU Post?
A: I heard that Post recently got a wrestling team and Coach Patrovich came up to me and said, “I’d love for you to join my team.” I wanted to stay local and seeing him come here made me think it was a perfect fit.
Q: When did you first begin to wrestle?
A: I started in fourth grade, but I started getting serious with it in ninth grade.
Q: Do you think Post’s wrestling program is headed in the right direction?
A: I do. Unfortunately our head coach got sick, but our assistant coaches have helped us tremendously. They stepped up to the plate and turned this team around.
Q: Whom do you admire most?
A: Georges St. Pierre. He is a two-time UFC World Heavyweight Champion. He is very humble and shows how to handle [oneself] well.
Q: Plans after graduating?
A: I want to be a Physical Education teacher or think about joining MMA. I definitely want to coach wrestling and help kids become successful.
