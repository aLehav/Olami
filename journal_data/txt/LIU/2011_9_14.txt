From the sideline, much of the C.W. Post women’s soccer team’s 7-0 victory over Pittsburgh-Johnstown looked as laid back and effortless as an easy practice. The Pioneers, ranked 20th in Division II and favored to repeat as ECC Champions, used their aggressive style of play and quickness on the forward line to take control of the game early on and bring their record back above the .500 mark to 2-1.
Sophomore forward Alexa Niciforo led the Pioneers with two goals, the first of which came just two minutes into action and put C.W. Post ahead early on. Eight minutes later, freshman midfielder Lina Harle converted a pass from Niciforo into a header into the top left corner of the goal cage for another point for the Pioneers.  Three more C.W. Post goals put the Pioneers on top 5-0 at halftime.
The Pioneers continued their assault on the UPJ defense in the second half. Any hopes of a comeback victory were dashed when sophomore midfielder Lauren Bischoff put the team’s sixth goal in the net just 46 seconds into play in the second half. Another C.W. Post goal, this time from freshman midfielder Brooke Palmer, was the cherry on top for the Pioneers, as they walked away with the 7-0 win. Pioneers’ goalie Allie Weiser made just one save for C.W. Post, which outshot UPJ 18-1.
The women’s soccer team will be back in action Thursday, September 15, as they travel to Caldwell College for a 4 p.m. non-conference game.

The C.W. Post men’s soccer team finished the 2010 season in disappointing fashion with an under .500 record of 7-8-2, marking the team’s first losing season in three years. However, the 2011 Pioneers look determined to get back to their 2009 form, the year they finished 12-5 and captured the East Coast Conference Championship Tournament title.
To open up the 2011 campaign, the Pioneers went on the road to face Saint Anselm College. The Pioneers came out of the gate strong and would not be stopped by the overmatched Hawks. Freshman forward Eivind Austboe and sophomore forward Cemil Turan each scored a pair of goals for the Pioneers, and sophomore back Eirik Bjoernoe and sophomore midfielder Jonathon Watkin both netted a goal as well to put the game far out of reach in favor of the Pioneers by a score of 6-1.
The Pioneers brought the confidence and excellent play that they displayed against the Hawks into their next matchup, when they squared up against the Holy Family University Tigers. If you love overtime nail-biters, this game was the perfect game for you to watch. The Pioneers held a 2-1 lead deep into the second half, but the Tigers scratched and clawed their way to even the score up at two goals apiece with just under 1:30 left to play in the game. Both squads would come up empty in the first overtime session, but the Pioneers took control in the second extra session. Cemil Turan nailed the game-winning goal as he dribbled through the Tigers defense to give C.W. Post a thrilling, down-to-the-wire win in its second game of the year.
The Pioneers then returned home to Brookville for their home-opener against the Concordia University Tornados. The Tornados wasted no time on offense, scoring in the third minute of play to take a fast 1-0 lead. That lead would remain until the second half, when Turan scored a goal to even the score at one. The Pioneers weren’t finished yet, though. With just under five minutes in regulation, Austboe scored a goal off a pass from junior forward Andreas Olson. This goal would prove to be the deciding goal. In yet another exhilarating game, the Pioneers’ scoring threats, Austboe and Turan, each scored at least one goal for the third consecutive game to begin the season.
The Pioneers most recent game came on the road against the Dominican College Chargers. In an extremely defensive game by both teams, the Pioneers edged out a 1-0 victory. Austboe had the lone goal for either side, and he now has a team-high of five goals.
The Pioneers have been playing excellent soccer, led by the stellar goalkeeping of sophomore goalie Marco Jorgensen. He is now 4-0 between the pipes, and opposing offenses have had a difficult time getting anything going to start off the young season.
The next game for the undefeated Pioneers comes on September 14th at 3:30 p.m. at the Bentley University Falcons (1-0-1). In their last meeting, the Pioneers won 2-0 on September 10, 2010.

In the first two games of the season, the C.W. Post field hockey team has already posted two major marks. September 8th’s 7-0 victory over the Southern Connecticut State University Owls earned head coach Raenee Savin her 70th victory, bumping her to the winningest coach in program history, and saw graduate student Bethany Semlear score a career-high four goals to lead the Pioneers to victory in their first game of the season.
The Pioneers took control of the away game early on with a goal by senior midfielder Helene Bruckner just over five minutes into play. Bruckner’s goal was followed closely by two more C.W. Post goals, both scored by Semlear and assisted by senior forward Kathryn Godshalk, to give the Pioneers a 3-0 lead at the 10 minute mark. The Owls struggled to cross the 50-yard line as C.W. Post’s quick passing rendered the SCSU defense obsolete. A 5-0 lead at the half turned into 7-0 by the end of regulation time, and the Pioneers walked away with a 1-0 record.
Saturday’s home opener against Franklin Pierce proved more challenging for the team. The Pioneers struggled with their passing and receiving in the first half, falling behind on the board 0-1 in the 22nd minute of play. The deficit didn’t last long, however. Before the end of the half, sophomore midfielder Carlee Dragon netted a goal off a Godshalk assist on a penalty corner to even the score at 1-1 going into the half.
The second half was a different game for the Pioneers, as the kinks they saw in the first half seemed to smooth out in the final 35 minutes. While most of the period remained scoreless, C.W. Post dominated the play, rarely allowing the ball into their defensive end. Helene Bruckner’s 58th minute goal sealed the win for the Pioneers, raising the team’s record to 2-0.
The C.W. Post field hockey team began conference play Tuesday at home against East Stroudsburg University. They will attempt to carry their success into a two-game away trip this weekend, September 15th-17th,where they will face Shippensburg University on Friday and Mansfield University on Saturday.

The C.W. Post football team has seen a rough start to the 2011 season.  The team tabbed fourth out of eight Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference East teams in preseason polls has yet to find its pace in the first two games of the season, losing 13-7 in overtime against American International College on September 3rd and 41-13 most recently against California University (Pa.) last Saturday, September 10th.
The home opener on September 3rd was a nail biter down to the last play. After earning a 7-0 lead going into the half, the Pioneers relinquished their lead less than a minute into the fourth quarter. The rest of regulation time passed without another goal, sending fans into a frenzy and the game into overtime.
The drama carried into overtime, however, came to an unfortunate climax for the Pioneers when Yellow Jacket defensive back Markell Rice intercepted a pass by the Pioneers’ redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Laurino. Rice carried the ball 95 yards and into the end zone for AIC, scoring the winning touchdown and handing C.W. Post an 0-1 record to start the season off with.
The team did not fare any better in their first away contest of the season against 22-ranked California. Boasting transfers from Division I schools like West Virginia, Ole Miss, Towson, Army, Alabama, Temple, Virginia and Navy, the Vulcans made the Pioneers easy prey, allowing only one C.W. Post touchdown, by junior running back Thomas Beverly, to break the shutout.
The Pioneers will be back in action this Saturday, September 17th in Erie Pennsylvania as they face Mercyhurst and try to get back on track.

New York has always been a diverse state, so it is not surprising that our colleges reflect that diversity. Typically there are two divisions of all these schools, city and suburbs. This division provides a completely different feeling from college to college for students. Our own school is smack in the middle of suburbia, yet we are able to boast many of the same programs and activities as big city schools. So what is it really, that sets the big city schools apart from us?
Whether you’re a commuter or a resident, there is no doubt that you have explored parts of Brookville and the areas surrounding our campus. In just a ten-mile radius we have shopping malls, restaurants, parks, movie theaters, and bars. Senior Business Administration major Annalisa Crecco says, “The biggest difference is the atmosphere that a school in the suburbs creates.” Post has that small town feel, yet is close to all the big city amenities. In contrast, some schools in New York City are spread out over blocks, making it harder for students to get the community feeling that our campus offers. Even if Post is situated between gated communities, it really does not feel that way. Once you drive onto campus, it feels as if we are in our own (very small) town. There are places all around campus that everyone knows, but also there are other little hidden places that you just happen to discover one day. Did you know about the dollhouse on campus? It was built as a playhouse for Marjorie Post’s daughters, when the Post family lived here. It was built as a miniature version of the mansion on campus. You would discover similar treasures in a small town as well. It probably will not happen to you on a big city campus.
Of course if you go to college in a city, you will be close to museums and all different kinds of historical sites. Students at Boston University or Harvard are steps away from the sites of the American Revolution. At Georgetown, students can walk to the Capitol, and even check out the White House. Even in our own city of New York, students are able to visit countless museums on their own time, or even during class time. Just because our school is in the suburbs does not mean that we are excluded from these things. Our campus sits on a piece of history; it is a museum itself. Our students can say they worked in a mansion, or they took classes in what used to be a barn or a garage.
Every school is different, and every school will have a different feeling to it. There are schools that sit in the heart of the city that can still create a small town feeling among their students. The town built around the college and formed its own community. The city vs. suburbs debate really comes down to a personal decision. There are activities that can only be offered to you by a college that is located in a city, such as access to the hottest clubs, world-class restaurants, and a thriving city life.  The same goes for a college in the suburbs. You can go into the neighborhood deli and they know your order. Choosing a college in the city versus a suburban college also has to do with where you live and what you are comfortable with. If you have lived in the suburbs all your life, you may want to experience that big city lifestyle, or you may want to stay with what you know. Crecco wants to stay with what she knows; “I’m a homebody, so for me, living at home and going to school is a better fit. I do sometimes wish I did go to school in the city, since there is always something going on.”  The thing to remember is that suburbs exist for a reason. They were meant to be a place where people who work in cities can live and still have a backyard, but not be far from their jobs. Even if we go to school in the heart of suburbia, the big city is never too far away, 25.8 miles to be exact.

Out with the old and in with the new! Those who returned to C.W. Post, you may have noticed that Hillwood underwent several changes since the spring semester.  For many students, Subway in the Hillwood Commons is a popular destination to grab a quick lunch with friends.  The notoriously long line during peak hours (especially common hour) throughout the past years prompted renovations during the summer. According to the C.W. Post Dining Services website, the renovations that took place were intended to speed up service to make the wait shorter.
Subway no longer shares the space with Java City, which was eliminated from the Hillwood Commons.  However, for those who need their daily infusion of caffeine, Hillwood’s newest addition this year is Starbucks, which is located in what used to be the Little Shop of Commons. Also you may notice that those who previously worked in Java City are now working in Starbucks. This is great news for many, especially for the students who dorm as it will no longer be necessary to drive to Wheatley Plaza to purchase your customized cup of joe.
On the first day of classes, both students and faculty could be found waiting on the very long line at the popular coffee shop throughout the day.  You may have even noticed more Starbucks cups on the desks in classrooms than usual.  The newly renovated Subway was thriving with business as always while students waited on line to order their sandwiches. When senior Social Work major Lauren Fiore was asked her opinion on the renovated Subway and new Starbucks, she responded, “I think the subway expansion is a good idea. Hopefully more students will be able to be served during busy times like common hour. As for Starbucks, I’m more than excited to say the least! I think that it being built in Hillwood Commons is the best location on campus and will definitely do well!”   While there are students who will often be found at the new Starbucks, there are those who are unfazed by Hillwoods added luxury.  When asked his opinion on Starbucks, senior Geography major Abrom Shepard replied, “I don’t really drink coffee.  Starbucks will definitely not affect me.  I only like the white chocolate mocha.  I think they should open a McDonalds.”
Like everything, there will be people who are for and against the new Starbucks.  For many, the opening of Starbucks is very convenient and will have a positive effect on the future of C.W. Post.  For others, it’s just not their cup of tea.

Welcome to the Pioneer’s 2011 political column! One thing I promise to do with this column is to make it as interesting as possible to keep you guys updated on some of the pressing issues that are going on right now, that are crucial to us. Whether they are local or national political issues, I know that some of the interviews and presidential addresses that come to your attention some nights when you’re watching TV can be very lengthy, and sometimes boring, but all of the issues that are addressed by the President and Congress affect us and our future. Politics may be hard to understand, but are ultimately important to all of us. Whether it’s a little vote to save a forest from getting cut down, or a larger election to decide who will become the next President of the United States, we should get involved, or at least become aware of what is happening in the world. I mainly like to focus on the issues that are affecting our generation.
Recently there was a proposal to issue a bond for $400 million (check amount) of Nassau County taxpayers’ money spent on rebuilding the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Many, myself included, felt that this was outrageous. Our taxes are high enough as it is and they wanted to raise them to pay for a new Coliseum? Granted many of us Long Islanders enjoy many of the events that occur at the Coliseum, but there are many other improvements that need to be made to our county. If taxes were raised at all they should at least go to things like helping the homeless, or funding jobs for those with families who are still unemployed.  When the results came in,  the majority of people had voted against raising their taxes to spending money on a new Coliseum. This goes to show the power and effect that voters can have.  Anyone can make a change. To do so, we must be aware of what is happening. By being aware of what is going on, you can do something to make a change, and your voice can be heard.

Classes, check.  Textbooks, a sort of check; you’ll get to them when you get the money. New school clothes, a definite check. Goals for the semester?  Each student has his/her own reason for going to school, but the bottom line is we all want to succeed.  Maybe in the past we slacked off for numerous reasons such as work, partying, not knowing what to expect and many other things. But it’s not too late! With a new semester, you have a brand new chance to start over, and bring up your cumulative average. Your fellow classmates have similar views on what they want to accomplish this semester.
Junior Journalism major Jazlyn Beltre says, “My goal is to get a perfect, or near perfect GPA. To do this, I even took two extra days off from work to devote to studying and getting better grades.”
Senior Photography major Emily Rawson has similar goals, “I hope to get better grades. I kind of slacked off last year in some of my C.O.R.E. classes when I know I could have done better. I hope that this year I go out with a bang, and my grades look great.”
Junior Criminal Justice major Will Adams has a very specific goal, “ I just want to be able to afford the semester. I have to pick up more hours at work and pray that I don’t have to take out loans. I will definitely study hard and show up for all my classes.”
Freshman Michelle Wilson, undeclared, says, “I just hope to make some new friends. This is my first year away from home and I just want to make some new friends, decide what I want to do and have a good time. Isn’t that what college is about?”
The semester is only a week underway, we have the power to make it a great semester, or flush it down the toilet (but that wouldn’t be a good idea). Your professors are always there for extra help, and there are many workshops on campus that readily supply help.  Making new friends is always a great way to start a semester, so even if you have to go out of your comfort zone to join a new club, it might be worth it. You’ll be able to connect with others, and you’ll have somebody to hang out with long after classes are over. These are just a few ideas; the possibilities are endless.  Now what are your goals going to be?

Last Wednesday marked the first day of classes, which you obviously all know. It also marked the last day of summer vacation, the last day to sleep in. For those of us who are  commuters, we again have to face the traffic, the parking limitations, and getting that first cup of coffee in the morning. For those who are new to the commuter system, welcome! As a treat for you,  here are some tips from a long-time commuter at Post.
Guys, this doesn’t relate to you, but girls need time to get ready in the morning. (Sorry to break it to you, but we don’t wake up perfectly poised).  I like to wake up an hour before I have to leave so I can figure out what to wear and how to do my hair. There are definitely days that I’m just not in the mood to make the effort, and instead  I throw on ‘whatever’ and run to class.. But it’s the beginning of the school year! We should show that we care for a few weeks at least. (It also looks good to the professors.) .
Departure time is tricky. I have the luxury of not having to take parkways to school, but some of you do not. So fifteen minutes before your scheduled departure, you should check the traffic, consider your alternatives and decide whether you have to leave early. Getting to class on time is very important. It not only reflects on you as a person, but it may affect your grades as well.
Now that you’re on your way to class and hopefully driving safely, you get to the campus to find that all  available  parking is a mile away from where your classes are held. I enjoy the walk so I always park in a distant spot,  but I see those who brave it out and wait for a spot closer to campus. I definitely give those of you who do it much credit, but I would rather take the walk especially on the few nice days we have left. So now that you have braved getting up early, the drive, and the walk, you are ready to get to class on time. Hey, if you have a few extra minutes, get a cup of coffee or quick breakfast on the way too. Since we drive we can stop anywhere on the way and avoid waiting on the crazy lines at school. And I always love the jealous stares from my classmates when I walk in with my once- a- week frappuccino. So my fellow commuters, have a wonderful semester and be on time!

A Student Ambassador’s job requires a number of duties such as conducting scheduled campus tours for all potential students and their families, participating in Admission events, such as Open Houses, Post Preview Days, and Graduate and Transfers events, hosting prospective students who shadow their classes, and providing office support for the Admissions Office. Most importantly, Student Ambassadors serve as tour guides and answer any questions or concerns a visiting family might have. They also make the potential students and families feel comfortable by ensuring them that C.W. Post is the right choice for them.
Student Ambassadors are enthusiastic, and excel when it comes to public speaking. They must be able to communicate well with their visitors on their tours and feel confident as the leader of the group. Although most people can readily agree that everyone possesses different qualities and characteristics that make them different from one another, some qualities that all Student Ambassadors share in common are their outgoing and bubbly personalities, along with a strong sense of self and knowledge about the school.
Every year, students have the opportunity to apply for one of the seventeen positions. They must fill out an application that can picked up in the Admissions Office and then must go through an interview process. If you are a ‘people person’ and love talking and interacting with others, then the Student Ambassador position is for you. The pay is minimum wage and the work is about 6-10 hours a week.
One of the newer ambassadors, Sophomore Speech Pathology major Justine Lopez said, “I love this job because I enjoy interacting with people and being the person who can have an impact on someone’s decision to come to C.W. Post. Being an ambassador gives me the perfect opportunity to get involved on campus and meet different people.”
Bryan Smith, Freshman Admissions Counselor, is in charge of the Student Ambassador program. “One of the best aspects of my job is being able to work hand-in-hand with our own students in the recruitment process. With roughly 70 percent of graduating high school seniors stating that their visit played the most important part in their college selection, the need to have highly qualified and effective admission ambassadors cannot be understated,” says Smith. “We are lucky to have such an outstanding group of students working in the office this year.”
For more information about the ambassador program please contact either David Follick, Director of Admissions, or Bryan Smith, Freshman Admissions Counselor at 516-299-2064.

Every fall they pile onto campus, wide-eyed and ready to start a new chapter in their lives, college.  Some of them may go on to be the leaders of tomorrow, paving a big road for themselves that starts at C.W. Post.  For some, C.W. Post was a choice they made after beginning college, transferring here to give themselves a new start.  So who are these fresh faces, and what do they plan to do with their time at Post?
This fall, 930 freshmen have begun their college careers as C.W. Post Pioneers, and an additional 550 transfer students who have chosen to continue their studies here at Post will join them.  Ian Boswell, a film major, one of the 930 incoming students, said that he’s excited for the change of pace that college will offer him.  “I’m excited for the freedom to study what you want…in high school you’re not given a lot of opportunity to study whatever you want,” said Boswell.
The class of 2015 consists of students from locations throughout the country, with some traveling from as far as Puerto Rico and Hawaii to attend classes here.  In all these new undergraduates come from a total of 26 different states.
The most popular courses of study among this year’s freshmen are education, business, psychology, criminal justice, forensic science and accounting.  Boswell, explained that he is excited for his Film program as a whole.  “The entire program in the way it’s designed…it’s really holistic in the way it approaches teaching film.”
For Michelle Morey, a freshman print and electronic journalism major, working at the campus radio station, WCWP, as a high school intern was what helped her to choose Post.  She also added that the thing she’s excited for the most is simply college itself.  “I’m looking forward to just growing as a person in general throughout college and just getting to experience so many different things,” said Morey.

As Hurricane Irene barreled up the East Coast of the United States and toward Long Island on August 27th, leaving a behind her a wake of destruction, the C.W. Post Campus braced for the impact.
During the storm, the Pratt Recreational Center, which has been designated as an American Red Cross mega shelter, acted as just that, housing some 90 people who had been evacuated from their own homes throughout Long Island.
C.W. Post Provost, Dr. Paul Forestell said of the arrangement, “We were pleased to provide the American Red Cross with a secure facility on the C.W. Post Campus to assist local citizens impacted by the storm.”
At approximately 5am on Sunday August 28, C.W. Post lost power, forcing the campus to resort to using back-up generators in order to light the facilities being utilized.  Due to the storm, the campus was forced to shut down for two days, an event that is unprecedented in C.W. Post history.  Power was restored 2 days later on August 30 at approximately 12pm.
The campus radio station WCWP, 88.1FM, conducted live broadcasts from both its on-campus studios and the Pratt Recreational Center, delivering top-of-the-hour reports along with updates from the National Weather Service and the latest evacuation information throughout Saturday night.  These updates enabled the 280 students who had stayed on campus to remain up to date with what was going on throughout the storm.
Over all, despite Irene’s high winds and pounding rains, the buildings and campus  walked away relatively unscathed, reporting that only small branches had fallen from trees throughout campus.  Campus services also reported some minor flooding in buildings like the Little Theater but added that the problems were quickly repaired.
According to Bill Kirker, Director of Facilities Services, damages sustained at the Brookville Campus were limited due to adequate planning on the University’s part.  Kirker added, “Early preparations ensured there was no major damage…We pruned trees, moved equipment inside, gassed up generators, and took other precautions to ensure the campus property was secure.”

An exciting new addition has come to Post! On September 6th, Starbucks debuted on campus at Hillwood Commons, in front of the ASL Gallery. The opening of the new coffee shop provides students with new meal choices and work opportunities.
The opening of Starbucks left students wondering if the new coffee spot will cause tuition prices to rise. According to Shawn Carvajal, the senior food service director at Aramark, the corporation that provides the dining services at Post, “there is no cost associated with tuition and the new Starbucks.”  Samantha Vega, a special education major and a junior, loves the fact that the new Starbucks won’t make tuition prices rise and since she’s been here, tuition has gone up $2,000.
While the prices at the Hillwood Starbucks are in line with the prices at the Starbucks located off-campus at the nearby Wheatley Plaza, students can continue to enjoy the benefits of using their meal cards at the new location.  Carvajal states that, “within the next few weeks the Universal Starbucks Card can also be used.”
Sheree Elder, a master of arts music theory and composition graduate student, said, “I think it’s great that there is a new Starbucks on campus. Most people like Starbucks, and it gives the school an exclusive edge over other campuses.”
The new store has also created jobs for the student body during these tough economic times.  Carvajal said, “We have had several students apply for positions at the new store, and there are a handful of students who are currently working for us.” He also added that anyone could apply for a position there; while experience is preferred, they are willing to train. As far as the job opportunities provided by the new Starbucks, Vega thinks it’s a good idea. “There are a lot of places on campus that don’t hire students,” Vega said, “and this gives students more options than just sitting at a desk.”
Students who are interested in working at Starbucks can stop by Room 240 in Hillwood Commons and ask for an application. Flexible work hours are provided.
Elder thinks there are more positives associated with the addition of the new Starbucks adding, “It’s going to make Hillwood exciting again, rather than having the same options all the time.”
The new Starbucks is open seven days a week, and its hours are Monday-Thursday 7:30 a.m.- 9 p.m., Fridays 7:30 a.m-6 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m.-6 p.m.

It has been 10 years, a full decade, since the America we knew had changed forever- 10 years since the horrific incidents that occurred on September 11, 2001. Now, a decade later, we still mourn for the thousands of lives and families affected by what happened. On the anniversary of the horrific attacks, a memorial ceremony was held on the C.W. Post Campus to help those still mourning to heal and to remember all those who were affected by the attacks.
Most of the students at Post today were very young at the time of the attacks. “I was in elementary school,” explained Dontae Hawkins, a junior film major at C.W. Post, who went on to say that at the time of the attacks he “felt as if I was watching a movie, being too young to comprehend the seriousness of the disaster.”
Briana Nussbaum, a junior art education major, who was also in elementary school at the time, said that, “I may have been young, but as I watched about the incident on the news and heard everyone talk about it, I started to understand how serious this was. We had always felt so safe here, and knowing this all was happening only an hour way was a scary realization.”  Now, 10 years later, many are left wondering how they should view and treat the events that occurred that day.
This year, eyes still teared up as the names of those who were lost that day were read aloud, and many gathered in the Interfaith Center for a memorial ceremony to remember all of the lives affected.
After an introduction by Father Ted Brown and a Psalm sung by the C.W. Post chorus, candles were lit as Post students from all different walks of life stood together to help bring our community closer together during this difficult time. Later in the ceremony, Rabbi Jill Kreitman, Pastor John Dornheim, and Mr. Zeshan Hamid, the Islamic advisor at Post, all recited prayers stemming from different religions, but all giving the same message or remembrance and togetherness.
Soon after, Deacon Greg Kandra gave a reflection speech about his thoughts on the attacks and how our country has recovered from them. Following a final prayer from the Assistant Director of Religious Life, Jeanette Murray, and a singing of the Post Alma Mater, “When Evening Falls,” by Mates-Wolpe, the service concluded, but heads still hung low, and eyes were still covered in tears as the Post community united once more to honor those that were lost while still questioning whether America has truly healed after this time passed.
Deacon Kandra stated that, “we have all been able to process it, but I don’t think we will all completely heal. As time goes on, it gets easier.” Father Ted Brown echoed a similar message, saying that, “we have, to some extent, healed, but it is like a scab that is still easily picked.” This feeling was mutual among students as well. Michael Riggs, a junior music major at Post, stated that there is still a “feeling of a lost community.”
If we gain nothing else from these events, our community and our nation still come together to mourn as one and comfort each other once a year on September 11th.  No matter the religion, race, gender, or sexual orientation, everyone comes forward to help heal one another. Although people may disagree about whether or not our nation will ever completely heal, Americans will always have the newfound togetherness and community they have built.

Full-time faculty at C.W. Post went on strike on the morning of September 7th, in response to a said walk out on contract negotiations by the University’s administration on the evening of Tuesday, September 6th.
The disagreement between the two parties involves a wage proposal on behalf of the administration that, according to CWPCF.org, offered a 0% increase in salary this year, a 2% lump sum payment in addition to their current salary for the following two years, and a possible wage increase of their base salary at the end of the third year if gross tuition revenue exceeds 5% of the previous year. Also, in the 4th and 5th year of the contract, the faculty’s base salary would be increased by 2%.
Dissatisfied with these terms, the C.W. Post Collegial Federation (CWPCF), the faculty union, comprised of approximately 300 full-time professors, came back with an alternative proposal outlining a 0% salary increase in the first year, with a 3.5% base salary increase for the following two years. (CWPCF.org)
In response to the strike, the C.W. Post Provost, Paul Forestell, wrote a letter to the student body detailing University protocol during the strike, as well as offering many reasons as to why the administration did not reach a compromise with the faculty union by the start of the new semester. The proposal submitted by the University during negotiations was, as Forestell describes, “designed to minimize tuition increases, to preserve student scholarships, to improve facilities, and to maintain equitable compensation rates for all our faculty and staff.” (LIU.edu)
A letter addressed to students on the CWPCF website states, “We offered to accept a wage freeze for this year, and were willing to keep working towards a fair and equitable resolution. Yet, the administration walked away from the bargaining table”. However, when asked about the walk out, Provost Forestell commented, “Negotiations continued on the basis of evidence of good progress, and the University always made it clear that we were available for continued discussion.”
On Wednesday morning, members of the faculty union began picketing at both campus gates. Most of the signs worn by the faculty detailed information regarding their cause and affiliations with labor unions, such as NYSUT and the American Federation of Teachers. Other signage contained messages directed at the administration.
Though a large portion of the staff was on strike last week, some classes still met. According the University’s website, “During the first two days of the semester, more than 70% of our classes have met”.  The website also indicates that this has been made possible because many courses at C.W. Post are taught by adjunct faculty who are a part of a separate union.
Many classes during the first week of school were full for only a short period of time until students felt it was a safe assumption that class was cancelled, even though signs on each doorway reading “All Classes Are In Session” indicated otherwise.  Some students still hadn’t had any classes as of Friday, September 9th, and have expressed that this could have a negative impact on their educations.  Ashley Babst, commented, “If we lose a semester, then I’m probably going to be pushed into my 6th year.”  Others feel that waiting until this point in the year to reach an agreement is irresponsible. Allie Heisner, a junior childhood education major, said, “I think they should have figured this out before school started. Considering the amount of money we pay at this school, we should be able to go to class.”
C.W. Post Collegial Federation President, Harvey Kushner, expressed that the faculty is on the same page as its students and understands its frustrations. “We know what you’re going through; we had the same feelings as you do. We look at you like you’re our extended family. Understand that we have your best interests in mind, and in the long run, it’s going to be a better institution.”
On Saturday, September 10, the University’s website posted information regarding the strike, indicating that negotiations had resumed, and as of Sunday, September 11, both parties have come to an agreement on a five year contract, putting full-time faculty back in the classroom as of Monday, September 12. Fortunately, both parties involved in this disagreement came to an amicable solution, and feelings of normalcy can once again permeate throughout the student body at C.W. Post.

At first, I didn’t want to sound ignorant when writing this. And perhaps, I am. However, this school costs every one of us over 40,000 dollars a year and I believe that someone from our student body should speak up and voice their concerns. In all honesty, I think that this entire strike is complete crap. These professors looked like morons wearing their signs in the pouring rain. And might I add, the signs strongly resemble the same signs that they used to picket years ago. I did some research and found that this happened before in 2003 and they were upset that they were not making enough of a raise. In an economy where thousands of people are getting laid off and taking pay cuts just so they can keep their job, our school provides jobs that actually come with pay increases, yet those pay increases are not enough for these professors. They would rather sit out in the pouring rain and make a mockery out of our student body.
 
I’m sure that a good majority of parents that send their children to school here have gone through some financial hardships within the last few years. I had to watch my grandmother, who worked as an interior decorator for a builder her entire life, get laid off once the housing market went belly up. Now, she is barely getting by on her Social Security check each month. And these professors who are lucky enough to still even get a raise year after year want to picket out in front of our school because their raise wasn’t enough. Or because their medical benefits got cut. Nearly every business in the United States has cut back on benefits. If you read any bit of the news, you will find that their are numerous municipalities and state governments, including our own, that are in budget deficits due to the amount of money devoted to pensions, healthcare, and other fringe benefits. We are in a double-dip recession, as many have put it, and they should feel lucky that they still have benefits as well as room for more money.
 
If you are a student, you should feel absolutely ashamed to go to this school right now. As far as I’m concerned, our professors who are supposed to be WANT to teach us have failed us. We are the ones who pay their salaries and they have let us down. Giving them more money means we must pay more money for tuition. I am tired of having tuition raised every year. And many people will say well C.W. Post is a private institution and is run like a business. We, the students, are the shareholders, my friends. Our money should be coming back to us in the form of a dividend, not by making the the CEO’s wallet fatter. The school has done a great job in recent years by using our money to renovate dorm buildings, provide free transportation to local businesses, a Starbucks, and a new gaming lounge, to name a few. That money shouldn’t be going back to the teachers. In my opinion, they get paid enough.
 
Harvey Kushner, the president of the striking union was quoted in saying that 60,000 dollars wasn’t enough for a person in this region to live off of. I guarantee you offer 60,000 dollars to anyone  that recently graduated from C.W. Post with an Education degree and they take that in a heartbeat. There are tons of people that can live off of that salary even if it is in New York. And on average, full-time professors are said to make between 95,000 and 133,000 dollars a year, and that is for working 10 months because they get summers off. So, why are these people making us look stupid by sitting outside with signs that don’t even say why they are on strike.
 
If you ask me, I think it’s time we bring in the replacements. I don’t really want to be taught by any of these greedy bastards. Perhaps, we could lower tuition if we could get some teachers here that actually care about the students.
 
If you want to view the proposal that these morons rejected, it can be found online on the school’s website. The Provost wrote a very nice memo today about the situation and you could see how greedy these people truly are.
 
If this goes on any further, or tuition gets raised because of this, I am going on strike. Feel free to join me.
