Ryan Derham is a wide receiver for the LIU Post football team. Last season he played in all 11 games of the season and started in one of them. This season, he has 13 catches for 218 yards and three touchdowns. To open up the 2012 season, Derham had a touchdown reception in each of the first three games of the season. 
Q: What was your personal best moment (career highlight) as a member of the Pioneers?
A: My personal best career highlight was probably during a big game my junior year against the #2 ranked team in the nation at the time, Bloomsburg University, in a foot or more of snow catching my first career touchdown for about 30 yards, and I’m pretty sure I started my first game as well. It just created a great vibe and confidence for the rest of the season, it also put trust in my coaches that I can help my team win.
Q: What was the most memorable game you were a part of as a member of LIU?
A: My most memorable game at LIU Post had to again be my junior year beating the #2 Bloomsburg University. We had no one that believed in us to win, we were the total underdog, plus we are a spread passing team which is supposed to be very hard to do in a foot or two of snow. Especially against a team who was supposedly a great running team offensively. We stopped their running attack and passed the ball in the snow just as good as if it wasn’t even snowing. To be a part of that and contributing a decent amount is a great feeling and memory to this day.
Q: What has being a Pioneer meant to you?
A: What being a Pioneer means to me is just holding yourself accountable for your actions, good or bad while creating a bond between students and athletes to exemplify Post Pride.
Q: What are you going to miss most about LIU Post?
A: What I’ll miss about LIU Post is the great people I’ve met and been lucky enough to become friends with. There are so many good memories that have gone on either on the football field, in the dorms, or going out with all your friends from Post. Just going to miss the great learning experiences you come across as I’ve grown from a freshman to a senior. I don’t want to say I’ll miss the people I’ve met here and became friends with because I truly hope to stay friends with mostly all of them even out of college. I’m going to miss the brotherhood, the team, the sacrifice given everyday to achieve a certain goal, and the relationships created with good people that I may no longer see.
Q: If you could be a part of any NFL team who would it be with and why?
A: The NFL team I’d like to be a part of is the New York Giants just because Eli [Manning] is such a clutch player and leader and you don’t really get anything better than being in NYC.
Q: What do you hope to do in the future after this season?
A: What I hope for in the future is finishing school getting my bachelors in Business Management, as well as do more and more social networking meeting more and more people. I’d like to start great internships, getting my masters which everyone needs nowadays to get a good job. I want to create successful opportunities for myself and other people around me earning respect with any move I make. In addition to staying healthy, I want to provide for my family and maybe meet a nice girl on the way.
Q: Most memorable quote/best piece of advice you’ve heard while being a member of the Pioneers?
A: Best advice I’ve been given and understood as being a Pioneer is just be real with what you do and say. Honesty may be harsh at first but the other genuine people in the end will fully respect you for doing so. Also, don’t hold back your emotion in anything competitive in life and strive for the best. Don’t let anyone embarrass you or your family.

Grayson Laurino is a dynamic player for the LIU Post football team as he has played wide receiver and punter throughout his entire collegiate career for the Pioneers. He even played quarterback Week 8 of this season against East Stroudsburg University. In the 2011 season, Laurino was a member of the ECAC All-Star Team and the PSAC East First Team. Last year he caught 33 passes for 443 yards and three touchdowns. As a punter he averaged 37.5 yards in 64 chances as the punter. This season, Laurino has 27 catches for 186 yards and one touchdown catch. 
Q: What was your personal best moment (career highlight) as a member of the Pioneers?
A: I have been very lucky to have had a very successful career for the Pioneers but, I don’t know if I have a career highlight. I have had many great punts and great catches during my career. One moment that I will never forget as a Pioneer is the day my brother signed to play here. Not very many people have an opportunity to play with their brother. We have a very special connection on and off the field and I was ecstatic when he decided to join me as a Pioneer. 
  Q: What was the most memorable game you were a part of as a member of LIU?
A: Two games standout for me. The first game is last year’s win against Shippensburg. We had started the season off 0-3 and were really struggling as a team. Shippensburg was a very good opponent and many players had doubts in their mind about our talent. We played an exceptional game capitalizing on all three phases of the game and were able to turn our season around. The second game was last year against Bloomsburg in the blizzard. Bloomsburg was ranked #2 in the nation and the snow heavily favored their style of play. We shut them down and came out on top in a very close game.  
Q: What has being a Pioneer meant to you?
A: Being a Pioneer has been extraordinary. My coaches and teammates have changed my life forever. This program and school will forever be in my heart.  Q: What are you going to miss most about LIU Post?
A: Football. Coaches. Teammates. The atmosphere. The Fans. Home Games. The list could go on and on.
  Q: If you could be a part of any NFL team who would it be with and why?
A: I would be grateful to be part of any NFL team. If I had to choose it would be the Patriots, being able to play with Tom Brady would be unbelievable. For the record, I am a JETS fan.  
Q: What do you hope to do in the future after this season?
A: My desire is to continue my football career as long as possible. When my playing days come to an end I would like to work for a professional sports team and eventually coach.  
Q: Most memorable quote/best piece of advice you’ve heard while being a member of the Pioneers?
A: “Perfection is an Understatement.” -The Gillas

There were over 51 million viewers watching the Vice Presidential debate in early October. According to an October 12th article in the Los Angeles Times, “Nielsen: 51.4 million people watched Joe Biden-Paul Ryan debate” by Meg James, how can one not think that the debates strongly impact the voters of our nation, especially when social media is overflowing with public opinion. The debates give Americans an opportunity to compare and contrast the candidates, their policies and styles, by listening or watching on T.V. It is also a chance to see how our leader deals with pressure and conflict, which are important things to consider when voting.
Yet, despite the apparent interest, according to various studies, debates do not make or break the elections. According to the Washington Monthly, in his article “Do Presidential Debates Really Matter?”, John Sides states that “Scholars who have looked most carefully at the data have found that, when it comes to shifting enough votes to decide the outcome of the election, presidential debates have rarely, if ever, mattered.” The effect of the debates on eventual votes are likely mild, and, in most cases, nonexistent.
Journalism major Dorianna Valerio, does not believe that the debates can have a significant impact on the elections, yet she still follows the Presidential debates. “I believe the debates are useful in showing character. You get to see how each candidate acts and you get a sense of what they are about.” said Valerio. But, she also believes that the debates can be difficult for Americans to decipher. “I think the debates are useful in keeping Americans educated in general. However,  I believe watching the debates can be overwhelming; as you try to separate truth from embellishment.”
But, how so if immediately after the first Presidential debate, polls indicated that President Obama’s lead began to decline? “Analysts criticized Obama for a weak performance, and Romney has since seen a bump in the polls among likely voters,” according to the James article in The Los Angeles Times. Also, even though Biden was seen as the victor in the Vice Presidential debate against Paul Ryan, according to an article in Reuters, “Fiery Biden sets stage for Obama recovery attempt,” by Patricia Zengerle on October 12, pollster Julia Clark said, “Vice presidential debates don’t change electoral outcomes, but it may have done a little bit to stem the tide.”
Yecenia Tapia, a Senior and Child Education major believes the debates are still very important to watch. “It’s a way for people to get to know their politicians a little more” she said. Tapia will be voting on November 6. Ashley Abney, Vice President of the NAACP club on campus and senior Public Relations major, watched the first presidential debate and half of the vice presidential debate. “I believe the Presidential debate has way more impact on the country,” says Abney. “because you’re hearing from the future head of state.” She also believes they are important because, “You see how they [the presidential candidates] respond to questions with details about their platform,” she states. “And how they interact with their competition.”
    Even though political scientists claim that the debates do little for the election, it does not mean that they are no longer important to watch. Because, what effects do exist are most likely caused by factors beyond the content of the debates, like media coverage and the candidates’ appearance, according to an October 3rd article in the Washington Post “Do presidential debates usually matter? Political scientists say no” by Dylan Matthews. It is for this reason that the debates are important to watch, so we are not as easily persuaded by the media to lean towards the side of a candidate without being fully informed of all the issues.
 Election Day is on Tuesday November 6. Vote 2012.

Though I have not written for the Pioneer in a while, I do refer students to join the staff as I feel is crucial to learning and the overall experience of contributing to the school’s newspaper. I am very pleased about the paper this semester, each issue has been a great read. I wish the staff all the best.
Cheers,
Sandra Elien

The women’s soccer team held the top seed in the East Coast Conference going into the playoffs. But the Pioneers fell to the number four seed, Dowling College, in the semifinal on Friday, November 2 at Golden Lion Field, Brookhaven, relocated due to Hurricane Sandy.
The women’s soccer team  had a great season , and claimed the number one spot in the conference, and earned the right to host the ECC Playoffs. Due to Hurricane Sandy, the soccer fields at LIU Post were not in good enough shape for the tournament to be played at the Pioneers’ home field, and the back up plan, both for the men and the women’s soccer teams, was to choose Golden Lion Field, at Dowling College as their home field for the playoffs. 
The Golden Lions used 17 minutes to put the first ball behind senior goalkeeper Nicole Fierro, as Alexandria Abruzzo headed a corner kick into the left corner. Dowling continued to pressure the Pioneers, and doubled the lead after 39 minutes when Lindsey Thompson broke away from the Pioneers defense and scored from 15 yards out. Neither teams managed to score again before halftime, and Dowling went into half-time with a solid 2-0 lead.
The Pioneers gained momentum right from the get-go in the second half, when freshman Susanne Vistnes scored her 19th goal of the season only 2 minutes into the half. Vistnes brought the ball down inside the box, and scored with a clinical finish into the lower left corner.
Dowling played good defense to deny the Pioneers another proper shot on goal, as they won the game 2-1, outshooting the Pioneers 19-10.
Vistnes was devastated after the loss: “I’m really disappointed. We worked hard and tried our best, but today it was not really good enough. I really wanted to reach the conference championship game,” said Vistnes.

To the Editors:
This Wednesday I picked up the latest issue of The Pioneer and to my surprise, I was presented with a refined and improved layout. As a weekly reader of The Pioneer, I have to say I absolutely love the new look, especially the new masthead. I find it simpler and more relevant for a student newspaper. I also noticed the addition of weather, a Top 10 Billboard chart, and box office results to the paper. These are the features students care about. Keep up the positive changes!
I look forward to reading future issues of The Pioneer and seeing our student newspaper evolve into a better and more informative piece of journalism.
Sincerely,
Bernie Fabig
’13 Public Relations Student

     On Sunday, October 28, students subscribed to LIU Post’s Emergency Notification System received a text message announcing that school would be closed on Monday and Tuesday, October 29 and 30. The “Super Storm”, better known as Hurricane Sandy, was predicted to hit campus early Monday morning.  
     In preparation for Sandy, Facilities Services started their normal storm procedures to make sure all the buildings were safe and secure and that all tools needed in an event of an emergency would be available. “Every storm is different,” said William Kirker, Director of Facilities Services. “We never know what to expect so we anticipate the worst.” Kirker also explained that the most common safety risk for students are the hanging tree limbs due to the strong winds from storms.   	
     The Office of Residential Life prepared the students for the weekend by putting up multiple informational flyers and passing out information with the procedure about what students were expected to do during the storm and what supplies they needed to stock up on. Most items on the list included water, batteries and non-perishable foods, since a power outage was anticipated. On Sunday, October 28, each Resident Hall Director went around their halls to ask students what their plans were for the following days—whether they planning to stay on campus or going home? Many of the RHD’s urged students to go home to be with their families rather than to stay on campus. 
     To further ensure the safety of LIU Post’s residential students, Res Life posted flyers on all residential hall exits warning students to stay indoors due to the high winds that the campus was experiencing late Sunday night.  	
     By late Monday afternoon, the campus lost power and relied on back up generators. On November 1, the Office of Residential Life released a letter to residential students and parents updating them on the life on campus after Hurricane Sandy. Parents of over 600 students that were still on campus were informed that the back up generators was providing “emergency lighting, heat and hot water”. Winnick was also open the next morning, “serving a continental breakfast, sandwich lunch, and dinner” from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
     By the next morning, students  could see the obvious damage created by Sandy on campus. Although no major property damage was sustained by any of the buildings on campus, there were many fallen tree branches, uprooted trees and trees split right in half. One of the trees in front of the Chapel was cut down immediately as it lost a huge branch. Kirker explained: “When this happened the tree was split down the middle. That tree had to come down before it fell down.”  	
     The clean up process for the storm may take months. The school was without power for a total of five days. Working with Long Island Power Authority, the majority of the campus regained power on Saturday afternoon. Criminal Justice senior Brian Rojas, a resident in Brookville Hall explained his joy when power was restored. “I was told that my hall didn’t have a charging station so I was charging my phone in my car. I was extremely excited when I realized the power was back on. You never realize how much you depend on electricity until everything stops working.”

     Imagine a day with no running water in the shower. This happened on October 15, when a pipe burst at approximately 9:30 a.m. in Post Residence Hall, and was leaking in the HEOP computer lab. Post Hall consists of both the residence hall, the first three floors and offices, in the basement, including the Higher Education Opportunity Program. The Facilities Department responded by shutting down the water in the entire building, including both the dorms and offices. 
The water was turned back on that night, but it was cold. “I was being tutored [in the HEOP lab] and there was a sound like a shower was being turned on, drops of water came down from the ceiling and about a minute later it was like a waterfall,” said Yisselis Ottenwalder, a junior Speech Pathology major, who goes to the HEOP building every Monday from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m.  Ottenwalder said the water was coming down from three tiles on the ceiling. She and her tutor moved right away because they and their belongings were getting wet. They went into another room nearby to finish their session, but she said that water was coming down like a stream in the entire building. “I never witnessed anything like this before,” said Ottenwalder. 
	“Tutoring was going on, there was a leak, minutes later we found it was gushing like Niagara Falls – and it was hot water,” said William Clyde, Jr., Director of the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) Office. There was a stream of water coming down from the ceiling to the entrance of the basement of the building for half an hour, said Clyde.  He said you had to roll up your pants to avoid getting wet. The lobby of the International Student Services offices and the entrance of Post were soaked. “Facilities were here in a heartbeat to fix the problem,” he said. They soaked up the water with three wet vacuums, found the source of the leak and shut it down, said Clyde. He said the leak in the pipe was caused by an overflow in the heating-cooling system. There was a leak in the HEOP office six years ago from a different source of water, Clyde said.
	Due to the leak, the HEOP computer lab was not fully functional on October 15. This lab is for all students on campus, but mainly for students in the HEOP program. “There was a little disruption for the day; with tutoring students and other students not being able to print,” said Clyde. He said he is thankful it didn’t happen at night, then everything in the office would have been ruined. Facilities fixed the ceiling by replacing the tiles the next day. He said the Facilities Department takes pride in their work. “If you go in the computer lab now, you can’t tell that there was a problem,” Clyde said. 
	Many residents in Post Hall were inconvenienced with no running water in the showers during the day. As a Post Hall resident, the incident made me feel uncomfortable all day. The water actually got shut off while I was in the shower with conditioner in my hair, unaware of the situation. Many others had a negative experience. “It was terrible, I had to pack up all my shower stuff and go to Riggs. I had to wait to get in there to shower because I don’t know people in other buildings,” said a student who did not wish to give his name. Several others agreed that they were inconvenienced. “It was after lacrosse practice, there was cold water in the showers, I took one anyway,” said Katie Ventrella, a freshman Accounting major. Others were forced to take a cold shower as well. “Better to take a cold shower after practice than smell,” said Jessica Marsh, a sophomore Math Education major. 
	Some Post Hall residents, though, were not affected by the incident. “I took my shower the night before; I was gone all day,” said Cathleen Joseph a senior Digital Art and Design major.  “It didn’t affect me; I was in class while it happened. I came back at the end of the day and it was back on,” said Veronica Hemmimger, a junior Criminal Justice major. 
	Clyde said he knows it was inconvenient for residents of Post Hall, but knowledge has been gained from this incident. “Two lessons have been learned, the value of water, hot water when we take a shower and wanting water to flow freely but not in places where we didn’t expect it-in the ceiling,” said Clyde. The Facilities Department is trying their best to prevent future problems. “The gentlemen who worked on it said they took care of the pipes in the ceiling and we shouldn’t have a problem again,” said Clyde.

Joe Alvarez, freshman voice major, won Post’s Got Talent October 18 for singing classical song “Because We Believe” by Andrea Bocelli. He has never received a vocal lesson in his life until last month. 
	Alvarez taught himself the song at his home in Schodack, N.Y.. He always enjoyed classical music, which was first introduced to him by his mom. 
	“I grew up listening to Pamaradi. His voice alone inspired me to be a classical singer,” Alvarez said.
	He spent a week preparing for Post’s Got Talent in between classes and work at the farm on campus. It’s not easy for him to keep up with his schedule of practicing for 30 to 60 minutes a day. “Oh god it’s hard,” Alvarez says as he thinks about it. 
	When it comes to performing, Alvarez only gets nervous before he gets on stage. He was nervous before Post’s Got Talent because he didn’t know what to expect from the competition. However, once he steps on stage all his nerves go away.
	“I was kind of at peace…being on stage is comfortable and relaxing to me,” Alvarez said. 
	He said that he was happy with his performance; although, he felt that a few other people did better than him when he was watching his competitors. 
	“I was so excited. I never really won anything like that before. It was cool; I was excited! I was excited to sing at pep rally,” Alvarez said. 
	As winner of Post’s Got Talent, he won $100, a trophy and a chance to sing at pep rally. “There was a lot more people at pep rally. I was more nervous singing at Post’s Got Talent than pep rally because I was being judged and competing for something,” he said. 
	At pep rally Alvarez got a standing ovation, which made him really happy. After pep rally people began coming up to him in Winnick and telling him how much they enjoyed his performance. 
	“At some points it made me speechless; it was the biggest audience I ever sang in front of. I didn’t expect to get that reaction from the pep rally. In my opinion, college crowds are hardest to please,” Alvarez said. 
	He wasn’t sure how it would be singing a classical song in front of college students at pep rally. He was glad he was singing the song that he did because it’s about looking up at the sky and believing, which he felt fit well with the event. Alvarez was just nervous because classic music isn’t as popular as other genres are with college students. 
“I think it’s [classical music] a dying art form and not many people pay attention to it. I don’t think it catches the attention of younger audiences. When I sang classical music at my [high] school people would jokingly make fun of it. They can’t understand what it is,” he said. 
	Alvarez started singing in his freshmen year of high school, where he joined the chorus. His teacher noticed his talent and began giving him solos and told him to go to NYSSMA, where his voice could be critiqued by judges. Both times he went he scored a 99. 
	His teacher continued to influence him to pursue a career using his voice. “She told me that I had a gift. I worked really hard through high school to make my voice better; they didn’t offer lessons and I couldn’t afford it,” Alvarez said. He explains that it isn’t easy to learn to sing without lessons, especially classical music. 
	He left on October 25 to go to Orlando, Florida with the church choir from Post this week to sing at a retreat for priests. He is continuing to develop his voice through music classes and by getting vocal lessons from Neal Harrelson, adjunct professor. Harrelson has been teaching Alvarez to control his voice better so he can hit higher notes with ease.

LIU Post hosted a blood drive on October 23 and 24 for the New York Blood Center in Hillwood from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.. The drive provided food and t-shirts for those who donated a pint of blood in what they designated as the canteen area so students were able to replenish right away.
“The need for blood is there because it is used daily,” said account manager, Michelle McCaffrey. According to McCaffrey, it takes about 45 minutes to give blood and the donation gets sent to local hospitals that are in need of the supply. “The hospitals use around 2,000 pints a day. Only 2% of the population actually donates, so that presents a challenge.” 
The organization’s goal for those two days was to have 250 people donate. According to one of the representatives, the turnout was “pretty strong”.
“I have an O blood type, which is universal. I’m used to donating every year for 4 years now… It’s just blood,” Leslie Zuriti, a senior Criminal Justice major, commented after just donating.
“This is my second time giving blood,” added Lauren Malesky, an undecided freshman. “It’s important because it could be you that needs that blood… you never know.” 
For one of the volunteers that helped out with the blood drive, the importance of these donations really hit home. “I had a heart operation in which I lost a lot of blood,” said Rolf Adams, a retired teacher who decided to give his time to help out with the event. “I needed 12 bags of palettes for the blood clotting. I got 8 bags from my family but the other 4 were from strangers that donated… It’s good to donate because last I heard it’s nice to help people.”
Along with taking blood donations, palettes and white blood cell donations were also taken for those who are in need. Be the Match was also present to recruit those who wanted to register to donate bone marrow. “We look for these sorts of diverse colleges because of the 9 million people on our donor list, 26% are minorities and that may be the hardest to match,” explained Jair Thompson, the recruitment supervisor for New York Bone Marrow Department. “We need to find people of the same racial background… to increase the amount of unrelated matched donors.”
The blood drive will be coming back once more on December.

LIU Post has a variety of different talents, both hidden and shown. The Alpha Xi Delta sorority gave many students a chance to show that at the Post Café event they hosted on Tuesday, October 23 at 8 pm. Students were able to sign up prior to the event, but they were also able to do it spontaneously, as the main point was for it to be an open-mic-night.
Post Café took place in Hillwood, right next to Starbucks, and the performers were heard throughout the building, attracting other students to come watch. The attendance was positive; the audience loudly supported the brave souls standing behind the microphone. 
This is the first time Alpha Xi Delta has done anything like this event, and approximately 50 to 70 students showed up. “We wanted to bring a lot of orgs together who usually don’t do things with Greek life ‘and open the door’, so that hopefully, in the future, there will be more unity on campus,” said Alpha Xi Delta sister, senior and Criminal Justice major Kristin Mendes. “It was also a great way to get everyone’s minds clear during midterms.” 
“I thought it was a great event where students were able to show their talents,” said Alpha Xi Delta sister, junior and Sociology major Marit Ronningen. “I think we should do it again, because it’s an awesome way to get to know new people.” She also said she does not think she has any talents that she would want to show other students, which is why she prefers to just sing in the shower. There were four AXD sisters all together that sang and read poetry.
Approximately 10 to 12 students performed, and some of them went twice. The participants did not get anything for joining. It was everything from songs, to poetry and raps, to guitar playing, and then a band finished the successful night. The event went one for an hour and a half. People left the area with satisfied looks, probably happy to be entertained by the many talents, and to get a valuable break from midterm studying. 
“I think the event went well. A good amount of people were there, and I thought everyone was respectful. I would definitely go again,” said senior and Marketing major Sanger De Vine.
The response among the students that showed up appeared to be positive, and it seemed like everyone enjoyed it. Maybe that means the sorority should think of hosting an event like this again. “Rumor has it, though, that there will be another open mic night in the upcoming future,” said Mendes.
