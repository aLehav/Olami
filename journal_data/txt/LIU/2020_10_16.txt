With the ongoing issue of Covid-19, everything from sports programs to theatre groups have had to make adjustments in order to ensure students’ safety. One such group is the Wind Ensemble, who have faced special challenges in resuming their rehearsals as students have returned to campus. 
The students and faculty of Wind Ensemble are no strangers to needing to adapt when it comes to the coronavirus, after dealing extensively with this issue last spring when campus was shut down. “Due to Zoom’s latency, it is impossible to play in time with each other” explained instrument performance music major (clarinet), Jacklyn Smith. “Instead, we spent the rest of the spring semester working on special projects,” said Smith. 
Professor McRoy, director of Wind Ensemble ensured the group was still able to make the most out of virtual learning. “We did a variety of different things,” said McRoy, “at the time we were working with a lot of music by composer Brian Balmages – preparing for our annual Band Festival when he would have been with us. In March-April, we did a deep dive on some of that music and did some analysis and other exploration.” 
In spite of their successful handling of the remote spring semester, students and faculty alike were grateful to be returning to in-person rehearsals. “After not having in-person rehearsals since early March, coming back to that environment is something I’ve really been looking forward to throughout these past few months” said Smith. This semester however, rehearsals will function differently than they ever have before, in order to ensure the group’s safety.
“We rehearse all spread out, six-plus feet apart…Percussionists wear gloves….Everyone has to use their own music stand. I wear a headset wireless mic broadcast through a speaker so everyone can hear me through my mask,” explained McRoy. 
Wind Ensemble has also had to deal with the added challenge of having woodwind and brass players, whose instruments require air flow in order to be played. Smith spoke about how these instrumentalists have found ways to play their instruments in a safe manner: “We made masks with a slit (so the mouthpiece fits through), and bell covers to further decrease the risk of contamination.”
 Even with masks, social distancing, gloves, and coverings on their instruments, Wind Ensemble has taken additional precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in their rehearsal space. “We rehearse for a period of time, then take a break for the air in our rehearsal hall to clean and change, then we return to continue to rehearse…There was a lot of scientific research done over the summer at the University of Colorado that we learned from on how to continue to make music in this environment,” explained McRoy, “It’s different, but it’s working.”
Now, the group is looking forward to what lays ahead for the remainder of the semester, including some virtual performances and events. “Right now, my plan is to record a performance in our rehearsal hall toward the middle of November – before Thanksgiving. We will then broadcast that via Zoom at a later date along with some interviews of students and perhaps some of the composers whose music we are preparing” said McRoy. This foresight and hardwork Professor McRoy has been putting into the group has not gone unappreciated by the students in the ensemble “[He] has worked extremely hard to ensure we have a wonderful and safe semester” said Smith.
With a successful method of holding safe rehearsals in place and some virtual events on the horizon, Wind Ensemble is excited for the rest of their semester of making music together, even if it’s done from six feet apart. “In rehearsal we talk openly about how great it is to be together doing what we love, and we also share openly what a challenge it is to do that in this environment. The key is to embrace it and not fight it. Turn every challenge into an opportunity to learn and grow” said McRoy.

“Saturday Night Live” returned for its 46 season on Oct. 3. Chris Rock hosted the show, it’s first in nearly six months due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Coming live from Studio 8H, in NBC’s Rockefeller Center Headquarters in Manhattan, the show followed visible guidelines due to the virus. All audience members had to undergo a series of questions regarding whether or not they had been in contact with COVID, had their temperature taken, and took a rapid COVID test. New guidelines set by New York State also mandated that audience members be “casted,” meaning if you could get your hands on tickets, you also got paid. 
Sean Ludwig, a freelance writer who attended the premiere of SNL on Oct. 3, said that he and his friends each received a check for $150 when the show was over.  
The main topic for the show’s first episode was the Trump-Biden first presidential debate. Alec Baldwin continued his role as President Donald Trump, and Jim Carrey made his debut as former Vice President Joe Biden. Beck Bennett played moderator Chris Wallace from Fox News.  
Throughout the night SNL poked fun at President Trump’s recent corona diagnosis. Host Chris Rock, addressed the “elephant in the room.” “President Trump’s in the hospital, from Covid,” he said. “And I just want to say, my heart goes out to Covid.” 
Olivia Ali, a senior education major, said she enjoyed the show. “Making politics into comedy, I loved it.” 
Musical guest Meg Thee Stallion used her performance time to highlight the importance of black women. Stallion told the audience “We need to protect our Black women and love our Black women because at the end of the day, we need our Black women. We need to protect our Black men and stand up for our Black men because at the end of the day, we’re tired of seeing hashtags of our Black men.”
The show ended with Kate Mckinnon in the audience, dressed as Ruth Bader Ginsburg. With her hand to her heart, Mckinnon bowed her head and the screen displayed the words “Rest in Power.” 
Saturday Night Live is expected to air at least four more live episodes throughout the month of October.

After a shortened season, the New York Yankees will not be advancing to the American League Championship Series after losing to the Tampa Bay Rays. The Rays beat the Yankees three games to two in a best of five American League Divisional Series. The 2020 American  League Divisional Series kicked off on Oct. 5th and consisted of a game running each day until Oct. 9th. The New York Yankees finished as the number five seed, which meant they played the number one seeded Tampa Bay Rays. Petco Park in San Diego, home of the Padres, hosted the series as a neutral site. This site served as part of the MLB bubble to ensure that the season can conclude with no coronavirus outbreaks.  
The New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays kicked off their divisional series on Oct. 5th with Game 1. The opening game of the series was a pitcher’s battle featuring Gerrit Cole of the Yankees and Blake Snell of the Rays. While Blake Snell won the 2018 Cy Young Award with the Rays, some would consider Gerrit Cole the best pitcher in the 2019 season when he was with the  Houston Astros. Despite the comparable star pitchers, the Yankees beat the Rays 9-3 to take a  commanding lead in the series. Game 2 kicked off the next day with JA Happ pitching for the Yankees and Tyler Glasnow pitching for the Rays. The Rays quickly forgot their loss the night before and won Game 2 with a score of 7-5 to tie the series. Game 3 kicked off the next day with Masahiro Tanaka on the mound for the Yankees and Charlie Morton pitching for the Rays. The Rays beat the Yankees with a score of 8-4, giving the Rays the series lead. Game 4  was win or go home for the Yankees, and they delivered by winning 5-1. Game 5 was an elimination game and the Yankees fell short. The Yankees lost 2-1 in Game 5 after Mike  Brosseau hit a game-winning home run off  Aroldis Chapman in the bottom of the 8th inning.  
The Yankees Game 5 performance left many Yankees and baseball fans with a mix of emotions. Kevin DeLeonardo, a senior business administration major, was surprised by the pitchers duel that took place. “I wouldn’t say I was surprised they lost because the Rays have been very good in the playoffs, but I was surprised they lost in such a low scoring game,” he said. “The Yankees have been scoring so many runs, so to see them score only one run in an elimination game was a little surprising. Although the Yankees postseason ended earlier than they would’ve liked, the Yankees made moves in the 2019 off-season to better their team for years to come. The Yankees signed Gerrit Cole from the Houston Astros on a $324 million contract, the largest contract in MLB history for a pitcher.

Despite optimism from fans before the season, the New York Giants and the New York Jets are both winless with 0-4 records a month into the NFL season. This offseason the Giants made some significant additions such as cornerbacks Logan Ryan and James Bradberry, offensive tackle Andrew Thomas, safety Xavier McKinney, linebacker Blake Martinez, and new head coach Joe Judge. While the Jets added players like wide receivers Breshad Perriman and Denzel Mims, offensive tackle Mekhi Becton, cornerback Pierre Desir, and running back Frank Gore. Even after adding these players and having hope for this season, the Giants lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-16 on Monday night football to open the season. The Jets didn’t fare much better with a 27-17 loss to the 4-0 Buffalo Bills as top running back Leveon Bell left with a hamstring injury. 
Even after a rough first week, the Giants had hope going into week two against the Chicago Bears. After a scoreless first half, the Giants came back to make it 17-13 but couldn’t score from the Bears 10-yard line to end the game. Even worse, the Giants lost star running back Saquon Barkley for the season after he tore his ACL in the loss. Even after the tough loss, the Giants had a chance to get their first win at home vs. the injury-riddled San Francisco 49ers. The Giants didn’t come close, as they were held to three field goals in a 36-9 loss while being outscored 20-3 in the second half and outgained 420-231. Next, the Giants traveled to take on the Los Angeles Rams, coming off a last-minute 3-point loss to the bills. The Giants defense stepped up this game holding the Rams to 17 points and 240 yards with just 116 in the first half, but the offense couldn’t capitalize being kept out of the end zone for the second week in a row resulting in a 19-7 loss and an 0-4 record. After the rough start, fans aren’t as enthusiastic as before the season. Avid Giants fan Eddie McQuade, a senior sports management major, is not happy with the front office. “I look forward to general manager Dave Gettleman getting fired, the Giants aren’t going to be good for at least three years, but I do think Joe Judge is the right man to turn this team around even if the front office is failing him,” he said.
After a tough week one loss, the Jets returned home to  MetLife Stadium to play against the San Francisco 49ers. Despite the 49ers having multiple players get injured during the game, the Jets had no answers on offense or defense, as evidenced by an 80-yard touchdown run by Raheem Mostert to open the game, which led to a 31-13 loss. The Jets next traveled to Indianapolis to take on the Colts. Despite throwing an early touchdown, quarterback Sam Darnold had a rough day with three interceptions and two that were returned for  touchdowns, resulting in another Jets loss 36-7. The Jets played the Denver Broncos on Thursday Night. The Jets started strong with a 46-yard touchdown run by Sam Darnold, the longest quarterback run in Jets history. After an injury scare to Sam Darnold, Broncos quarterback Brett Rypien threw two late interceptions, one a pick-six to get the Jets back in it. However, after hitting a field goal to go up by one, the Broncos came back to take command of the game at the end and handed the Jets another loss 37-28 to bring them to 0-4 on the season. Fans aren’t exactly happy with the slow start to the season as they had hoped something good might happen this season. James Waldhof, a senior broadcasting major had only one thing to say. “Tank for Trevor,” he said, in regards to hoping the Jets finish last in the league, so they could draft Clemson Tigers star quarterback Trevor Lawrence with the first overall pick. The Giants have a chance in the coming weeks to secure their first win as they take on teams such as the Dallas Cowboys, the Washington Football team, and the Philadelphia Eagles. McQuade is disappointed with the slow start, but understood it was likely. “As a Giants fan, I knew this year was gonna be bad thinking we could go 6-10, but now I wouldn’t be surprised if they go 3-13,” he said. In Contrast, the Jets have the complete opposite coming up, as they face teams such as the Arizona Cardinals, Los Angeles Chargers, Buffalo Bills, and reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.

The first and only Vice Presidential debate of the 2020 election year, took place on Oct. 7, at Kingsbury Hall, in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence discussed several major topics, including a COVID-19 vaccine, the state of the American economy, as well as the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic, and by extension, it’s global ramifications. 
Pence claimed that the current president Donald Trump and his administration will have a coronavirus vaccine ready to be administered by the end of the year. Pence repeatedly assured the viewers that not only will a coronavirus vaccine be administered before Jan. 2021, but that the United States military will be administering the vaccine. 
Pence said that the Trump administration has been in contact with several developers of a COVID-19 vaccine and has “five companies in stage three of a clinical trial … and we’re right now producing tens of millions of doses.” 
The Trump campaign has set out another promise to the American people, assuring them that a vaccine will be available before the year is over. 
In contrast to Vice President Pence’s remarks, Harris told viewers how “whatever the Vice President is claiming the administration has done, clearly hasn’t worked.” Harris cited the 210,000 deaths the coronavirus has taken, in addition to the fact the Trump administration knew the deadliness and potential of COVID-19. 
When asked why the administration act didn’t sooner, Pence said “the president wanted people to remain calm.”
Harris’ rebuttal to Pence was asking the American people to remember how calm they were upon the discovery of what the coronavirus and its ramifications meant for their lives. 
USA Today journalist Susan Page reminded candidates that the unemployed rate is currently 7.9%, and 11 million jobs that existed in the beginning of the year, have yet to return. In order to combat this, the Biden-Harris campaign has promised to raise taxes on those who make more than $400,000 a year, generating four trillion dollars, in potential government spending. According to many economists, this move can curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and overall weaken the regrowth of the economy in a post-coronavirus world. When asked to elaborate on the four trillion dollar tax raise, Harris said “Joe Biden thinks [the economy] is about investing in the people of our country.”
While maneuvering around the core question, Harris pledged that her and Biden’s campaign will cut student debt for those who come from a family earning less than $125,000 a year, by $10,000. Harris said the same people who fall in the aforementioned income bracket, will be able to attend public university for free. Discussing the future of our economy, Harris and Pence went back and forth over Biden’s promise to repeal the Trump administration’s tax cut. According to Pence, this tax cut gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax cut. Despite this, Harris reassured voters that Joe Biden will not raise taxes on those who make under $400,000 a year. Harris also said that Biden will not end fracking. 
Both candidates frequently led viewers off-track from the initial question being asked. Many times, throughout the debate, the candidates back-tracked their thoughts and harped on previously discussed issues ad nauseum. 
While there were interruptions and false claims made during the debate, the public did not react as negatively to the vice presidential debate compared to the first presidential debate.
Post students wanted the debate to ask more specific questions to the candidates.
“I would have liked the moderator to ask more questions on each topic to ensure a more in depth response on each topic,” Allison Montefusco, a senior public relations major, said. 
This does raise questions on whether or not the structure of the debate should change. 
“I think each person should get a certain amount of uninterrupted time to talk, then the other, afterwards, they respond to what the other said once both candidates finish stating their points,” Justin Finn, a freshman business major said.
Many viewers find it frustrating that candidates only have two (usually interrupted) minutes to discuss their views and policies on the topic in question. These questions are almost always full of nuance and complex layers of understanding, and explaining your solution in two minutes is impossible. It almost seems as if the debate is purposely designed this way to limit a proper verbal dialogue. No changes to the debate style currently used are being made currently.

White house officials announced on October 2nd President Donald Trump contracted COVID-19. Following the announcement, Trump was transferred to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center by helicopter. 
It was confirmed that Trump was aboard a plane with his aide Hope Hicks, who had already tested positive.
After news of his diagnosis broke, Trump received support from members from both political parties. 
The democratic nominee for President, and former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted out in support.
“Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the President and his family”, he wrote. 
News of the diagnosis also received criticism due to Trump’s downplaying of the severity of the coronavirus and effectiveness of wearing masks. During the Presidential debate on Sept. 29th, Trump mocked candidate Biden for wearing masks, a practice recommended by Center for Disease Control officials. 
“I don’t wear masks like him,” Trump said. “Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from it, and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve seen.”
Junior public relations major Allison Montefusco wasn’t surprised when she saw the news. 
“When I first heard he had COVID I really wasn’t surprised,” she said. “ He didn’t follow the doctors orders to protect himself or others around him, so in a way it was bound to happen at some point.” 
Senior arts management major Brianna Saverino agreed with Montefusco. 
“I’m not one of those people that was like “finally!” but honestly karma works in mysterious ways and Trump contracting COVID is really just a smidge of his own medicine that he unleashed on America,” Saverino said. 
Trump has since left the hospital and begun making public appearances again with election pressures ramping up. He’s claimed an asymptomatic response to the virus and at this point in time, doctors expect Trump to fully recover; although his last positive test remains unknown to the public.

A new club is forming on campus and they are looking for members. A group of students have started the Psychology club, and anyone, even professors, are encouraged to join.
Shayla Harris, a senior psychology major, has been engaged in the club from the beginning and plans to run for club president. She has been involved in planning, as well as working with Promise to ensure they would be a recognized club schoolwide.  
“We have not had any meetings yet, but we just got back our poll of good meeting times, and after we review it together we will create a schedule,” Harris said.
Harris and her peers are very excited to begin this new club, which will discuss many aspects of psychology.
“The club will discuss anything related to psychology. So far, we have ideas about possibly doing Zoom movie nights, possibly some research that may interest students, discussing research we’ve done, or interesting things we’ve learned about, and meeting to help each other with psychology or statistics homework,” Harris said.
In addition to Harris’ excitement, her peers Ganga Pradeep, a junior psychology major, and Nicole Guzman, a senior psychology major, share this feeling with her as well.
“Psychology benefits everyone from different perspectives. We all have different backgrounds and different ideas because of them, so it would make for wonderful conversation, if nothing else,” Pradeep said. “We are all human and we will work with other people in any setting, at work, when out shopping, etcetera. All people are fascinating, and psychology is applicable to everyone in their respective fields and everyday life.” 
Guzman agrees that anyone should join the club, because psychology is relevant in anyone’s everyday life.
“I would suggest anybody join the club, not just students,” she said. “Other professors can have their inputs in as well and faculty members can feel more than welcome to come by to see what’s in store for them.” 
If any students or faculty are interested in joining, they can fill out the interest form, in which they can provide their email and best method for contacting them. https://forms.gle/MShWxHeZG7EoMdLP6

At 7:30 PM on Friday, Oct. 9, over 40 Post students were setting up music stands, assembling instruments, and clipping headlamps over baseball caps in an empty parking lot. The members of the marching band hadn’t been able to make music together for over six months, but on Oct. 9, under the dim lighting of street lamps and car headlights, the night came alive with the sound of the group’s first rehearsal this semester.
“It means a lot to me to be back in a rehearsing group of band members,” Sarah Gordon-Macey, a freshman musical theatre major and flutist with the Marching Band, said. Macey’s sentiments were echoed by the rest of the band, as the group was teeming with the excitement of being able to play together again.
“Marching Band for me means being able to return to another creative outlet in making music and having fun with the people I got to get closer with last year,” Hannah Winston, a sophomore musical theatre major and drum major with the Marching Band, said. 
For returning members like Winston, they’ve been looking forward to being back with their bandmates for months now. Like most school activities, Marching Band was shut down in March with the closure of campus. Still, the group has made strong efforts to maintain their sense of ensemble in spite of the pandemic.
“Over quarantine, we would continue communicating in our own group chat and find free days to zoom all together and catch up,” Winston said. “We’ve also been keeping up with posting content on our social media pages.”
Even though classes have resumed, Marching Band has faced unique challenges in navigating how they can safely rehearse during a pandemic.  
“It’s been challenging to find the right space and time, and to be able to make music safely,” Winston said. In order to ensure safety, Marching Band rehearsed outside and spaced 12 feet apart from one another, which added another layer of difficulty to the group’s ability to play together. 
“As instrumentalists, it’s a lot easier to play when we are closer to our other bandmates, just so that we can hear them,” Macey said. In order to remedy this, the drum majors used a speaker system, and whistles to communicate with the group while they’re spaced far apart. This has allowed the group to successfully play together in spite of social distancing. 
With rehearsals successfully underway again, the group has also enjoyed the return of their supportive, fun-loving dynamic. “As soon as I joined the band, I could definitely tell that they are a very close-knit group which I’m looking forward to being a part of,” Macey said. As for returning members, they’re just as excited to be back and making music together. 
“I’m happy to be making music again with the family we created last year as well as welcoming new members into the family,” Winston said.
