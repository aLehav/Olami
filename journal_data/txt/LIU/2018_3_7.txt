With winter coming to a close and the weather getting warmer, potholes seem to be everywhere, including on campus roads. Heading towards the south of campus, next to the football field, a large pothole on Campus Drive is leading drivers to drive on the opposite lane and into oncoming traffic to avoid it.
Students have noticed the potholes on campus. “They are really bad and annoying to try and avoid,” Lisa Jenkins, a junior broadcasting major, said. “Potholes are known to damage your car and we spend a lot of money on repairs, tires get blown out from the huge impact of the pothole and can ruin your transmission,” she said.
According to Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, “potholes form due to snow or rain falling on the road, and rapid freezing and unfreezing overnight. Over time the ground will crumble and cause holes in the pavement.”
The pothole on Campus Drive was created by a water main, or underground pipe, break and will be “repaired once the weather gets warmer,” Fergus said. With the weather taking an unpredictable turn later in the week, he is unsure when the reparations will take place.
“The water company is responsible for fixing the pothole after repairs,” Fergus said. The school is planning to do a temporary fi
x of the road, although an exact date has not yet been chosen. “It does depend on the weather for the repair to take place,” he said. Fergus recommends that students call facilities services if they notice any other problems on campus.

Tucked away on the second floor in the south wing of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is a vast array of historical, educational, and artistic collections. The Archives and Special Collections department, located in LB 345 and 346, is home to more than 30 rare book collections and 75 archival collections. Collection formats include illuminated manuscript facsimiles, rare books, rare manuscripts, archives, original correspondence, original movie posters, journals, periodicals, original photographs, broadsides, maps, original watercolors, drawings, theatre programs and multimedia.
“In the library, I think special collections is the department with the most interest,” Paul Kim, adjunct professor of music history and piano, said. “A resource like special collections – it’s such a treasure for students.”
Kim teaches several music history classes and utilizes the collections to accompany his lesson plans. On Thursday, March 1, his “Music and Western Civilization” class, which covers 20th and 21st century music history, studied over 20 different movie posters from the 6,000 in the archives.
“We tie in the study of movies and visual aspects of the posters with the music and general culture,” Kim said. “The students study music of that period in history, but then they get to see visually the representation of the artworks. That kind of education just jumps out of the pages into the students’ imagination.”
Classes are held in the special collections department regularly, according to Jarron Jewell, acting director and senior library assistant in the department. Last month, she held an education class with the head of the gifted class. “There is serious research and some very beautiful materials [in the department],” she said.
Some of the collections include the pre-eminent American Juvenile Collection, the Archives of LIU and LIU Post, the Original Movie Poster Research Collection, the Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection and Cedar Swamp Historical Society Collection (Long Island), the Eugene and Carlotta O’Neill Personal Library, and the Winthrop Palmer Collec- tion: French & Irish Literature.
There are 12,000 first edition children’s books in fiction, folklore, fairytale and poetry in the American Juvenile collection. “All donations – it took 40 years to get those donations and we’ve had quite a few exhibitions on them in the past,” Jewell said.
How can students use the collection? “Well, say I want to study the changing role of women between 1910 and 1950 – really big changes sociologically, historically and psychologically – from a standpoint of art, and so forth,” Jewell said, demonstrating the benefits of the collection. “There are North American imprints, and we also have archives which are letters, drawings, and so forth, that go with this collection that are priceless,” she said.
The staff of the archives and special collections department is in the process of digitizing and cataloging the collection for the university’s Digital Commons webpage. The Digital Commons is a platform students can use to display their work. “Students could write a paper, and with
a professor to sponsor them, could publish the work in the digital commons and put that on a resume,” Jewell said.
Access to the materials in the archives and special collections by faculty, students, and guest scholars is encouraged, but comes with necessary restrictions, according to the website. These items can only be used in the “Rare Book Room” under departmental regulations. Those interested can call 516-299-2880 or email Jarron.Jewell@liu.edu to set up an appointment.

Post & Beyond, the annual exhibition of students’ independent academic research, service and experiential learning, and internships, will be held on April 26 from 12:30 to 2 p.m. in the Tilles Atrium.
The symposium features work by graduate, undergraduate, and sometimes high school students across the University and in the community. The event highlights a wide range of original research and community work and celebrates the hands-on learning experiences of students going out, facing the world and trying to make sense of it through teamwork with faculty mentors.
The program is sponsored by the Office of Academic Affairs and organized by the Dean’s Office of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and LIU Promise. “The point of the symposium is to present student research and also other student experiences that lie outside the traditional academic setting,” Glynis Pereyra, associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said.
Student applications to present their work are reviewed by a committee of faculty from LIU Post. The faculty gives feedback on the submitted applications, and the students can make modifications before submitting their final projects. Between 90 and 100 percent of the applications are accepted. All students working with an LIU Post mentor are welcome to submit an application to participate. Online forms are due by March 20. After students are accepted, they are to attend a workshop where they will learn to make a poster and then LIU Post Information Technology department prints the poster.
“It’s great experience to see how to do a poster presentation because it is a common thing in the professional world,” Pereyra said. Senior Kristen Olsen, an early childhood education major, is thinking about entering a poster this year about her experience as a student teacher. “I think putting together a presentation would be great experience for me in the real classroom setting where I will have to put together presentations in the classroom, as well as presenting my work,” Olsen said.
So far only three students have submitted their work for the 2018 symposium. With 44 submissions last year, the symposium committee is hoping to increase that number this year. One thing that attracts more students to attend is that the posters are not judged. Post & Beyond is just a space for them to display and present work/experiences.

It has been three weeks since the school shooting that resulted in 17 people killed, in Parkland, Fla. In those three weeks, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have done a lot to show that they want change, more than other shooting survivors have done previously. Students and faculty at Post are responding to these students’ activism, and debating on how likely they are to succeed.
The Parkland shooting marks the 18th in 2018 alone. In the aftermath, the survivors are speaking out. They have thrust the debate on gun control into the national spotlight and are keeping it there.
“I think the courage being shown by the Parkland students is honorable, they are truly making America proud. I do hope they are receiving guidance, as the current political reality in this area is increasingly disappointing,” Adam Hornbuckle, a senior political science major, said.
Many students across the campus are supportive of the Parkland survivors. “I think it is such a bold move. Considering they are only high school students that is to me, something that deserves so much respect,” Michelle Chan, a freshman broadcasting major, said.
The students of Parkland have given many speeches and statements to the press, rallied for support for gun reform, and also visited the Florida Capitol in Tallahassee to advocate for gun reform. They also forced a town hall hosted by CNN where the students and their family members got to ask Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the National Riffle Association (NRA) about their plans for gun reform.
Students also have further plans to continue the fight for change, including several walkouts with help from other major social justice platforms. Organizers from the Women’s March planned a school walk-out for March 14, at 10 a.m., and will last 17 minutes to represent the 17 lives lost as a result of the shooting. March 24 will be the “March For Our Lives” to Washington D.C. to advocate for change, planned by the students of Stoneman Douglas. On April 20, there is another high school walkout planned by the Network for Public Education; this date as it is the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting.
“Public demonstrations are necessary to push through divisive legislation like gun control. Every demonstrator is a voter. Personally, I have long supported the Brady Campaign, which acts to prevent gun violence,” Hornbuckle said about the planned marches.
Chan is considering to participate in the walkouts. “It is very much a big step to take, even though that is really a great way to convey the message,” she said.
Whether or not this will amount to actual legislative change is another discussion. “I believe what they are doing is appropriate, there are after all 10 million AR-15’s owned or in circulation,” Dr. Michael Soupios, professor of political science, said. These plans are widely supported in a recent poll by POLITICO, with support for stricter gun laws among registered voters at 68 percent and 25 percent opposed.
When asked what was holding up the passage of these laws, Soupios said, “There is too much money. The NRA invests money in the campaigns of candidates and expects a favor in return, so nothing gets done. There is a difference between a public servant and a professional politician and right now we have too many professional politicians.”
The large volume of money involved in the campaigns is the main reason there is no legislative action. “Campaign finance reform is crucial to stopping the money, Citizens United vs. FEC (2010) was a mistake,” Soupios said. This case decided that corporations and individuals donating unlimited amounts of money, are protected by the first amendment.
Though stricter gun laws have been proposed, there is another proposal from President Donald Trump: arm teachers.
“I think that is crazy. As if we don’t already have enough failing school districts. That certainly won’t help. Also, that seems to convey the wrong message,” Chan said.
“Arming teachers is not a solution, it’s a joke,” Hornbuckle said. Though not everyone agrees with Chan and Hornbuckle. Soupios argues that certain teachers can be armed, with an exception. “Teachers or staff with military experience who are adept and trained in rearms, I’m okay with having guns, but not training teachers to do this. We don’t want to make elementary schools the OK corral,” he said.
The 2018 congressional midterm elections are approaching, and the students and their efforts may play a role in who gets seated into Congress. “I think it will be a major focus of the 2018 midterm elections, it is unacceptable that there is so much money and not proper background checking for gun owners,” Soupios said.
Advocating for something is not an easy task to undertake and is certainly not a short process. The students of Parkland show passion for conveying change and have garnered a great deal of support for their cause. As the 2018 midterm elections approach, we will see just how successful the students are in making the gun control debate an important topic in America.

Dr. Wendy Ryden, a professor in the English department, teaches writing courses such as Creative Non-fiction and Writing and Healing. Ryden is also the coordinator of the WAC (writing across the curriculum) program, and she loves working with literature as well. Ryden teaches different literature courses, including Introduction to Literature and World Literature. This semester, she is teaching Writing and Healing and a graduate class, Mythology.
With a passion for Kate Chopin, Willa Cather, and Sara Orne Jewett, Ryden has done work on Gothic literature and its importance in the American canon.
She co-edited a volume that came out last year,“Haunting-Realities: Naturalist Gothic and American Realism,” based on the idea that we don’t intuitively associate Gothic literature with Realism and naturalism; literature that focused on everyday reality rather than the fantastic or romantic.
“My own essay in the book is about a light-skinned African American author, Charles Chesnutt, who wrote a lot about how skin color arbitrarily and with very negative consequences organized American social life,” Ryden added.
Ryden is working on a new book with Monika Elbert from Montclair University, who co-edited “Haunting Realities” with her. This new book also focuses on the Gothic in literature “but with regard to regionalist literature and how authors use the Gothic to resist and become complicit in the narrative of American exceptionalism that was shaping the national identity,” she said.
Ryden has done interdisciplinary work with Professor Shaireen Rasheed of the department of Curriculum and Instruction, to teach students about the idea of resistance.
“Dr. Rasheed and I decided to pair our courses, EDI 14, Social, Philosophical, and Historical Foundations of Education and ENG7, World Literature, Antiquity through Renaissance, in a learning community organized around the ideas of transgression and resistance; so many stories in early literature involve characters breaking prohibitions and defying authority,” Ryden said.
“We looked at Antigone in Sophocle’s drama, who is often thought of as the first civil disobedient, to talk about people breaking laws or rules today from principled stances. In some ways, it was surprising to see student reactions where they seemed to consider Antigone more of a libertarian than a civil disobedient,” she said about the interdisciplinary course.
“The experience affected my own views on the subject. In today’s world, I am finding myself hoping the rule of law will prevail to protect us against deregulation and corruption. In the course, we began to ask the question: When is it a good thing to defy authority and when isn’t it?”
Ryden’s interests in Gothic literature developed in a roundabout way. In the course of the work she does with writing and rhetoric, she became interested in the way we use language to construct race, especially whiteness and its created privilege. She also reveals the work she does with her students. “This interest led me to look at Charles Chessnutt, mentioned earlier, whose fiction deals with very much with that subject. From there, I started looking at the Gothic dimensions of his writing,” she said. “He used the Gothic to show the horrors of American racism in the late nineteenth century.”
