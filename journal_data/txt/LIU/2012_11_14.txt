After 13 months of campaigning, rallying, and debating, Barack Obama will begin his second term in the White House. Although he beat former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in a landslide in electoral votes, he was not as popular amongst all Americans.
According to A CNN article published this month, “Obama takes key battlegrounds to win re-election” by Tom Cohen, Obama won all battleground states as well as Romney’s birthplace of Michigan and his governing state of Massachusetts, with 332 electoral votes. Romney won 206 electoral votes.  Obama needed only 270 electoral votes to win the election. But, Obama did not win the popular vote with such a wide margin. According to the BBC U.S. 2012 results, 50.5 percent of the country voted for Obama while 47.9 voted for Romney, leaving the nation divided.
In Chicago, Obama supporters roared and cheered once Obama’s victory was announced, while television networks showed coverage of Romney supporters somber and crying. Republicans still had hope since Fox News Analyst Karl Rove had reported that Romney might still have a chance in winning Ohio. Shortly after Obama won the battleground state. After Romney’s concession speech, one Romney supporter stated that the fact that Romney lost was “a tough pill to swallow.”
A new Romney appeared on stage, less aggressive and more somber than we’ve seen him in the past months. An hour after news networks projected Barack Obama as victor, in Boston, Romney, whose eyes appeared to be red and watery, conceded, “I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation. The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. I believe in America, I believe in the people of America.”
In Barack Obama’s acceptance speech, he stated, “Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs – not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together…..We’ve got more work to do.”
Changes promised for students under Obama’s Presidency:
Student debt has reached $1 trillion for the fist time in history. Students will begin to see Obama’s Pay as You Earn program reiterated on certain websites where students can apply for loans. The Pay as You Earn program, which will be in effect in 2013-2014, caps monthly federal student loan repayment at 10 percent of one’s monthly income. This is so students have more money to spend and invest in the economy, according to Barackobama.com. Also, under this program, a student can choose the college they want to attend based on their career goals and not solely on the price of tuition. In addition, if one pays their federal loans on time and at least at 10 percent of your monthly income as a teacher, service person, or doctor, one will be forgiven of federal loans after 10 years. For all other professions, if loans are paid responsibly, one will be forgiven in 20 years.
The Know Before You Owe program is a form that includes loan interest rates while differentiating between grants and scholarships, showing students exactly what they will be paying, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the U.S. Department of Education. The form would also be introduced as a universal Financial Aid document that all colleges would be urged to adopt by the 2013-14 school year. This would allow students to see what they are being offered and how much they could possibly pay, before they accept the offer to attend that school. President Obama also insured that veterans and service members would be able to get a college education and find work when they return from service by implementing and expanded the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, according to BarackObama.com.
He also proposes to make higher education institutions more affordable, even though a written bill has yet to be written out and plans lack details, according to “With Obama’s Win, Colleges Anticipate 4 More Years of Reform,” by Michael Stratford in Chronicle.com this month. According to WhiteHouse.gov, the official website of the White House, Obama stated, “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a postsecondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs.”
The President will be inaugurated for his second term on January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.

Professor Scott Carlin, in addition to teaching environmental science here at LIU Post, is very involved in the campus Recycling Program. Here’s what he had to say about how the program is progressing, what’s new, and where it’s heading.
TP: How did the recycling program here at LIU/Post begin?
SC: I used to teach at LIU’s Southampton College campus. They had an environmental sustainability program there, and when that campus closed, some of those students came to LIU Post and adopted aspects of Southampton’s program to initiate our Post recycling program.
TP: Can you give us an update on the recycling program? What’s working? What’s not?
SC: It’s really starting to pick up momentum. For instance, we started our recycling program in the two dorm buildings. Now, all dorm buildings are participating. The recycling program is the strongest in our dorms.
TP: Who is involved in carrying out the recycling program in the dorm buildings?
SC: In order to make the recycling feasible, all containers have to be cleaned before the carting company picks them up for recycling. We have expanded the number of work-study students who are paid to manage our recycling program. That includes washing the recyclable plastics by hand and moving them to designated central areas outside the dorms for pick up by the Facilities Service staff. So, not only have we expanded student involvement through work-study programs, but the number of recyclables has increased, as well, since we started our recycling program.
TP: Just outside of Starbucks in Hillwood Commons, there’s a new recyclable Dasani container. Has there been any thought given to soliciting corporate sponsorship on a campus-wide basis for LIU Post’s recycling program?
SC: Yes. As a matter of fact, it was an LIU Post student, Billy Achnitz, who wrote a grant to Coca-Cola and won the grant, resulting in its corporate sponsorship. This Dasani container is just the first one of many that will be placed throughout campus buildings in the coming weeks.
Billy’s initiative is really the back-story here; that is, a single individual student really can make a change to his/her college campus. Billy is now pursuing a master’s degree in environmental sustainability.
TP: Speaking of sustainability, besides the recycling program, where else on campus have there been improvements to move forward?
SC: Our campus Library, as well as the dorm buildings have been upgraded to energy-efficient fluorescent lighting.
TP: Are there any programs in place to involve faculty and administration in participating in the recycling program?
SC: We will be instituting a pilot program for all offices to go green. This is in sync with the future goals of the LIU Post Sustainability Committee to foster awareness and implement practices to include staff, administration and faculty. Basically, the pilot program will encourage staff members to take a pledge to commit. For instance, our current thinking is that part of the pledge will include agreeing to use double-sided printing, to recycle plastic waste, and to turn off lights. Once more than 50% of that staff takes the pledge, they will be considered a green office. As incentives to take the pledge, we’ll use signage, signifying that office as a green office.
TP: What clubs, programs are available to students to get involved?
SC: LIU Post joined AASHE (American Assoc. for Sustainable Higher Education) last year. Students and faculty alike can become members. All one needs to join is a valid LIU e-mail address. Their website is http://www.AASHE.org. Membership will keep members updated as to what’s going on other campuses concerning efforts for becoming environmentally sustainable campuses. It’s a great way to network with other campuses. LIU Post is sending student representatives to a national conference in LA this fall.
TP. Are there any efforts or progress being made into incorporating environmental issues across the curriculum at LIU Post?
SC: Sustainable literacy has been gaining momentum as a statewide conversation. Faculty from a number of different NYS colleges and universities are starting to talk about shared goals for statewide education. At LIU Post, we are creating a new faculty committee under the Faculty Council that will begin talking about sustainable learning goals here at LIU Post. We already have a new Masters in Environmental Sustainability and we have an Honors Green Track for undergraduates. So faculty can begin to look at other opportunities for improving education on campus. The specific charge of this new committee will be to come up with recommendations for the Faculty Council to review.
TP: Where can students keep up with the progress of these issues?
SC: Our public relations staff has developed a new website for a variety of campus projects – http://www.liu.edu/post/green. For example, students can download from that website our April 2012 Sustainable Post Vision report, which is a draft vision for LIU Post. Students can contact me to participate in the campus committee that created that report and makes a variety of recommendations to the campus each year.

	20 LIU Post students cheered on the Knicks as they beat the Dallas Mavericks 104 – 94 in Madison Square Garden on Friday November 9. The trip was planned and hosted by the Scandinavian Vikings Club and advisor Martin Guss. 
	The New York Knicks remain undefeated so far this season, led by Carmelo Anthony who had 31 points and J.R. Smith with 22 points. This is the best start the Knicks have had since the 1993-1994 season. This was also the first meeting of former Mavs player, Jason Kidd, since his trade to NY.
	“We all had a great time seeing the Knicks play. In fact we were so excited and into the game that it felt like it was over way too soon,” said  Joella Skoogh, a junior Public Relations major and vice president of the club. She handed out tickets – printed with a price tag of $81, but sold to the students for only $15 each, including transportation. A once-in-a-lifetime deal one might say. “We had 20 tickets for the game, and they went very quickly,” said Skoogh. The tickets were sold during one of their club meetings, held every other Thursday at 1 p.m in Hillwood Commons Room 118. “I was lucky to get a ticket, I heard about it from a friend, and first I thought the offer was too good to be true,” said junior Nutrition major Aurora Kronberg.
	Hurricane Sandy and snowstorm Athena could not stop the Vikings, with the LIRR operating on schedule, and tickets already booked. Posing for photos to document the trip, eating pizza and popcorn from a kiosk at the Garden, and wearing new blue and orange Knicks t-shirts with number 7, Melo’s number, on the back, the students cheered for the players, and were rewarded with a win. “Even though I don’t know too much about the team or the sport, it was great to feel the vibe from an excited audience,” said Kronberg, after watching her very first Knicks game. Sophomore Film major Christine Stronegger agreed saying, “It was so much fun!”
	The trip was funded by the Vikings club budget as well as student payments. “We decided at one of our meetings that we wanted to go to a sports game, and after a vote we agreed on the Knicks,” said Skoogh. Led by president Elina Viitasaari, the Viking Club aims to educate people about Scandinavia, the cultures and traditions, and also do fun things together. “And it’s not only for Scandinavians,” Skoogh emphasized. 
	Previously this year they visited the Scandinavia House in Manhattan, eating a three course dinner, followed by a scandinavian movie, and according to Skoogh they are planning to repeat the success a second time this year. Also, coming up is a “Vikings Night”, with details yet to be settled.

There has been a lot of hype over Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln.” The film pairs Spielberg with one of the most celebrated actors alive, Daniel Day-Lewis, and brings to light the life and struggle of our 16th president during the turbulent passing of the 13th amendment. “Lincoln” comes at a critical time for Americans, with the presidential election still fresh, and the Academy Awards race picking up steam. The Pioneer attended a live Q&A session and pre-screening with Spielberg and Day-Lewis at the AMC Loews Theater in Lincoln Square, New York City on October 10. Mark Harris of Entertainment Weekly led the discussion, which included questions from the audience and Twitter. 
“Lincoln” is based on the book “Team of Rivals” by Doris Kearns Goodwin and takes place heavily within the charged meetings where the passing of the 13th amendment was discussed. “I began to read Doris’ book, which was probably the springboard for all of us, and I essentially ran out of excuses,” said Day-Lewis, who admitted to fleeing from the role at first. “I can’t account for why, at the moment, it appeared inevitable to me, but I think it has in common in all the moments in my life when I have taken on any piece of work. I have to feel there really isn’t a choice. In this case, in that moment, I felt I had no choice but to try and understand this thing.” 
Day-Lewis gives an expectedly commanding performance as the President, forging a unique voice for the role. The actor, now in his fifties, will no doubt receive an Oscar nomination for the role, with supporting actor Tommy Lee Jones also up for the ballot. Jones gives a nice edge as Thaddeus Stevens that complements the rest of the cast. Spielberg described how early on in making the film he received an audio tape from Day-Lewis, who read a bit of an actual Lincoln speech. “The voice really never changed,” said Spielberg of the treble-heavy voice. “FDR had a voice in that register. It was probably a little lower than Lincoln’s voice but in that register. You can imagine how that voice can carry.”
“Lincoln” does tend to rely on the basic quirks of Spielbergian filmmaking. His style has become a trademark featuring the ever-nostalgic-and-emotional musical aid of composer John Williams and employing a similarly big cinematic feel that makes the film a drastically different experience. Last year’s “War Horse” had a similar vibe, giving priority to character and dialogue over action packed scenes like in “Saving Private Ryan” or “Indiana Jones.”
One Twitter question addressed the large amount of college students and teachers in attendance, to which Spielberg seemed overjoyed. “Students and teachers are the first wave of the people who I am interested in hearing from about history,” said the director, continuing that “a movie can only be an adjunct, or a supplement to books, to different points of view, to scholars, and historians, and your own teachers.”
The director made it clear that this is not the only interpretation of the life of Abraham Lincoln. “There are so many stories I encourage everybody to learn and read about Lincoln. Let this be a supplement to your learning. Do not let this be your only learning about Abraham Lincoln and that period during the civil war.” 
We now live in an age where 200 million dollar movies are common, but with independent writers and directors seeping into the Oscar race, we might be seeing an academy that prefers a more-with-less ethic. Historically, low-budget films have snagged the top prize, like last year’s “The Artist” among top contenders like “The Descendents,” both of which had budgets under 20 million according to Box Office Mojo. Furthermore, since 2007’s “No Country For Old Men,” the academy has chosen films with budgets under 25 million dollars. Spielberg’s own winner was “Schindler’s List” in 1993, which worked on 22 million. “Lincoln” almost triples that number, with a reported budget of over 50 million. Will the more-with-less-ethic have any effect on the race this year? 
While a big budget has not made the definitive successful movie (just look at flops like “Battleship”), good acting and writing has. Tony Kushner has produced a hearty script for “Lincoln” full of the chunky monologues and tear jerking moments. “There were so many amazing things I never knew about Lincoln or his office or his rivals,” said Spielberg of the president. 
It remains to be seen where “Lincoln” will stand in the coming months. Will it be a historic victory for Spielberg or beaten out by this year’s competition? “Lincoln” hit select theaters November 9 and will play everywhere November 16. To watch the entire Q&A session, visit movies.yahoo.com/lincoln-live. Verdict: 8.5/10

The men’s soccer team had its season come to an end on Sunday, November 11, after the team lost 1-0 to the University of Massachusetts-Lowell River Hawks in the second round of the NCAA East Regionals. The loss ended an impressive season that saw the Pioneers go 18-2 and rank number one in the country in Division II soccer at one point. 
It was a close battle on Sunday, with both teams creating scoring opportunities throughout the game. Pioneers junior goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen had an excellent game, making nine saves and keeping his team in the game. His counterpart, Chris Maleri, was equally as stellar, making four saves in the River Hawks win. 
The two teams traded scoring chances throughout the game. In the 14th minute, UMass Lowell’s Bruno Bonicontro sailed a shot over the goal. Prior to that, Pioneers freshman midfielder Per Forgaard had a good look, but was stone-walled by Maleri. 
The game remained scoreless going into the second half and the Pioneers and River Hawks continued to trade chances. However, the River Hawks broke the scoreless tie in the 89th minute. UMass Lowell was awarded a corner kick, allowing Bonicontro to place a perfect kick right to teammate Juan Moreira who was able to head the ball past Jorgensen to give the River Hawks a 1-0 lead.
The Pioneers did not find an answer to that goal and saw the season come to an end with the loss. The Pioneers were outshot in the matchup 25-14.
“We are all very disappointed that the season came to an end this weekend,” said junior captain Eirik Bjorno. “We really hoped to extend the season for at least a week, and host the quarterfinals at home on Saturday. That was our goal, but we failed at the finish line. We are all aware that it is hard to win a National Championship, and statistics show that you have to be in the top of the region for more than one season to take the step into the final four, but we really hoped to do it this year.” 
Though the season came to an end, there is plenty for the Pioneers to be proud of. The Pioneers were crowned East Coast Conference champs a week prior, after a 3-2 victory over New York Institute of Technology in the championship game.  Several players also received individual awards for their performance this season. Junior forward Cemil Turan was named ECC Offensive Player of the Year, Jorgensen was named Goalkeeper of the Year, and Forgaard was named Rookie of the Year. In addition, Jorgensen and sophomore forward Eivind Austboe both were named to the Capital One Academic All-District Men’s Soccer Team.

	The LIU Post women’s and men’s basketball teams seasons have officially begun, but in different fashions. The women battled and edged out a one point victory in its opening game against Adelphi University while the men dropped each of the first two games in the Southern New Hampshire Tournament.
On Saturday, November 10, the Lady Pioneers (1-0) defeated the Adelphi University Panthers on the road by a score of 82-81. LIU Post was down 43-33 at the half, but the Lady Pioneers clawed their way back for a win in the first game of the year. The Lady Pioneers had all five starters reach double figures in scoring, led by senior guard Ashley Caggiano and sophomore guard Chelsea Williams who each had 21 points. Caggiano was 9-10 from the floor and missed only one of her four attempts from beyond the arc. 
In the win, senior forward Nicolette Marciniak and senior center Samantha Kopp each registered double-doubles. Marciniak scored 14 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, while Kopp added 10 points and hauled in 13 rebounds. Junior guard Alexis Peters had a solid all-around game as she dropped 14 points, secured five rebounds, and dished out five assists. 
	Last season, the Lady Pioneers finished with a 21-10 record and went 11-5 within the East Coast Conference. However, the season ended on a bitter note as the team lost a heartbreaker to Southern Connecticut State University in the first round of the NCAA Division II East Regional by a final score of 58-57. 
	The Lady Pioneers next game is Saturday, November 24, in the Dowling Holiday Tournament against Felician College at 12 p.m. 
	Unfortunately for the men’s basketball team, it has not gotten off to the same quick start that the women’s team has. The Pioneers have begun the season 0-2 after dropping each of the two games in the Southern New Hampshire Tournament. 
In the first game, the Pioneers fell 81-70 to the Franklin Pierce University Ravens. In the loss, junior forward Vaughn Allen and sophomore forward Tyuan Williams each had double-doubles. Allen had 19 points and 10 rebounds on 7-10 shooting, and Williams had 14 points and 16 rebounds. Williams absolutely destroyed everyone on the offensive glass, as 11 of his 16 rebounds were offensive. 
Last year, the Pioneers were an up-tempo, high-powered offense that ran up and down the floor at a furious pace. With a quick system like this, the team is expected to make outside shoots from beyond the arc. Last season the Pioneers were 36 percent from three point range and took advantage when the defense allowed them to take an open three pointer. In the opening game, the Pioneers were 2-11 (18 percent) when taking three pointers. The only two threes made were by freshman guard Dillon Burns. 
The following day, the Pioneers were narrowly defeated by the Southern New Hampshire University Penmen 60-57. Allen led all scorers with 21 points. Senior guard Tobin Carberry accounted for 11 points but struggled as he shot 2-11 from the floor. The Pioneers once again abandoned the three-ball as the team shot 1-9 (11 percent) from beyond the arc. A bright spot for the Pioneers was sophomore forward Charles McCann off the bench scoring eight points, grabbing five rebounds, and blocking four shots in 21 minutes of action. 
Last season, the Pioneers finished with a 23-6 record and were 15-1 within the East Coast Conference. The Pioneers ended up winning the ECC Championship, but lost in the first round of the NCAA Division II East Regional to Adelphi University 66-65. 
The Pioneers have its home opener on Saturday, November 17, at 3 p.m. against Post University (1-1). Both LIU Post women’s and men’s teams begin ECC games on Saturday, December 1, against Bridgeport University.

Only nine days after Dowling College beat the Pioneers in the ECC Semifinals, Dowling finished the Pioneers season with a 2-0 win the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday, November 11.
The Pioneers were considered underdogs in the National Championship this year as the team went into the tournament ranked number six by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. 
The Pioneers earned the number one spot in the East region and got a bye for the first round in the NCAA tournament. Dowling, on the other hand, beat Southern New Hampshire on penalties to claim the right to meet the Pioneers in the second round contest hosted by Southern New Hampshire University in Massachusetts.
Dowling began the game strongest as it took a couple of shots early on, but the team had to wait until the 23rd minute before it got on the board. A free kick was drifted towards the far post, and senior goalkeeper Nicole Fierro pulled out a good save to keep the ball out of the net, but Alexis Parrotta was there to put in the rebound to give Dowling the 1-0 lead going into halftime.
After the break, Dowling continued to play strong defense and deny the Pioneers any space to create chances. After 73 minutes, Dowling doubled its lead when Lindsey Thompson scored with less than 20 minutes left in regulation.
The Pioneers failed to find the equalizer and ended up losing to Dowling for the second time in nine days. 
Sophmore midfielder Lina Harle was devastated after the loss as the season ended early. “It was a tough loss. We really hoped to keep playing for at least another week,” Harle said. She also pointed out the fact that Dowling ended both playoffs this season made it even worse. “Dowling is one of the school’s biggest rivals, so to see them ruin our dreams, twice, is hard to accept.”
The Pioneers were set up as the hosting institution after earning the number one seed in the region, but due to Hurricane Sandy this week’s games were moved out of the state because of lack of hotels and gas on Long Island. Harle does not use this as an excuse. “Of course we would like to play the game at home, but it was a natural disaster, so there is nothing we could have done about it. Dowling was in the same situation, so it did not play a direct role in the outcome of the game.”
The Pioneers had a good season overall as they finished with a 15-3-2 record.

	In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, sports were the last thing people were concerned or worried about. Countless lives have dramatically changed due to the damage to their houses and lack of power and gas. Some even lost their lives because of the storm. However, during Hurricane Sandy, sports were definitely affected. 
	The Brooklyn Nets were scheduled to open their brand new arena, the Barclays Center, on Thursday, November 1 against the New York Knicks, but that game was postponed to Monday, November 26. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg thought that the mass transit system was a mess, that the game would cause a problem with traffic, and that there was no reason for a game to be played just days after the devastation that took place. Jay-Z’s Nets were supposed to make the headlines to start the 2012 NBA season first because of the new-look team, but instead, it was the Knicks who grabbed the spotlight to start off the campaign. The Knicks opened up their season against the defending champions, the Miami Heat, on Friday, November 2 at Madison Square Garden, despite the hurricane. 
	Many people wondered if this game should even be played because of all the damage that took place in New York. All-Star Dwyane Wade shared his thoughts on Twitter about whether the game should be played, with so much of New York still in shambles: 
	“We shouldn’t B hre 2 play a basketball game when theirs so many families obviously still R affected by #Sandy.”
	“I luv playing in the garden but cnt do nothing but think abt all the families that dont have power,food,water etc..ths is a tragic hit 4 ths gr8 city.”
	Wade went on to donate his game-check, over $200,000 before taxes, to Hurricane Relief efforts. Despite the hesitations about playing, the Knicks were stellar against LeBron James, Wade and the reigning champs. The Knicks beat the Heat 104-84 largely because of excellent ball movement throughout the entire game. Carmelo Anthony scored 30 points and secured 10 rebounds, and the Knicks as a team dished out 27 assists. 
	“Today was something to give New York a couple hours of some peace,” said Anthony. “We gave them [the fans] a good show out there tonight; that’s the least that we can do.” 
	Point guard Raymond Felton, in his second stint with the Knicks, was overjoyed with the Knicks’ victory against Miami. “I think this win meant a lot for us, for the city, fans, you know, just everybody in New York. This was a big win, so I’m happy we got it.” 
	The Nets began their delayed season on Saturday, November 3 against the Toronto Raptors. In front of their home crowd, the Nets played the first professional sports game in Brooklyn since 1957. The Nets defeated the Raptors 107-100, led by Brook Lopez’s 27 points and Deron Williams’ 19 points and nine assists. 
	In addition to basketball, a major sports event that was canceled was the New York City Marathon, scheduled for Sunday, November 4. Mayor Michael Bloomberg flip-flopped on whether the event should take place directly after Sandy had hit. He initially felt that the marathon could help bring the city closer together and could bring in money to the city (The marathon averages roughly $340 million in revenue to the city). However, after the Twitter universe nearly exploded in outrage over Bloomberg’s initial decision, Bloomberg changed his mind and canceled the marathon. Staten Island would have been the starting place of the marathon, but this was one of the hardest hit areas in New York. The safety of the runners and the outrage of the public were taken into consideration when the marathon was officially canceled. 
	Travel plans were also altered because of the hurricane. The Miami Heat changed their flight plans when they found out the game versus the Knicks would be played. On the gridiron, the Pittsburgh Steelers took a flight the day of the game when they faced the New York Giants on Sunday, November 4. In the game, the Steelers edged out the G-Men 24-20, sparked by two fourth quarter touchdowns. 
	All the athletes that participated this week in the New York area knew that sports were not the most important thing going on in the world. But it’s their job to entertain. It’s their job in times of crisis to take people’s minds off of their problems, even if only for a couple hours.  
	“There are so many bigger things going on around here that what we do is not as important as real life,” Steelers’ quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said after the game. ”My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone else who are going through so much…But maybe we were able to take their minds off their problems just a little.”
	In addition to professional sports, LIU Post’s athletic teams were impacted by the storm as well. The football team’s game against Kutztown University (5-4) was canceled and moved to Saturday, November 17. The Pioneers’ record is 3-5 and their next game is Saturday, November 10 against Gannon University (2-8). 
	The men’s soccer team (18-2) had to adjust their game schedules as well, but they had no problem as they defeated Mercy College by a score of 7-1 on Friday, November 2, and knocked off NYIT in a 3-2 win on Sunday, November 4 for the East Coast Conference Championship. They then moved onto the NCAA Division II East Regionals and faced the University of Massachusetts-Lowell on Sunday, November 11. However, in the game, the Pioneers lost 1-0 and their season came to a sudden end. 
The women’s soccer team was also impacted as their schedule changed because of the Hurricane. In the East Coast Conference Championships on Friday, November 2 they lost 2-1 to Dowling College. Later on November 11 they faced Dowling again, this time in the NCAA Division II East Regionals, and had the same fate as in the ECC Championships as the Pioneers fell 2-0. Home games for both LIU Post soccer teams had to be played at Dowling College. 
	Finally, the men’s basketball team postponed their exhibition matchup against Manhattan College that was originally slated for Thursday, November 1.
	Sandy had a huge impact on the lives of LIU Post students and faculty, and everyone in the New York area. Those involved in sports were no different.

 	Kevin Hart may only be 5’4” but he definitely makes up in jokes for what he lacks in height. On Saturday, November 10, he made history by selling out both New York City shows and also making Madison Square Garden history by being the fourth comedian to ever perform in the venue.
 	Hart and his opening acts, or as they refer to themselves, the “Plastic Cup Boyz”, consisted of Joey Wells, Will “Spank” Horton and Na’im, delivered hilarious jokes that made the audience laugh and cry at the same time. For two and a half hours there was never a moment of silence in the room when the performers were on stage.
	Hart first rose from the stage, out onto an elaborate stage filled with lights, fog, cameras, and fire. You would have thought you got tickets to a concert rather than a comedy show. He opened by asking the crowd, “Did y’all see my goddamn fire?!” The comedian explains that he was at a Jay-Z and Kanye concert and they had fire, so he had to get fire for his comedy tour and promised the audience that fire was going to be seen throughout the night.
 	As always, Hart tells stories of his life, family and friends, which make him more relatable and enjoyable for the audience. One of the first jokes he told was about the fact that his divorce was finally finalized from his crazy ex-wife. He says that the only reason why they got divorced was due to infidelity on his part and that he’s a chronic liar about any given situation.
 	By the end of the show, Hart had a heartfelt message for those who attended the show. He had tears in his eyes thanked the audience for helping him achieve a milestone by being one of the handful of comedians to perform at MSG. Hart tweeted: “Words can’t express the emotion that is running thru my body at this very moment…MY FANS ARE THE F—— BEST!!!! Thank you NEW YORK CITY.” 
 	“Let Me Explain” was recorded and is to be released in 2013.

	Known as the only bilingual city on the North American continent, Montreal is the cultural and economic capital of Quebec and the main entry point to the province. The second largest city in Canada, it is a city rich in culture and history and a well-deserved reputation as one of the liveliest cities in North America. Demographics show that Montreal residents come from 80 countries, forming an urban mosaic of vibrant ethnic communities and neighborhoods safe to walk in day or night. Visitors will detect a distinct British influence in parts of the city, inherent in the culture since the days when English merchants controlled the city’s trade. All in all, it’s easy to see why “cosmopolitan” is the adjective most used in describing Montreal.
Airlines: Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport is Montreal’s main airport. The airport is served by all major Canadian and U.S. airlines and is a major hub for Air Canada, Air Transat, and WestJet. There are multiple daily trans-Atlantic flights to and from London, Amsterdam, Paris, Geneva, Zurich, Athens, Doha, Frankfurt, Rome, Madrid, Lisbon, Munich, and Casablanca.
Hotel/Lodging: For the budget traveler, Montreal offers youth hostels with dorms or private rooms as well as budget bed and breakfasts. The densest collection of budget hotels are in the Latin Quarter, in the streets east of Berri-UQAM metro and the long distance bus station. Old Montreal has a couple of quality hostels, but you’ll pay more to be there. Mid-range options include Downtown chain hotels to “gîtes,” guest houses that range from a single room in an apartment to elegant historic homes with three to five rooms. Gîtes are usually found in the more residential neighborhoods like the Plateau. On the upper-end, four and five-star luxury and boutique hotels are mostly concentrated in Old Montreal and Downtown.
Attractions/Sightseeing: Montreal’s museums, historic sites, shopping districts, and nightclubs provide plenty of entertainment. For a taste of historic Montreal, spend a day exploring the 18th-century buildings of Vieux-Montréal, which now house small museums and souvenir shops. This city is also a great destination for families with attractions like the Montreal Biodôme and La Ronde Amusement Park. If you are visiting during the winter, escape the cold by heading down to the shopping malls and museums of the Underground City. Like the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Empire State Building in New York City, Mount Royal and in particular, the Mount Royal Cross, acts as a natural landmark and way to orient yourself in Montreal. Hike, bike, drive or take a bus to the top of Mont Royal and enjoy the great view and park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for his work on Central Park in NYC. Mount Royal Park includes a small, man-made lake, playground, lookouts, and walking paths. Access to the park without a car is free.
Cuisine: Montreal is a culinary mecca and has a huge variety of food options from diners and fast food to low-cost ethnic restaurants to haute cuisine. No visit is complete without at least one plate of poutine. This unique dish is a plate of French fries drowned in gravy and topped with chewy curds of white cheddar. There are variations on the theme adding chicken, beef, vegetables, or sausage and replacing the gravy with tomato sauce (poutine italienne). Many Montreal restaurants are “apportez votre vin” (bring your own wine).

	Fast paced, intense, and cannot look away are just a few words to describe Taken 2. Retired CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is back for some more action. For those of you who didn’t see the first Taken movie, Mills’ daughter, Kim, gets kidnapped while on a trip to Paris with her friend. Mills flies to Paris with little to no clues as to where his daughter is, as he retraces her steps to find her. 
	We see a lot more from Mills’ daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) and his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). The three of them are in Istanbul and the people Mills had to kill in order to get his daughter back are seeking revenge for their sons and grandsons. Instead of just going after Mills, they go after his ex-wife and daughter instead, to hurt him they way they were hurt. 
The second installment is similar to the first film, as the director, Luc Besson, really does a good job of keeping the audience guessing. Sometimes the sequel to a movie, which is usually highly anticipated, is not all it was hyped up to be. I was definitely proven wrong. Liam Nesson did a great job as usual. 
I don’t want give away any of the details of this movie, because it’s truly surprising. All I can say is that if you liked the first Taken, you will definitely not be disappointed. Even if you didn’t see it, you will not be lost and you will enjoy this movie just as much. I personally loved this movie; it definitely lived up to expectations.

A few days before seeing Cloud Atlas, I read an article from Entertainment Weekly writer Owen Gleiberman declaring the film a “cornily enthralling sci-fi kaleidoscope.” At first, I thought this statement was just a flowery bit of critic talk, one of those adjective-heavy sayings that somehow sounded the right bit of crazy to make sense in a magazine. I turned to a film buddy and gawked at the absurdity of such a deep-fried assertion.
But after seeing the film, the latest by the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix) and Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run), I finally understood Mr. Gleiberman. I felt a bit like a cartoony jogger smashed by an oversized Steinway slipped from a third story window. It made sense to me how a film could be light and heavy, contrast the goofiness of extreme makeup art with a serious feast of philosophy, and hold onto its chunky story for nearly three hours. While my head is not literally squashed by a big piano, it certainly had to take on some weighty stuff during this film.
	David Mitchell’s 2004 novel of the same name was adapted to the big-screen in one of the largest independent productions ever staged. With a budget of over $100 million, the film features tons of beautiful imagery aided by digital enhancement and effects weaving in hearty variety to your eyes quenched when flipping from any of the six interconnected vignettes. 
Atlas connects its six stories eclectically ranging from the journal entries of a sickly lawyer in the 1850’s Pacific and a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, like a parable told at bedtime. Fairy tales often take on big themes along with the right amount of adolescent naivety to, well, appeal to kids: knowing that there are consequences to our actions, sharing with others, the concept of fairness, altruism, and, of course, respecting your Mommy. Atlas is no different, although I don’t recommend bringing your toddler to see it. 
The film thinly veils it’s introspection by whipping it up with a fair amount of sometimes unintentional humor. Atlas has an ensemble cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, and Jim Sturgess. All of these actors play multiple roles between the different stories, which are built on themes of connectedness and serendipity. Sometimes this mixing and matching of actors can get a little confusing, especially at the beginning of the film. Hopefully most audiences will ease into the quick changes between the stories and get over the laughability factor found in the make-up art. Tom Hanks is seen as a goateed thug in one scene, a tattooed sheepherder in another, and a big-toothed 19th century doctor in the next. The vast differences of these personas can be shocking and a bit goofy.
If you’ve seen The Matrix, you’ll get a kick out of the dystopian future in this film where we see a corrupt totalitarian government with a twisted ruling corporatism. The filmmakers make a direct reference to sci-fi cult movie Soylent Green in Atlas and we no doubt can trace visual seeds back to classics like Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange and Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner.
Atlas has a careful mix of late-night philosophical looming and laser blasting sci-fi. Sometimes a bit too fantastical, the film undoubtedly has its flaws. For a three-hour visual feast, could it really go so wrong? Verdict: 8/10

Many students had to stay on campus during Hurricane Sandy. There was no power at LIU Post from Sunday, October 28 to Saturday, November 3. There were also no school shuttles or N20 buses on campus from October 28 to November 1.  The campus regained power on Saturday, November 3 at around 1 p.m.  Obviously, not everyone can leave campus to go home, especially not out of state and international students.  So did students feel safe on a closed campus with no power? 
Many students said they felt safe. “Resident Hall Directors and Resident Assistants were always on duty; they checked up on us and gave us candy on Halloween,” said Liang Long, a graduate Master of Business Administration student. Others did not feel safe. “I need power and heat. It’s terrible; I want to go back to Korea,” said Celina Dalae Min, a senior Broadcasting major. 
Some students feel that LIU Post staff did everything they could. “Winnick was open every day. I saw workers cooking food outside with wood and fire when there was no power,” said Long. There was heat and hot water every day during the hurricane, he added. “One of my classmates who lives in Hicksville stayed in my room because our dorm is safer than his house,” said Long. The dorm buildings are good because they are made from stone. There was light in the lobby; people played cards and board games every night, Long said. “My dorm, Suffolk Hall, had the most international students staying during the hurricane, more than thirty,” said Long. One thing that they should have done was to make a place to study, either a building or room in the residence halls, he said. “During the hurricane, one door was open in Life Science; my classmate and I went into room 273, which had light and heat. We studied in there for several hours and then a security guard made us leave because the building was closed and then locked the door,” said Long. 
Others felt that that LIU Post could have done more to make students feel safe and comfortable during the hurricane. “They should have provided us with candles and shuttle buses,” said Mikhail Gryaznov, a sophomore International Business major. The school didn’t really do anything bad or anything good during the hurricane, he said. “The main problem was I couldn’t get cash; the university should provide us with ATM machines. Winnick closes early. We need to eat and to order food, you need cash,” said Gryaznov. Winnick was open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on October 29-30 and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. starting on October 31. “The school asked us to save electricity, but they didn’t shut off the lights in the other buildings which were closed like Life Science and the library,” said Gryaznov. The school taped the outlets with band-aids and did not allow us the charge our laptops, he said. “My friend’s room helped me a lot. Their dorm room was the only room with power in the entire building of Nassau Hall,” said Gryaznov. Several students went to their room to charge their cell phones and laptops, he said. 
Many students did not only lose power on campus but in their homes as well. “I had no power for ten days at my house and then I came back to campus and there was no power,” said Emika Wada, a senior Music Education major.  LIU Post lost power again on Wednesday, November 7 at around 5 p.m. This was the same day classes resumed. The power came back six hours later on November 7. The power went out again on November 8 at around 12 p.m. This power outage lasted about three hours. 
I evacuated the campus on Sunday, October 28, to go home where the power remained on. I felt the safest at home. I returned to campus on Tuesday, November 6. At this time, everything was working in the dorm buildings. However, the next day it was very unsettling when the power went out at 5 p.m. It was extremely dark and I was unprepared to be living with no power. The residence halls did nothing to make me feel more comfortable or safe at this time. The Residence Hall Director and Resident Assistants just stayed in the lobby of the dorm building. They did not know if class would be canceled and when we would regain power. I did not see anyone check on the residents at this time. I think they should provide students with flash lights or candles to make them feel more comfortable. It was a little scary walking to Winnick in darkness during heavy snow. At this time, there were no drinks available and there was a limited selection of food. I did not feel safe on campus with no power at all. I was very pleased when the power went back on at 11 p.m. However, the next day, October 8, the power went off again at around 12 p.m. I was in class and was dismissed due to the power outage. I went to Hillwood and everything was closing around me. I quickly got food but I witnessed that many students did not. There was no food being served in Hillwood less than an hour later and Winnick was closed at this time. I don’t understand how you can close all food places when you have a campus full of students.            
November 7 and 8 were days of confusion on campus. Many students did not attend classes and teachers did not know how we would make up the time lost during the hurricane. No one knew if classes would be canceled, when the power would be back on and what was open on campus. I felt uncomfortable, anxious and did not feel safe the entire time. After the power went off on November 8 and afternoon classes were canceled, I went home.

The cover of Newsweek magazine for the week of October 15 had in big white bold letters, “Heaven Is Real.” This cover caught my eye without a doubt. Does someone at Newsweek really know whether or not heaven is real? Has someone traveled there? Is it really true? These are all questions we all ask ourselves many times throughout our lives. Whether we like to admit it or not, we are born with this curiosity.  
Dr. Eben Alexander, an academic neurosurgeon, shared his story with Newsweek about his uncanny yet life changing experience. Having taught at many prestigious universities, including Harvard Medical School, Dr. Alexander has followed his father’s path as a neurosurgeon and has well-rounded knowledge about the “astonishingly sophisticated but extremely delicate mechanism,” the brain.
He didn’t believe in “the phenomenon of near-death experiences.” Dr. Alexander believed that there were “good scientific explanations for the heavenly out-of-body journeys described by those who narrowly escape death. Reduce the amount of oxygen [the brain] receives by the smallest amount and it will react.” Dr. Alexander didn’t believe that the stories these people came back with had any truth to them, until now. 
In the fall of 2008, Dr. Alexander contracted a rare form of bacterial meningitis that led him to a seven day coma, which then led to the human part of his brain to become inactive. He experienced something so profound that gave a scientific reason to believe in consciousness after death. While Dr. Alexander’s body lay in a coma in Lynchburg General Hospital in Virginia, his “mind- my conscious, inner self- was alive and well, my brain-free consciousness journeyed to another, larger dimension of the universe: a dimension I’d never dreamed existed and which the old, pre-coma me would have been more than happy to explain was a simple impossibility.” 
In the Newsweek article, he continued to say that what he saw had been very similar to countless stories told by people who have claimed to journey the same path and called it heaven, “it exists.” He described what he experienced, “seeing and hearing was not separate in this place, everything was distinct, yet everything was also a part of everything else. [We] were riding along an intricately patterned surface, which after a moment I recognized as the wing of a butterfly. In fact, millions of butterflies were all around us- vast fluttering waves of them.” The images and wondrous visualizations that Dr. Alexander described are probably much more than what our minds can fathom. 
While being in this dimension of the universe, he received a message that had three parts, “you are loved and cherished, dearly, forever. You have nothing to fear. There is nothing you can do wrong.” This message filled Dr. Alexander with relief, “it was like being handed the rules to a game I’d been playing all my life without ever fully understanding it.” He sensed a divine being at work. “Divine” is defined, by the Merriam Webster Dictionary, as relating to, “or proceeding directly from God or a god, supremely good, heavenly, Godlike.” He went on to talk about the universe and how it’s defined, “not only is the universe defined by unity [of these two realms], it is also- I now know- defined by love. The universe as I experienced it in my coma is- I have come to see with both shock and joy- the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways.” Dr. Alexander told Newsweek about his whole moving and remarkable journey. Check out www.newsweek.com for the full story. 
Jeff Kleinstein, sophomore Accounting student, supported Dr. Alexander’s experience after reading his article in Newsweek. “I agree. You know, when I die, I expect to wake up again in a different life.” He viewed death as an ordinary sleep, “but when you wake up, you’re in a different bed.” Junior Nutrition major Maria Tavella, after hearing about Dr. Alexander’s experience, believed it to be true also. “There is something more to life, “she said, “stories like these are very inspiring; it gives people something to hope for.” 
Dr. Alexander is just one of a many people who have experienced this joy of life. Individuals may think that all there is to life is the physical and they’ll only believe what they see. Some may think this “only the physical” view of life isn’t normal. Well frankly, it’s very normal. The only reason people may not believe in another realm or consciousness after death or even God is because they haven’t experienced anything to bring them to that realization. It’s almost like a gift of awareness and of truth. I’m pretty sure that nothing can change Dr. Alexander’s thoughts about what he experienced, simply because it was as real to him as eating breakfast or driving a car. Fortunately, in my opinion, it is the truth, not just for this doctor, but for everyone, some just haven’t received that gift. However, you can’t receive a gift if you don’t believe there is a gift to receive. 
The comments on Newsweek.com about Dr. Alexander’s article reveal that he has just as many supporters as critics. Hearing about any kind of supernatural experience can seem like a distant idea that some people cannot attain. Was Dr. Alexander in the presence of the almighty God? Maybe; maybe not. All I know from my personal experience is that it is possible. In my opinion, there isn’t one person on this Earth that cannot experience the joy that Dr. Alexander spoke about. All it takes is a little faith.

	Wicked girlfriends probably do not realize it at the time, however; the repercussions of their actions will haunt numerous other females long after the initial breakup. Boys that have been ruined by one wretched girl are literally the worst. You know the girls I’m talking about; they are jealous, ruthless, controlling and vindictive. If you have a friend like this, advise her to cut the crap for the sake of single females everywhere.
	The aftermath of the destructive wakes these females leave behind could last for years to come. These poor guys are like beaten down little puppies after they finally find the courage to end it. Then they become treacherous. They become the smooth criminals, the ones who know exactly what to say to get girls right where they want them. These are the boys that will almost act like a boyfriend by taking a girl out to dinner, calling or texting, and giving half-hearted but seemingly sincere compliments; the sweet talkers. However, they will never act on it even if the girl is perfect for them. They will find some garbage excuse not to be with her.
	The underlying cause for all of this can be traced back to old injuries left behind by the previous she-devil. Although no 20-something-year-old guy would ever admit this, that would mean showing normal human emotion and vulnerability and God knows that would just be blasphemy. 
	These boys have it in their mind that toying with girls is ok. Just because you are now single does not mean you can throw all sense of morality out the window. Single girls should not be forced to pay for what some other girl did. I’m not saying that guys should settle into another relationship right away. If you want to be single, go ahead and be single. What I’m saying is that you can’t go around acting like Prince Charming, saying and doing all of the right things, only to fall off the grid a week or two later. You also cannot make it seem like the girl is crazy for wanting or expecting more when you are acting like you are willing to give more. Girls are crazy and boys are stupid; but what actually makes girls crazy is stupid boys.

Linda McMahon loses after investing almost $100 million in her campaign
In Connecticut, Linda McMahon (R) lost her bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate to three term Connecticut Congressman Christopher Murphy (D). McMahon is married to Vince McMahon, former wrestling executive and retired WWE wrestler. This was her second time in three years running for Senate according to an article by Peter Applebome in The New York Times this month. According to the New York Times, McMahon spent nearly $100 million dollars between the two races. “Ms. McMahon may or may not get to influence job creation as a senator,” wrote Applebome in a separate article before the election. “But she has already made an impact on the Connecticut economy,” wrote Applebome. “By dishing out close to $100 million for two Senate races.” McMahon spent more than anyone has ever spent of their own money to win any federal seat.
Same Sex Marriage Legalized in four states on Election Day
In each state that same sex marriage was considered through ballot voting, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington, it was approved. In total, nine states have  legalized same sex marriage. According to the article by by Erik Eckholm written this month, Maine voters voted against same-sex marriage only three years ago, 53 percent to 47 percent. But last Tuesday the numbers were reversed, leaving supporters for same sex marriage at 53 percent to 47 percent. Not only were gay rights legalized in four states for the first time, but also, according to an article on Time.com by Michael A. Lindenberger this month, candidates that were openly gay or that strongly supported gay rights were also elected into office. Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin was elected to the Senate in Wisconsin and will become the country’s first openly gay Senator when the new Congress forms, wrote Lindenberger. In total, nine states in our country have  legalized same sex marriage. 
Gas is being rationed according to odd-even license plate numbers
If you have been sitting in gridlock traffic, it may not be traffic, you might be on a gas line. After Superstorm Sandy, residents have been racing to the gas stations using social media websites like GasBuddy to track stations that have gas. Because of power outages, many gas stations in our region remain closed, and those that are open, are closed within a day or so due to long lines and people buying gas. According to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, only 25 percent of gas stations are open in New York City. With residents camping out all night at gas lines, the government has attempted to shorten lines by rationing gas. “Since Friday, Nov. 9, is an odd day,” according to an article in The Christian Science Monitor by Laurent Belsie, “only cars with license plates ending in an odd number or a letter or other character will be able to buy gas. On Saturday, only cars with license plates that end with even numbers or zero will be able to fill up.” Bloomberg added that shortages can continue to last up to another two weeks. According to Belsie, police officers are monitoring gas stations to ensure no one cuts lines. Violators of the odd-even system can be charged with a Class B misdemeanor.
Marijuana legalized in two states
Voters in Washington and Colorado passed ballot initiatives last week to legalize marijuana for recreational use. But, even though Washington and Colorado have regulated the use and sale of marijuana for adults, according to an article on CNN.com “Marijuana legalization passes in Colorado, Washington” by Aaron Smith, marijuana is still illegal in the eyes of the federal government, which overrules states’ rights. According to Smith, analysts had projected that Washington voters would approve legalizing cannabis because it proposes a heavy tax for marijuana that made the proposal attractive to ‘budget hawks.’ According to another article on CNN.com “2 states legalize pot, but don’t ‘break out the Cheetos’ yet” by Alan Duke, “Legalization could save U.S. taxpayers the $10 billion spent each year on enforcing marijuana prohibition, and eliminate the criminal cases against more than 750,000 people arrested per year for possession.” The Drug Enforcement Administration remains adamant that marijuana is an illegal drug and that possessing, using or selling it is a crime.

Though I have not written for the Pioneer in a while, I do refer students to join the staff as I feel is crucial to learning and the overall experience of contributing to the school’s newspaper. I am very pleased about the paper this semester, each issue has been a great read. I wish the staff all the best.
Cheers,
Sandra Elien

To the Editors:
This Wednesday I picked up the latest issue of The Pioneer and to my surprise, I was presented with a refined and improved layout. As a weekly reader of The Pioneer, I have to say I absolutely love the new look, especially the new masthead. I find it simpler and more relevant for a student newspaper. I also noticed the addition of weather, a Top 10 Billboard chart, and box office results to the paper. These are the features students care about. Keep up the positive changes!
I look forward to reading future issues of The Pioneer and seeing our student newspaper evolve into a better and more informative piece of journalism.
Sincerely,
Bernie Fabig

Dear Readers,
As we get back into the grind of things after the mess that Hurricane Sandy brought upon us, I would like to say that I hope you and your family and friends are all re-cooperating well. The devastation that Long Island endured is something that will surely not be forgotten anytime soon. Although the past few weeks have created excruciating and unwelcome circumstances for many of us — the sense of community I have seen among us Long Islanders has been overwhelming, in a very heartwarming way. I’ve heard countless stories of students helping those in need, even when their own personal situations weren’t ideal. We should be nothing but proud that we go to this school and are surrounded by so many great people. And of course, we’re New Yorkers and will get through this. Good try Sandy, but we’re still standing.
Due to the severe weather conditions and inaccessibility to many of our resources, the Pioneer was unable to publish an issue during the weeks we didn’t have class. We sincerely apologize that you weren’t able to pick up a copy of your campus newspaper for two weeks. However, we do hope that you were able to check our website, www.liupostpioneer.com, and stay informed. We’re also pleased to announce that we will be publishing an extra issue this semester, on December 12, since so many students will be on campus making up classes that week. 
It’s been a hectic semester and the chaos of finals is right around the corner. Remember to stay positive and try not to get overwhelmed. With Thanksgiving being next week, I think this year we can truly be appreciative of how fortunate we are. The losses that some families experienced from the Hurricane have been incredibly sad and now more than ever, it’s important to be thankful for what we do have. Personally, I am thankful for our hardworking staff, having a Co-Editor-in-Chief who is literally the ying to my yang, and the most thoughtful advisor possible. The Pioneer has come a long way this semester and I’m proud and thankful for what we were able to accomplish. We wish you the best — with Hurricane recovery, finals and everything in between! As always, we appreciate any and all feedback. Reach us at cwpstpnr@gmail.com 
Sincerely,
Olivia Wicik
Editor-in-Chief

On Monday, November 12, students gathered outside Hillwood Commons at the Flag Pole to celebrate its 4th Annual Veterans Day Flag Ceremony during common hour. Samantha Vega, the President of Veterans and Students United (VSU) delivered her welcome speech and explained how VSU helps veterans in need and deployed soldiers. “We support them through donating various times throughout the year to the Wounded Warriors project,” said Vega, a senior English Literature major, “we send out cards and this year we are starting pillowcases for the troops where they can actually send them over to a unit we adopted.”  	
Following the opening speech, Father Ted Brown, Director of Religious Life, delivered a moving prayer for the soldiers who are serving or have served our nation.   	
Dr. Forestell thanked the men and women in the armed services for protecting “the way of life that we have come to believe in and hope for and work to sustain here in the United States” in his speech. He also stated the importance of welcoming returning service men and women back into our communities after defending our country. Dr. Forestell said, “It really is important that we form a community here that provides people with the space and resources so they their life may continue to chase their dreams and success just like the rest of us.”  	
Later in the ceremony, United States Marine Corps Veteran and Information Management and Technology major, Matthew Gabriel and United State Coast Guard and Vice President of VSU, Michael Knauer spoke to the students that  were in attendance.   	
“There are things that you have to adjust to when you come back to the civilian world,” said Gabriel. He spoke of how the school and Adam Grohman, Director of Student Conduct and Community Education Coordinator of Veteran and Military Affairs, welcomed him to LIU Post when he was looking to go back to school. “I remembered I spoke directly to Adam and he spoke to me like I was already enrolled in the school. I was already welcomed in and there were no questions asked.” Gabriel also expressed to the audience that “the little things to us matter.” Whether it was a handshake, or a simple thank you, it matters to Gabriel and other service men and women.   	
Knauer served in the US Coast Guard for ten years. Knauer shared, “VSU was started by an Army veteran named Steven. One of the things that Steven wanted to do was to make sure that VSU facilitated veterans helping other veterans when they returned, came back, made the transition back into life. It’s brought back a sense of camaraderie something I have missed since I’ve been back from the military. Another thing we’ve done is bring awareness to LIU Post. There’s a real appreciation for us and we really, really appreciate all of you.”  	
The ceremony closed with a speech from Dr. Steinberg. “This University stands for education and the future and energy and opportunity. We welcome back the group of men and women who have served their country.” Acknowledging the veterans that spoke of their experiences, Dr. Steinberg said, “I feel very pleased that this University has heard them and their needs and is trying to meet them.”  
Refreshments were also served at the top of Hillwood Commons immediately after the ceremony and students and guests were able to speak with all the veterans in attendance. “To be able to work with the veterans here on campus and put together such a huge event is a honor,” said Vega.  	
G.I. Jobs named LIU Post Military Friendly for the third time, as one of the top 15 percent of military friendly colleges in the nation. For more information on Veterans and Students United, please email them at veteranstudents@gmail.com. To contact the Office of Veteran and Military Affairs, contact Adam Grohman at adamgrohman@liu.edu.
