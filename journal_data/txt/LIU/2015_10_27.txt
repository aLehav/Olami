Halloween is only days away, and with all the excitement, you may have forgotten to get a killer costume, or make plans with your friends. Each year trends change and different costumes become popular, new haunted houses open along with different parties that attract people.
There are several events being held in the New York City to celebrate Halloween. This year’s events include:
Webster Hell
Attend the Halloween Parade “After Party,” hosted by Webster Hall; all four floors of Webster Hall, with guest appearances by Suga Ray, Sean Sharp, and more. There will be a “Virgin Sacrifice,” on an unsuspecting guest, and a costume contest with a prize of $5,000 dollars. Tickets are available on Webster Hall’s website.
Candle Light Ghost Tours of Manhattans Most Haunted House
Take a 50-minute tour of the Merchant’s House in Manhattan.
This tour reveals the “dark past” of the Merchant family, and how they’re still “haunting” their house years later.

Earlier this week, I came across a quote from Van Christian Andersen. If you don’t know who he is, I’m sure you’ve heard of his work; he’s actually kind of a big deal. Andersen is best known for writing, “The Ugly Duckling,” “The Nightingale,” and yes, he even wrote “The Little Mermaid” (and you thought it was all Disney). Anyways, the quote reads as follows: “Where words fail, music speaks.”
When all else fails, we often turn to music. It can reflect how we’re feeling; it allows us to feel like we’re not alone, it offers us advice, and heck, we even sing it the shower as a form of entertainment. Music helps us to tell our stories; It’s a reflection of who we are, plain and simple.
Hmm, plain and simple…
When I think about it, if I had to describe the music of today, I would have to say that it’s plain, and it’s simple. In my opinion, the sound is homogeneous; the lyrics have lost their meaning. Instead of creating and making music that they believe in, ‘artists’ create whatever may sell, or makes the most profit.
That said, I don’t stand alone on the state of our music. Just ask junior Criminal Justice major, Jason Mari, who took modern day hip-hop to task. “It’s funny when you really think of it, every [hip-hop] song you listen to, is either about money, drugs, or someone’s ‘trap queen’,” he said. “Not too often do I hear a song that makes me feel like I can relate, or understand what the artist is going through. I think that’s what made Eminem so great.”
Mari is spot on. Artists, such as Eminem and Nas, once made music that spoke to the individual. Songs that have lyrics so transcendent and powerful, one could use these songs for therapeutic purposes. Nowadays, artists like Eminem and Nas are viewed as ‘obsolete’, they simply can’t compete with the ‘Fetty Waps’ and the ‘Big Seans’ of the world, whose songs are premised upon success, currency, and the ‘activities’ that come with fame.
This problem isn’t indigenous to the Hip-Hop genre. This phe- nomenon is taking place within all facets of the music industry. “It seems that nowadays everyone wants to fit in, instead of stand out, and that’s not good for music,” said Linda Sanzo, a junior Business major. “If Z100 isn’t playing the same songs six songs every other hour, that, not to mention have the same beat and same message, then they’re either at com- mercial, or your listening to the morning show.”
I asked Sanzo what “message” she was referring to, and she replied, “By message, I mean that everyone is about just going to the club, which isn’t necessarily bad, but I just want something different, something that speaks to me, something I can relate to.”
When we compare the artists of today to the artists of prior years, the disparities in all-around talent, and overall substance of their music is alarming. For example, the ‘90s featured perhaps one of the greatest generations of music artists: Eminem, Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Madonna, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and even bands such as the Backstreet Boys and N’Sync were revered for their music. However, perhaps what made them such transcendent stars was the fact that they were all great and unique, in their own way; Something today’s artists are often severely lacking.
But is it our fault? After all, we are the consumers; what we want, we get; or is it the inverse? We’re being fed the same vanilla product, and we’re forced to like it. Perhaps it’s both. On the one hand, I think society has changed drastically in the past 15 years. As we venture deeper into the digital age, our world is much more up-tempo. We listen to our music for sound as opposed to food for thought. Tie that into the music industry searching for the next artist with the potential to be the next one-hit-wonder, and there you have it: today’s music industry, with the variety of Subway, and the ingredients of your local McDonald’s.

As many of you seniors are entering your last or second to last semester, the reality of what these amazing four years have all been will start to kick in! But, although it seems like it’s only these veteran college seniors who are going to ponder about their lives, during the next year, we all should start to think about our end game: what am I going to do after college? What is my ‘means to an end?’
If you haven’t already put together a resume, it may be a good idea to make an appointment with your success coach, professors, department chairs, or your parents for extra help. Even if it’s just listing all the cool things you have done, any jobs you have endured, as well as your interesting characteristics as a person, that can all be included in your resume.
Although many of you may think, “Oh, I have years before I have to start thinking about a serious job,” it’s not too soon to have a resume. Drawing up your resume doesn’t just need to be something that you hand in to some corporate animal; no, it could almost be an analysis of yourself. You could study what you have achieved so far: Have I achieved enough? What else have I always wanted to do? What life experiences would be cool to have? It will also help you question whether you have been productive enough in your life so far: Have I had a job? Do I need to mature a bit more?
This, as a whole, is not just a huge step toward where you need to be in the future; in a business or professional setting, it is a necessary step to help yourself understand what you’ve achieved and accomplished. It may go two ways. You could be happy and content with your progress through life, which will serve as a confident boost, or you may come out of it thinking, “Maybe I have to buck my ideas up and get my head down!” Both of these outcomes can only improve you as a person. Give it go!
If you don’t have a “Scooby doo” (this means CLUE in cockney rhyming slang), then you need to start thinking. To set a goal or having an ambition that will lead you where you want to be is so important for your psyche. We as humans need stability in our minds, and things such as giving your future “food for thought” is a very healthy and a crucial way to maintain a strong mind.
I am a prime example of someone who konws what he wants to do. College opens so many avenues that you could ride along, which may become overwhelming. However, one positive outlook is that you have
a choice. Many people in our age don’t have this luxury of choice. They don’t have the opportunity to make their own decisions on what field they want to follow upon graduation. Having a vague idea of a specific path or subject matter that we really have a passion for, and want to do once we have left the green scenery of Pioneer Country, is key.
Focus on thoughts that center yourself best; what are you good at? What is your major? Is this the field you want to go into after college? What are your options? These are all questions that you could ask yourself and then go into deep thought and find what you really want to do.
If you need help with any of these questions, and I am pretty certain you will because they are hard concepts to think about and extremely serious topics, then visit your success coach, ask your professor, and please don’t be afraid to ask your parents and friends for their perspectives. Asking questions will help massively, and make a few decisions much easier. Just be warned that you may find things out that you never thought you would, but your mind will become clearer once you have considered them. So do it with an open mind, and find your ‘means to an end!’

We are a world dependent on technology; our addiction is to our phones, our webpages, and our social media applications. These addictions rule our day-to-day lives in a way that allows harmful individuals to hide behind their screens, and avoid any real face-to-face contact, giving them an incredible amount of power.
This reason alone has created an epidemic that has engulfed the lives of almost every teen, young adult, and adult across the world. According to the Megan Meier Foundation, 71.9 percent of young adults have reported being cyber bullied at least once during the school year, in a 2014 study. Why do you think that is?
Social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, allows the user to have open opportunities to say how they feel about others. It has become a popular go-to when dealing with cyberbullying, because the bully knows and understands that everyone will be able to view what he or she posts. This gives the bully an extreme amount of power. We no longer live in the days when a child’s worst fear was someone taking their lunch money; they now fear that their reputations will be attacked in a public sphere on the internet, a place that once you make a post, there is no taking it back.
What do you think constitutes bullying on social media? Kresla Storey, a senior English major, described cyberbullying to be “name calling, derogatory comments, just saying nasty things.” According to No- Bullying.com, the section on Cyber Safety Social Media’s article, entitled, “social media bullying has become a serious problem” (May 25, 2014), negative comments on pictures is a form of abuse, as well as simply using the pictures of others to create a harmful post. Storey believes that the motivation behind the bullying is fueled by pure boredom, “they are just jerks who need an outlet,” she said. “I think they are ignorant and don’t understand that’s not how you treat another human being.”
The thought of mocking someone’s entire existence and picking out their flaws as a form of entertainment is unsettling and troubling. Unfortunately, this trend is real and it’s raw. Cyberbullying on social media has ruined many lives, and has even taken them. In 2006, Megan Meier, who the Megan Meier Foundation is in honor of, took her own life due to being ridiculed and bullied on her MySpace page. This unfortunate circumstance exemplifies the idea that cyberbullying gives the attacker the most power.
In Meier’s case, the “boy” who bullied her wasn’t actually a boy at all. It was a mother of another girl, Lori Drew, that Meier attended school with who did not like her very much. Drew and her daughter created a fake profile just to torment Meier. This is cyberbullying in its most intense form; it allowed the tormenters to push Meier to her worst possible fate, suicide. Thus, it sparks “ the question: is cyberbullying something to ignore?
Absolutely NOT! It is up to all of us to stop it in its tracks, so those who are suffering do not face the same fate as young Megan Meier. Some tips you can give someone who may not know how to handle cyberbullying on any of their social media accounts if it occurs is to un-friend anyone who has been posting negative content to their page, according to NoBullying.com. “Block anyone who continues to send messages,” Storey said. And definitely let an adult know what is happening. Storey added, “I know a lot of people who are not on Facebook because of [cyberbullying].” Those people are taking the right steps in order to work through this tough situation they were unfairly placed in.
Although our generation has matured and grown, that does not mean that cyberbullying on social media doesn’t play a part in our daily lives. “It doesn’t matter what age…anyone can be bullied,” Storey said. Hopefully we can help anyone out there who is succumbing to this situation, in order to prevent the number of causalities due to this torment.

Hazing, a word often talked about in colleges and universities by both fraternities and sororities, as well as non-members of these groups. The word portrays controversial views of these specific groups. Many schools, including Post, do not permit hazing because of its possible dangers. The news often features stories about tragedies associated with hazing, as well as Greek organizations that were banned for partaking in hazing during recruitment process to induct new members.
Chiara Marangelli, a junior Elementary Education major, was initiated into Alpha Epsilon Phi in the spring of 2014. Alpha Epsilon Phi supposedly does not haze the recruits, like some other Greek organizations at Post. Members of the sorority feel very strongly about staying away from the stereotype of Greek hazing.
“We don’t haze because we want Greeks to be seen in a positive light,” Marangelli said. “We want to teach girls about our values and traditions without embarrassing or humiliating them.”
Marangelli added that there are more positive ways to bring girls into Greek life. “We mostly just try to befriend the girls and help them to befriend each other. We want to be really close; that’s why we call ourselves sisters,” she said.
Victor Ramirez, a senior Marketing major, is a member of Phi Iota Alpha. He went through the recruitment process without being hazed, to join his fraternity in fall 2013. “During my initiation and the process to join, I went to workshops that were run by the older brothers in the fraternity,” Ramirez said. “They taught us about the history of the organization and educated us.” According to Ramirez, hazing is not a problem in Greek life here. “We do not haze because we make better use of our time. We’d rather create a strong brotherhood,” he said.
I personally believe that hazing does happen, but Greek organizations would not admit to it. That said, I don’t think every organization hazes their recruits. It seems as though it depends on the specific fraternity or sorority. In one story I have heard from a friend at another school, a freshmen who was pledging a sorority had to basically be a slave to the sisters of that organization in order to become a member. This is not an acceptable way to treat people, regardless of whether or not they’re a member yet. I would never want to join a group of people that require me to embarrass, hurt, or offend others to be a part of an organization.

From casually driving around town on a sunny day, to cruising on a highway or parkway a little above the speed-limit (a little… yeah right), it should always be expected that you drive safely, not only for yourself, but for everyone else on the road around you. It’s a notion we take for granted, but sometimes don’t always follow. When we rush to get to our destinations, not caring whom is in our way, we tend to, like a one-sided proportion, become extremely selfish.
Do we ever wonder why that is? Maybe we are having an off day, or maybe we just don’t have the patience? Well, no matter what the reasoning behind our actions on the road is, it’s always important to drive carefully. However, when everyone looks out for himself or herself, it can be difficult to maintain that standard. So should drivers have to retake their driver’s test every few years?
For drivers of all ages, that question may become a new law, and sooner than you think. Well, at least in Connecticut.
According to WFSB 3, Connecticut’s article entitled, “Drivers could have to be retested for license renewal” (Apr. 3, 2014), the new bill proposal will contain “a licensee seeking renewal of a motor vehicle operator’s license…required to pass a comprehensive test as to knowledge of the laws concerning motor vehicles and the rules of the road.”
The law is approved by the state-senate of Connecticut. It would be coded as Bill No. 335, and would take effect as of Jan. 2016. With this in mind, do Post students think that this is a law that every state should have, or do they think that current driving laws and restrictions are fine the way they are?
Stephanie Lozada, a junior Broadcasting major, thinks that there should be a mutual law for every state. “I honestly do think that people should retake their test. Some people just get too comfortable and they start to act reckless,” Lozada said. For Lozada, it’s more than just a matter of safety, it’s taking proper precaution. “I think there should be tests for people who have had a certain number of accidents in a year or so; or people that have gotten a certain amount of traffic violations,” she said.
Mike Themistocleous, a junior Film major, has similar thoughts on the matter. “I definitely think that there should be something drivers should do to prove they still know the law,” he said. “Whether it’s a class or a road test, we are all responsible for our behavior on the road. If it will keep people safe, do it.”
I personally agree with Lozada and Themistocleous. In my experiences thus far, sitting as a passenger in someone’s car, or in the back seats, it’s important for the driver to drive as if anything can happen at any moment. One wrong swerve, and an accident can turn bad really quick. I would say obey the speed limit (but let’s face it, no one will, and that one’s a given). However, I will say that every life is important and we need to look out for each other, especially when commuting, and keep our roads safe for traffic and transit.

“Crimson Peak” is director Guillermo del Toro’s ninth movie and his first since 2013’s “Pacific Rim.” “Crimson Peak” is not his most exciting movie, but it does manage to capture you from the very first scene, keeping its mystery alive for most of the film.
The film stars Mia Wasikowska, who plays the role of Edith Cushing, an aspiring writer and a member of
a wealthy New York family who falls for clay miner and businessman Thomas Sharpe, played by Tom Hiddleston. 
Jessica Chastain also stars in the film, taking on the role of Thomas Sharpe’s sister, Lucille. In addition, Charlie Hunnam plays Dr. Alan McMichael, who is an ophthalmologist and Cushing’s close friend. All of the actors do a great job, with Jessica Chastain as the menacing villain, leading the charge.
Even though “Crimson Peak” is marketed as a horror movie, it is actually a Gothic romance story that
happens to include the appearance of ghosts. The romance in question develops between Edith and Thomas Sharpe when he arrives in New York to pitch his latest business idea to Edith’s rich father.
In the opening scenes of the film, we are introduced to Edith as a young girl who is visited by her mother’s ghost who delivers a warning to Edith to stay away from Crimson Peak. Years later, the ghost reappears and repeats the same warning soon after Thomas and Lucille arrive in New York.
Due to unforeseen circumstances, Edith has to eventually move into Crimson Peak with Thomas and Lucille. Once in the ancient mansion, Edith discovers that ghosts walk the halls and the Sharpe siblings hold more than a few secrets of their own.
While there are four main characters advertised in “Crimson Peak,” there are actually five. The sharpe mansion in “Crimson Peak” is a character in itself, with its amazing set design and looming presence for a large portion of the movie. Once inside the mansion, it is clear that director Guillermo del Toro envisioned this mansion as one of his main characters. There is so much detail and painstaking effort to make this mansion look as authentic as possible to ones that existed 100 years ago. Like other del Toro films, the cinematography is also outstanding, with some of the best shots showing the interior and exterior of the mansion.
Since “Crimson Peak” contains ghosts, it is important that the ghosts look disturbing, and thankfully they do. The visual effects are also one of the strongest aspects of the movie. Every ghost in the movie has a distinctive look with certain elements separating each one. Ghosts are either black, red, or white, depending on how each one died. Since the ghosts were created using a combination of practical and computer generated effects, each one looks believable and as if it belongs in the world. There are also several jump scares present, but not nearly enough to take the viewer out of the movie.
As for the negative aspects, there are only a few. Out of the four main characters, it is Charlie Hunnam’s that gets short-changed. His character is not as developed as the other three and he disappears for a large part of the movie. The story also drags for a small part in the middle of the movie, but it’s not a major issue.
In the beginning of the movie, Edith describes her book as a love story that just happens to include the presence of ghosts. That is actually what “Crimson Peak” offers. Viewers going into the movie expecting a typical horror movie with tons of jump scares might be disappointed. Instead, they will find a great Gothic period tale of romance with horror elements thrown in.
Like Edith, viewers should not obey the ghost’s warning of Crimson Peak. Instead, it should be sought out, and even though it may not be what viewers expect, all of its elements are well worth the time.

Thursday, Oct. 22, Webster Hall was sold out to Halsey, a New Jersey native, New York loving, alternative singer. Halsey is only 21 years old, and has already toured with bands like The Kooks, and opened for Imagine Dragons on their “Smoke and Mirrors” tour this past summer. This sold out show was part of her first headline tour, Badlands, for the release of her first-full album, “Badlands.”
Halsey took to the stage with her song “Gasoline.” Her light, airy voice sang as fans screamed her lyrics, “You can’t wake up, this is not a dream. You’re part of a machine, you are not a human being. With your face all made up, living on a screen, low on self-esteem so you run on gasoline.” Halsey did more than just stand up on stage and sing the lyrics she wrote. For each song she performed, she created the story she wanted them to tell.
Eight songs into her set, Halsey stopped to give a speech, thanking her fans for believing in her, giving them the credit for her success, then introducing her first single, “Ghost.”
“This song that I wrote got the attention of record labels who wanted to talk to me, and some of them said I’ll never make it. Some of those people are here tonight, let’s show them how well I did without them,” she coaxed, before having the entire theatre sing along with her.
Halsey’s songs focus on mental health, love, sex, and independence. During the middle of the chorus for her song “Hurricane,” she spoke over her singing fans saying, “This song is a reminder that you don’t belong to anybody! No man, no woman, nobody owns you!” Halsey’s fans screamed and cheered her on as she spoke; several people cried from her songs, her words, or her presence.
Several times, in between songs, she gave speeches about how much she loves New York, how she considers it her home, how she recorded “Badlands” in her then boyfriend’s apartment, and how she credits her fans getting it to number two album in the country.
Halsey ended her set with her single “New Americana,” which she describes as a satire on today’s culture. “We know very well who we are, so we hold it down till summer starts. What kind of dough have you been spending, what kind of bubble gym have you been blowing lately.”

“Scream Queens” is Ryan Murphy’s newest show that is, in a way, a combination of his other shows, “Glee” and “American Horror Story.” The show involves several A-List actors, such as Emma Roberts, Jamie Lee Curtis, Lea Michele, Keke Palmer, Oliver Hudson, Abigail Breslin, Nick Jonas and Ariana Grande.
80’s slasher films in a way inspired creator Murphy to create “Scream Queens.” Murphy described the show as saying “Heathers meets Friday the 13th”. The premise of the show is basically this: sud- denly a bunch people are murdered on a college campus, but the catch to it is that the audience doesn’t know who is doing it and there is pos- sibility that it could be any of the characters that are presented in each episode.
“It definitely has this ‘Pretty Little Liars’ vibe going on with the whole not knowing who is doing these things,” said Stephanie Michelle, a senior Accounting major, who has been watching the show since it first premiered. “I was very excited for [“Scream Queens”] since I really like most of the actors that are in it and it just looked like a fun and engaging show.”
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy claims that he was really interested in doing a show like this that had both aspects of scariness and comedy. “What I love about it is when it’s funny, it’s funny. And when it’s scary, it’s scary,” he said.
Michelle admits that the show wasn’t as good as she expected it to be.
“It’s that type of show that is just over the top ridiculous, but it knows that it’s like that so it plays on that,” she said. “But even though it’s not the best show out there, it still leaves you hooked because you always want to know what happens next, you always want more clues as to who is the killer. It’s as if you’re solving the mystery yourself. “
In the interview, Murphy also discussed how Greek Life is a big part of the show. “It’s also a show about the sorority/fraternity system in our country and what’s happening with that, so it’s a satire about that,” he said. When asked, Kristen Esbin, who is receiving her masters in Education and is part of the sorority Delta Zeta, what she thought about the way Greek Life was being portrayed in the show, she said that she be- lieved they were over exaggerating the typical sorority girl and fraternity boy stereotype.
“I only watched a bit of the show and I get that it’s supposed to poke fun at these situations but I do believe it creates more of a stereo- type for sorority girls,” Esbin said. “Which may affect the way people continue to look at Greek Life, when in reality it’s not close to the way it’s portrayed in the show.”
With Halloween coming up, it seems like the perfect time to start watching this show. “I like that it came out now during the fall since it [evokes] that Halloween spooky feel to it,” said Michelle. “Halloween is one of my favorite holidays and I love watching horror things, especially when they have a comical side to it.”
You can watch “Scream Queens” on Fox every Tuesday at 9 p.m.

LIU Post will host several Gold Coast International Film Festival events through early November. A limited number of free tickets are offered to LIU students, who must R.S.V.P. to Festival Director Caroline Sorokoff at caroline@goldcoastarts.org to reserve them. Post-hosted events include a screening of the documentary film Landfill Harmonic on Saturday, Nov. 7, at 7:30 p.m., and “An Evening with Morgan Spurlock” (Supersize Me) on Monday, Nov. 9, at 7:30 p.m.
The Gold Coast Arts Center Gala is tonight, Oct. 28, at 8 p.m. in the Hillwood Recital Hall. The Gala will include a special screening of the Buster Keaton short film One Week with a live musical accompaniment, followed by an awards ceremony to honor actor Navid Nagahban (Homeland), Grammy-winning musician Vince Giordano (Boardwalk Empire) and director Patricia Riggen (upcoming The 33).
The screening of Landfill Harmonic on Nov. 7, is in collaboration with the Music Department who will be having an afternoon of workshops beforehand. This documentary film chronicles the story of a Paraguayan musical group whose use of instruments made out of garbage goes viral. They navigate the larger musical world while also enduring a natural disaster that strikes the country. In addition to LIU Post students, local high school students (through Tri-M societies) will be attending the event.
The highly acclaimed Spurlock will be giving an intimate conversation about the power of documentaries and his approach to filmmaking at the Nov. 9, event, which will include a screening of his new short film Crafted. A Q and A will be conducted with the audience.
“Our tagline is ‘everyone’s invited’ and we take that very seri- ously,” said Festival Director Sorokoff. “We offer films that appeal to the wide demographic that lives in our region — including families, seniors, young adults, parents looking for ‘date night’ films, music lovers, foreign film lovers, [and] documentary fans. Plus we screen films from countries with strong representation in our region.”
“The [Gold Coast Film] Festival was founded by The Gold Coast Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) multi arts organization that for the past 20 years has been dedicated to promoting and supporting the arts through education, exhibition, performance and outreach,” continued Sorokoff. “To fulfill that mission we have a School for the Arts, a free public art gallery, a monthly concert series, and arts-in-education outreach program and a long standing film screening program that for the past 20 years has screened previews of the best new independent and festival films for one night only, with each screening followed by a Q&A.”
Senior Film major Erica Weinz is an intern for the festival, work- ing closely with Sorokoff on promotion, outreach, research and other office responsibilities. The two were introduced by Professor Susan Zeig, film department head, who helped to co-ordinate the partnership between the college and festival. Weinz noted the unique learning experience provided by the internship.
“It’s quite different than being on a film set, I don’t get to see a camera ever,” explained Weinz. “The work they do feels a lot like producing. It’s coordinating, making arrangements, finding venues, finding audiences, catering, transportation, outreach, phone calls, e-mails, etcetera. Really, it’s beneficial for any filmmaker, so they could learn and understand what it takes to put on a Festival, but more importantly, its the same amount of work that goes into making any film a great one.”
Weinz spoke of the inherent collaborative qualities of the industry and how speaking to people is a wholly important aspect of outreach. “Film isn’t just an every man for himself business,” she said. “You have to work with others to get a project done and if one person gives an attitude or someone can’t compromise, nothing is going to get done. It’s cooperation, tactfulness, and kindness that is key to making films.”
The festival runs Nov. 9-15, with venues in Roslyn, Port Washington, Brookville, Manhasset and Great Neck. More information, including screening dates and events can be found at goldcoastfilmfestival.org.

“The Walking Dead” is based on the popular graphic novel series of the same name. The show follows a group of people as they attempt to survive in a post-apocalyptic world where the dead have come back to life. There are also various human threats that often prove to be more dangerous than the zombies, a.k.a. “walkers.”
This show is for viewers who like horror, drama, and zombies. However, viewers should be warned that the show is very violent and can be frightening at certain points. Those that scare easily, or hate the site of blood, should not watch it.
The second episode of the sixth season of “The Walking Dead,” “JSS” was one of its best and most terrifying, with hardly any walkers. In the season five finale, fan favorite character Morgan made his first appearance outside of a cameo since season three. He arrived in Alexandria, just in time to see Rick, a changed man, as he executed one of the towns-people in Alexandria. The fallout of this situation, with Rick and Morgan’s relationship, was touched upon in the premiere of season six on Oct. 11, but will have to wait a few more weeks for the rest of the plot to be revealed.
This was one of the few episodes that main characters Rick, Daryl, and Glenn made no appearance. Instead, other main and secondary characters were the focus. Without Rick and Daryl, the main focus was mostly on Carol and Morgan throughout the episode. The advancement of Carol’s character throughout the series has been one of the most fascinating aspects about “The Walking Dead.” In five seasons, Carol went from an abused wife to one of the most reliable and feared fighters in the group.
This episode centered on the attack and invasion of Alexandria by the Wolves, a cult-like group identified by extreme violence and the letter “W” carved into their foreheads. The Wolves were introduced last season and, in the finale, were portrayed as the next threat in the show.
Similar to last season, Carol once again proves why she is one of the best characters on the show. Once Alexandra was under attack, Carol was in full force as she took on several Wolves by herself and even impersonated one of them. This made for one of the best moments of the show as Carol, in full Wolf costume, came face-to-face with Morgan and revealed herself before taking on several attackers.
Throughout the attack, there was only one walker present, which made the assault by the Wolves more powerful. Morgan also had some interesting moments throughout the episode. Since returning to the show, Morgan has refused to kill another human being, allowing several Wolves to escape Alexandria towards the end of the episode. However, there was an ambiguous moment at the end where he possibly changed his philosophy by killing one of the Wolves.
The Wolves might be the most extreme group our survivors have come across, even topping the cannibalistic people of Terminus, who may have inadvertently created the Wolves by locking them up in a train car. However, the presence of the Wolves may soon signal the arrival of the Saviors and their leader Negan, who is the most dangerous villain in the graphic novel series. With the way season six is heading, viewers may witness this sociopath appear in the season six finale to reek havoc on our survivors.
New episodes of The Walking Dead air on Sunday nights at 9 p.m. on AMC.

Cinema is meant to be convincing, to draw you into the reality of the story, to hide away the fact that everything you’re seeing is an illusion. This effective deception is achieved through the filmmaker’s tools, one of the most critical being a believable set design and use of props, especially when a film is a period piece.
Back to the Future Day having just passed, I’m sure you’ve noticed the rampant corporate sponsorship involved. Nike is cashing in on “self-lacing” shoes that appeared in the film. Those classic movies themselves contain obvious product placement that weave into the set design. However, copyright isn’t always easy to come by, so filmmakers must use fake brands and products to fit into their created reality. Thankfully, there are already many faux products to choose from.
Ever see a character smoke a cigarette in a movie or TV show? Chances are they’re the brand Morley, a rip-off of Marlboro used as far back as in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” in 1960. Consider this: the universes of “Malcolm in the Middle,” “Mission Impossible,” “That 70s Show,” “The X-Files,” and “The World’s End,” are totally separate, the events within them isolated, except the continuity of a cigarette brand called Morley.
Since airlines would be quite angry if a show or movie depicted their planes involved in hijackings and crashes, the screen world has developed brands like Oceanic Airlines, in “Lost,” to fill in. Can’t get the rights to show Google? There’s always FinderSpyder, the fake search engine used in shows like “Breaking Bad” and “Dexter.”
Some filmmakers have developed their own trademark fake brands, perhaps in line with their meticulous, detail oriented vision. For example, Quentin Tarantino, known for his ultra-violent films like “Reservoir Dogs,” “Pulp Fiction,” and “Django Unchained,” has several times featured Big Kahuna Burger in his movies– Samuel L. Jackson famously describing how tasty one is after taking a bite. The popularity and the image of the burgers have led to real world restaurants featuring the name on their menus.
In an odd way, fictional brands have created their own sort of continuum that draws from the popular consumer items of a non-existent base universe. Seeing these products used so frequently in fiction, have developed their own legitimacy and familiarity. Next time you watch a movie or TV show, keep your eyes peeled for the fake brands used. You may have seen them before and not even realized it.

Senior forward Susanne Vistnes: 2 – Roberts Wesleyan College: 1. That was the story from the Pioneers matchup against Roberts Wesleyan on Friday, Oct. 23, in Brookville, N.Y.
Vistnes extended her program scoring record with a goal in the 17th minute, due in part to some fancy footwork. The scoring ceased for the rest of the half after that goal, but both teams combined for 12 shots. Late in the second half, LIU got called for a hand ball inside the box, which set up a penalty kick for Bella Mitrevski. The junior midfielder converted the shot and forced overtime.
In the first overtime session, neither team scored. Instead, there was a Vistnes sighting in the second overtime, as she received a cross from junior mid-fielder Katie Kingston and connected for the game-winning goal that lifted the Pioneers to victory by a score of 2-1.
They looked to carry the momentum from Friday’s victory into Saturday’s game against Daemen College. In that matchup, the Pioneers were the aggressors and it payed off. They outshot Daemen and also earned more corner kicks from their aggression.
They got their first tally in the 25th minute from Vistnes, but that was all the scoring for the first 45 minutes. With a 1-0 lead early in the second half, the Pioneers struck three times in just over ten minutes. Headers from Kingston and senior back Katie LaManna followed by a goal from freshman forward Andrea Huntzinger put the game out of reach and gave the Pioneers their 12th win of year. They are now unbeaten in their last six matches.
The team returns to the pitch this afternoon against Molloy College. Kickoff from Pioneer Country is set for 3 p.m.

The Pioneers wasted little time in dismantling Molloy College on Thursday, Oct. 22, as they handled them easily and won the match in straight sets, 3-0.
In a tightly contested first set, the Pioneers went on a 6-2 run late to grab a commanding lead and an eventual set win. The second set, much like the first one, was a back-and-forth affair, and similar to first set, the Pioneers put themselves in position to succeed. Tied at 21, a pair of unforced errors by Molloy coupled with kills from sophomore outside hitter Danielle Valenza and freshman outside hitter Rachel Londot, led to another set victory for the Pioneers.
The third set was all Green and Gold, as they cruised to their 18th victory of the season. Valenza, Londot, and freshman middle hitter Elise Strange all had nine kills apiece to lead the squad. The Pioneers serve up their next match on Saturday, Nov. 7, as they travel to Connecticut to square off against the University of Bridgeport. Game time is set for 7 p.m.

Keliann Margiotta is a senior who is double-majoring in speech pathology and audiology, with a minor in psychology. Margiotta hails from Sewell, N.J., and serves as a forward for the Field Hockey team as they look to get over the hump and win the NCAA Championship after coming extremely close the past two years. She is the leading goalscorer for the Pioneers with her seven tallies, and has three assists through ten games.
Q: As a senior, how do the younger players look up to you?
A: I know how to manage my time and I teach the younger girls how to hold themselves on the field, which builds their confidence and overall figure to hold themselves accountable for.
Q: What is the strongest part of your game?
A: My desire to never quit or give up on and off the field.
Q: How long have you been playing field hockey and what got you into it?
A: I’ve been playing for about nine years. My mom was an All-American, so I gave it a try and loved it.
Q: What are some of your accomplishments so far here at Post?
A: I won Northeast-10 player of the year last year. I’ve been an All-American and an Academic All-American in addition to setting the career and single-season assist record. I also hold the record for most goals in a season.
Q: If you had to play a different position, what would it be and why?
A: I would play center-midfield because it’s the all-around spy on the field. I’d get to work with others offensively and defensively, which is the biggest aspect role on the team.
Q: How do you think your team will fare in the NE-10?
A: As of right now, we need a clean sweep and just have to tweak some things that haven’t worked for us on the field and we’ll get to where we want to be.
Q: How can this team win the National Championship after coming close in previous years?
A: We know what it takes to get there, but we just need to figure out which way to turn at the end of the road.
Q: How can you guys improve moving forward?
A: We can improve by putting in extra time and effort. Coming together and playing as a cohesive unit is also key.
Q: What is your favorite part about playing field hockey?
A: My favorite part is the competitive aspect of the game and pushing myself for something that I love.
Q: What brought you to Post?
A: My major and the opportunity to play field hockey. Only three schools on the East Coast had both, Post being one of them.
Q: Do you have any plans after you graduate?
A: I’m going to graduate school for my audiology degree and research.
Q: Who is your favorite athlete?
A: My favorite athlete is Abby Wambach because she puts herself on the line and does everything she can to make her playing easier even though she’s older.

After a goal by senior forward Per Forgaard, the score looked to be 2-1 for the Pioneers going into the break, but junior forward Johann Kristjansson gave the Pioneers an even bigger lead when he scored just before the half. That lead though, evaporated early in the latter stanza as Roberts Wesleyan came out kicking and notched two goals in a span of five minutes to tie the match at three. Looking for an answer, Forgaard was able to find Ruiz who bent a shot just inside the right post for the game winner.
The Green Machine looked to carry the adrenaline from this game into their date with Daemen College on Sunday, Oct. 25, and did they ever. The Pioneers notched a season high eight goals and quadrupled Daemen on the scoreboard, winning 8-2. The team got two-goal performances from Ruiz, who continued his stellar play, sophomore midfielder Harry Pearse, and sophomore forward Toby Ilomuanya.
The Pioneers drew first blood in the 18th minute, but opened up the floodgates in the second half, as they scored six times in just 30 minutes.
LIU, now unbeaten since Sept. 12, will host Molloy College on Wednesday, Oct. 28, at noon.

Coming off their third straight one-goal victory, the Pioneers, led by sophomore defender Grace Ilias and her two goals, ousted Pace University by a score of 3-1 from Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium on Wednesday, Oct. 21. Ilias didn’t take long to get her team on the board as she scored in the fourth minute to break the scoreless tie. After another goal by Ilias in the 19th minute, it was senior forward Keliann Margiotta who gave the Pioneers the commanding 3-0 lead on a penalty stroke. The Pioneers did allow a late goal, but won the match by a score of 3-1.
After a few days off, it was a different team but the same result, as the Pioneers stayed in Brookville, N.Y. and welcomed American International College on Saturday, Oct. 24. They upended AIC by a score of 3-1, thanks to a two-goal effort from Margiotta. Protecting the net, junior goalkeeper Ericka Parks played back-to-back strong games allowing two total goals and putting her team in a good position to win. LIU returns to the field today in Massachusetts against Bentley University. Face-off is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Three years ago, while working nights, senior Accounting major, Anthony LoSardo came up with the idea, Bayside Brewery. Bayside Brewery’s philosophy is to start big and think even bigger. Their long-term goal is to launch New York’s largest craft beer opening. He mentioned how inventing his own strategies and recipes have contributed to developing this business.
Now, LoSardo’s student-run organization is beginning to blossom here at Post after being established in 2013. “Bayside Brewery is a business that will help us build financial success and make higher quality beer. Our market segment is called, ‘Better Beer’ because we are striving to develop a more quality beer with no forced carbonation, no GMO’s and no white cane sugar to speed up production,” said LoSardo.
The Brewery teamed up with the Biology department to help increase yeast fermentation. Bayside Brewery has united different departments of the school to help create and develop this business.
LoSardo pitched the idea of combining departments, which will serve as good real world experience for students. “We are working with the biology, dance, and film/audio departments so far. Our door is always open and we want ideas from everyone,” said LoSardo. Since most of this is derived from volunteer work along with no pay, students can gain experience and long-term growth in their specific industry.
Senior Management major Oscar Sekkelsten serves as the company’s director of public relations. He works on social media and on developing marketing strategies. “We want to help people grow personally by thinking and acting like an entrepreneur,” Sekkelsten said.
“Building integrity for the student body here at Post is very important.” In addition to running the Brewery’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, Sekkelsten also plans event coordinating and does a lot of networking with junior Marketing major Jason Rubenfield.
Rubenfield’s role is networking and he serves as the Marketing Director. “I’m from Massachusetts and ‘foreign’ from New York, but I’m good with social aspects, which is huge in marketing, especially in New York,” he said.
Rubenfield added four things that are going to help Bayside Brewery reach its potential. “We have a dynamic and motivated team and a staple unique product, which will help our business. In addition to that, our identifiable brand can be used in other states and our innovative technologies and inter-department sharing will help us grow and expand at an exponential rate,” Rubenfield added.
Now that the brand is receiving recognition, involved in social networking, establishing connections and relationships with others, Bayside Brewery looks to continue to build and grow moving forward. Senior Finance major Nick Butera is the director of finance for the Brewery. Butera is the President of the Finance club here at Post and oversees the student run businesses. “My role is preparing the financial investment scenarios and developing financial valuations,” he said.
Another one of the connections Bayside Brewery has already made is with the film department. Andrew Morales, a senior Film major, got involved with this business through Rubenfield. Morales works with fellow senior Film major Ryan DiBiase, for Shutter Sound Pictures Company, which is another student-run business. Morales will be creating a kick-starter video and photo content for the Brewery. “I look forward to getting involved with Bayside Brewery and helping them succeed,” said Morales.
Some students shared their opinions about Bayside Brewery and how it can affect the student body. “I think it can serve as an inspiration to students that want to start their own company,” said senior Accounting major Greg Mannix.
“Bayside Brewery proves that students from LIU have the ability to start their own business and have the help of the school faculty and students while doing so,” Mannix added. Another student also shared similar thoughts. “I think this business will show students that you should pursue your ideas no matter what stands in your way or the obstacles you may face,” said undeclared sophomore, James Montefusco.
Although these students have only been part of Bayside Brewery for a little over a month, they are extremely excited about the direction the Brewery is headed toward. Bayside Brewery has support from the deans on campus and they are a very dedicated and hard-working group of students. LoSardo and his colleagues now look to strengthen their business and gather more resources. LoSardo concluded, “We have the right group of students with strong work ethics and we have the motivation to do really well.”

It has been three years since Super Storm Sandy ravaged America’s eastern seaboard. In terms of force, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia were hit hardest by the storm. Sandy made landfall in the Carolinas when she was bordering category three status. However, these states were prepared for Sandy, since they had been hit by hurricanes before. The tristate area, including New York, was not prepared.
Sandy shut off the power on LIU Post’s campus for three days. “We didn’t know when we’d have power again,” said Christina Scorazzi, a senior Broadcasting major, who was living on campus at the time. “It was my freshman year and it was just my first semester. Campus was in disarray; it was chaotic and whoever was on campus for the storm was in full out panic mode. People were out all hours of the night after the storm; it was crazy here.”
Post’s buildings didn’t regain power until the third day. There were issues with the auxiliary power generators, but by that day, students who lived on campus were told to go home. For approximately two weeks, campus was closed for cleanup and minor repairs.
“We all remember the images of Staten Island,” said Lisa Goodwell, a senior Chemistry major, who commuted to Post at the time. “In my home town of Whitestone (Queens), which is right off the water, the storm surge swamped most our beaches, and even some houses off the water.”
“A lot of us couldn’t even get to campus during the storm; even a few days after, you couldn’t even make the commute,” said Beth Funfgeld, Facility Service Response Coordinator at LIU Post. Funfgeld said, “Luckily, we suffered no real damage to our infrastructure, but trees were everywhere, that and wind really knocked out our power.” As Funfgeld recalled, there were no calls for assistance from students living on campus. “They actually conducted themselves well; they made the situation better, much easier for that matter; which was great because on the home front, my house of 25 years was lost to the storm.”
Funfgeld has since moved on, and Post has moved on as well. However, Funfgeld believes Post can withstand another super storm, “It was our first time being hit by a storm like that, a mega storm, but
I think we would handle a super storm like Sandy much better [if one such as Sandy were to hit again]. For example, we’ve added better water pumps, much better reserve power generators, and we are confident in our Public Safety team. We’ll be much more efficient, not just because we’re better equipped, but because we dealt with one before.”
Representatives from the Office of Public Safety would not comment about Post’s preparedness for another storm.

On Thursday, Oct. 29, the promise office is hosting a bookjobs.com and Association of American Publishers event during common hour in the Student Incubator in the Library.
Representatives from the company will be sharing a presentation with students regarding the careers available, including publishing, marketing, editing, accounting, art/design, finance, publicity, advertising, sales, and IT.
“Students do not always realize the career opportunities available to them and we want to bring awareness to the industry,” said Ali DiBona, senior associate director of LIU Promise.
DiBona hopes that students understand the many facets of the industry by attending the event, and pushes for possible career opportunities within publishing. “[We] want students to know how to get their foot in the door at big publishing companies such as Random House, Penguin Books, Pearson, McGraw Hill, HarperCollins.”

Midnight Madness is a free event for all students to come out and support the men’s and women’s Post basketball teams as they start the season.
Midnight Madness is a night filled with prizes and spirit. Students will have the opportunity to participate in various basketball themed contests to win more than $10,000 in prizes. The prizes include 50” smart TVs, a Skywalker Board, Go Pro Bundle, $1,000 in cash prizes and much more.
“I’m super excited for Midnight Madness,” said Kylie Garrett, a junior Broadcasting major. “I love how it gets the teams and students amped up for the new season.”
“Midnight Madness is a great event that kicks off our season and brings the school together. It gets our team pumped for the upcoming year,” said Greg Dotson, a junior Business major and team member of the men’s basketball team.
As reported by Kahleel Bragg, for The Pioneer on Nov. 5, 2014, last year’s Midnight Madness event “was a huge success containing nearly a thousand post students in the gym. The energy was electric throughout the whole night and really illustrated post pride for the basketball teams.”
Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, said, “We are expecting a record turnout of over 1,000 students.”
Berthel added, “Last year, Midnight Madness was the most spirited, fun, and well attended event of the year and I am confident that this year will be even better.”
Senior Business major Nyasia Davis said, “I am very excited about Midnight Madness. Last year was a hit and this year there are so many more amazing prizes; it’s going to be fun!”

The University’s Children’s Institute for Play Therapy and Research (CIPTAR) will host its first annual Play Therapy Workshop on Friday, Nov. 13. The workshop will analyze therapeutic play methods for children exposed to trauma using psychological and clinical exercises.
CIPTAR was founded this past summer by Dr. Geoff Goodman, an associate professor in the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program. The Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program disciplines students who want to practice as clinical psychologists with a concentration in serious mental illnesses, dialectical behavior therapy, and interventions with high-risk families, and substance use disorders.
Dr. Goodman explained that as a clinical child psychologist, he has always been interested in using play therapy techniques to work with children experiencing emotional problems. He wanted students who are also interested in the subject to participate in a real-life practicum, and therefore, has invited health professionals and students alike to join the workshop. “Just as adults use words, children use play to communicate. When developmentally appropriate, mental health professionals therapeutically use play to help clients, especially children, to communicate, resolve their problems, and obtain optimal mental health,” Goodman said.
The Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program, as of this past summer, has been approved to offer the coursework required for the registered play therapist credential. It has been licensed by the Association for Play Therapy, an organization of mental health professionals that applies the therapeutic power of play to communicate with and treat clients, particularly children. The two courses associated with the workshop, Introduction to Play Therapy and Advanced Integrative Play Therapy, are offered for the clinical psych doctoral students during summer sessions.
According to Dr. Goodman, the workshop is designed to provide mental health professionals and students with an introduction to two well-known play therapy treatment models in literature: psychodynamic play therapy and cognitive-behavioral play therapy. “The techniques related to these models will be presented and illustrated with cases of child patients who have been exposed to traumatic situations. The attendees will learn this material through lecture, videos, discussion, paired and small-group role-play and other activities,” said Dr. Goodman.
If this first play therapy workshop is successful, there will be additional play therapy events in the future. However, students must demonstrate an interest in this workshop if they want more play therapy events scheduled. The workshop is open to all students interested in the field of clinical psychology. The registration fee is $80 for undergraduate students, and $160 for mental health professionals.
The Nov. 13 workshop will take place in the Patron’s Lounge, Tilles Center, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Students interested in the workshop must register by Nov. 6. Students can contact Dr. Geoff Goodman at Geoffrey.Goodman@liu.edu for a registration form and additional information.

Dr. Bob Brier has been to Egypt over 100 times, however, mentioning his next trip still fills him with excitement. Dr. Brier is the school’s resident mummy expert, who spent decades studying the field of ancient Egypt.
Dr. Brier, a Senior Research Fellow, which basically means he no longer teaches, but writes and does research, is returning to Egypt in November to follow up on his theory that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built with an internal ramp that is still inside. He plans to do this by asking permission from local authorities, upon his arrival, and plans to bring equipment in with him, such as an infra-red camera or ground penetrating radar to verify his theory. This theory was also the subject in his book, “The Secret of the Great Pyramid,” in 2009.
In addition to conducting “The Great Pyramid” research, Dr. Brier will be leading a 14-day tour of Egypt to the general public who is interested. The tour consists of a slow, detailed walk-through of The Great Pyramid, cocktails with working archaeologists, and a tour of the library at the Chicago House, a major center for Egyptian Studies, according to Farhorizons.com. The tour costs just under $13,000.
The trips Dr. Brier used to take his students on were far more cost efficient. “We used to do it very inexpensively for the students. We would get to go to Egypt for about two and a half weeks for $3, 000,” said Dr. Brier. The first trip was in the 1970s and he conducted trips all the way into the 1990s. The main reason he stopped facilitating these trips was because of his involvement in TV documentaries such as the host of “The Great Egyptians,” the subject of “Mummy Detective,” and narrator of “Unwrapped: The Mysterious World of Mummies,” which are all productions for The Learning Channel
Although he is not currently teaching, Dr. Brier continues to conduct research and write books as a member of the faculty on behalf of the school. He has been at Post for over 40 years, and recently stopped teaching two to three years ago. He has taught seminars about mummies, how to read and write hieroglyphs, and ancient Egyptian philosophy.
Dr. Brier’s last book, “Egyptomania: Our Three Thousand Year Obsession with the Land of the Pharaohs,” explored our culture’s infatuation with Egypt. “Then, I discovered it fascinates everybody. People are more interested in Egypt than any other ancient civilization,” said Brier.
Although Dr. Brier is at the end of his teaching career, he still has thoughts about a future for Egyptology at Post.
“I think an undergraduate program in Egyptology could bring thousands of students from all over the country,” Brier said. This is significant because there are a few graduate Egyptology programs in the U.S., but only seven undergraduate programs according to, Egyptianemporim.com.
