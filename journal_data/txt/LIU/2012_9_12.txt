The Hillwood Commons Café reopened on September 5th, after being renovated over the summer, to show off an updated design. It was expanded by 1,000 square feet and it features a center island and a pathway that is expected to help students access the different food stations easily. LIU Post announced the change via Facebook at the end of the spring 2012 semester. The café has not undergone a renovation such as this one since the 1970s.
Dana Weiss, the Senior Assistant Provost for Budget Management and Auxiliary Services, stated that the cost for these renovations was approximately 1.5 million dollars. According to Weiss, “This investment was made by Aramark Dining Services to enhance the customer experience and provide expanded food options. This is part of the ongoing renovations to update and enhance Hillwood Commons.” However, she also confirmed that this renovation will not affect the tuition dollars or food pricing.
Hillwood Commons Café also upgraded its food services. Topio’s, the new Italian station now offers a variety of sauces, including a new organic sauce for pizza, along with calzones and other Italian specialties that were previously served.
Another change is the sushi station, which has moved from the back of the Café, to the front of the center island. Additionally, it now offers hot entrees as well as a sushi selection. The Produce Patch salad station is also in the center, right behind the sushi station. Grab n’ Go selection is now offering a wider range of food for the students that are on-the-go and it is located at the back of the Café.
The Grill and Topio’s now have digital menu boards that make ordering much easier and make the space appear much more modernized. “I saw what it looked like before, during Orientation,” said Tom Hauptner, a freshman Acting major, “now it looks a lot cooler.” With foot traffic in mind, more registers have been added to reduce the wait time and line dividers have been installed for crowd control.
Hillwood Café is also home to the new “F’real Blending Bar”, a smoothie and shake machine that has been receiving a lot of attention. “It tastes amazing,” said senior Sociology major, Samantha McNamara. “This machine makes the process of waiting for the smoothie entertaining.” Students, according to Shawn Carvajal, director of campus dinning services, provided by Aramark said, students have been asking for something like this for years. “They’ve finally figured out the technology to get them,” he added.
There are also digital boards located outside of Hillwood Café that serve as a place for information—updating students on campus events, hours of operation, and the special of the day. Hillwood Commons Café is open Monday through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Friday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.

LIU Post welcomed the class of 2016! There is a diverse group of new students from New York, out of state and countries all over the world. They all have one thing in common; they are all freshmen. There are 950 freshmen students this semester said Rita Langdon, the Associate Provost and Director of Public Relations. This is an increase of 41 students from last year said Langdon. 
Forty six of the freshmen have a parent or grandparent who attended LIU, states Dr. Reginald Ross, Associate Provost and Dean of Admissions. Twenty eight of the freshmen have a sibling at LIU Post that is either a cur¬rent student or already graduated, said Ross. Joe Alvarez, a freshman Music major, said that he picked LIU Post because he liked the Music program and his sister is a senior who is studying Journalism here. 
These students are furthering their education and experiencing life on their own. Marie Lisa Alessia, a freshman who has not yet decided upon a major, is nervous because this is the first time she has lived away from home. Some freshmen have feelings of worry and excitement no matter where they are from. Alessia said Post is the perfect distance from her home in the Bronx, about 30 minutes. Many freshmen are anxious and nervous about starting a new chapter in their lives. “I hope I make new friends and have good experiences here,” said Alessia. 
Several students are eager to be a part of LIU Post and experience college life. “LIU Post was my first choice; I wanted to come here since my junior year of high school,” said Alessia. She said she wants to take core classes now while she is undecided on a major. Lang¬don stated that the most popular majors of this freshman class are Criminal Justice, Psychology, Education and Business. Another student who is excited to be starting at LIU Post is Alvarez, who said he is already getting involved on campus. “I expect a good education and memories that I can have for the rest of my life, good ones not bad ones,” said Alvarez. 
There are 400 freshmen who are com¬muting, said Ross and there are 550 freshmen living on campus, stated Jessica Hayes, Associate Provost for International Student Services and Community Development. Some students feel that they need to live on campus to get the full college experience. 
“My mom wanted me to commute but I always wanted to dorm,” said Yihua Xuan, a freshman IT Management major from Bayside, New York. Xuan said the beautiful campus made LIU Post stand out from other universities. She said she is half nervous and half excited. “I am looking forward to the campus events and a great college life,” Xuan said. 
Xuan lives in Suffolk Hall with room¬mate Jessica Wong, a freshman Pharmacy major from Carmel, New York. The roommates talked to each other through email before living together. “I’m nervous about my classes, meeting people and how people see me,” said Wong. She said she thinks that showering close to others in the communal bathrooms in her dorm building will be awkward. Wong said she is also nervous about getting sick since she is around many people inside a dorm building. 
Ross said that there are freshmen students from 24 states and there are 94 fresh¬men from outside of New York. He said that there are freshmen students from California, Georgia, Hawaii, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Is¬lands, among many other states. Dr. Ross said that there are many freshmen from the New York and Connecticut area. 
“LIU was the best University in New York that accepted me,” said Jakob Carter, a freshman Theatre major. Carter is from South Carolina and wanted to study theatre in New York. He lives in Riggs Hall and moved in before his roommate. Carter attended the Ice Social Event on campus, which was held the night of freshmen move in day on September 5th, which helped me make new friendships. 
There are 100 international freshmen this semester from 26 countries, Hayes stated. Hayes said there are freshmen students from Austria, Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Canada, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, Great Britain, Greece, Haiti, Iceland, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Nigeria, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
LIU Post has a wonderful, big campus and a lot of international students,” said Teresa Ndong, a freshman International Business major. Before attending LIU Post, she visited the campus and liked what she saw. Ndong is an international student from Equatorial Guinea. She lived in New York with her family for a year before attending LIU Post and applied to different universities in the U.S. “I want to make American friends and have a normal college experience,” said Ndong. She says she gets along with her American roommate and lives in Queens Hall. 
Ndong attended school in Madrid with Ignacio Alda, also a freshman International Busi¬ness major. “Ndong recommended LIU Post to me and I trusted my friend’s judgment,” said Alda. He said even though he has lived away from home before, he is nervous about starting at LIU Post. Alda wants to make a lot of friends from all different places. 
The class of 2016 consists of a broad range of students from all over the world. Nervousness is a common emotion this week but all the students are excited to embark on this new journey. The class of 2016 will be formally welcomed into the LIU Post community at the Convocation on September 19th at 12:30 p.m. in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts. The Division for Student Success and the Provost’s Office are hosting the event. Good luck freshmen!

Fall means back to school, and for many LIU Post students it also means new technology – as the university offers the Apple iPad to all new undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at least a half time basis. 
The iPad tablet is lightweight, and easy to use. By downloading a variety of applications you can make it almost whatever you want; it could be a game, a social media tool, a music player, and a school notebook – all in one. 
“I use it for everything,” said junior Public Relations major, Helene Bettina Pedersen. “I use it as a notebook in class, I listen to music on it when I’m at home, I read newspapers on it, and use social media. I even read books on it.” Pedersen uses different applications for different purposes, and finds the music search engine Spotify to be her favorite. She also enjoys using iBooks, which is a service where you can download and read all kinds of books whenever you want. 
Sophomore Nutrition major, Aurora Kronberg, uses her iPad to keep in touch with friends and family through Facebook, play games, and stay updated with the news through online papers. “I like my iPad because I always have entertainment that is easily accessible,” she said. 
With the jungle of applications it can be hard to navigate. Here are some applications that can be useful to college students: 
Dictionary.com – Usable in every Writing Across the Curriculum course, as word definitions can be easily looked up, and synonyms are provided to create a colorful language. The application is free. 
Things – With busy schedules, this application makes it easier to keep track of all important tasks in an organized way. Whether it’s a gym appointment, an internship, or a paper due, you can find it on your iPad checklist. It has been featured as an Editor’s Choice in over 25 countries and has received good reviews. The price is a around 12 dollars. 
Dragon Dictation – For the lazy ones tired of writing on the iPad with no keyboard – this is an easy-to-use voice recognition application allowing you to dictate messages showing up on your ipad. That’s an easy way to send e-mails. The application is free. 
Kindle – If you are interested in getting your textbooks online, this free application will turn your ipad into the perfect reading device. More than 1,000,000 books are available in the Kindle Store, along with hundreds of newspapers and magazines. 
iSource MLA/APA – Bibliography writing can be hard, but this application helps you keep track of sources and quotes, and will for¬mat your bibliography and in-text citations easily. The application is less than five dollars. 
Viber – Keep in touch with friends and family with this free application that can be used for both text messages and calls. The over 90 million Viber users communicate for free worldwide, as long as they have internet connection. 
Download these helpful applications and suddenly you find your iPad to be a little bit smarter. For more application ideas, visit www.appadvice.com where you’ll find reviews, application lists, and application guides.

The LIU-Post Pioneers women’s lacrosse team capped off a successful 2012 season by defeating West Chester University of Pennsylvania 17-16 in the National Championship game. 
Under head coach Meghan McNamara, the Pioneers finished off the regular season with a 14-3 record. During the Championships, the Pioneers defeated Adelphi at Hickox Field by a score of 14-11. From there, the Pioneers traveled down to Louisville, Kentucky and beat LeMoyne College 15-10 to advance into the finals. In the National Championship Game, the Pioneers won a nail-biter 17-16 in a game where the Pioneers started off quickly, but managed to hold off West Chester for the title. 
It was the program’s third Division II National Championship. LIU Post is one of only two Division II schools to have won at least three national championships. The Pioneers last championship occurred in 2007 under then head coach Karen MaCrate Henning. Ironically all three national title victories have come against West Chester. 
During the off-season, several members of the Pioneers were honored with nominations to All-American teams and All-star teams, along with receiving several awards. 
Jackie Sileo, now a junior, was named national player of the year by the IWLCA and was named to the All-American First Team. She was also named Attacker of the Year by Synapse Sports. Since arriving at LIU-Post, Sileo has been one of the Pioneers most potent scorers. She set an LIU Post single-season record with 45 goals and 96 assists during 2012. She also set an NCAA Championship record for points in the tournament, with 17, and points in a championship game, with nine. Sileo also received ECC Player of the Year honors. 
In addition, Pioneers junior goalie Dominique Mosca was named National Player of the Year by the IWLCA and made the All-American First team. Mosca was ranked in the top-10 in goals-against average and save percentage, and was ECC Goalkeeper of the Year. 
Senior midfielders Chelsea Donaldson and Lauren Spagnoletta, as well as junior attacker Ashley Olen were also named by the IWLCA to All-American First team. 
Additionally, Donaldson was named as a National Player of the Year and selected to play in the North-South Senior All-Star Game, along with Spagnoletta and senior midfielder Nan Mayott.
On July 23rd, the New York Mets honored the Pioneers during a pregame ceremony at Citi Field. The team had the chance to stand on the field and be featured on the Diamond Vision video board. 
LIU-Post also honored the team at halftime during Saturday’s season opening football game against Clarion University. Prior to that, the team received their National Championship rings at a morning breakfast.

26 sports. 205 countries represented. 313 Gold Medals. 17,000 athletes. 150,000 condoms. Don’t worry, I will explain that last one later. Throughout the 2012 Olympics in London, England, there seemed to be a new storyline that unfolded each day. Whether it was Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte, the Fierce Five women’s gymnastics team led by Gabby Douglas and Aly Raisman, the beach volleyball Dynamic Duo of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, the dominance of USA basketball, or even a badminton scandal; there were so many reasons to be glued to the TV during these Olympics. In fact, NBC said that the 2012 Games were the most-watched United States TV event in history, with a total of 219.4 million people viewing at least part of the coverage proving that whether you follow sports or not, you probably became immersed in the Olympics. 
Let’s dive right into one of the biggest initial headlines as the Olympics started which was Michael Phelps not winning a medal in his first race! Many speculated that Phelps possibly did not come to the 2012 Games fully prepared after seeing him finish in fourth place in the 400-meter individual medley. Some thought that fellow American Ryan Lochte would overtake Phelps as the face of U.S. swimming during this Olympics, but four gold and two silver medals later, Phelps made sure he remained number one. As the Olympics concluded Phelps retired, and when he did so, he left with an Olympic record for most career gold medals with 18 during his illustrious career. And here’s more good news: America may have found a new star for the next Olympic Games replacing Phelps. Seventeen-year-old Missy Franklin became a hit as the soon to be senior in high school destroyed her competition capturing four gold medals in London. 
Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Jordyn Weiber and Kyla Ross, also known as the Fierce Five, made up the U.S. women’s gymnastics team that took home the first gold since the 1996 Olympics held in Atlanta. Douglas, a 16-year-old from Virginia, made history when she became the first African American to win gold in her individual all-around. Raisman, the captain and oldest of the five gymnasts, added a gold medal in the floor exercise and a bronze on the balance beam. Maroney notched a silver medal in the vault. 
To the beach we go! Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, better known as the Dynamic Duo in beach volleyball, played in the Olympics for the final time together as a team. Walsh Jennings announced that she also will be retiring and will not participate in the 2016 Games. But in London, the Duo went out on top winning their third consecutive gold medal and 21st consecutive match as they won in the finals against American counterparts April Ross and Jennifer Kessy 21-16, 21-16. 
It is just unfair when a team can win by 83 points…in a basketball game! That is exactly what the happened to the Nigerian team when it played the United States Men’s Basketball team on day 6 of the Olympics. U.S.A. annihilated the Nigerian team, winning 156-73. From day 1, the U.S.A. men’s basketball team was the clear-cut favorite to bring home the gold, and anything less would be considered a major disappointment. The team, led by Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, USA defeated Spain 107-100 in the finals and defended its title to win gold. This year’s team drew comparisons to the 1992 Dream Team that featured a roster of NBA legends such as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen and Patrick Ewing. Another interesting parallel drawn after the Olympics was how similar Michael Jordan’s 1992 season and LeBron James’ season this past year were were. Interestingly enough, both superstars won the NBA MVP Award, an NBA Champion-ship, NBA Finals MVP, and an Olympic Gold Medal during the same season. 
What Olympics would be complete without something scandalous going on…in badminton? There were eight doubles players caught in this scheme by the Badminton World Federation. The players, highlighted by the world doubles champions Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang of China, purposely threw games to gain a more favorable position in the next round of the tournament. What a disgrace! Yu was emotional after finding out he was disqualified from the Olympics and went on Twitter to say: “This is my last game. Farewell Badminton World Federation. Farewell my dear badminton.”
Oh wait. Those 150,000 condoms. What was the deal with those? A highly publicized story during the Olympics was a report that said that each athlete was given 15 condoms during the 17 day stretch of the Games. Hope Solo, goalie of USA women’s soccer team, told ESPN, “There’s a lot of sex going on.” Hope even said that in more extreme cases she has witnessed some athletes having sex “right out in the open” in the Olympic Village. Solo said, “On the grass, between buildings, people are getting down and dirty.” That is a behind-the-scenes look that most people probably were not expecting to hear about…
there is no way I could discuss every major star, story or sports occurred during the London Games. The U.S. dominated its competitors garnering the most total medals s104) and most gold medals (46) than any other country. Sprinter Usain Bolt from Jamaica continued to shatter records in an almost casual, nonchalant manner. USA women’s soccer team won its second consecutive gold medal defeating Japan 2-1. Serena Williams won the third Olympic gold medal of her career by defeating Maria Sharapova 6-0, 6-1 in women’s tennis singles. the USA women’s basketball team won its fifth straight gold medal defeating France in a blowout by 36 points. 
For whatever reason you tuned into the Olympics, you were surely not let down be¬cause these are some of the most athletic people in the world. There was a new store each day And a new player that would steal your heart. But most of all, there was pride. You rooted for your country, which helped bring us closer together.

To the demise of all students the summer has come to an end and with it all, or most, of the summer romances. It’s hard not to succumb to the temptations of a summer fling. The parties, the beach, backyard barbeques, theinnate feeling of adventure; they all lead to the inevitable and over¬whelming feelings of love, or at the very least lust. 
But, as cliché as it is, all good things must come to an end. Sorry to all of you lovebirds who think your long distance relationships are actually going to work. Our fates our inescapable, we go back to school. Mix those full-time class schedules with a part-time work schedule, don’t forget to add in time for homework, studying, and who knows what other projects your professors are going to throw at you. You still think you’re going to fit in time to travel to see your new beau? 
I only have a small word of advice for you: Godspeed. Summer romances are called summer romances for a reason… they are only supposed to last that one season. Of course there may be a few exceptions to this general rule. There is that one in a million chance that you meet someone truly special whom you are supposed to be with. However, I believe that nine times out of ten these flings should be left behind in the billowy memories of the summer months. 
Trying to make it work long distance with someone has serious potential to leave both parties broken and wounded. No one likes a broken heart so why willingly put yourself through something like that? I can’t come up with one good reason. 
For the people who are smart enough to know when to say when, it’s time to start over. Go back to school, go out and meet new people; or just go out and enjoy yourself. The best relationships happen when you’re not looking for them.

I hope LIU Post students and staff en¬joyed the summer off and had the time to go to some fun places, eat new foods, see some great movies, and experience interesting things. So why not get published and write up a brief review about what you did for the Pioneer? 
We are asking you, our readers, to get involved in our weekly publication. If you are interested in writing and publishing reviews, please email your ideas to paul.kalis@my.liu.edu for consideration. I check this email account daily, so you can expect a prompt response. 
Students don’t have to be Journalism or Media Arts majors to write about a passion. An Art major could review the latest exhibit at a local museum, while a Physical Education major gives his or her input on new training techniques. A Music major can review the lat-est concert he or she attended. Excel in your field of study by writing a relevant piece, put-ting your knowledge to the test. Become our expert consultant, and share your ideas with others. Submit pieces weekly and create your own subsection in the Reviews section. Don’t feel like you can’t write about a particular subject just because someone else is. 
Let’s make this year’s reviews section the best it can be. Any new ideas for what we can review? Do you have a friend who is trying to make it in the entertainment industry? Writing reviews for class on a presentation or lecture? Submit them for publication. Review submissions are due to Paul.kalis@my.liu.edu on Saturdays at 5:00 pm for publication the following Wednesday.

You would never expect to find an enormous park right smack in the middle of Brooklyn. Not only is the park 585 acres, but there is also a 60-acre lake, Brooklyn’s only forest, and a zoo. This past Sunday afternoon a few friends and I walked to Prospect Park and went to the zoo, which is located off of Flatbush Avenue. 
For $8 (General Admission) we were able to see over 125 species of wild animals ranging from common farm animals to baboons, dingoes, and wallabies. Although this zoo is not as large as the Bronx Zoo, it is well worth the $8 you pay to get in. We happened to get there at just the right time as the sea lions (located in the center of the zoo) were being fed and giving quite the performance. 
The zoo is open from 10 a.m. to between 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., depending on the season. For children from ages 3-12 admission is $5 and $6 for senior citizens. This zoo is family friendly with numerous attractions for smaller children. 
Prospect Park has a number of different things to do. It’s filled with bicycle and walker paths, wide open fields, and volleyball courts. You can even go pedal boating on the man-made lake. If you are looking for a fun and pocket friendly afternoon in Brooklyn, Prospect Park is definitely a great place to go. You can either pack a lunch or walk a few blocks and find just about any type of food you want!

When the LIU Post football team defeated Clarion on Saturday, it won its opening game of the season for the first time since 200n. Head Coach Bryan Collins admitted that over the last few years the Pioneers have struggled out of the gate in the first month of the season, but the team has still managed to finish with winning records for the last past three years. However, you would have no idea about the past slow starts after the performance the Pioneers displayed. 
The Pioneers annihilated the Golden Eagles (1-1) by a score of 46-26, but the score does not truly indicate the complete dominance by the green and gold. At the end of the half, the Pioneers led 39-8 and had forced Clarion’s junior quarterback, Ben Fiscus, to throw three interceptions and lose a fumble.
Many coaches in football believe that to be successful your team must win the turnover battle. The Pioneers not only won the turnover battle, they put on a clinic of how to protect the ball on offense, as well as force mistakes and turnovers on defense. The offense led by sophomore quarter¬back, Steven Laurino, amounted to 375 total yards, and more importantly, no turnovers. at times it seemed as if the Pioneers had an extra five players on the field because Clarion coughed up the ball four times, and Fiscus threw for three interceptions. There was constant pressure in the backfield caused be sophomore defensive lineman, Joseph Thompson, (two sacks), as well as junior linebacker, Rob Bright, (six tackles and an interception). 
On the first play, following a fumble recovery by freshman linebacker, Brandon Cheney, the Pioneers put its first points on the board as Laurino fired a 49 yard touch¬down strike to senior wide receiver Ryan Derham. The Golden Eagles tried to answer back, but senior line¬backer Anton Rukaj picked off Fiscus to give the Pioneers the ball again. Fresh¬man tight end Sean Binckes was the beneficiary of the next offensive possession, catching a 10 yard touchdown giving LIU Post a 12-0 lead. 
The common theme was that after each mistake by the Golden Eagles, the Pioneers took advantage and put points on the board. The trend continued when junior linebacker, Chris DiIorio, jumped in the passing lane of Fiscus for yet another interception. The Pioneers added to their points off turnovers, as Laurino scampered into the end zone for a 17 yard touchdown to make it 18-0. 
Despite being down 18-0, the Golden Eagles drove down the field and scored an adventurous touchdown by sophomore running back, Bobby Thomas. From two yards out, Thomas lost the ball as he was about to cross the goal-line, but he recovered it in the endzone for the touchdown. After a successful two point conversion, the score was 18-8 in favor of the Pioneers. 
The Pioneers would respond and catch a break with a serendipitous bounce that would turn out to be a turning point in the game. After Laurino scrambled for a first down, he lost the ball, but luckily for the Pioneers seniordtight end Pat Fitzgerald happened to be in the right place at the right time and returned the ball 59 yards for a touchdown for the Pioneers. Even when the Pioneers made a mistake, a touchdown ended up being the net result. 
There was not much action to speak of in the second half. The Golden Eagles did outscore the Pioneers 18-7 in the final 30 minutes of play, but it simply did not matter since the Pioneers led by 31 points after the first half. 
For the Pioneers, Laurino completed five of his ten passes for 90 yards and three touch¬downs. On the ground Laurino rushed the ball 18 times for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Junior running back Jeff Mack had 16 carries for 93 yards and one touchdown. On defense, senior defensive back Antonio Powell- Fields led the team with 12 total tackles. Powell-Fields also made a contribution on special teams recovering an onside-kick. 
The 46 points the Pioneers scored was the most points by the team since 2010 when they put up 63 points against Cheyney University. Ironically enough, the Pioneers opponent in Week 2 are the Cheyney Wolves (1-0). The Pioneers have breezed through the Wolves in their last four meetings as the Pioneers have averaged scoring 48 points per game and won by an average 34 points per game. The Pioneers will travel on the road for their next game Saturday, September 15th, against Cheyney. Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org to hear all the cover¬age for the game. Pregame starts at 12:30 p.m. and kickoff is scheduled for 1:00 p.m.
