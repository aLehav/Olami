Ali DiBona, the Senior Associate Director of LIU Promise, reached out to The Pioneer recently to clarify that the Promise program, which was established on campus just last fall, is now offering career services to students. The LIU Promise office is located on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, room 270.
The new initiative, called Career Success, is replacing the Office of Career Services that was formerly located on the second floor of Kumble Hall. Career Success offers the same services as that of Career Services; the LIU Promise coaches work one-on-one with students to find them the right internships, as well as launch students’ career paths by connecting them with employers before graduation.
“We have an upcoming workshop series that will be great for students,” DiBona said. The series is called “How I Met My Career,” and consists of three seminars that focus on how to land an internship, make your résumé stand out to employers, and how to ace your interview. The string of lectures is based off the popular television sitcom “How I Met Your Mother.”
“Challenged Accepted,” which will teach students how to find the right internship, will take place on Oct. 13, 20, and 28. The “Legendary” workshop offers tips and tricks on how to perfect your résumé, and make you a standout amongst other job candidates; the seminar takes place on Oct. 14, 21, and 29. The last seminar, “Suit Up” will give students a crash course in acing a job interview, and takes place on Oct. 15, 22, and 30. All seminars will be held in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, room 386, from 1 p.m. to 1:50 p.m.
For more information about Career Success, please call (516) 299-3737, or email Post- careersuccess@liu.edu.

BASIC College Ministries is holding its second annual debate on Nov. 19 in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall, on whether or not God exists. The club, which is a part of a national network and became an official chapter on campus in Spring 2014, aims to “serve and equip local churches to effectively reach and discipline students through vibrant college ministries,” according to its official website.
“There are about 30 colleges in New York State with official chapters,” said Amal Zeidan, a first year Nutrition graduate student and president of the club. She’s optimistic about the event, and is currently looking for more debaters. “We have two theists and one confirmed atheist. I’d like two more atheists and one more theist.” Approximately 400 people attended the debate last year, and Zeidan hopes this year’s debate will be equally successful.
Adam Hornbuckle, a freshman Political Science major, is not involved with BASIC, but is one of the students that will participate in the debate. It will be his first debate with BASIC.
“I’m on the atheist side of the debate,” Hornbuckle said.
He reached out to Zeidan and confirmed his involvement after seeing a BASIC Facebook post regarding the debate.
To prepare, Hornbuckle said that he would be “studying atheist debate tactics/points. Watching famous atheist debaters [like] Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Lawrence Krauss, and Sam Harris. It’s a topic I feel very strongly about,” he said.
“The goal for the event is to bring together people with different interests and talk about their worldviews and what they believe,” Zeidan said. The club aims to host a debate every year, which is open to everyone on campus. “We try to select students who have been in debates but are not fully ‘developed,’ we want keep the door open to people who have never debated, and show that you don’t have to be a professional speaker to show your view.”
The debate itself consists of 10 minutes of introduction for each side; both sides have three students each. Five questions are then posed to either side, for which they will have five to seven minutes to answer.
The five questions will be:
1. Origin:   Where did we come from?
2. Identity:   Who are we?
3. Meaning:   Why are we here?
4. Morality:   How should we live?
5. Destiny:   Where are we going?
The debaters do not have positions – they will work as a team. After the questions there is a Q and A session, first between the two debate groups and then within the audience. Afterwards, Zeidan wants the audience to decide who won the debate. “We want people to judge for themselves.”
“BASIC College Ministries has about 30 members on campus, and there are a few off campus members,” Zeidan said. An off campus member is a non-LIU Post student, according to Zeidan. “BASIC is not just debates; it’s a club on campus that really focuses on people’s relationship with themselves, their relationship with other people, and their relationship [with] God.”
The group is Christian-based, but they also have atheist and Muslim members as well. “We welcome all faiths; no judgment is passed on anyone’s beliefs or opposition. We like to discuss things large and small — spiritual and science based,” Zeidan added. The club meets every Thursday during common hour in the Gold Coast Cinema of Hillwood Commons.

Last week, Dr. Joan Digby received help to “box up” her collection of over 1000 theses from students and alumni that have participated in the Honors Program under her supervision. The boxes, along with Dr. Digby and her staff, have been moved over to the Winnick Mansion.
The relocation of the Honors lounge is part of a major department move from Humanities to the Winnick Mansion; the Philosophy department has already packed its bags and headed up the hill to the new offices, and the English department is underway to empty its space, too. Once settled in, these offices will all be face each other on the second floor of the Winnick Mansion.
“It’s a magnificent view of my old office,” Digby said. “Here, honors students can come to study like they did before. We’ve even got a small classroom for some of the Honors courses to be taught [in]. It’s cozy,” Digby added.
Although she emphasized that 25 years is a long time in which many memorable moments have been created, Digby feels prepared to face the forced change. “I will give it my best!”
In 1979, the Honors Program first moved into Humanities, as part of the English department. A couple of years later, Dr. Joan Digby received her own office—a refurnished ladies restroom—more commonly known as room 201.

Lively, energetic, and impetuous-yet-driven people seem to be the motto of Manhattan residents, as it satisfies many desires of a dynamic. The city’s attractive lights, noisy streets, uniformed apartments, and interesting people moving at various speeds speaks for itself, and gives a valuable life lesson. Every day in New York City, people are constantly moving and going in different directions, traveling to a certain destination. In the midst of the entire hustle and bustle, residents still seem to push through the crowd until they get to their appointed destination. People travel in taxicabs, trains, buses, subways, cars, or even by walking just to get to where they want to go. For instance, out of the 7.6 million people who travel through Manhattan everyday, everyone has one goal in mind: to get to their destination. Inspiring, right? The city does not only promote hard work and a business mindset, it attracts a population who would rather paint the town.
The city offers a wide range of intriguing activities, especially for young people. Danae Glover, a freshman Undeclared major, stated, “I’d rather live in the city in my 20s, but when raising a family, I’d rather live on Long Island.” When one hears of visiting the city, their first thoughts revolve around Broadway Musicals, art shows, fashion shows, eateries, concerts, film festivals, museums, galleries, cultural events, sight- seeing, shopping, marine exhibits, and wildlife parks—the list is endless. However, people often forget that places other than Manhattan offer a great deal of fun, too.
Brooklyn, for example, is beautiful with its iconic Brooklyn Bridge and Promenade that boasts view of the Bridge itself, Lower Manhattan, and the Statue of Liberty. The city of Brooklyn is a nice getaway without being in as much traffic as Times Square.
The Bronx is home to one of New York’s national baseball teams—The New York Yankees and the Yankees Stadium, The Bronx Zoo, as well as the renowned Botanical Garden, which is known for some of the oldest trees in the city, along with a 50-acre forest. In Belmont, Bronx, lays a street full of tasty Italian eateries and bakeries, so popular that it has earned the name of “Little Italy” on East 187th Street.
In Queens, there is The Chocolate Factory Theater, which promotes new, visual artists of dance, theater and music. Queen’s historical Kaufman Astoria Studios, once called the Paramount Theater, took place where over 100 silent films were created.
Harlem is the home of the paradigmatic Apollo Theater, where musicians such as Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong performed. African markets have sales daily where tourists easily find great bargains. Next time you think of the city, don’t forget about Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Harlem. These areas each have a unique culture that they are famously known for. Visiting a new place is like looking through a new lens, take a chance and visit!
Long Island can easily be overshadowed for its beautiful homes and the Hampton Bays, but according to Samantha Cebollero, a Psychology freshman from Middle Island, “There is much more to do than just soak up the sun and shop.” Shelter Island provides a scenic route for the family, along with its nature trails, beaches, and bike riding. Fire Island is a place where many enjoy the summer, with its plentiful ice cream shops. In Montauk, one can go fishing, kayaking, and host bonfires. Port Jefferson, located on the water, has a shopping town with a variety of stores such as crepe stores and a mini mall. In the winter, Port Jefferson hosts a Charles Dickens festival and hands out free marshmallows that the crowd gets to toast.
Long Island has a wide variety of eateries, such as New York Bubba’s Burrito Bar in Islip, serving irresistible burritos for all to enjoy. Sweet-eats are also a popular demand on the island. Places such as Queens City Cupcakes and Hollywood Sweets will satisfy any Long Islander’s sweet tooth. A person of any age can have a great time without spending a substantial amount of money, compared to the city where it’s easier to spend.
The city is always enjoyable but Long Island presents an unforgettably friendly experience that will leave a good impression on not just New Yorkers, but tourists as well. The cities of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Harlem are fast-paced with people of all walks of life and are great for weekend trips with friends. However, Long Island is family-oriented and can you a great deal of money. Keep an open mind because both Long Island and the city are great—it depends on what you are looking for!

Entertainment on any college campus is a big part of the appeal to the school. Students are bound to the campus either for classes, class- related work, or living in the dorms. Colleges therefore seek to have a consistent source of entertainment that appeals to a wide variety of students.
At LIU Post, that venue is the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. The Tilles Center offers a wide array of performances, including contemporary music, classical music, plays, comedy shows, and more. But the question remains: are students taking advantage of these shows?
Aliza Gulab, a junior Broadcasting major, has yet to attend an event in the Tilles Center. Gulab commutes to school, and attributes her absence at campus shows to what she feels is limited marketing. “I think they should advertise more; most people don’t take the time to read the small flyers on the wall,” Gulab said. Although she hasn’t attended any Tilles events, she does feel like they do offer great shows at great prices, and plans to attend her first show, “Guy Code + Girl Code,” on Oct. 10.
Traveling distance might play a part in students’ lack of attendance at shows, according to Ashley Coleman, a senior Psychology major. Coleman, who lives on campus, has attended several shows including Spring Fling and fashion shows. Yet, she believes that commuter students would be less apt to purchase tickets. “Personally, I think I’ve gone to these events because I live here,” Coleman said.
Coleman, like Gulab, felt that increased promotion would help boost ticket sales. Coleman suggested that an Instagram page would be helpful in the promoting events at Tilles.
Other students are completely turned off by events at the Tilles center. Michelle Morey, a senior Journalism major, said, “[Campus events have] never really sparked my interest; they don’t really gear [shows] to younger students.” She also feels that the only event heavily promoted is Spring Fling. Morey is also a commuter.
Eliot Sroka, Executive Director of the Tilles Center for 28 years, stated that he has been listening and catering to the students’ feedback. Sroka attempts to make adjustments with the help of his Student Advisory Committee. The committee was finalized last year, and their goal is to incorporate student opinion into the selection of different events. For example, the “Guy Code + Girl Code” show came directly from the minds of the committee members.
The “Guy Code + Girl Code” comedy tour, which will be showing at Tilles Center on Oct. 10, is clearly aimed towards a younger demographic. The show will be similar to the television show, with a built-in question and answer segment, where students will interact with the comics.
“Dancing Pros: Live,” on Nov. 23, will be a live dance competition where the audience votes with electronic devices they receive at the door. Finally, “Evil Dead,” a Halloween themed musical, will appear on Oct. 24. The show will feature a splatter zone, where the first four to five rows of the audience will be occasionally splattered wirg fake blood throughout the play.
“We always love to hear what might be the interest of the student body,” Sroka said. If students have amy suggestions for shows at Tilles they can contact Clara Zahler, Campus Arts Liaison at 516-299-3235.

1) In the 1960s, the university built the campus radio station WCWP.
2) Hillwood, which was Marjorie Merriweather’s home, was made to resemble her father’s office building, located on the grounds of the Post Cereal Company headquarters in Battle Creek, Michigan.
3) The LIU Post equestrian team uses the same horse stables that were originally on the property and used by Marjorie Merriweather. The structures were moved from the center of campus, to the south side of campus, where they are currently located today.
4) The water garden on campus, originally built in 1923, was restored in 2001 by Blanche Karlan, a friend of the university workers who donated $100,000.
5) The 47-foot labyrinth, including the stone bridge, and benches, was named the Karlan and Geisman Meditation Garden in memory of Mrs. Karlan’s husband Lazarus.
6) The estate pool was used by the university up until 2001. After the university purchased the estate they enclosed the outdoor pool for the students. The pool was demolished on December 14, 2001, because the university built the Pratt Center, which includes an eight-lane swimming pool.
7) In June 2004, the university restored the mansion on campus. Gary Winnick, class of 1969 donated $8 million for the project and therefore the building is now named the Winnick House.
8) Some old bricks on campus have the word Post emblazoned on them. They were made in Post, Texas, a city founded in 1907 by Mr. Post.
9) On the balcony of the Great Hall, there is a decorative stained glass crest celebrating the 50th anniversary of the campus that was put there in 2004.
10) The tennis courts Marjorie and her family used were located where the labyrinth is today.

Each year, millions of Americans face the tough reality of living with a mental health condition. The first full week of October is dedicated to raising awareness of mental illness across the nation.
LIU Post has therapists and counselors on staff available to work with both faculty and students all day. Students can feel free to book an appointment during their free time, and even schedule to see someone weekly. The therapists do not only offer help for those with a mental condition but also of any student who just needs an outlet from the stress of their daily lives.
The United States Congress first established Mental Illness Awareness Week (MIAW) in 1990 to help the efforts of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). The week includes two national events; Tuesday, Oct. 7 is the National Day of Prayer for Mental Illness Recovery and Understanding, and Thursday, Oct. 9, is the National Depression Screening Day.
LIU Post does not do anything to specifically recognize mental illness awareness week. The Student Health and Counseling Center is located in room 154 of the Life Science Building. The office is opened Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the contact number is 516 299-2345. LIU Post offers free and confidential services for students.

Life for college students comes with a lot of freedom and power. This means we have more responsibilities and decisions to make on our own. A constant daily battle some students might face is answering the question: “Should I go to class?”
Perhaps you were up late the night before finishing homework, or the class is boring, or you simply have better things to do (like meeting with friends at Starbucks). You may choose not to go to your morning classes. Do you think you should be penalized for not attending class, or is it something the professor should overlook as long as you turn in your assignments and receive good grades?
Against popular opinion, I strongly believe attendance should be mandatory and that students should go to all classes. Without a mandatory attendance policy, too many students would be tempted to skip class. For example, some lectures are far too big to take attendance. I think being present and attentive are key pieces to being successful throughout the semester. It shows respect to your professor that you took the time out of your busy schedule to attend class, so it isn’t a waste of the professor’s time. By going to class everyday, you can stay tuned with the curriculum and know what is going on at all times. Most professors will argue that attendance and good performance on tests are highly related. By going to class, you are also helping fellow classmates in having an interactive environment with diverse peer-opinions and feedback to classroom discussions.
Some college students argue that they should not be punished for poor attendance since they are paying for these classes through tuition Christina Kotarski, a junior Secondary English Education major, stated, “I feel that attendance should not be mandatory. We are adults, and we should be able to make the decision to attend classes on our own. If someone wants to jeopardize their future by not attending classes, that’s their decision. I feel that, in the end, it is in the hands of the student.”
Another downside to mandatory attendance is the amount of students who come to class not to learn but to simply earn the attendance points. This poses as a distraction to the kids that actually go to class to listen and learn. Admit it—we’ve all been in lecture halls and looked around to see girls checking hairstyles or wedding gowns on Pinterest or guys watching live sporting events on their laptops. Mandatory attendance may punish hardworking students who don’t attend classes, also. If a student studies hard outside of class and does well on the tests, they will still get a poor overall grade due to the attendance grade being factored in. College is all about growing up and maturing both personally and academically into young adults— but required attendance seems to go against this statement and treats students like children.
Senior Public Relations major Colleen Dreyer said, “I don’t think attendance in college should be mandatory. The difference between high school and college is that you have more free will. Of course it’s important to attend the classes you are enrolled in, but that should be a personal choice. If you do well in class without showing up, good for you. If you don’t do well, due to attendance, perhaps you may consider going to class.”
So what do you think? Should all professors at LIU Post carry out mandatory attendance policies? Email us at liupostpioneer@gmail.com and let us know.

When you think of school, you may be tempted to think of a boring setting with textbooks and the occasional chalkboard. But, to love school is to enjoy the atmosphere, surpassing classes and your daily routines. It is not enough to just go to school. A good atmosphere encourages you to want to come back and be active in your school community. LIU Post has provided that atmosphere for the entire student body. It’s a welcoming school that encourages diversity and a willingness to accept new and exciting ideas.
Chyna Browne, a freshman Political Science major, said, “I love the people here. It is such a peaceful setting, such a breath of fresh air.” When introducing new students to a university, it is important that a warm, welcoming environment is presented. Students are more receptive to welcoming environments rather than feeling alone or as if they do not belong. It is important to feel secure and comfortable, being away from home and on your own for the first time.
College is the time in your life where you are exposed to the world in a different way. What better way of exposure than a vibrant, refreshing school community to engage with?
“It is peaceful and quiet,” said Alex Martinez, a sophomore Music major. A quiet atmosphere results in a relaxed and comfortable learning environment. It is easier to learn when you are focused in a stable setting. You gain a better understanding of what you are learning, and you can better grasp concepts and ideas.
Also, an extensive amount of activities is a key factor when it comes to a thriving and exciting campus. “There is always something going on!” said Jennifer Meija, a junior Art Therapy major. Activities such as fundraisers, community service, games, and contests all keep the students intrigued to be on campus and really experience campus life. Along with these various activities; Post provides many leadership opportunities. Whether you serve on an executive board in a campus club, hold a work study or budget job, act as an ambassador, or venture out to do an internship: Post provides ways to keep you active and astute.
Some view Post as a small campus, while others view it as a densely populated university. Devan Farrell, a senior Public Relations major, said her favorite thing about Post is the “small, family-like campus feel.” Everyone knows each other so it makes attending Post that much more exciting and, more importantly, comfortable. The small class settings enable students to have a better grasp of knowledge and information being taught by the professors. She said you get to know the professors and you feel like you matter as a student.
There are many things to like here at Post. The warm welcoming environment invites people of all ages and walks of life to gather together. It evokes a strong sense of student leadership and activeness on campus. It also gives students a chance to express themselves freely and creatively among their peers.
Being a sophomore English major here at Post, I would have to say my favorite thing about it is the amount of opportunity granted on campus. Whether it is career-based, or club- and organization-related, Post enables opportunities for everyone. It’s just up to the individual to take advantage of it.

Dear Editor,
We commend the Long Island University Post Equestrian team for working to bring awareness to the important issue of horse slaughter (“Equestrian Team Gives Back,” Sept. 30). Horses are our companions and partners in work and sport, and the team’s efforts exemplify the special bond we have with horses and the responsibility we have to care for them.
Horse slaughter betrays the trust that horses have learned to put in us. From the auction to the kill box, horses suffer in appalling conditions throughout the slaughter pipeline. Horses sent to slaughter are not old and sick—rather, 92 percent are in good condition and able to be won- derful companions when given a second chance. Horses deserve better than slaughter, and 80 percent of Americans agree with the LIU Post Equestrian team that the slaughter of horses for human consumption should be prohibited.
The Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act (H.R. 1094/S. 541) will put an end to this grisly practice. U.S. Senators Schumer and Gilibrand – and 22 of our New York U.S. Representatives – have already co-sponsored the SAFE Act. Please urge Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to join them in co-sponsoring this crucial legislation.
Regards,
Brian Shapiro
New York State Director
The Humane Society of the United States

What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear about Hillwood Commons? It could be The End Zone—an addition to Hillwood that minimized space for extra seating—or the blasting music during common hour, or the layout of the fishbowl that gives it it’s attractive retro name. To me, two infamous f-words come to mind: food and friends. Hillwood is the place to be to catch a quick bite, to meet with friends, or simply just to hang out.
I can’t deny that Hillwood has great food, but perhaps a little more variety would spike people’s interest and quell the grumbling tummies of busy students. We all know the line for Subway goes out the door an hour before common hour even starts. But, if we allocate more of our budget towards healthier foods—instead of spending more money on the candy store and boutique—and some popular American food chains, everyone would be happier. I am not saying we need a McDonalds, but perhaps we can create a stand where, once or twice a week, Moe’s comes to Post, instead of all of us haggling each other for a ride to the closest Moe’s. And, we wouldn’t even have to stop there! Every month we could bring in a different food chain or local restaurant, café, etc.
On another note, maybe it’s time to “remodel” the candy store and boutique. In other words, change the merchandise to practical, reasonably priced goods that students would actually want to purchase. Most of the student body will tell you that they find these campus stores pointless and overpriced, all the more reason to move on to different storefronts. A cool idea would be to transform one of these shops into a mini convenience store that is open 24/7. I noticed that on campus, the bookstore does offer a limited selection of little last minute things, but it is only open on weekdays and not 24/7. If you would ever need some pens, Tylenol, soft drinks, or little chocolate bars to keep you going during midnight study sessions, a little convenience store in Hillwood Commons could always be open.
Another cool addition to Hillwood Commons would be to bring back a quiet room stocked with computers and printers. This is the first semester at LIU where the computer room no longer exists. But ask a student and they’ll say they want that computer room back for its convenience. No more treks to the library during the last stretch of common hour to print something for a class only minutes later—a class you’ll surely be late for if you have to make a pit stop at the library first.
You see, there are endless possibilities to improve Hillwood reasonably. Hillwood should retain its standard as a place to “chill,” rather than morphing it into a mini Roosevelt Field Mall. Franchises like the boutique are cool add-ons at first, but as time wears on, the student body doesn’t find a purpose for an overly priced clothing store, and all that merchandise doesn’t result in net profit for LIU Post. That room might just possibly see better days as a niche to do homework and print out assignments, just as the candy shop would be more successful as a 24/7 “All You Need” mini convenience store.

“Morning mate, you okay?” I say in my deep London accent. The American receptionist just looks at me and replies, “I’m fine thanks— mate,” and chuckles. I realize that I sounded extremely English (or Australian—what’s the difference?). The Yanks don’t really say “mate,” but I say it all the time. I am still getting to grips with what Americans understand and what they don’t when I speak. However, I sometimes don’t understand them either. Americans seem to say “what’s up” instead of “pardon” or “excuse me” when they didn’t hear the question properly. Which, (I know) sounds very posh and upper-class English, but when they say this, I don’t know whether to tell them how I am and what my day has been like or whether I should just repeat the question. Do other international students have the same problem with dialect as I do? This is what I want to find out from this week’s column.
There are many international students who, obviously, have a language barrier because English is their second language. Well, let me tell you guys… I also have a language barrier. Although I am from England, there is barely a sentence that I say to an American where they won’t be baffled at what I have just said. Don’t we speak the same language? After being here for six weeks, I’ve discovered that we don’t!
For example, I was walking past a car a week or two ago, with a few of my American friends, and I said, “Look at those scratches on that car’s boot and bonnet!” They looked at me, “Huh…?” Of course they don’t use this lingo. A boot in America is called a trunk, and a bonnet is called the hood.
However, I tell myself: “It is just the Americans that don’t understand what I say” (although they do think I’m from Australia), but it is in fact also my fellow Brits and countrymen that don’t. I’m always being taken the mick out (meaning to be made fun of or teased) by my fellow teammates Tom Bowen, Jason Lampkin and Alex Billington about my heavy London accent, which can sometimes come out a bit Cockney or upper-class, different ends of the spectrum I know.
Apparently, I sometimes don’t pronounce my H’s… “‘Ello,” “‘Ow are you?,” which I find bizarre because my name, Harry, begins with the letter ‘H’. I also struggle with U’s in some words (but it’s best not to write them down in the school newspaper). Personally I don’t see it, but I’ve been told numerous times. So, is it me that doesn’t speak English? Or are these Northerners, Tom, Jason, Alex, just different, which is what us Southerners in England think?
[In an American voice]: “Haaarry, what color paaants are you wearing tonight?” This is what an American mate of mine said to me. I replied, “Probably just white boxers, mate.” Okay, so can anyone see the confusion here? In England pants are briefs. I don’t wear briefs, so being a bit of a “helmet,” I thought it was a weird question! What my friend meant to say was [in English]: “What color jeans or trousers are you wearing tonight?”
Another example comes from one of my house-mates Alfred Lindberg, a soccer player from Sweden. He said the first time he came to the U.S. a couple of years ago, he had to get used to the different types of slang that all these different cultures use. Being part of an athletic team, he has been witness to all of these many jargons. Alfred also went to say, that in Sweden they are taught the British English, so when he said to his old American coach, “Do we play much football in the autumn?” his coach was extremely confused.
These are just struggles from a “tool” of a Brit and a sophisticated Swede, so I cannot imagine the struggles that maybe a Chinese or Japanese student must have, especially with the cultural shock they must be facing since the move over the Pacific.
I am making an extra effort to use and understand certain American terms, such as “pinnies” (bibs) and “soccer” (football). So collectively as international students, I think we should try and be part of this intriguing dialogue, which was created after the success over the “lobster backs” in 1783. And although when the Americans go abroad they speak e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y slowly (like we are dumb), let’s embrace this culture and encircle the American Dream we are all living here at Post.

Professor Neill Slaughter, a professor of Fine Arts at LIU Post, will be giving his lecture, “The Maine Event,” in The End Zone on Oct. 9 during common hour as part of the School of Visual Performing Arts’ Dean’s Lecture Series. The lecture will feature a slideshow presentation highlighting Slaughter’s sabbatical painting project. Slaughter is a tenured full-time professor who has taught at LIU for 20 years, but has taught a total of 36 years as an art professor since 1978.
Slaughter described the images he painted during his yearlong sabbatical in Maine. “I painted ‘en plein air,’ or on location, to add to a series I had begun initially in Acadia National Park, Maine, several years ago,” Slaughter explained. “These new paintings will be part of a solo exhibit I’m having in California at Marymount University in Palos Verdes and San Pedro. I currently have one of these paintings on display in the Long Island Biennial Juried Exhibit at the Heckscher Museum in Huntington, New York, running from mid August, as well as two more of the paintings of Maine at the Salmagundi Art Club in NYC [from] September 29 to October 15.”
Not only has Slaughter been teaching fine arts courses at the university level since 1978, but he has also had his drawings and paintings exhibited nationally and internationally. He began his teaching career in Philadelphia at the Tyler School of Art of Temple University, before moving to St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, who invited him to inaugurate their study abroad program at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, England. When he returned to the states in 1983, he relocated to California to teach at California State University, and then to Loyola Marymount University in 1987. He again went abroad to teach at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England in 1989, and then in 1993, Slaughter moved to Southampton, New York to begin teaching at Long Island University.
During his 36 years as an educator, Slaughter has traveled the world to teach, conduct research, and create art. His extensive travels have influenced what he paints, which often reflect the social conditions of his surroundings. In addition to his many years of teaching and traveling, he has collected a number of awards and honors. Among them, Slaughter has received a Ford Foundation Fellowship award in 1977 and 1978, a Scottish Arts Council Grant in 1980, an LMU Research Grant to Africa in 1988, and a Fulbright Fellowship to India in 1992. In 2003, he was awarded the David Newton Award for Excellence in Teaching granted by LIU Post. In 2008, he mounted a 30-year retrospective, which included a full color catalogue funded by the institution.
Slaughter has had more than 28 solo exhibits of his own drawings and paintings since 1978, and participated in more than 75 national and international group exhibitions. His art has been reviewed by leading newspapers as well as magazines, and his work is in numerous public and private collections throughout the world. Galleries such as Island Weiss Gallery in New York, Peter Marcelle Gallery in Southampton, NY, Couturier Gallery in Los Angeles, CA, and Richard Demarco Gallery in Edinburgh, Scotland, have all represented his art.
All are welcome to the lecture, and lunch will be served.

Sharon Matt Atkins, Managing Curator of Exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum, will be giving a free lecture on Oct. 9 from 12:30 p.m. – 1:30 p.m in the Steinberg Museum of Art. Light refreshments will be served at the event, which is also viable for Honors program merit credit. All students are welcome. The event is sponsored by the Department of Art, and organized by Professor Aileen Wang and the Art and Art History club. The lecture will focus on the experience of working as a curator with contemporary artists.
“[Atkins] is my friend from graduate school so we grew up together in the field, working towards being professionals, and now she is the Managing Curator of Exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum,” said Wang. “I thought that she would be an interesting person to come to [the university] and share her insight and experience within the curatorial field.”
In her work at the Brooklyn Museum, Atkins has been responsible for modern and contemporary art exhibitions, such as “GO: A Community-Curated Open Studio Project” with Shelley Bernstein in 2012. She has also coordinated exhibitions devoted to artists such as Andy Warhol and Norman Rockwell, and organized “Swoon: Submerged Motherlands” in 2014. Atkins recently helped organize a major presentation of the work of Ai Weiwei, a contemporary Chinese artist whose vast swath of work—from sculpture, to architecture, to film—expresses his political activism, which is critical of his native government. “He’s very much in the news and is currently being detained by the Chinese government,” noted Wang.
“This lecture is part of a series that I helped the Art and Art History Club start,” said Wang. “We bring in [people] who are active within the visual arts profession, [have them] meet with the students, and offer insight to them on what it’s like to work in the field now, and also to give professional advice.”
“They come [to] lecture and have a discussion with the students,” said junior Arts Management major Hannah Fitch, secretary of the Art and Art History Club. “It’s really great for art students, as well as other [majors] who are wondering about what happens in the real world [of art], like how to get jobs. It’s very helpful for us to know how it all works.” The Art and Art History Club is active in organizing these lectures. “We help set up a date, determine the refreshments, location, time, all of that,” continued Fitch.
“Last semester, I invited one of my colleagues in the commercial gallery field, Sunny Shin, who is the director of Coohaus Art in Chelsea,” said Wang. “She was able to [give a] presentation on how to be a professional artist, how to approach galleries that want to represent your work, [and] how to stage an exhibition. So that talk last year was very successful.”
Typically, Wang negotiates to have one speaker visit per semester. These events have led to key networking opportunities for students, like 2014 Art History graduate Jill Coklan, who had been secretary of the Art and Art History club. Coklan was introduced to Shin last year, expressed interest in internships, and now holds an assistant curator position at Coohaus Art in Chelsea. “Which is a key position,” noted Wang.
According to Stacie Zucker, a junior Digital Arts and Design major and the president of the club, the lecture series is beneficial, especially for graduate students
or those in the Honors program. “You get good information, make a network, have people who come in from the real world and show you how it is, and you get excited for your future,” said Zucker.
In addition to the discussion during common hour, there will be an extra talk with Atkins during Wang’s night class from 5:00 p.m. – 6:30 p.m. at the Steinberg Museum. This talk will focus on how the Brooklyn Museum chooses their exhibitions, and what they consider when adding them into the gallery calendar. Interested students are free to notify Wang of their attendance, at aileen. wang@liu.edu

“A to Z” is a new romantic-comedy television show on Thursday nights at 9:30 on NBC, created by Ben Queen (writer of “Cars 2” and Fox’s “Drive”). The show follows the relationship between Zelda Vasco (Cristin Milioti) a no-nonsense lawyer, and Andrew Lofland (Ben Feldman) an employee of an Internet-dating site who longs to meet the girl of his dreams.
Immediately, the pilot tells the audience that this is just a stepping-stone in Andrew and Zelda’s lives, with Katey Sagal – the narrator – stating that the story lasts a little over eight months. However, this takes nothing away from the story or the characters. Both Andrew and Zelda are great onscreen presences, and their chemistry is quite charming, with all the quirky and oddly-romantic power reminiscent of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall in the Woody Allen classic, “Annie Hall.”
Queen’s pilot script might bring him into a new light, as he has never really touched upon a romantic-comedy like this. Pilots are usually unfunny and tiring, but this episode is loving, fun, and enjoyable due to the charm of Milioti and Feldman. Following “Drive” and “Cars 2,” Queen is building his way up creatively, pushing out, quite possibly, his best work to date.
Feldman and Milioti portray the perfect couple, which the audience is able to relate to. They’re awkward, fun, and cute.
The contrast between Zelda’s hardworking essence and Andrew’s goofy allure creates a perfect on-screen balance. Milioti is especially a standout performance. The actress proved her incredible television presence in the 200th episode of “How I Met Your Mother,” and we see that strength here, as well. Her performance as the titular mother in the show made the audience fall in love with a character who wasn’t on screen for almost the whole series. The pilot of “A to Z” demonstrates that Milioti has much more to give as an actress, and that “How I Met Your Mother” wasn’t her acting peak. Quite frankly, she’s brilliant.
Of course, it’s only the pilot, so it is hard to say exactly where this show will go, but it seems like it will be excellent. The cliché rom-com cinematography (i.e. spinning during the kiss) is forgiven, as it tremendously benefits the show’s humor – this show is about the relationship of this couple from “A to Z,” there will be clichés everywhere.
“A to Z” seems to be the modern answer to “Annie Hall,” or more of a romantic twist to Richard Ayoade’s film, “Submarine.” Queen creates relationships that are relatable, and develops a romantic comedy that may not have the happiest of endings. This is a must-watch, and I do not say this lightly.

Liam Neeson stars in “A Walk Among the Tombstones,” which opened on Sept. 19 in New York. Scott Frank (“The Lookout”) directed the film, which is based on the novel written by Lawrence Block of the same name. Neeson plays the character of Matthew Scudder—an ex-cop and now private investigator hired by a drug trafficker, Kenny. Kenny hires Scudder to *SPOILER ALERT* exact revenge on the people who kidnapped and killed his wife, and sent her back to him, literally, in pieces. The morbid abductors had told Scudder that since Kenny “slashed the price” on the ransom money, they “slashed” his wife. Disgusting.
Before he decides to take the case, Scudder thoughly investigates the circumstances and finds out that the same thing happened to other women. He predicts (and is right) that this will happen to others in the future. The story reveals Scudder’s conscience, who realizes that these abductors are seriously disturbed. The movie also shows a budding relationship between Scudder and a young homeless boy who hangs out in the library. The boy, T.J. (Brian ‘Astro’ Bradley), and Scudder end up forming a mutually beneficial bond, as T.J. eventually helps Scudder take down the bad guys.
The story is also constantly interjected with Scudder’s struggle with alcoholism, as the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are blended in throughout the film.
What sets this movie apart from regular police thrillers is the fact that it is constantly depicting a character analysis of Scudder. Without giving away the entire storyline, he had a horrible accident while he was inebriated, which completely changed his life and made him leave the police force.
The movie portrays Scudder as a better person in the present, even though he got there the hard way. It is very graphic, with violent scenes – more than one depicting horrible and demeaning actions against women. I found this unnecessary and distasteful. Some things don’t need to be seen—they can be alluded to and the viewer can piece the message together. Less can be more.
“A Walk Among the Tombstones” is a great movie, but don’t expect your average “rogue cop” story. Neeson is definitely the draw for this movie, and I really don’t know if it would have been such a hit at the box office without him. He has a big fan base, and deserves it. Scudder battles with himself over his past and tries to do the right thing, showing the audience Neeson’s talent as an actor. The supporting actors, including Bradley, were cast perfectly for the film, each (the drug addict, drug trafficker, and the kidnappers) playing their parts believably. Overall, the film is definitely worth seeing for the pure “edge of your seat” factor.
Verdict: A-

With yet another clean sheet and two tallies from senior forward Lauren Bellone, the women’s soccer team continued its winning streak on Sunday, Oct. 5, and is continuously in the mix for a spot in the National Championships by the end of the season.
The grass surface on the new Pioneer Soccer Park seemed to have recovered from the heavy rain the day before, as both teams kept knocking passes on the ground. However, the home team—with six straight wins—dominated the ball and kept on bumping forward, giving the Knights a hard time to establish any build-up of momentum. As the Knights had a hard time penetrating through the Pioneer defense, it led to a comfortable day for sophomore goalkeeper Hrafnhildur Agnarsdottir, who stood for one save in 90 minutes. The one save turned out to be the only shot on goal for the guests. Agnarsdottir has now recorded six shutouts in nine games, and four shutouts in a row.
In the first half, the Green and Gold had scoring opportunities, but they couldn’t get on the scoreboard as they went into halftime tied at zero. The Pioneers got an early goal in the second half when sophomore forward Julia Backman fed Bellone who found an opening by the first post. Following the goal, the Pioneers added to their lead in the 73rd minute when Bellone overwhelmed the Knight defense again. This time, she sent it to the far corner, beating the goalkeeper. Bellone’s second goal of the day sealed the deal as the Pioneers won 2-0.
Head Coach Mark Dawson and the team will continue to battle on the new Pioneer Soccer Park on Wednesday, Oct. 8, when they face Wilmington College, Del. Kickoff is slated for 3.30 p.m.

On Sunday, Oct. 5 in Brookville, N.Y., the Field Hockey team showed their attacking prowess by hammering eight goals against Franklin Pierce College.
The Pioneers were on the back of a draining overtime win against local rivals Adelphi College. After cutting it close versus Adelphi, the Pioneers set out to make a statement. The Green and Gold scored four goals in the first half, two of which came from graduate student Dani Crouse to put the Pioneers two up after 32 minutes. True to her recent form, junior forward Keliann Margiotta notched two before the break, holding her spot at the top of the goals per game average in all of Division II. When asked how it feels to be the most prolific forward in the country right now, Margiotta humbly replied, “It is great to receive recognition, we are mid-way through the season and I am just happy the team is clicking, if it happens to be me on the end of the entire team’s hard work then that is a bonus.”
Senior forward Lyn-Marie Wilson also added two goals to the score-sheet, before Crouse again broke free offensively and scored her third of the game, securing a hat-trick for the day. “This team has a lot of talent, but above all, we are a really tight knit group who all really want to win that championship [NCAA Division II National Championship],” Crouse said.
Sophomore midfielder Lauren Adamusik also got in on the action, hitting home off a Margiotta assist. It was a quiet afternoon for the LIU Post back line, as the Ravens did not manage a great deal offensively, finishing the game without a single shot on target.
Sophomore defender Abi Sawyer reflected on the game, “We really clicked today; we stopped their attacks before they had a chance to create anything dangerous.”
The Pioneers return to action next in a Conference match-up against Merrimack College on Saturday, Oct. 11, in Mass. Game time is scheduled for 4 p.m.

After 20 years in baseball, Yankee captain Derek Jeter played his final game on Sunday Sept. 28, against the rival Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park. Jeter legged out an infield single in the third inning, plating a run in the process, and ending his baseball career as he got a pinch runner. The hit was the 3,465th of his career, good enough for sixth place on the all-time hits list, behind four Hall of Famers and the infamous Pete Rose.
Jeter came up in the Yankees organization in the mid-1990s and became the backbone of multiple championship teams. In his 1996 rookie season, he batted .314 and led the team in hits, well deserving of winning Rookie of the Year honors. The Yankees went on to win the World Series in six games over the Atlanta Braves that year.
A few years later, a few more rings for Derek. In 1998, The Yankees, as a team, had the best record to that point in baseball history. They finished a staggering 114-48 and had a 22-game lead on the second place Red Sox at the season’s end. Right smack in the middle of that great season was Jeter. Jeter, then 24, posted a .324 batting average and led the American League in runs scored with 127. The Bronx Bombers capped off an impressive season with a sweep of the San Diego Padres in the World Series.
The following year, 1999, saw a lot of statistical highs for Derek. He totaled career bests in: hits with 219, home runs with 24, and RBI with 102. Not to mention he also batted .349. The amazing year for Jeter helped propel his team to the Fall Classic for the second straight year, and the Yankees defeated the Braves once again, this time in four games. In 2000, Jeter continued his stellar play and led his team to the World Series for the third straight year, fourth time in five years. The matchup that time was the city rival New York Mets. Jeter stepped up to the challenge in that World Series, making big play after big play. From relay throws to nail runners at the plate, to big home runs which helped seal a fourth title, Derek never felt uncomfortable in the big moments. The big plays made by Derek made it an easy choice to nominate him as the World Series MVP of 2000.
Seeking a fourth straight title in 2001, the Yankees put baseball in the backseat to grieve for the families who suffered losses during the September 11th attacks. The attack on the country had people turning to sports in order to help them forget their problems. They found the Yankees as a way to feel normal again. With lots of support from fans, the Yankees, led by Jeter, made the playoffs and seemed poised for a big run. Perhaps the signature play of Derek’s career came in game three of the 2001 ALDS against the Oakland Athletics. With the Yankees trailing two games to zero in the series and facing elimination, Jeter helped preserve New York’s precious 1-0 lead by making a play on a relay to nail a non-sliding Jeremy Giambi at the plate. The Yankees went on to win the series and advance to the World Series. While the Yankees lost the World Series in seven games, Derek became known as “Mr. November” with a walk-off home run as the clock struck midnight, becoming the first player in baseball history to hit a home run in that month.
A few years later, in 2004, Jeter wrote another chapter in his already historic career. In a regular season game against the Red Sox on July 4, 2004, Jeter made a catch over third base and his momentum took him face first into the stands. The play showed Jeter’s determination, effort, and hustle as he sacrificed his body to make the play. With his face beat up and bloodied, he was forced to exit the game, which the Yankees went on to win.
Jeter came to the park every day—and he came to play. Thirteen times during his career, he played over 150 games a season, showing his durability and strength. In September 2009, Derek passed the Iron Horse, Lou Gehrig, on the Yankees all-time hits list and became number one on the team in hits. The hit was a typical Jeter slap shot to the right side passed a diving infielder. Jeter batted .334 on the season, the first one in the new Yankee ballpark in the Bronx, and earned another championship, his fifth in total.
Two years later, in 2011, Jeter looked to etch his name in history yet again. This time, he was shooting for hit number 3000. The number 3000 in baseball is very special, as only 28 players have ever totaled that many hits. It is an exclusive club to say the least. Of the 28 members in the club, 24 are in the Hall of Fame, while the few others are said to become. In 2011, on a hot July afternoon in the Bronx, sitting on 2,999 hits, Derek Jeter smacked a home run to left field off all-star pitcher David Price for his 3000th hit. The magical moment at the stadium seemed as though it was scripted, but it was typical Derek Jeter. For all the drama surrounding Jeter and his quest for 3000, he had a down year by his standards, batting .297 and accumulating just north of 160 hits.
At the ripe age of 38, in 2013, the Captain had one of the best statistical years of his career. The old-timer played in 159 games, tying the most he’s ever played in, and led the Major Leagues in hits with 216. Jeter seemed to be able to withstand time, but an ankle injury forced him to miss the ALCS that year, and the Yankees went on to lose to the Detroit Tigers. After an injury plagued his 2013 campaign, Jeter saw two of his longtime teammates, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera, both walk away from the game.
Derek Jeter came into the 2014 season with high expectations as he usually did, but it never clicked for him as he batted a career worst .256 in only his third season missing the playoffs out of 20. Jeter played in a grand total of four games during his entire career, where his team was mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. One of those four games came in 2014 on Sept. 25. The Captain played his last game in pinstripes and gave the fans a show. He went 2-5 with 3 RBI and the walk-off hit to write a storybook ending to his Cooperstown-worthy career.
Jeter’s numbers in the regular season speak for themselves, but his postseason numbers rival the greats of all time, as well. Jeter batted .308 in the playoffs and accumulated 200 hits on the button in 158 total games. When examining his career, he essentially played an additional year of baseball just in the playoffs.
As Derek Jeter rides off into the sunset, Yankee fans—and baseball fans in general—will remember him for being a winner. He was a likeable person who just came to the ballpark and worked his tail off. It showed on the field with all the hits and plays he made. As a kid, Jeter told everyone he wanted to play shortstop for the Yankees. He was one of the lucky ones; he got to live out his dream. He did it for 20 years, under the microscope that is New York, and he did it with class.

On Wednesday, Oct. 1, the men’s soccer team (6-3-1) played host to the Firebirds from the University of the District of Columbia (5-4-1). The Pioneers were able to hold off the visitors, despite the scoring of a late goal, and come away with a 2-1 victory.
Both teams battled wet and soggy conditions all afternoon, but the Pioneers got on the scoreboard first, scoring in the seventh minute of the match. Junior midfielder Per Forgaard weaved his way through enemy defenders and found graduate midfielder Dale McDonald, who beat the Firebird goalie. Later in the first half, the Green and Gold struck again. This time, it was freshman midfielder Harry Pearse who, with help from senior forward Eivind Austboe, found the back of the net to increase LIU’s lead to 2-0.
The Pioneers set the pace in the first half, outshooting the Firebirds by five and holding a 6-2 advantage in corner kicks. In the 75th minute of the second half, the Firebirds came out with a different mentality and cut the deficit in half. Junior midfielder Elio Hernandez was able to adjust to a deflection close to the net and capitalized. The 2-1 score held up the rest of the way, despite the two sides being very physical.
Due to inclement weather, the second scheduled match against the Knights from Queens College (1-6) was moved from Saturday, Oct. 4 to Sunday, Oct 5. With the extra rest, the Pioneers came out fresh and ready for battle. In the 20th minute, Austboe was able to give his team a one-goal advantage, courtesy of a pass from Per Forgaard. The action packed first half, which saw a combined 12 shots, only yielded one score.
After the break, the Pioneers got in a rhythm offensively. In the 68th minute, McDonald was hit in stride by junior midfielder Matias Ruiz, and McDonald gave the hosts a two-goal lead. The Knights were able to trim the lead to 2-1 after a late goal, but the Pioneer defense stood strong late, not allowing a shot on goal in the final eight minutes.
The victory was the second straight for the Pioneers, as they look to string together some wins and make the National Tournament. Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his squad hit the field next on Wednesday, Oct. 8, when they travel to Delaware to play the Wildcats of Wilmington University. Kickoff is slated for 3.30 p.m.

On Saturday, Oct. 4, after trailing 7-3 late in the first quarter, the Pioneers (3-2) scored 34 unanswered points to take a commanding 37-7 lead heading into halftime. The Pace University Setters (0-5) stormed back in the second half and cut the lead down to eight, but the Green and Gold were able to hold off the late game rally and round out their three-game road trip with a 44-36 win against their NE-10 rival from Ossining, N.Y.
The Pioneers began their scoring outburst with back-to-back three-play drives. Just a minute after the hosts took a 7-3 lead, red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino hooked up with sophomore tailback David White for a 70- yard score giving the visitors a 10-7 edge. On the following drive, Laurino fired an 86-yard bomb to red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer, giving the Pioneers a 17-7 lead. Just nine seconds later, red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti forced a turnover stripping junior tailback Valentino Miles of the ball, and senior defensive back Roger Hamilton took it to the house from 21 yards out. The offense continued to dominate as Laurino added a 5-yard touchdown, which was bookended by a pair of field goals to put the Pioneers up 37-7 at intermission.
Halfway through the third quarter, the Pioneers led 44-14, setting the stage for the Setters comeback. Freshman quarterback Steven Demeo threw touchdown passes to junior wideout Kyle Johnson and sophomore running back Delaney Wallace to narrow the gap to 44-28. With seven and a half minutes to go in the final quarter, an interception by senior defensive back Joe Roman off red-shirt sophomore quarterback Matt Brennan turned into seven points and brought the Setters within eight. Demeo anchored a 9-play, 61- yard drive resulting in a three-yard score by Miles. Demeo connected with junior tight end Luiz Ribiero on a two-point conversion attempt, making it a one-score contest at 44-36.
LIU Post utilized their stellar running game to secure the victory for the second straight week. Laurino picked up a couple of crucial first downs with his feet to move the chains and seal the win for the Pioneers. “This win was a huge momentum builder, and we’re in a good situation where we can start stringing wins together. Seasons are built upon momentum and so are games. I’m always asking myself what play can I make to spark momentum,” Laurino said.
Laurino finished 8-of-14 for 208 yards and two touchdowns. He also racked up 62 yards on the ground with a score. White had the game-high with 112 yards on 14 carries. “I have a lot of game experience as a four-year starter, which helps me take a lot of control over the game,” Laurino said. “Bybeingadualthreat,Ihaveabetteradvantage of getting first downs in 3rd-and-long and scenarios when the defense has everyone covered. The hard thing is not using your feet when you don’t need them,” Laurino added. Being currently seated in third place, Laurino believes that the Pioneers have a real good chance to win the NE-10 and they have yet to play the top two teams in the conference.
On defense, Brunetti led the squad with 12 tackles, four that came from a loss, and he forced a fumble. Hamilton recorded 10 stops to add to his fumble recovery for a touchdown. Red-shirt senior defensive lineman Dan Belfiore had nine stops and a sack. Red-shirt junior linebacker Brandon Cheney and freshman linebacker Matt Grassa chipped in with eight tackles a-piece.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the team return to action on Oct. 11, when they open up a three-game homestand against NE-10 rival Stonehill College. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.
