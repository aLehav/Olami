Tiktok, a social media platform that has over 100 million active users in the United States, has garnered national attention because the Trump administration has put pressure on the app’s owners to strike a deal with a U.S. based company. According to President Donald Trump, the deal would require the Chinese based company that owns Tiktok, ByteDance, to transfer ownership of the app entirely to a U.S. based company. This comes out of a concern the Trump administration has that the app has been sharing information about its U.S. users with the Chinese Government.
Trump has spoken about his concerns regarding the app being controlled by ByteDance since July. Originally, Walmart and Oracle were to take a share in the app alongside ByteDance; however, in a recent statement, Trump said he won’t approve the deal unless 100% of the app’s ownership is transferred to a U.S. company. If a deal isn’t worked out on his terms, the president has threatened to ban Tiktok in the U.S. altogether.
This back and forth regarding whether or not Tiktok will be allowed to have continued use in the U.S. has Post’s community of Tiktok lovers and influencers feeling conflicted about the future of the social media platform.
“Both the left and right sides of the government are joining together for the ban. As much as I love the app, I am worried about my own privacy since a lot of my personal information can be found on it,” Emily Szalkowski, a freshman business major, said. She currently has over 220,000 followers on her Tiktok account, @sourrpatchkidz.
Students have, for a long time, been actively engaged in and enjoyed the Tiktok community.
“TikTok allowed me for the first time in my entire life to truly showcase my own personal differences in a way that I can be proud of,” Jack Tomlinson, a junior physical and health education major said. Tomlinson is a Tiktok influencer who has amassed over 130,000 followers on his page, @JackTomlinson2000. 
Szalkowski also reflected positively on the platform the app has provided people. 
“Tiktok is one of the only platforms where the content is so genuine and real. A lot of creators touch on current events, so viewers are able to see different perspectives on modern day issues,” Szalkowski said.
With the intrusion of Trump’s administration into the safe space Tiktok has become for many users, some students have been worried about how this will impact the future of the app. 
“I started creating content on this app to not only entertain myself but entertain others,” Tomlinson said. “With the involvement of politics, I feared it would take away from the true meaning of why I create [content].” 
Some Tiktok influencers at Post have also been worried about how government influence might affect their ability to monetize their content.
“I would say most creators are concerned about losing the ability to make money and losing [their] followers if the platform just disappears completely,” Szalkowski said.  
Still, students have acknowledged the occasional necessity for politics to play a part in Tiktok and other social media platforms. “The Trump administration posed a legitimate threat of potential challenges that could meet our country due to Tiktok’s ties with China,” Tomlinson said.
In fact, Tomlinson has an optimistic view about what Trump’s jurisdictions may do for the future of the app.
“Personally I do not see this deal doing anything to Tiktok in a negative aspect,” Tomlinson said. “I see this as a great opportunity to grow a still up and coming entertainment platform in the entertainment capital of the world; which is America.”
Szalkowski echoed Tomlinson’s optimism regarding Trump’s dealings and the future of Tiktok. 
“I believe that Trump’s dealings will help [ensure user’s privacy]. Although he hasn’t been the greatest president, I do think that the government knows what they are doing with this,” she said.
Trump has not yet reached a final deal regarding Tiktok, but the future of this popular platform remains uncertain as negotiations continue.

Long Island University has been recognized by The Princeton Review as one of the Best in the Northeast for the fourth consecutive year. The Princeton Review releases their survey to college administrators and students yearly; this year marks the 29th edition of the Review. The survey asked administrators from several hundred colleges in the Northeast about their school’s academic offerings, faculty members, resources, and financial aid. A portion of the survey also included input from 143,000 college students who gave input on various aspects of their campus. The Princeton Review surveys colleges on everything from academics, to best career services, and even which schools have the happiest students. 
“We chose Long Island University as one of our 224 ‘Best in the Northeast’ primarily for its academics,” Princeton Reviews Editor-in-Chief Robert Franek said.“We also greatly considered what students enrolled at LIU reported to us on our student survey for this project.”
Students gave the university and their peers glowing reviews. Undergrads praised the university faculty, claiming that they receive “personalized attention” and “individualized instruction” from their professors. Students also praised how the professors had “a career outside of the classroom” which allows them to showcase the real world through their curriculum. Students described the student body as “hardworking, helpful, intelligent, and creative” and mentioned how there are always events taking place on campus. 
“We are thrilled to earn recognition for the fourth consecutive year from The Princeton Review’s annual college rankings of the best colleges for 2021,” Chief of Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement Michael Berthel said. “This ranking is especially important because it is based on student survey responses and further advances LIU’s position as a nationally recognized teaching and research institution.” 
The 2019-2020 school year brought an abundance of new advancements for the university including the collaboration with Roc Nation to form the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports, and Entertainment and the George Polk School of Communications. The university also reached out into the community through the Global Service Institute, a comprehensive volunteer app built and overseen by the university. The College of Veterinary Medicine was also launched and athletics debuted as the Sharks in NCAA Division 1 competition. 
Kevin Williams, a junior accounting student, believes that the university deserves all the praise they received in the Princeton Review. “Throughout the whole pandemic, the staff were unbelievably understanding and devoted to providing a solid education and support system to students,” Williams said. Additionally, he credits the many resources available to students as another reason that students gave the university positive feedback. “LIU offers a great environment for students to excel both in and out of the classroom. It’s an overall great college if you’re looking to make a change for the better in your life.”

12:24am
Staring in the mirror above the sink in my bathroom. 
Admiring the reflection as the droplets of water trickle down the structures of my face. 
Embracing each and every imperfection God has perfected.
Acknowledging my deep dark chocolate complexion.
Remembering the youthful era of my existence when the darkening of complexion was a curse for me.
Almond to Milk Chocolate 
Milk Chocolate to Dark 
Sweet to Bitter 
Admired to Disregarded 
Fascinated by the bitterness in its taste
I have allowed it to make its bed in the pit of stomach 
The Bitterness converted to Hatred 
And hatred is how I felt about the skin I was living in
It was said the dark the berry, the sweeter the juice.
The darker the flesh, the deeper the roots.
But that was just a euphemism for the dark skin sons and daughters – men and women to find beauty in their dark skin.
Those were the words that we held tightly to our beating hearts to find the love within when our minds were clogged with the overpowering forces of hatred.
“Pudda, I love your dark skin. You’re the chocolate baby I never had. You are so handsome.”
“Grandma, I hate how dark I am? I wish I was much lighter. I am ugly.” 
She was speechless, but I was seeking answers of why I hated him, why I hated me.
As we begin to develop as young men, we were taught about puberty. The growing of hair all over our bodies, the pimples upon our faces, the cracking of our voices to the bass that will be left in its place and the development of a substance that assist in the process of reproduction.
We were taught about the birds and the bees. To protect our vulnerable manhood with latex jackets from attracting any unwanted disease or an unplanned fatherhood – shoes far too big to walk a mile in.
But we were never taught about colorism.
As children, we ran in and out of corner stores to buy candy, ices and a bunch of snacks that increase the sugar levels in our bodies.
Ignoring the paper bags that they were so gently placed in by the lovely owners of our corner store bodegas.
But would you believe me if I told you that those were the same paper bags placed by the faces of black men, women and children to determine their value – how worthy they were, was determined by the light tan hue of a bag.
A concept that we wish was abandoned when the chains were shackled around our feet and segregation played its part in actively keeping us in poverty.
Transcended into the 21st century.
When my younger self stood in front of the same mirror above the sink in my bathroom to look at my reflection – discontent with my complexion because of the lack of representation.
As we began to develop as young men
We were taught about masculinity 
We were told to maintain a tough interior and exterior 
Refrain from wearing our emotions on our sleeves 
But they forgot to teach us about the treatment we will receive.
When they see my dark skin, when they see our dark skin 
Fascinated by the freckles 
Soft hazelnut green grey eyes 
And the buttery caramel skin
Dark chocolate was never the trend 
We were scary
We were intimidating 
We spoke too loud even when we were whispering 
We argued too much even when we were expressing 
We were too angry even when we were hurting 
The opportunities were never overflowing 
We always had to play the defense because someone was always trying to tell us that were not right the fit.
That we do not meet the qualifications even when our resumes were long and extensive.
Blatantly shouting 
Overtly confessing 
That the darker we are, the lower we should be.
And do you know how that feels 
As a young man 
To not have control over perception 
To be burdened with reflections from people’s projections 
Now…
When we flip through magazines 
And turn on our television screens 
We are flooded with chocolate faces 
It puts a smile on my face, but I question this objective.
Are people finally standing with us to acknowledge the problem or are they trying to pull a scheme for a diversity campaign?
Please stop using my face, my body, my experience to meet a quota.
No longer do I want to stand front and center on your auction block to be sold to the highest bidder, the highest supporter.

Several fraternities and sororities participated in National Hazing Prevention Week from Sept. 20 through Sept. 25.. Organized by HavingPrevention.org, a non-profit organization, Hazing Prevention Week is intended to spread the word about the dangers of hazing and to implore fraternities, sororities, sports teams and other groups not to partake in the dangerous practice. Founded in 2007, the organization seeks to provide education and resources, as well as to focus on preventing instances of hazing rather than dwell on how to punish existing guilty parties.
Delta Zeta was one of the Greek organizations on campus that participated in the national event. “This week as a community we wore purple to raise awareness for hazing prevention and promoted it on social media,” Kristina Occhino, a senior childhood/special education major and president of Delta Zeta, said. “As a chapter, we watched a Hazing Prevention seminar explaining situations and examples of hazing. This seminar allowed us to stop and reflect on our own chapter to make sure we were not participating in any such activities.”
Occhino also added that the sorority’s nationals held a second seminar Wednesday aimed to shed light on instances of hazing nationwide, even providing a quiz in poll form on social media platforms. This quiz, Occhino said, intended to “present scenarios and allow viewers to vote whether or not it is hazing; these scenarios are ones that may not be considered hazing to others to show what hazing actually is.”
Still, there are groups that publicly disavow hazing while privately condoning its use among members. 
“At American hazing is not allowed. Despite that, hazing is the most important aspect of Greek life at AU,” Ari Kramer, a senior pre-law major and fraternity member at American University in Washington D.C., said. “Anyone who was part of the fraternity leadership had nothing to do with the hazing process, they had particular members of the fraternity in charge of hazing.”
Kramer added that the mentality toward hazing by the fraternity’s members could be summed up as “it happened to us so it has to happen to the next class.”
Kramer claims that of the nine weeks of pledging, only about six days were free of hazing. As to its nature, he asserts hazing was mainly physical, such as forced push-ups, planks, and wall-sits; all while the brothers in charge of the process yelled in their faces. 
Alyssa Lawson, a sophomore adolescent education major who is is a member of the panhellenic council on campus, says she was informed of LIU’s strict anti-hazing policy the second she received a bid, and reiterated that all Greek Life on campus wore purple on Monday, Sept. 21 in a show of support for National Hazing Prevention Week.

As the fall 2020 semester commences, students may be wondering what they can do to keep themselves occupied, while also preventing the spread of COVID-19. There are multiple opportunities to have fun or just unwind, while being safe and socially distant.
The outdoor movies held on Riggs Lawn are a fun and safe way to relax and spend time with friends.  Matthew Sporrer, a senior dual major in theatre arts and international relations, says he found out about this event from “the campus posters and the inflatable TV right outside [his] window on Riggs Lawn.”
Sporrer went to see “Knifes Out” and said that it was an enjoyable experience, and that he felt safe while attending this event.
“Public Safety was there enforcing social distancing and it was outside. People were wearing masks and only took them off to eat snacks,” he said.  “Three people to a socially distant circle outside is a great way to keep us social in these socially distant times.”
If students don’t enjoy movies there are still a multitude of other things they can do on campus, such as eating socially distant at Winnick Dining Hall. Samantha “Samie” Friedman, a sophomore political science major, enjoys going to this location to spend time with her friends, and do it safely.
“I feel safe eating inside at Winnick, not so much in Hillwood.” Friedman said. “In Winnick I see maybe 15 people, at Hillwood I’d say it’s about triple that.”
Friedman suggests that students go to grab food with a friend, because sitting in a dorm room can get lonely.
“I think it’s important to see people other than your roommate, and getting food together is a great way to do that safely, she said. “The capacity at any table is two people.”
Friedman also thinks that students should just be able to do whatever they’re comfortable with, regarding dining at school.
“If people are more comfortable with taking their food to-go, they should definitely do so, but I also think that eating at Winnick is a nice social experience,” she said.
If any student is uncomfortable being in groups indoors, the Great Lawn is a great place to hang out, and get a nice view of the campus.
“I like to just sit on the Great Lawn with my friends to eat and do homework,” Ally LaMont, a sophomore musical theatre major, said.  “It’s a safe way to get things done and still be social.” 
LaMont encourages other students to find their favorite place outdoors to be able to safely see their friends.
“I know that some people are uncomfortable being in large groups inside. Finding a place to see each other outdoors is a great way to relieve stress and loneliness on campus.”
This is only a short list of many events, and ideas that students can participate in to feel more as if they are getting the “college experience.” More socially distant events can be found on the Promise Instagram page @postliupromise.

The 2020 Emmys was a night of firsts as it was filmed in 137 different locations due to COVID-19 . Television host of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,”  Jimmy Kimmel, hosted the Emmys from a nearly empty Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Nominees of the event tuned in from all over the world from the comfort of their own homes. 
Kimmel opened up the awards show with a monologue that stressed the importance of television in today’s society. “We’ve been quarantined and locked down. We’ve been confined to our homes like prisoners in a dark and lonely tunnel, and what did we find in that dark and lonely tunnel” Kimmel said. “I’ll tell you what we found: a friend who is there for us 24 hours a day. Our old pal, television.” He also went on to poke fun of the fact that he was performing to an empty audience and took a jab at President Donald Trump by saying the audience was empty because it wasn’t a MAGA rally. 
The 2020 Emmys also made history as  24-year-old Zendaya Coleman became the youngest Emmy winner for best actress in a drama for her role as Rue in HBO’s “Euphoria.”
“Watching Zendaya win makes me want to start watching [Euphoria]” senior arts management major Brianna Saverino said. 
Also setting records was Canadian series “Schitt’s Creek.” The show won a total of nine Emmys this year, the most a comedy series has ever won in a single year. 
Television’s biggest prize of best drama series went to HBO’s “Succession” a chronicle of a treacherous, ultrarich media dynasty. 
Many winners of the night spoke about the importance of voting and made statements about racial injustice in the United States. Tyler Perry, who received the Governor’s award for extraordinary accomplishment, spoke about his grandmothers and how her experiences related to Black Americans. 
While taking a moment to honor those in the entertainment industry who have lost their lives this year, H.E.R. performed a rendition of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U” while a montage of pictures was played. The montage included  photos of stars like Chadwick Boseman and Naya Rivera. However, fans were disappointed that Kobe Bryant, Nick Cordero and Kelly Preston weren’t included.
“It’s a very big shame,” senior broadcasting major Anthony Cavarretta said. “Kobe did a lot for TV and deserves his place in the Emmy’s memorial just as much as he deserves a spot in a memorial for fallen athletes. ” Representatives for the Television Academy have yet to make a statement regarding why those individuals were excluded.
