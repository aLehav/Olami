Due to the recent snow days, both study days, April 30 and May 1, will be used to make up cancelled classes to ensure that the New York State Education Department (NYSED) contact hours are reached. Professors may choose to make up the missed classes on a Friday or during common hour as long as the decision is discussed with both their students and the Registrar office.
 
“I’ve missed, like, all my Philosophy classes,” said Brianna Vanacoro, a junior Fine Arts major. On the first day of the semester, Tuesday, Jan. 21, classes after 3:30 p.m. were cancelled. The following day, Wednesday, Jan. 22, all classes were cancelled due to the winter weather conditions. During the third week of school, all classes on Monday, Feb. 3 and Wednesday, Feb. 5 were once again cancelled due to inclement weather. Heavy rain, sleet and snow, caused by Winter Storm Pax, led to classes being cancelled on Feb. 13.
Students were notified of the closings through their LIU email accounts as well as via text message notifications, and on the LIU Post website. “I’ve gotten [the text message notifications] early enough before I left [to go to class],” said Andrea Senenman, a dual-degree graduate student studying Nutrition.
However, Senenman expressed concerns about missing the same class multiple times, especially since it was her Chemistry lab. “Typically, the decision on how to make up class time (due to weather, illness, etc.) is left to the discretion of the faculty. But when we close multiple times for snow closures, we need to formally establish options for how class time is made up,” said Beth Wilkow, registrar.
There is no plan as to what will happen if Long Island experiences another winter storm strong enough to close campus. However, both Wilkow and Joanne Graziano, associate provost for Student Financial Services, say that if the situation arises where the campus needs to make up more days, senior leadership of the university, Jeff Kane, (vice president of Academic Affairs), will hold a meeting to discuss options concerning make-up days.
In Nov. 2012, when Super Storm Sandy hit the area, LIU Post was closed from Oct. 31 and didn’t reopen until Nov. 7, according to the LIU Post website. To make up the contact hours, classes were instructed to meet on Fridays or Saturdays and during common hour.
“It won’t be too bad since it’s early and we’re still getting into the swing of things,” said Danielle Savarese, a junior Art Education major. “We missed more during Sandy and we made that up.”

The spring semester will be a trying time for the two new student- run shops located in Hillwood Commons. The Student Body, which opened at the end of the fall semester, and the Treat Shoppe will end up proving whether the entrepreneurial forces behind the Commons’ two additions are a hit with students on campus.

The Student Body, the on-campus boutique located on the second floor of the Commons, officially reopened on Jan. 21. The boutique, which was closed during the winter break, held its grand opening on Nov. 12, 2013, with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by students, staff, and visitors. Tamir Dayya, special projects coordinator at Post and manager of the boutique, stated that its sales have developed.
“They’ve been consistent. However, we’re getting the students more and more involved in finding the most effective way to market and increase the sales,” Dayya said. Dayya said that the boutique is “keeping an assortment of inventory and reaching out to students through social media,” he addded.
“There were days last semester when we made sales of about $500 to $600 in one day…We usually make an average of $25 to $30 a day,” said Zaroon Ahsan, a junior Finance and Marketing double major, and also a sales associate at the boutique.
“Daily, we get about 15 people who come and browse in the shop and a few of them make purchases.”
In order to boost sales, Ahsan stated, “We are using social media to promote [the store], like Instagram, Twitter, Foursquare, and Facebook. Other than that, flyers of the boutique are on the information board in Hillwood Commons, and banners are on the doors and glass windows, as well throughout the building.” The boutique will be open this semester from 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Along with a clothing store, a sweet shop was recently added on the first floor of Hillwood. Post’s second student-run business, The Post Treat Shoppe, officially opened on Wednesday, Jan. 29, in the former Center for Student Information (CSI) space.
“What sparked the idea was to add something different on campus, that would be convenient enough for students to have, and through some polling, we decided that a treat shop would be something great for students to have,” Dayya said. “We will be working with the cinema [by] accommodating show times with Post Treat Shoppe hours,” he added.
“There were flyers put on residents’ doors before the opening,” said Theresa Frank, a senior Political Science major, who is also a sales associate at the new store. Frank also stated that the Treat Shoppe is managed by a student committee that “deal[s] with marketing, decision making, and communications.” She went on to say, “It’s cool because they’re students here, and they’re different. They also don’t get paid. They’re doing it for experience, which is really cool.”
As for the student employees, “It’s a budget job, and people can apply to work at Post Treat Shoppe through JobNet. [It is] open to all majors, and all levels I believe,” said Frank.
Milton Lawrence Williams III, a senior Early Childhood Education major, believes that the new candy store is a good addition to campus. “It is a great addition to the campus for students to access. There are more snacks inside the store than the little Winnick store and there are healthier choices for students to choose from. I feel like it will be a huge success.”
The Post Treat Shoppe is open Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., and on Saturdays from 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.

The never-ending snowfall on the campus and on Long Island has created potentially dangerous situations. Students, both commuters and residents, are facing problems relating to the snow and ice.

The first part of the spring semester has been a non-stop ordeal of school closings and bad weather. Some students are finding the snow to be a big hassle, but nothing that affects them in a really bad way. For other students, the snow has caused problems and even some hazardous situations, with people slipping on the ice, and sharp icicles hanging on the roof edge, scaring others.
Kelly Urbonas, a junior Criminal Justice major, said that she hadn’t noticed any hazardous conditions on campus. However, she has a problem with the parking lots. “They don’t put down enough salt,” she said. The Snow and ice in the parking lots has caused problems for Urbonas, who said her car was recently stuck.
Inger Gine Soerboe, a senior Chemistry major, experienced sidewalks on campus that hadn’t been plowed. Soerboe has a friend who slipped on campus. “He almost missed the shuttle because he fell so hard,” she added.
All the snow days have been an annoyance for many, but some think that the closures have been necessary. Soerboe is a commuter, and she is happy that she doesn’t have to get in a car in the bad weather. “I’ve been in plenty of situations where the cars I’ve been in are not properly equipped for the winter weather, and as such I have been afraid for my life,” she said.
Jessica Beissel, a senior Childhood Education major, hadn’t heard of anything bad happening on campus, regarding the snow. However, She thought, that plowing the sidewalks right before classes could be a hazard as well. “If they don’t see a student walking by, they could potentially hit them,” she said. Beissel was also dissatisfied with the parking lots on campus. She thought that the plowing wasn’t sufficient, and that the ice and snow could be hazardous for students walking long stretches to get to class.
“We focus just on keeping main roads and paths clear for emergencies,” said Bill Kirker, head of facilities. “We also try to keep primary entrances to dorms open for access.” Kirker also said that there were other issues to take into consideration about snow removal. “How long can our people go before they are tired to the point it is unsafe? Also how the equipment holds up,” he said. “Trucks, plows, tractors, sanders, and blowers are all mechanical things that can and will eventually
break down, ” he added. “These things will slow down the snow clearing process.”
Beissel, also thought that the school closings were necessary, but she thought that the school was way too slow in giving notice to the students about the campus closing. “Not everyone lives ten minutes away,” she said. On Wednesday, Feb. 12, before 11 p.m., LIU announced that there was a delayed opening on Thursday, Feb. 13, but then decided to close down the campus for the entire day the following morning.

Male students were pregnant, someone rebuffed annoying sales people on an imaginary shoe phone, and others slept on stage when hypnotist Dale K visited the Gold Coast Cinema in Hillwood Commons on Feb. 12.

Nearly 200 curious students entered the Cinema on Wednesday night, for LIU Post’s Association for Campus Programming (ACP)’s sponsored event of the Canadian hypnotist’s show “Campus Tour.”
Those who were expecting to see a man in a tuxedo swinging a pocket watch were in for surprised when the man of the hour took to the stage in jeans and a hoodie.
Not only has Dale K abandoned the old, stereotypical props, but he also repudiates the common idea that hypnosis is a matter of controlling people. On his website, he explains that he is “proving that hypnosis is simply the power of suggestion,” and that “it’s not a matter of control. It’s really encouragement and motivation through relaxation.” If he is right about that, he successfully motivated the LIU Post student volunteers, to put it mildly.
Six students were picked to join the hypnotist on stage. Dale K made them perform several relaxing exercises, including having their eyes closed, taking deep breaths, and using their imaginations. Meanwhile, he talked constantly, fast, and with no room for deep interpretation. He encouraged them to trust their own intuition, reminded them of how well they were doing, and told them that they could feel safe.
As the volunteers got visibly more relaxed, they also became surprisingly willing to follow Dale K’s increasingly bizarre instructions. The early giggle from the audience eventually turned into hysterical laughter, and countless stunned faces, as the show escalated.
Invisible body parts, nudity, horrible smells, extreme heat and freezing cold were just a few of the things the student volunteers imagined they were experiencing.
Dale K was happy with the evening. “It was successful. My volunteers really managed to get motivated and use their imagination,” he said. The hypnotist explained that every show is different from the others, depending on the volunteers. “Tonight, they were quite tame. Usually, volunteers tend to be more physical,” he added.
At one point, a girl was allowed to use Dale K’s “magical wand.” She learned that a touch with the wand on the forehead would result in instant sleeping. However, when a “bee” landed on her forehead, and she was told to use the wand to kill it, she did not hesitate. A quick hit and she collapsed on her chair. Without thinking, she had put herself to sleep instantaneously.
Jesus Cardenas, a senior Business Film major, was one of the student volunteers—perhaps mostly recognized for giving birth to “little Baby Jesus.”
Friends and strangers surrounded Cardenas after the show. Everyone was curious to hear about his experience, but most of all they were eager to shake hands with him. And no wonder why; every handshake made him jump around like a cowboy, swinging an imaginary lasso in the air and cheering “Yee haw!”
The funny cowboy imitation was Dale K’s last trick of the night, before telling the volunteers that they would not remember the show as well as their own participation.
Cardenas was laughing, but clearly confused, as his friends told him about the night he could not seem to remember.
“People are asking about my baby. How did I get pregnant? It’s weird, random. I don’t know what to tell you,” Cardenas said.
Apparently, a successful hypnosis show doesn’t need any hired actors, pocket watches, or tuxedos. All it takes is a talented guy in jeans and a hoodie, and it will either be mind blowing or mind motivating.
Dale K delivered a show that will not soon be forgotten. Well, at least for some of us.

More than 50 faculty and students attended the Thoughtbox Lecture series at LIU Post, on Wednesday, Feb. 12, during common hour. Mark Fasciano, founder of Canrock, the early stage technology venture capital fund that moved onto campus in November, gave the first lecture in a new LIU Post Thoughtbox Lecture Series. He is the co-founder of this lecture series, which shows students how a startup begins as an idea and ends in success. The new lecture series “is an exclusive opportunity for our students to get to know Mark and hear the struggles he endured early on in his career,”said LIU Post’s Ryan Attard, an employee of Canrock and the new director of Entrepreneurship at LIU.
“The goal of this lecture series is to encourage and inspire promising young entrepreneurs here at LIU,” Attard added.
During his first lecture, Fasciano spoke to faculty and students about his business, and how to start a successful business of their own. Fasciano stated that he kept Canrock on Long Island because he and his partners grew up here, and it is also cost effective. “It is close enough to the city so we can attract young people and get into the city in less than one hour. The cost basis is much lower than actually being in the city,” said Fasciano. One of the main differences about his company from other companies is that Canrock is an open “incubator” for ideas—there are no walls or barriers, thus keeping ideas from flowing freely.
Fasciano stated that his company is unique from most venture capital funds because Canrock does not just fund money blindly. “We don’t just write out million dollar checks and hand it out,” he said. He talked about how Canrock is also different because it funds multiple ideas all at one location, which he said, allows for faster and more efficient exchange of ideas.
When Fasciano was asked what can be done to establish more successful startups on Long Island, as well as in other places, he answered that talent, networking, and capital are necessary to get a business started. He also added that institutions that are interested in the business eventually fund the rest of the remaining capital and resources. Fasciano acknowledged that the media plays a huge role in the success of a budding business.
Fasciano was concerned with the opportunities that he and this lecture series will provide for the students at LIU Post. Interested students can go to Canrock’s temporary offices in the basement of the library to see how startup companies function. He ended his presentation by saying that he looks forward to working with LIU Post and the entrepreneur program in the near future.
The next segment of the Thoughtbox Lecture series continues with Mark Simon on Feb. 27 in the Hillwood Lecture Hall. Following lectures include Hilary Topper on March 25, Eric Ho on April 1, and Jeff Leventhal on April 16. All lectures will take place during common hour.

Tamir Daaya, a Post Marketing alumnus, took the new position of Special Projects coordinator in the Office of Student Life at LIU Post. As coordinator, Dayya is the manager of The Post Treat Shoppe, The Student Body, and The End Zone, all located in Hillwood Commons.
As the manager of the first three student businesses, there is a lot to keep track of, but that is not a problem for Dayya. “I’m not left in the dark when it comes to managing any of the stores. The student employees and the students on the committee play a big role in keeping the operations of each location running smoothly.”
Dayya explained that there are challenges in running any kind of business, but the best way to handle challenges is with cooperation. “The key is working together to work through them [challenges] and create learning experiences along the way.”
Managing three stores takes time, Dayya handles this challenge by being where he is needed. “I devote time equally to each location, or allocate my time as needed most. If there seems to be more attention needed at one location [compared to another], I’ll make sure I spend time at that particular location in order to address any issues, and keep my time balanced going forward.”
When managing a business, and in this case, managing the stores, there are a lot of people to deal with every day. However, that is Dayya’s favorite part of the job. “I really enjoy being able to work with so many different people. Whether I’m meeting students or university personnel, everyone has something interesting about them,” said Dayya.
“It’s impressive that he was a former student here recently and is now the manager of all three student businesses,” said Regina Fierro, a junior Film major and an employee.
“He is a good manager. He always stops by to make sure everything is okay,” said Lucie Chrastecka, a sophomore Pre-Med and Biology major. “He also does a great job working around schedules since we’re all full-time students.”
There will be a future for more student-run businesses at Post, according to Dayya. “I’m sure there will continue to be many changes on campus, including new businesses to make Post an even more engaging place.”
When new business ideas arise, Dayya makes sure that students approve. “I prefer to keep adding businesses with the students in mind.”
Dayya explained that students, staff members, and administrators made the decisions concerning the stores in Hillwood Commons. “We all decide together on what would be the greatest additions [for the] campus.”
He believes that the businesses are important for LIU Post. “A major factor in the creation of the businesses was finding a way to generate more scholarship for students. Half of our profit is dedicated to university-wide scholarships and the other half is spent on the addition of student run businesses.”
The businesses will survive into the future, according to Dayya. “Entrepreneurship has been rapidly increasing and sweeping the nation, and LIU is ahead of the game by adopting the future of higher education before anyone else.”

The LIU Chinese Student and Scholar Association (CSSA) held a celebration in the campus chapel, a week after the Chinese New Year, on Feb. 8. Traditional cuisine, dance, and music made Chinese students feel more at home and allowed other students the opportunity to embrace the culture.
Although the exact beginning of the New Year’s celebration in China is unclear, it is estimated that the Chinese New Year history can be traced back thousands of years. One of the most famous legends about the origin of Chinese New Year is that of Nien, which is believed, among Chinese people, as an extremely cruel and ferocious beast that ate people and their crops on New Year’s Eve. The ancient Chinese fought to keep Nien away by pasting red paper couplets on doors, lighting torches and scaring it with firecrackers. Legend has it that Nien fears the color red, the light of fire, and loud noises. Then, early the next morning, they would celebrate their success and hope year after year.
The date of celebration varies from mid-winter to early spring. Chinese months are decided by the lunar calendar, with each month beginning on the darkest day. New Year festivities traditionally start on the first day of the month and continue until the 15, when the moon is the brightest. The day this year was Jan. 31.
At the campus celebration, “There were hundreds of students who came to enjoy food and dance and song,” said Xiao Di Wu, a graduate Accounting student. “Chinese New Year is the most important annual event if you were born in China, just like Thanksgiving Day is for Americans. People are supposed to be at home, so this is very important for CSSA to hold the festival for those away from home,” she added.
“I was working on that day, but I ran to show up there on my break. It had a nice atmosphere,” said Zhang Qiqi, a graduate Accounting major, who played piano at the festival. CSSA sponsored a dinner of fish cake, dumplings,
Chinese sushi, and some traditional desserts ordered from a local Chinese restaurant.
“The New Year’s Eve dinner is the most important dinner for all Chinese. Usually, this is the family reunion dinner. At the New Year’s Eve dinner, normally fish will be served. Dumplings are the most important dish in northern China—these two dishes signify prosperity. The majority of Chinese will have New Year’s Eve dinner at home instead of at a restaurant.”
It is often difficult to make everyone feel at home. However, Michel Yiyang Hu, a junior Nutrition major, said she had so much fun and she was able to make many friends at the event. She also mentioned that she was one of the performers at the festival. “I began practicing two weeks in advance. It was not a traditional Chinese dance, but Hip Hop, because that’s what I have practiced back home in China. I thought it would be more fun to respect American culture as well as Chinese culture.”
For Trista Yang Lu, graduate Clinical Mental Health Counseling major, who had been taking care of International students as an orientation leader and is now an academic advisor, felt that the club did a great job organizing the event despite her absence.
“This was my very first day [that I didn’t take] care of anything. I had been observing and seeing what was going on during preparation. Overall, everyone did a great job, and I am so proud of the team,” said Yang Lu.
Even though the event was a Chinese celebration, all students were welcomed. “I saw a few students who [were] not Chinese and enjoyed our cultures and foods. We all were so happy about it. CSSA always offers a chance to meet more and more new friends. We welcome students, who have different cultural backgrounds,” Lu added.
The next Chinese New Year is on Feb. 18, 2015, 370 days away. CSSA plans to hold its next festival on the weekend after Chinese New Year’s day.

With the spring semester off to an icy start, many students might be thinking about heading off to another country, perhaps to escape the snow, maybe to immerse into a different culture. Students interested in traveling overseas, while maintaining their academic obligations, can take advantage of Post’s Study Abroad program.

The LIU Post Study Abroad program offers many opportunities for students from all majors to study abroad. Patricia Seaman, director of the Study Abroad program, encourages students to seize the opportunity to travel abroad. “We currently have between 75-100 students who study abroad each academic year, but we are always trying to increase awareness and participation in the program,” she said.
All students in good standing, who have completed one full-time semester, are eligible to study abroad. Seaman believes the largest misconception that prevents students from participating is its perceived inaccessibility. “Students, who do study abroad are often amazed at how easy it is to put the whole process together. Financial aid is available, every major field of study can partake, and study abroad is an experience available for every student,” Seaman explained.
The program has a couple of standard destinations. “Australia and England are the most popular destinations; perhaps because they are both LIU programs, so financial aid and scholarships directly apply,” Seaman said. In other words, these affiliated programs allow students at Post to use the financial aid they normally are entitled to, including most scholarships.
However, there are lots of alternative routes for students who seek to experience other countries. In fact, LIU host’s Global College, which holds centers in China, Costa Rica, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. LIU Global is attractive to students participating in the four-year-long Bachelor of the Arts program. However, the school’s involvement in Global College makes it an option for students to visit these countries even for semester-long studies, according to the LIU Global website.
Each regional program provides an overview of the history, politics, culture, ecology, and economy of the area. In addition, students take essential language courses and have the freedom to choose from an array of courses, including independent studies.
Nevertheless, if an especially attractive country or field of interest applies to a student that is not offered directly by LIU Post, the option to work with a company indirectly through the Study Abroad program counselors is also possible. However, these non-affiliated programs do not necessarily grant students their scholarships from Post.
Christoffer Andersson, an international student from Sweden, is familiar with the concept of a non-affiliate program in which his dream of studying in Hong Kong, China, became real. “LIU Post did not have direct exchange programs with Hong Kong Polytechnic University. So instead, the organization I went with, GlobaLinks, organized apartments in the central areas of the city, which worked perfectly fine,” he said.
The many alternatives to go for, makes it difficult to list specific costs. “The cost is dependent on each individual program. However, the affiliated programs will cover tuition abroad, although room and board fees will vary depending on the program,” Seaman said.
Due to Andersson’s choice of picking a non-affiliated program, he had to pay slightly more than the tuition at Post. Although, taking advantage of the opportunity to visit China was, according to him, definitely worth the price. “Hong Kong is an amazing city for students because of its extraordinary mixture of attractions. Everything from high quality nightlife to cultural, and historical monuments lies behind every corner,” Andersson said.
Too many options can leave interested students feeling overwhelmed. Therefore, Seaman emphasizes the importance of asking the program counselors for assistance.
“Each student’s program is unique and developed in conjunction with academic counseling to ensure that the student will receive not only an enriching experience, but also one that will complement and enhance the work they do on campus,” she said. Seaman also points out the fact that the vast majority of programs will give students credits to their major here at Post, which makes the valuable time abroad even less of a waste.
Students applying for an affliate program, can start the program the beginning of their sophmore year, through the first semester of their senior year, and before the beginning of their senior year in case of a non-affliates program. The program generally works on one or two semesters; fall, spring or summer.
“I would highly recommend every student at Post to take advantage of a semester abroad,” Andersson said. “From other people, I know who have been a semester abroad, they only have positive feelings towards it.”
Every semester, representatives from the different programs come to inform students interested in studying abroad. Students, who missed the information table on Feb. 12, in the Hillwood Common’s Lobby, during common hour, can attend the next sessions on Feb. 19, and 25, every date represents a different destination.

As the semester rolls on, many students on campus are excited and anxious for spring break. This year’s spring break begins Saturday, March 8 and will end on Sunday, March 17. This is a time for students to take a nice break from school, get away, relax, and regroup as they get ready for an intense second half of the semester. Some students take vacations, some become couch potatoes, and some students, who dorm, sometimes use this break as time to spend with their families.
Destiny Gellar, a junior Public Relations major, is extremely anxious for this year’s spring break. “I really can’t wait until the break comes,” said Gellar. “My friends and I planned a trip to Miami and I’ve never been—it’s going to be great.”
Taking a vacation seem like a popular choice for college students during spring break. Popular destinations appear to be Virginia Beach, Miami or Orlando Florida, California, Cabo Mexico, the Caribbean, and Atlantic City, just to name a few. Cruises are also popular for college students around this time of year. Danny King, a senior Media Arts major, goes on a cruise every year during spring break with his family. “It’s become a family tradition since I’ve been to college,” said King. “We like to switch up the destination every year, this year’s trip is to Aruba.”
After experiencing a brutal winter this semester, some students around campus might be anxious to get away and encounter some beautiful weather during spring break. Freshman Psychology major Dominique Jenkins said she just wants good weather during spring break. “I’m staying home for break, but I just hope its good weather in March,” Jenkins added. “This winter has been very cold and annoying.”
Not all students look forward to the 10-day break. Michael Schule, a sophomore Political Science major, believes that spring break is pointless. “I’d rather not take a break in the spring, we should just continue the semester and start our summer early,” said Schule. When asking Schule what he’s going to do over the break, he replied, “Nothing—I have nothing planned. That’s why I’d rather be in school.”
Spring break is three weeks away, and will hopefully be an exciting and relaxing time for students. After spring break, school-work will only get more challenging and frustrating, so use spring break to relax and recharge.

Social media is part of our everyday lives. We are confronted with it wherever we go, in everything we do. It appears that social media with its inherent urge of constant and silent communication is forcing us to neglect our desire to be truly alone once in a while, to reflect and to relax.
It has been often discussed, and debated, whether technology and social media is keeping us more connected, or if it is actually keeping us from face-to-face interactions. And what about our ability to actually be alone? Are we still in the position to see being alone as a positive and beneficial state? A basic need or interest of a human being is to stay connected and to be part of a community, according to American Psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.
People that set up a profile on a social media platform become a part of the online community and get a feeling of connectivity and togetherness. However, it has become evident that these new methods of communication have also influenced and altered our ability to be alone.
Nowadays, young adults are confronted with technology very early in their lives and are exposed to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This may be prior to having the ability to judge the impact these platforms will have on their lives.
Consequently, they tend to look for some sort of entertainment or people they can connect with.Ask yourself this question: What would happen if you were to leave your house for an afternoon and forgot your phone? Or worse, what would happen if your phone were to break?
“I would feel uncomfortable because nowadays you are expected to be reachable almost 24/7. I think I would feel stressed in the beginning because I’m not used to it anymore,” said Philipp Lutz, a senior Business major.
“Not having a phone for a while, definitely has its perks. It can be a good thing to be alone. It allows you to sort things out in your mind and focus on what’s important to you—all you need to worry about is yourself,” Lutz added.
While communication is an integral part of our social life, as well as a desire to feel connected to our community, it is also good to be alone once in a while. If we do not have the ability to be alone and feel good about it, we will only know how it is to feel lonely.

“American Idiot” is a passionate punk rock musical, beautifully adapted from Green Day’s 2004 album with the same name, by director Michael Mayer, and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong. The punk rocker performed the role of St. Jimmy occasionally throughout the original run at the St. James Theatre on Broadway from 2010 through 2011. The show is centered on punk culture, and is heavily influenced by Armstrong’s view of the world. It is peppered with political opinions and his abhorrence towards former president George W. Bush, and the U.S. Military presence in Iraq and the Middle East.
Spectators at the Tilles Center on Sunday, Feb. 16 were introduced to a crowd of young people sick and tired of mass media hysteria. The group of anarchist youths energetically exclaimed their opposition to the mainstream media in the form of one of Green Day’s most popular songs, “American Idiot.” The stage’s backdrop was covered with
flat screen TVs in an urban setting, which displayed visuals saturated with political messages and other graphics during the electrical performance—over an hour and a half long. A drum set, keyboard and several guitarists were subtly placed into the setting.
The three main characters, Johnny (Jared Nepite), Will (Casey O’Farrell) and Tunny (Dan Tracy) are all fed up with their wasteful lives in the suburbs, optimistically leaving for the city, while carrying only their backpacks and guitars in hand. Will finds out that his girlfriend is pregnant, thus deciding to stay behind. Their drinking and partying with new friends, along to the song “Holiday” highlights the distance from his friends.
Instead of acting out scenes in a total dramatic fashion, most of the musical is sung, and laden with punk attitude and songs. Music from the titular album is cleverly adapted to fit scenarios, making the musical a spectacular experience.
Nepite and O’Farrell were excellent singers: clear, but a little rough, just like Armstrong. Tracy’s voice tended to be a little high-pitched. Trouble with sound quality was a re-occurring issue, as female voices were clearly drowned out by instruments.
The variety of songs went from slow ballads to head banging punk rock, and if you hadn’t heard any of the songs before, such as “American Idiot,” “21 Guns,” “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” and “Time of Your Life,” you might have spent the last dedcade under a rock. Green Day has charted well in the past, with many of their singles keeping prime radio time for long periods of time.
The musical highlights how the media lucratively portrays officers as heroes; this is when, and why, Tunny enlists in the Army. At this time, the character St. Jimmy (Carson Higgins), Johnny’s devious alter ego, takes the stage. Higgins’ voice, too, was powerful and vibrant. The character influences Johnny, the character that the audience spent the most time with, into doing heavier drugs, as the story progresses.
Falling in love with Whatsername, played by the agile and talented Olivia Puckett, Johnny continues down a path of self-destruction. Puckett’s character is given an impersonal name to emphasize how much of a daze Johnny is in. The relationship is beautifully performed and wonderfully credible.
“American Idiot” is dreary, yet energetic. The characters go from being enthusiastic about the future, to spiraling into an abyss on their respective paths. A highlight of the show was the joint singing of “Wake Me Up When September Ends,” a somber song, and a prime example of how well the adaptation fit.
“American Idiot” has the potential to make you both laugh and cry. The mix of punk rock, love, heartbreak, sex, drugs, rock’n’roll, tenderness and pain can put you through an emotional roller coaster. If you
are waiting for a happy ending, you might be disappointed. The last song was met by a standing ovation and, despite the dark scenario, the characters rebelliously seem hopeful of the future, just as they did at the start.

Royal blue, hunter green, burgundy, and maroon are the colors of the season for Autumn/Winter 2014. New York Fashion Week (NYFW) displayed a plethora of colors, draped sweaters and dresses, and streamlined coats within various fashion shows at the Lincoln Center in New York City, which ran from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13.
Some of the trends seen in many runway shows this year were the layering of knit sweaters over tailored buttoned down blouses, fur-lined coats, and cape-like coats, with large hoods. However, every runway show displayed a variety of different designs, trends and patterns that showcased the unique tastes and talents of each designer.
The Lacoste runway show displayed clean cut, sleek and streamlined clothing during its runway show. Models who walked the stage gracefully donned knee length pea coats and varsity jackets with zipper detailing. Oversized wool sweaters, skirts and cropped tops with abstract patterns also made an appearance in this year’s runway show.
Alexander Wang created show-stopping pieces for his Autumn/ Winter collection, including flowing dresses, pea coats, and leather boots to make any shoe lover swoon. The models that walked the Alexander Wang runway wore knee-high black leather boots, which sported an open back, and were embellished with a white sole and heel. These edgy boots are clean cut and appear easy to wear, as the back of the boot is completely open, exposing the models calves and heels. Long down coats with paisley designs and fur hoods also made an appearance on the runway.
The MM6, Maison Martin Margiela collection presented an edgier side to clothing for its Autumn/Winter collection. The clothes worn by models were very dark, with the use of black, white, and occasionally red materials. If one did not have the opportunity to be a part of the fervent runway audience, they could simply watch it online live from the homepage of the Maison Martin Margiela site. To the left of the partial runway was a white stage set up for a live performance by Sean Nicholas Savage.
The singer performed a slow ballad as models walked the runway, one by one slowly encircling the performer as the song continued. Long white dresses with cut out side panels, red sweaters, white blouses, and black sleeveless varsity jackets were a few of the various articles of clothing displayed during the runway show.
If you are looking to invest in clothing with more color this 2014 fall season, now is the time to invest. Although black and grey are colors of warmth and sign of approaching fall, it never hurts to add some other colors to your wardrobe. The 2014 NYFW runway shows taught fashion connoisseurs how to add just the right touch of color to their wardrobes for the upcoming fall season.

The Lady Pioneers (17-5) started their three game road trip on Wed. Feb. 12 when they traveled to Connecticut to take on the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights (6-17). The Pioneers shined and made it four straight victories for them, winning at a clip of 83-72.

The scoring for the Pioneers was jump started by senior guard Alexis Peters, who nailed a three pointer. That shot was a precursor for the first half and the rest of the game, as Peters finished an assist shy of a triple-double. The first half was a tight contest, as neither team led by more than four points. The score was knotted up at 38 at the break.
At the half, junior guard Chelsea Williams and senior guard Kiki Sears each had 10 points, and Peters was stuffing the stat sheet as well with nine points, five rebounds, and four assists. For the Purple Knights, junior guards Tiara Ariz and Jenna Hoffman were the high scorers with 10 each.
After a quick 6-0 run to start the second half by the hosts, it was Sears who stepped up and nailed two three pointers to tie the game. After a Peters’ three, she buried another one from deep giving the Pioneers a six-point lead. Their lead was pushed to nine with free throws from Williams. Looking to respond, the Purple Knights went on an 8-0 run and later on, took the lead with under eight minutes remaining. The Pioneers answered that run with a 9-1 run of their own and never looked back as they earned the win.
Sears finished with 24 points, while Williams poured in 22 and added seven rebounds. Peters had an all-around game with 16 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists. In the second half, the Pioneers stepped up big time as they outscored their opponents by 11 and held them to 33 percent from the field.
In their second matchup of the week on Friday, Feb. 15, the Lady Pioneers continued their stellar play when they took the court against the Dowling College Golden Lions (9-12) and won by a score of 61-51.
The Golden Lions opened the scoring and led 2-0, but a 12-0 run by the Pioneers stopped
the possibility of any momentum in favor of the Golden Lions. Williams scored seven points during the run. With a slim four point lead and halftime approaching, the Pioneers went on a solid run again, this time a 10-3 run that was capped off by a layup from senior forward Shayna Gatling with three seconds in the first half. The green and gold took a 32-21 lead going into the break.
The defense was pivotal in the first half, as the Golden Lions were held to fewer than 22 percent shooting and to only 21 points. The Pioneers were also forcing the action on defense as they caused nine turnovers.
In the second half, the Golden Lions came out strong, putting a 10-1 spurt together and later on in the half, cut the deficit to just two points at 38-36. The Pioneers responded to the strong showing by the Golden Lions with nine straight points to go up 11 points.
The lead was pushed to its limit of 12 when Peters nailed two free throws later in the half. Williams put the game on ice with under a minute remaining as she nailed four free throws, and the Pioneers cruised to a 10-point victory.
For the Pioneers, Williams had 26 points, eight rebounds, and chipped in on the defensive end with two steals, while Gatling snatched 13 boards and finished with nine points. For the Golden Lions, sophomore guard Krstina Surlan was the high scorer with 14.
Coach Moore and the Lady Pioneers hit the hardwood again on Wednesday, Feb. 19 when they travel to play the Mavericks of Mercy College. Tipoff is scheduled for 5:30 p.m.

“Bury the hatchet” is an American English phrase meaning “to make peace.” Falling in Reverse and Escape the Fate are two post-hard- core bands, who did not have a peaceful past. The Falling in Reverse front man Ronnie Radke had been the previous front man for Escape the Fate. In 2006, Radke was involved in a fatal shooting in Las Vegas. While Radke was not the behind the shooting, he was indicted with battery. Due to the charge and his past with drugs, he was sentenced to five years’ probation.

In June 2008, Radke failed to report to his parole officer and was then was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison. After this, Escape the Fate kicked Radke out and replaced him with former Bless the Fall lead man Craig Mabbitt. In 2008, Radke created a new band from behind bars, Falling in Reverse. By 2010, they began recording their first studio album. The bands previously had a large rivalry with each other. Fans were split down the line, and Falling in Reverse’s first album trashed Escape the Fate through the choice of lyrical content.
On Oct. 28, 2013, the bands both annouced that they would be touring together. After the shock factor wore off, Mabbitt and Radke had an interview together in which they shared that they wanted to put the feud behind them and become friends. They named their tour “Bury the Hatchet,” and it set to begin in January 2014. On Jan. 30 at the Best Buy Theater in New York City, bands Survive This! and Chelsea Grin opened up for Escape the Fate and Falling in Reverse. The venue was pretty large and it was a sold out show.
Doors opened at 6:30 p.m., and within minutes, the entire venue was packed. At around 8 p.m., Escape the Fate graced stage. To say the crowd was excited is an understatement; there was an immediate uproar of screaming, yelling, and singing. The band played a good variety of older songs as well as songs off their newest album, “Ungrateful.”
After many crowd surfers, and a few intense mosh pits, the band ended their set with “This War is Ours,” a fan favorite. After Escape the Fate’s set list, Falling in Reverse took over. They started their set list with a video: A mock intro of the “Full House” theme song featuring the Falling in Reverse band members. After the video, they took the stage
by storm. After another amazing set, they ended their main set list with “Raised by Wolves,” the band’s first single. They were called out for an encore and played two songs “Alone”, which is a single from their second and most recent album “Fashionably Late,” and “The Drug in Me is You.” After the encore, the band left the stage once more—but not for the last time.
All of a sudden, the entire crowd started chanting “Situations.” The song is from Radke’s first album with Escape the Fate, which is arguably one of the bands best songs. After the chanting, Radke and Mabbitt took the stage with another Escape the Fate former member Max Green, who had been one of Radke’s closest friends. The three of them performed two of Radke’s song with Escape the Fate. They played “Situations” and “Not Good Enough for Truth in Cliché.” The entire venue was in an uproar. It was truly an amazing show and a once in a lifetime experience.

Sofie Hoff, senior Art major, will be holding the reception for her show “Artificiality” at the Student Art League gallery in Hillwood Commons today, Feb. 19, from 5 to 8 p.m. Hoff will be showing a new collection of conceptual pieces using plastic cups that bend light as her Visual Art senior and Honors thesis. The exhibit will run until Feb. 22.
Hoff’s work has varied in the past, using ceramics, paints, photography, and charcoals predominantly reinforcing dark psychological themes with her gaunt and skeletal subjects. The Swedish artist makes use of shadow and light in ways that reflect a sense of isolation—even within abstract pieces. Hoff spoke with The Pioneer before the opening of her show.
The Pioneer (TP): What can we expect from the show? Is there any particular overarching theme you have been exploring?
Sofie Hoff (SH): You can prepare yourself to see a lot of plastic cups (laughs). The show is an installation of conceptual sculptures entirely made out of plastic cups, and in addition to that, I have incorporated different light sources, light effects and video art. The concept of the show aims to address the issue of what artificial materials we are surrounding ourselves with, and how that might affect us and the environment in the long run; how the synthetic materials and unnatural, manufactured realities that we create for ourselves remain the same and completely unaffected by external stress such as time.
TP: What influences your work? Is it other artists, music, nature, social interaction? What makes you tick?
SH: This project actually started in 2012, during my first semester here at Post. I made a spiral-shaped piece and shot a video of it, which was featured in an international online video art festival that my Professor Ryan Seslow curated. I felt like the project had potential, so I decided to develop it further for my Honors thesis and senior project.
I would like to say that my biggest inspiration for this show has been my genuine interest in how we perceive reality and how our modern ways of living today isn’t sustainable; neither through an environmental perspective nor when it comes to our health, especially psychological. When it comes to artists that have inspired my work, I think I have to say, Tara Donovan in this particular case. I love her work and I am happy that I was able to experience a show of hers in person this summer.
TP: Any particular plans after graduating from Post?
SH: I want to move back to Europe! If I can’t get a job or an internship that keeps me in New York after I am done in December, I will move to Berlin, rent a studio and just do art for a year or so to see where it might take me.
TP: Do you have a personal definition of “art” or “creativity”? What does art mean to you, and your life?
SH: I think we all have our own definitions of art, and I believe art could be anything and everything. “Art” has several meanings for me. In general, it almost resemblances more a lifestyle to me than physical art works. [For example,] looking at things and being aware of all different perspectives, gives me a greater understanding of things.
TP: If you could sit down and have a drink with any artist, dead or alive, who would it be? And what would your conver- sation be like?
SH: I think it is a tie between Kurt Cobain, Edvard Munch and Alex Pardee. They have inspired me a lot on many different levels at various times throughout my last 10-15 years or so. But I would be really happy if I could meet Edvard Munch, especially because he has had a huge influence on my paintings and drawings. I would pick his brain about what art means to him and ask him very personal questions about his mental health and psychological condition, because that is what initially inspires me the most.

Hailing from Montauk, New York, The Montauk Project devises a sound that mixes the grunge of Sound Garden, the garage rock of The Black Keys and the beats of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Montauk Project has been getting some proper attention from local press as they prepare the release of their debut album, “Belly of the Beast”, on March 25.
“Making this album hasn’t been about fame,” said drummer Jas- per Conroy. “It’s about affecting people—making them gravitate towards the music. It’s not who you are. It’s what you create.” A roller coaster mix of both energetic and slow-paced tunes highlights the album. A variety of influences help keep the music sounding fresh on each track.
The band is thankful of their hometown roots and it seems to be a major reason for the album sounding unique. “We’re not affected like bands in Brooklyn,” said guitarist Mark Schiavoni. “We don’t have the city around us, so we’re left to our own devices.”
“Belly of the Beast” isn’t the greatest album to be released from the Long Island music scene. It lacks the quality to age well. It’s an album that can be forgotten about as the band keeps releasing tracks and progressing musically. The production quality is pretty clean, but in comparison to bands like Life Between Sleep and Persona, it falls be- hind. However, as a whole, the album succeeds in keeping the listener’s attention for its length.
As a full-length album, it’s much longer than what has been coming out of the Long Island music scene recently. The scene has had EP after EP, so the bands have only had to hold the listener for twenty minutes or so, compared to The Montauk Project whose album is almost double that. Bywater and Persona have both released EPs that have been excellent, and while “Belly of the Beast” doesn’t live up to the same hype, it’s great to have something longer than five or six songs.
“It was very D.I.Y. [do it yourself] and it was all by ourselves,” said Conroy, who was happy with the sound of the album. “It’s an evolu- tion throughout the album. We were always changing and always grow- ing,” Schiavoni added.
Both Schiavoni and Conroy agreed they were extremely proud of the title track, “The Beast.”
“It’s a metaphor,” said Conroy. “It’s dealing with struggles, the pain, things being too tough, and overcoming things.” The album builds up energy at the first track and the feeling solidly continues throughout the album.
As for now, The Montauk Project are playing shows in Montauk and New York City, preparing the album release party on March 31.
“Eventually we want to do another album,” said Schiavoni. “We’re waiting for this to be released, and see how it goes with the audi- ence.” The band also has a new single titled, “Lady in White”.
The Montauk Project’s “The Belly of Beast” is definitely worth a listen. It has energy, pop, and some killer tunes on it.
Key Tracks: “The Beast” and “The Rainbow Song”

The LIU Post men’s Basketball team endured a busy week as they travelled to the University of Bridgeport and Dowling College. The Pioneers commenced a three-game road trip with an 83-68 loss to East Coast Conference rival, Bridgeport Knights, at the Harvey Hubbell Gymnasium in Bridgeport, Conn.
Leading 15-14, six minutes into the game, the Purple Knights ac- celerated into a game-changing 19-4 run to extend their advantage to 34-18 by the eight minute mark. The first 20 minutes proved to be all the Purple Knights needed, as the Pioneers only managed to close the gap to as few as 13 points (81-68) by full time.
Even though senior forward, Vaughn Allen, posted a double-double (14 points and 10 rebounds) against the Knights, he was disappointed with the final score. “We played with no energy and acted as though Bridgeport was going to give us the victory. We didn’t play with any urgency, and it showed on the score- board,” Allen said.
In spite of the final result, sophomore guard Akosa Maduegbunam, contributed a six-point, five-rebound effort. Freshman and junior guards Jared Hall and P.J. Torres added five points apiece, and junior forward Charles McCann chipped in five boards, four points, two assists and a pair of steals in 26 minutes off the bench.
Despite their loss, the Pioneers made a swift recovery as they got back on the road to face Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y. Prior to the game, Allen stated, “We have to come out ready to play from tip-off. Dowling is a good team and they feed off their crowd at home.” He then added, “It’s one of the toughest places to play in the league, so we can’t make mistakes. We have to be ball strong and make the right plays.”
In a game where neither squad led by more than nine points, the LIU Post Pioneers suffered a 71-66 loss to Dowling in an East Coast Conference match-up at Dowling Gymnasium in Oakdale, N.Y. Although the Pioneers managed to equalize the score to 37 by the beginning of the second half, the Golden Lions came out on top, as a lay-up followed by two free throws sealed their victory.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers are back in action Wednesday, Feb. 19, when they conclude their three-game road trip at Mercy. Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m.

After a comfortable lead from first splash during the three-day- long event, the Pioneer swim team stood for an impressive victory in the Metropolitian Conference Championships in Pistachaway, N.J. on Feb. 14-16.
On Friday, Feb. 14, senior Captain Malin Hedberg took the lone Pioneer win, as she swam the 500-yard freestyle on a time of 5:07:21, earning 32 fresh points to her team.
Thereafter, the green machine held their top mark by bringing in multiple top-10 finishes throughout the day. In the 200-yard individual medley, four Post members reached the wall in second through fifth-place marks. Tamara Garriock led the way, followed by Johanna Petters- son, who topped her second-best school history time with 2:03:39.
On Saturday, Feb. 15, the green and gold retained remarkable top performances. The highlight of the day came after the 200-yard relay team-meet, where the Pioneers marked a new pool and Conference record, by beating the previous record set by the University of Florida. This also meant a historic new Post top-time.
Once again, the green machine dominated the events’ top place. The final individual event of the day was the 100-yard backstroke, where three women from Post managed to finish first, second, and third. Seren Jones won the meet with the third best time in Pioneer history, as she put her hand to the wall at the time of 55:97.
After last year’s success, there was no doubt that the green machine aimed to bring home the Conference Championship title again. By overwhelming their opponents in the first meet, and setting the bar high, they were comfortable enough to hold on to their lead against runner-up Bridgeport. ”We are all pumped to finish this final session with a bang and bring home the Conference Champions title again,”said Seren Jones before their last day of meets—and so they did.
When counting the score from the weekend, the Pioneers reached 1355 points, which was almost 300 points ahead of the number two Bridgeport.
Next up will be the ECAC’s in Annapolis, M.D., on Feb. 28 to March 2, where Maureen Travers and her roster hope to achieve the same great, before heading to defend the National Championship.

Coming off a remarkable season where they captured their fourth National championship, LIU Post women’s Lacrosse looks to get back to work as the two-time defending NCAA Division II National champions, behind the lights of senior attacker, Jackie Sileo. Sileo has been honored as Pre-season Offensive Player of the Year after putting on a show and scoring a sensational 178 points; consisting of 61 goals and 117 assists as a junior. The Pioneers hope to take advantage of her leadership as they begin the quest for another title.
Following a 20-0 season, the Pioneers are well aware of their outstanding potential and high expectations of a three-peat. Although they’re ranked the number one team in the nation, the Pioneers cannot get too ahead of themselves and give other teams any daylight. They need to put the puzzle together one piece at a time. With a cohesive group and a number of returning core players, the Pioneers look to be in the driver’s seat heading into the season.
Led by head coach Meghan McNamara, the Pioneers continue to develop strong bonds and establish good fundamentals. McNamara also has two newly acquired assistants Alyssa Kildare and Dominique Mosca. Kildare was a big standout when she played lacrosse in college for four years at Johns Hopkins University, where she was an excellent defensive force. Mosca was a phenomenal goalkeeper when she played for the Pioneers and helped them achieve two National championships in 2012 and 2013. The Pioneers are so experienced in championship play that it’s nearly impossible to not declare them as favorites.
Looking ahead, the Pioneers will open the book of 2014 when they host Bloomsburg on March 1, in a non-league battle at Hickox field in Brookville, N.Y. at 2 p.m.
