 The softball team played a victorious double header at home on Sunday, March 24, against the Wilmington Wildcats, putting them on a seven-game win streak for the season. The Long Island Ducks Fastpitch travel team coached by LIU alumna and former softball team member, Paige Swantek, cheered the Pio-neers on from the stands.
Wilmington scored the first run of the game during inning one. LIU turned it around at the bottom of the inning when sophomore Breanna Klaiber hit a single into left field. A throw error advanced her to second base and sent junior Abbey Fortin across home plate to score the first run for the Pioneers. Klaiber followed her home after sophomore Hanna Finkelstein hit a double to left center, placing LIU in the lead, 2-1. Wilmington tied the score at the top of the fourth, giving Ducks team members a game to remember. 
At the bottom of the fifth, Finkelstein grounded the ball between shortstop and third base, landing her a sure single. A bunt from junior Megan Sneeden advanced Finkelstein’s pinch runner, Ashley Casazza, to second base. Sneeden was thrown out at first base, leaving Wildcat infielders without a forced play. Sophomore Patricia Dun followed up with a single to left center, and because of two Wildcat fielding errors, Casazza passed home plate, placing the Pioneers in the lead, 3-2. Post’s defense held Wilmington down for the remainder of the game, earning them the first match win.
Swantek, who brought her team of 12 to 14-year-olds and their parents to observe a college team play the sport they love, is disappointed that the 2019 season will be the last for the Pioneer softball team. “They’re very good,” she said. “I think they’re going to have a successful year.” Swantek played for the team in 2014 when they represented the East Coast Conference in the NCAA Division II championships in Virginia. She now coaches because she wants to “give back to the community.” Her team of teenagers were sad to leave before the second game since they had yet to see a Pioneer hit a home run.
The Pioneers didn’t see much action in the second game until the top of the third inning. Senior pitcher Hannah Olshevski picked up a grounder and made a quick pivot to get the out at second base, which resulted in enough time for Dun to make the double play at first base to end the inning. The Pioneers landed on the scoreboard when Fortin, who was recently named ECC’s player of the week, slammed the first home run of the day into left field, which consisted of two runs batted in, giving the team a two run lead. The Pioneers scored a third run in the bottom of the third when senior Leah Mele hit a single to center field, bringing Sneeden home to change the score to 3-0. 
Wilmington gained two runs in the fourth due to a stolen base and a fielding error, and then scored a third run after hitting back-to-back doubles at the top of the fifth to tie the score 3-3. They scored a fourth run at the top of the sixth, but their lead was Pioneers; Laird tied the game again with a home run to right center. The Pioneers took the win at the bottom of the seventh inning after Mele hit a homerun over the left field fence and into the stands where the Ducks team had been seated earlier that day. As Mele rounded third base to head home, her teammates were waiting for her at the plate, cheering. 
Senior infielder Ashley Melendez is pleased with her team’s performance. “I feel we ex-ecuted all parts of the game: pitching, hitting and fielding,” she said. “Every game is a double header. We end up at the end of the season with about 50 games under our belt.” Both game wins were really important, according to Laird. “I’m glad that our team pulled through today; we all did our part. Even Leah came through at the end and had a home run, which was great. So, it was a really good feeling,” she said.

 In the summer of 2016, the Robert Alvin Mark Moseley Memorial Basketball Court up the road from the east gate entrance to campus was transformed into a deck hockey rink. Yet, the lonely court has been left vacant and largely unused for the past three years.
The transition from a basketball court to a deck hockey rink was a process, as the plot of land needed a big makeover, according to director of recreational sports Rick Hamilton.
“We had an outside company come and remove the basketball courts and the unsightly fencing that was around them; they also had to level out the land, which was very slanted and bumpy,” Hamilton said. “It is a much nicer facility than it ever was when it was a basketball court.” 
Director of Facilities Roy Fergus did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the transformation of the basketball court to the deck hockey rink.
According to Hamilton, the  rink has been left vacant for this long because of safety concerns regarding nearby parked cars.
“We [Athletic department] have been hesitant to use the rink for deck hockey because there is no protective netting or barriers around the boards. It would be very common for the ball to leave the playing area and the possibility of damaging cars that are parked close by,” Hamilton said.
While the area looks like just a deck hockey rink, it’s actually labeled as the “LIU Multi-Purpose Court” on a sign in the parking lot adjacent to the campus security building. The court opens up opportunities due to the deck’s surface, according to athletic director Debbie DeJong, deputy director of athletics Lloyd Rib-ner, and Hamilton.
“It is a roller hockey rink, but the flooring that is put down allows you to [do] many things on it; you don’t need to be wearing roller blades, you could wear shoes so you can use it for dodgeball, soccer, lacrosse, basically what-ever you like,” Ribner said. 
“When we have weather like snow and you can’t get on the grass because it’s wet and starts to frost, students can use the court as an alternative,” DeJong said. 
“We didn’t want to stay stagnant with the basketball courts; we are always looking for new ideas and ways to create new offerings for students and this was something new [the court] as it gives students another facility to use for general recreation,” Hamilton said about the decision to transform the courts in 2016. 
While that is what Hamilton originally wanted, students are not utilizing the court, which is why the athletic department plans to start intramural leagues.
Associate director for recreational sports and intramurals, Martin Guillet plans to use the court for intramural teams such as 4v4 soccer and an alternative to ice hockey.
“Once the weather improves, we will be using the court for four on four soccer this spring,” Guillet said. “We also can use it for intramural hockey of sorts called floorball, which we hope to get going next fall.”
Since the rink is labeled as the “LIU Multi-Purpose Court,” Hamilton did not find it to be necessary for netting to be installed due to the lack of usage the rink has seen, also because there just has not been enough usage of the court to justify the need to install any netting.
“We [Athletic Department], look at the rink as more of an informal recreational space for students to use than an athletic space for teams. With the level of use, we didn’t think netting was needed,” Hamilton said. 
Although students are aware of the deck hockey rink, they do not seem motivated to use it.
Rebecca DeWitt, a sophomore education major, has used the hockey rink once.  “One of my friends brought his dog with him and we played soccer and it was cool because it was late at night, but other than that, I’ve never seen anybody use the rink,” she said. 
Junior broadcasting major, Griffin Ward, a hockey fan, is aware of the court, but doesn’t use it. 
“During my time here at this esteemed university, I have never seen any students utilizing the deck hockey rink for its intended purposes,” Ward said.  
With the upcoming intramural leagues, the rink will be used more by the students, according to the athletic department representatives.

 Three fan buses drove students from cam-pus to Adelphi University to cheer on the men’s lacrosse team as they went up against Adelphi Panthers on Wednesday, March 21.
The fan buses “provide an opportunity for all students to participate in college athletics, whether it is as an athlete or as a spectator, and to cheer on their student athletes and their team,” Dean of Students Michael Berthel said. 
At 6 p.m. More than 35 students students gathered outside Hillwood Commons to board the fan buses that would transport them to the game and back. Members of Campus Life offered students free dinner, t-shirts and sweat-shirts to the first 100 students to reserve spots on the buses.
Transport services have been provided to post-season and championship games in the past, but because of men’s lacrosse recent success against the defending national champions Merrimack College on March 9, the interest in the team has grown. 
“There is a lot of energy around men’s lacrosse because of their tremendous success,” Berthel said. “We are looking to tap into that excitement around it and provide an opportunity for students to cheer on their fellow student-athletes and to make sure the players know that their peers, staff and faculty support them.” 
The game against Adelphi was a perfect opportunity to build on the hype around the men’s lacrosse team, Berthel said, because of the rivalry and competitiveness between the two teams. “It’s always great when the stands are filled and people are cheering you on. I think that helps with the overall success of the team,” he said.  
Emily Tirado, a freshman health science major, travelled with the fan buses and think it was a great way for the students to get together and support the men’s lacrosse team. “I really liked it! I think it’s important that we support our sports teams like this. It really makes all of us one big family,” she said. 
The fan bus concept will continue and hope-fully be applied to other sports too depending on the team’s success and their game schedule, according to Berthel. “We can’t make it to every game obviously but we try to tap into when we see a team is doing well and there is energy around a sport,” he said. “For us it’s all about providing opportunity for students to feel like they are a part of the success the team is having and that community. We are obviously proud of them and what they are accomplishing and we want to make sure that we continue to sup-port them.”

 Toby Fox, a 28-year-old American video game developer, released “Undertale,” on Sept. 15, 2015. The game was revolutionary with its gameplay mechanics and storytelling. “Undertale” is a role-playing game that portrays the player as a child who falls into a land populated by monsters. 
What makes “Undertale” unique is the create your own story option where the player must choose between three paths. In the pacifist run, the player befriends all of the game’s enemies. In the genocide run, the player kills all of the enemies. The neutral run provides a middle ground. 
“Undertale” received positive ratings by gamers and critics alike on IGN and Metacritic. On October 31, 2018, Fox followed up with his latest game, “DeltaRune.”
“DeltaRune” takes place in the same universe as “Undertale,” but in a different time-line. In “Undertale,” the player’s choices make a big impact on the story, however in “DeltaRune,” the game makes clear early on that players have no choice in what happens with the story.
Alexandra Koster, a freshman art therapy major, and Andrew Frank, a senior broadcasting major, are fans of the game.
“It was definitely fun to play,” Koster said. “It took me by surprise when you see the main fundamental element of ‘Undertale’ turn on its head in DeltaRune,” he continued. The newer game gave Koster a “Toy Story” vibe. “I would give “Undertale” a 6/10 and “DeltaRune” an 8/10,” she said, rating both games.
Frank agreed that “DeltaRune” accomplishes the purpose of telling a story. He rated “Undertale” a 9/10 and “DeltaRune” an 8/10. “I believe ‘DeltaRune’ is indeed a worthy successor to ‘Undertale,’” Frank said.
Having played both games myself, I am looking forward to the rest of Toby Fox’s latest masterpiece.

It’s okay to admit that we can sometimes be glued to our cell phones. These devices give us comfort, but what are the ramifications of this luxury? Many things in life are seemingly “too good to be true,” but is this the case with cell phones? 
In the past, society considered smoking cigarettes to be a classy pass time. Now we know the dangers of nicotine; the Center for Disease Control reported that cigarettes are responsible for more than 480,000 deaths in America each year. 
Technology takes over everyday tasks like
checking the door from your smartphone or
asking Alexa to turn on and off the lights. As
impressive as this is, it’s ignorant to invest into
this lifestyle without knowing the potential
consequences.

We’re in the phase of “cell phone history.” There isn’t enough research to conclude whether cell phones are completely safe. Despite this, we put them in our pockets and bra straps, unaware that these are important parts of our bodies susceptible to cancer. We can’t yet determine if we can contract tumors from these devices, but we should start gathering that information and weigh the pros and cons. 
Cell phones emit radio frequency radiation,
or RF radiation. These waves allow calls to be
made by transmitting signals from the internal
antenna at the bottom of your phone to the cell
phone tower and back again.

A study conducted by the American Cancer
Association concluded that over long periods of
time and excessive phone use, these rays cause
tumors in human brains. They also concluded
that excessive exposure causes heart tumors in
laboratory mice.

Are our closest technological companions safe to use? The answer isn’t black and white; between the hundreds of rays and signals we’re exposed to everyday, including air-traffic control, wifi, radios, fire brigade warning systems, bluetooth, and multiple broadcasting systems,
the less we expose ourselves to any kind of
radiation, the better.

 Apex Legends is a unique, all-out battle royale that supports instant gratification with fast-paced gameplay and an emphasis on teamwork. You and two other players will drop onto a map that’s slowly shrinking and fight for survival against 19 other teams. Through scav-enging and upgrading weapons, players aim to be the last team standing.
Apex Legends may be the biggest thing Electronic Arts has done since Star Wars. Combining the popular elements of battle royale and characters with abilities, the game already has over 2 million players.
There are eight “legends” that players can choose from. Six are free to play, and two have to be unlocked. All characters from heroes to assassins to medics are important to win. 
What makes Apex different from its predecessors is the emphasis on communication. Despite games like Overwatch in being team-based, it is almost impossible to carry a game of Apex Legends alone. Careful coordination and faith in your comrades are the foundation of success.
 Teamwork has never felt so smooth. Each player can benefit the other two. Burnt out support mains will develop a soft spot for this game as their tactical skills will be put to the test. Feeling helpless in team fights is the last thing that can happen. Oftentimes in other games, support characters can either heal or watch their team die with no solution to a problem. In Apex, all of your team’s positioning skills are necessary.
Managing the player’s inventory is easier in Apex and has become preferable to that of Fortnite. The system automatically equips the best loot when found, allowing for a faster and more satisfying gameplay. The color coded ammo helps new players adapt quickly and make it fair for them to play against veteran players.
Apex Legends was released on Feb. 4 and shows potential to create a great gaming community. Managing to knock Overwatch and Fortnite out of the park, Apex proves that heroes never die, but they can certainly fade away.

Professor Publishes Book on Food and Environmental Anxieties in 1980s Horror 
By Anand Venigalla
Features Editor
Thomas Fahy, associate professor of English, recently published a book with the University Press of Mississippi called “Dining with Madmen: Fat, Food, and the Environment.” The book is dedicated to exploring America’s preoccupation with body weight, processed food, and the transformation of the body and environment through the lens of horror fiction and film. 
According to the book description, “[Horror fiction’s] presentation of American appetites resonated powerfully for audiences preoccupied with body size, food choices, and pollution” in order to demand “a recognition of the potentially horrifying impact of consumerism on nature, society, and the self.” 
An increasing concern in the 1980s was “about how much money people were spending on fast foods, and how much fast food was being eaten,” Fahy said. The anxiety arose “not just that we’re eating these things but that we’re eating and consuming in large quantities food that was designed scientifically to be addictive.” 
Vampire fiction and film plays into this concern. “Vampirism is consistently used as a metaphor for addiction,” Fahy said. “Vampires can’t go without having their daily fix for blood.” In many fictional portrayals, characters are depicted indulging in fast foods, sweets, and processed food. “These films are pointing out the addictive quality of these foods and inviting us to think about the addictions we have and what kind of transformation they are causing in our bodies.” 
Fahy’s book does not focus extensively on popular 1980s staples such as Freddie Kruger, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers. “The 1980s has gotten a little lost [in serious analysis] because it’s perceived as all surrounding these type of iconic bad guys,” Fahy said. 
Fahy cited the importance of Thomas Harris’s novel “The Silence of the Lambs,” published in 1988, in its dealing with anxieties about the body. Also covered in Fahy’s study are Bret Easton Ellis’s novel “American Psycho,” Stephen King’s “Thinner,” and Katherine Dunn’s “Geek Love.” 
Fahy published a collection of writings in 2010 called “The Philosophy of Horror,” which looked at the horror genre from a philosophical standpoint. In 2015, he published “The Walking Dead: Talking Terror with TV’s Top Horror Writers,” a collection of original interviews with writers for television shows such as “The Walking Dead,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “The X-Files,” and “American Horror Story.” 
Fahy wrote many novels, including “The Unspoken” and “Sleepless,” which were published in 2008 and 2009. Then he decided to do a full scholarly study of horror. “It seemed like the next thing I should be doing. When I thought back on the 1980s, I realized there was a lot to say and a lot to explore, and it was an exciting period to go back to and use that genre as a lens for understanding it.” 
Fahy considers the horror fiction and films of the 1980s to be deeply relevant to contemporary concerns. “Zombie fiction in the 1980s tends to address apocalyptic concerns about destroying the planet, or science run amok,” he said. Work like this raises questions about what we are doing about these problems individually, socially, and culturally. 
“The genre is a way to heighten our sense of
emergency, letting us see an apocalyptic vision
of our own making, and challenging us not to
stand on the sidelines anymore.”

Fahy teaches ENG 2-014, ENG 2-018 – Writing II: Research and Argumentation and ENG 193: Writing Young Adult Fiction this semester. His book is available on Amazon.com.

The president and COO of Nintendo of America, Reggie Fils-Aime, announced his retirement after almost 13 years in the position on Feb. 21. Fils-Aime, who is 57 years old, will be replaced by Doug Bowser, Nintendo’s current senior vice president of sales and marketing. Nintendo of America is the North American division of the Japanese video game company Nintendo, which creates some of the world’s top selling video games.
Howard Thaxter, a sophomore digital game design major, was upset about the news of Fils-Aime’s retirement, “Because everyone knew Reggie [as the face of Nintendo] for so long.”
The announcement was even more impactful for Daniel Caixeiro, a junior digital game design major. “I cried, it was very depressing. I [was] pained inside,” Caixeiro said. “Reggie was the best; he was the face of Nintendo pretty much,” he said. “I saw a bunch of people on Twitter who were super upset about it.”
Matthew Lanza, a freshman digital game design major, also felt sad to see Fils-Aime move on, noting that Doug Bowser’s role “should be about keeping Nintendo popular.”
Alex Nicoletta, a junior digital game design major, was surprised at Nintendo’s announcement. “I really didn’t see it coming, but people retire eventually, so it wasn’t too shocking,” he said. “He made a lot of money, so now he can do whatever he wants and now he has the funds to do so,” he said about Fils-Aime.
Mary Scibilia, a senior game design major, Alicia DiMartino, a freshman art therapy major, and Robert Borrelli, a freshman digital game design major, were also aware of the change in leadership at Nintendo.
Robert Krebs, a sophomore musical theater major, expressed the feelings of many students who follow the company. “Ultimately when someone is the head of a company, retirement makes everyone a little disappointed, so I’m a little disappointed that he is retiring from Nintendo, but moving forward it’s probably really good for the company to have new faces and new people designing games,” Krebs said.
Both gamers and game designers respected Fils-Aime and the work he has done over a decade at Nintendo, and look forward to a new chapter in the leadership of the video game company.

Over spring break, a new user joined the Instagram feed. University President Kimberly Cline started an Instagram page to share stories and photos about LIU and to “bring the campus alive” to prospective students. 
“Facebook is still used by millennials, but Instagram is the top choice [for] generation Z,” Cline said. There are over two dozen university affiliated Instagram accounts, with users ranging from clubs, sports, Greek Life and Dean of Students Michael Berthel. 
The goal is to build up the page
until fall 2019, according to Cline.
“At this point, I am letting it grow
organically. For now, people are
finding me by accident,” she said.

The “liupresident” account has 42 followers so far, and follows back 14 accounts: 11 LIU groups and three Post musical theatre students. “I followed the first three students who followed me,” Cline said. Comments are disabled on the account’s content. 
Though the president is assimilating into social media for recruiting outreach, she is only using Instagram. “I don’t anticipate joining Twitter or Facebook at this point, but I believe Instagram offers a strong platform,” she said.

 The 27th Long Island Guitar Festival will return to campus from April 9 to 14. The event, presented by the Department of Music, will showcase distinguished guitarists in the classical and jazz genres, as well as a national high school guitar competition. Scheduled concerts, masterclasses and workshops will be held in the Tilles Center, the Interfaith Chapel, Krasnoff Theater, Hillwood Cinema, Winnick Great Hall, the Music Rehearsal Building, and the Fine Arts Center.
Director of guitar studies and adjunct professor, Harris Becker, initiated the festival back in 1993 to exemplify the music making process. When most of the general public experiences a live concert, they only hear the final outcome to years of practice and dedication, according to Becker. “What I wanted to do was focus on the process,” he said. It was his way of “creating more awareness to the art of music making.
”The festival began as a one-day event dedicated to the guitar. Since then, it has grown to celebrate exceptional guitarists from around the world. Each year the Guitar Festival includes at least one premiere performance. This year, acclaimed guitarist, Laura Snowden from the U.K., will make her U.S. debut. “She is one of the many exciting and gifted young performers in the guitar world today,” James Erickson, adjunct professor of guitar and the festival’s assistant director, said. 
Snowden decided to pick up a guitar at 8 years-old after her love of writing and singing pop-music ended. “The Spice Girls broke up. I was pretty heartbroken,” she said. “The only logical solution was to bury my sorrows in the classical guitar.” At 16, she received a scholarship from The Rolling Stones, a British rock band, to study at the Yehudi Menuhin School located just outside of London. 
She went on to attend the Royal College of Music. She has performed in major venues such as Wigmore Hall, Royal Albert Hall, and at Shakespeare’s Globe Theater as part of a series run by guitarist John Williams. Her invitation to attend the Long Island festival is her first stop in a series of concerts in America. 
Artists such as Snowden, will engage with aspiring guitarists from the campus and the community in a series of scheduled master classes. Erickson will lead a workshop on theory and technique for the contemporary rock guitarist; public forum lessons are a unique opportunity to work one-on-one with a world-class performer. “The student usually performs a prepared piece of music and then gets feedback and instruction from the artist,” he said. Robert Trent, a classical guitarist, will also teaching a workshop on nineteenth-century performance practices.
A festival highlight is the National High School Classical Guitar Competition on April 12 and 13. This portion of the event is open to young guitarists attending private or public school within the 50 states. The final round, consisting of three finalists, is open to the public, according to Erickson. The first prize winner receives $500 and an opportunity to perform at the 2020 festival. The second place winner will receive $200, and all competitors are awarded accessories and strings donated by guitar accessory manufacturers. Last year’s winners, Eliza Balmuth and Everett Shen, will perform a concert together during the “Emerging Artists Series” at this year’s festival. 
Shen began experimenting with the acoustic guitar when he was 12 years-old because he dreamed of being in a band. He switched to the classical genre when he was offered the opportunity to study with a renowned guitarist, according to Shen. During last year’s competition, he was a senior in high school, while in his last year to compete in the festival’s high school division. “I’d spent months preparing for the competition and it felt great to have such hard work pay off,” he said. He now studies at Princeton University.
Balmuth, who is a freshman at the Conservatory of Music at Oberlin College studying comparative literature and classical guitar performance, began playing when she was 8. According to the artist, she enjoys: “exploring the inspirations, stories, and cultural context behind nineteenth-century music and trying to convey these nuances on the guitar.” She’s inspired by Snowden’s musicianship.
Snowden is fond of Balmuth as well. “I was excited to see that Eliza Balmuth will be playing,” Snowden said. “She’s a terrific young player who I met at the Volterra Project in Italy last year.” The Volterra Project is an innovative experiment in classical guitar training help-ing young guitarists become well-rounded and non-competitive performers.
Some music majors will perform and assist in some of the presented workshops. Others will carry out administrative tasks and stage management. “There are also many LIU alumni returning to perform, myself included,” said Erickson.  “While most of the participants in the master classes and workshops are guitarists, our concerts are attended by a broad range of musicians and non-musicians who love the eclectic diversity of our performers.” Becker is proud of the international recognition the festival has received. “We have kept the focus on the music which has given many people much pleasure; it’s culture that connects us,” he said.
For guitar enthusiasts, the best bet is to purchase a festival pass that grants access for the weekend. Single event tickets are also available through the Tilles Center box office and liu.edu/gfest. Students with a valid LIU ID can attend free of charge. Vendors displaying guitars, sheet music and accessories will line up in the lobby of Hillwood Commons during the event. “We are also set up right next to Starbucks. Grab a latte and come hear some great music,” Erickson said

Gamers, get ready, as Browse, the technology store in Hillwood Commons, will host its gaming competition Thursday, March 27, in the End Zone at 6 p.m. The semesterly competition is open to anyone interested and a new game is featured every tournament. 
Participants will compete in the popular
“Super Smash Bros Ultimate” on the Nintendo
Switch. “We wanted to use Super Smash Bros
as our fall semester gaming competition, but
the game didn’t come out until the end of the
semester, so we’re capitalizing now,” Albert
Donor (’18), Browse’s lead associate, said.

During the fall 2018 semester, the tournament featured games in the FIFA series to compliment the excitement surrounding the World Cup. On Feb. 28, WCWP radio station held a Super Smash Bros Ultimate tournament, at which about 20 students played. “Seeing how good of a turnout the radio station had, I expect to have somewhere around the same amount of people show up, if not more,” Donor said. 
Jason Glickman, a sophomore broadcasting major, signed up for the competition. “I participated in the Super Smash tournament at the radio station and got destroyed by the competition,” he said. “I’ve been practicing in preparation for this tournament, so I don’t get embarrassed this time and so I could hopefully win,” he added. Glickman chose to keep the character he plans to play as a secret. 
The gaming competition is free for students who wish to sign up. “We decided to make this gaming competition free because we figured we could get more people to come out and just a enjoy playing the video game and just have and overall fun time,” Donor said. Students can sign up on the second floor of Hillwood in Browse between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
The grand prize for the first place winner will be Beats Solo 3 wireless headphones. The second place winner will get a Roccat Lua mouse and a $100 gift card to GameStop. The third place winner will receive a Nintendo Switch starter kit.

American electro house musician Steve Aoki will perform at the spring fling concert on April 25 at 7 p.m. in the Tilles Center. He was nominated for a Grammy award for his album, “Wonderland.” 
Tickets are selling quickly due to Aoki’s popularity, according to Ryan Day, assistant director of events and operations in the office of campus life. 
“There has definitely been a lot of excitement already for Aoki, especially around the pit tickets [general admission], which have almost already sold out,” Day said. 
Sophomore art management major, Brianna Saverino, is a fan of Aoki’s and will attend the show. “I was really hoping for an EDM-type artist and when they announced Aoki, I got really excited, as I am a [private event] DJ myself,” Saverino said. 
Sophomore criminal justice major, Savannah Giardina was unaware of the March 19 announcement of the performer, but when informed, she was excited. 
“I didn’t know they picked Aoki; I’m very
excited as I’ve always liked his [work] as a DJ,”
Giardina said.

Jeremih performed at last year’s spring fling concert, and proceeds from the performance were donated to Relay for Life. While SAB was unable to provide the amount of money raised, they donated $5 per ticket sold. Ticket sales this year are being used to pay for the show only. 
“Proceeds from ticket sales are going to be used to help cover the production costs to put on the show, like special effects, extra lighting, sound and security,” Day said. 
While SAB was unable to provide specific details, according to Day, it’s their most expensive spring fling performer. 
Tickets are available for $15 at the campus
concierge until March 28, and for $20 on
Ticketmaster afterwards. Reserved seating, as
it is further away from the stage is available for
$5 until March 28 and $15 afterwards.

 The class of 2022’s freshman year will culminate with their first Post Theatre Company (PTC) mainstage show, the Freshman Showcase, this spring. The showcase consists of two shows, one directed by theatre professor Lauren Reinhard and the other by adjunct professor David Apichell. The entire freshman theatre class will have roles in the performance, both on and off stage. The opening and closing numbers in both shows involve the whole cast. The main element of the showcases will be several individual scenes with the same underlying theme.
A show can’t be made without the support of a crew, many of which are second or third year students in the department. This is the first show that Emily Shoup, a sophomore theatre arts (design & production) major, will have a part in scenic design. “I’m excited to have a big portion where I’m in charge of something, rather than just being the assistant,” she said. Shoup will assist Apichell in making decisions based on his concept. “He gave me full reign on the spaceship chairs [a big prop in Apichell’s show],” Shoup said. 
Although the themes and titles for the two pieces are yet to be announced, the light-ing and costume designers are hard at work. Junior Kiely Boyington, theater arts (design & production) major with a concentration in lighting design, is in charge of the lighting plan for the both shows. “Designing lights for any show isn’t easy. It takes a lot of work and brainstorming and experimentation. It has a very creative side to it that not everyone under-stands,” Boyington said. 
Despite working on two separate shows, Boyington is able to handle the job efficiently. “Doing two shows at once doesn’t add a lot to the challenge, it just creates double the work. I am now working with two design teams, two directors, two stage managers, two casts, and two sets of shows,” she said.
 Being the only design & production student concentrating in lighting design, and having designed the lighting tech for almost nine main stage shows since 2016, Boyington is fully aware of the importance of her role. “Without someone doing lights, there would be no world, especially for these first year showcases,” she said. “When there is a minimal set, like in these shows, the lighting designer’s main responsibility is to create this universes for the characters. A simple shift in light color is the difference between being in Alaska or the desert.”
Sophomore Sami Eddy, a theater arts (design & production) major with a lighting in costume design, is responsible for costuming Reinhard’s cast. “I have to dress 26 cast members,” Eddy said. Eddy believes that the costumes can really bring a piece to life, as well as making the actors’ job easier to embody their character. “I feel like clothing and what you put on your body is an expression of who you are as a person, so doing research into who these characters are, where they’re from what they do, they’re wearing that on their body,” she said. 
Eddy is experienced in her craft, and high-lighted the importance of the entire crew as well as costumes. “You can do so much person-al work on your character, but once you got the clothing on and you look in the mirror and you see who your character is, it really ties every-thing together,” Eddy said. “Same with the set, interacting with the world around you it’s all essential to making good theater happen.”

The Middle Eastern South Asian Alliance (MESA) and Muslim Student Association held a vigil service for the victims of the two Christchurch mosque shootings on Wednesday, March 20 in the library. Students listened to speakers recount the importance of coming together in the face of violence. 
Nuvaera Mumnoon, a sophomore biomedical science major and president of MESA, helped organize the vigil. “I held this vigil for the large community at LIU Post, and it was open to the public,” she said. “My motive for this was to bring peace, to influence everyone around us. These attacks don’t make us weak, but they actually make us strong.” 
Mumnoon wanted the event to include people of all backgrounds. “No matter what your background is or where you come from, you are strong and everybody is here for you,” she said. “There’s something that everybody has in common: we’re all human, we have feelings. What we’re all going through we’re going through together.” 
Afaf Nasher, executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations, was a guest speaker at the event, and opened the vigil with a short prayer. She followed by calling for a need for all “people of conscience” to speak up in the face of prejudice and hate. 
“I’ve been at too many rallies and too many press conferences, and each time I try to hold back moments where I feel like I’m choking up because the insanity of it all is so traumatizing,” Nasher said. “But then what drives me to move forward is the understanding that
we who are alive have a responsibility to fight
against complacency and sometimes against
complicity.”

Louis Copertino, a junior public relations
major, said it was important for him to attend
the vigil as a representative of the Promise
office. “This is a time when the university
needs to come together. As student leaders and
representative for LIU Promise, we feel like we
should be here to support students,” he said.

Nasher encouraged students to be leaders and use their “consumer power” to take a stand against violence and injustice. 
“There are ways in which we hold people accountable that are in your hands,” Nasher said. “Use those tools to promote positive, productive change in the world.”

Audrey Gottbaum joined the Center for Healthy Living staff as the campus nurse on Jan. 4, replacing Mary Fletcher, who was campus nurse during the 2017-2018 academic year. The previous nurse, Constance Montalbano, retired on Feb. 28, 2017, after serving as campus nurse for seven years. There was no nurse on campus during the fall 2018 semester. 
Gottbaum spent over 20 years at NYU’s nurse-run health center for medical students before joining LIU Post. In her new position this semester, Gottbaum has not yet seen many students. No announcement was made about her arrival on campus, according to director of the Center for Healthy Living, Lynne Schwartz, and many students still seem to be unaware that there is a nurse on campus. 
“In a school health setting, the numbers will tend to vary greatly from day to day, but I expect for them to increase certainly as people become more aware that there is a nurse here,” Gottbaum said. 
Although there is now a nurse on campus,
there is no physician on campus. Gottbaum
refers students to the Riland Health Care Center
on the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)
campus for medical services that she does not
provide.

“If a student comes in, I’m going to find out why they came to see me, write down their medical history, [and] perform an appropriate physical examination,” Gottbaum said. 
“We can only do the basics like take their temperature, [and] their pulse; it’s called a triage.” Schwartz said. “After that, we refer them over to NYIT, free of charge.” 
“Students provide their own transportation to NYIT. Students are sent to NYIT every day,” Scwartz said. While the students are being treated off campus, the Center for Healthy Living still stays in touch with the students and the NYIT staff to assure proper care is given. Gottbaum may also refer students to a local Northwell Healthcare facility, like the hospital in Westbury. 
“If a student feels sick, for example has a fever, they will be referred to Riland Healthcare Center, where they can be prescribed medications,” Gottbaum said. 
Junior broadcasting major Asia Turner, like
other students, had no idea there is a campus
nurse.

“I didn’t even know there was a nurse on campus, honestly; they need to advertise it better,” Turner said. “It’s good for the school to have a nurse because it’s much more convenient than having to leave campus when you’re sick.” 
Courtney Scanapico, a junior healthcare
administration major, was also unaware of the
nurse on campus.

“Wait, we have a nurse, wow, I’m shocked,” Scanapico said. “I’m surprised that it took this long to have a school nurse. With a school that has a lot of students who live on campus, it’s important to have a nurse.” 
Gottbaum is on campus three days a week, on
Monday from 9-4 p.m., on Wednesday from 10-4
p.m. and on Friday from 10-2:30 p.m. She can be
reached at (516) 299-3468.

Schwartz anticipates that there will be a nurse
on campus on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the
near future. Students can meet with Gottbaum at
the Center for Healthy Living, in Post Hall, Room
C2 without an appointment.

There are 11 librarian faculty members in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library ready to assist students with their research and other needs.
Kimberly Mullins is an instructional design librarian who integrates open access resources, services, and other tools in the library and aca-demic curricula. She also develops programs and leads instruction and library classes. She works closely with faculty in developing cours-es “to integrate information literacy and library resources into their actual courses,” she said.
“I also help manage the entire instruction that goes on here in terms of staffing, schedul-ing and working as the intermediary between classroom faculty and library faculty, and I also manage the reference desk,” Mullins said.
Although there were 26 librarians in 2012, today, there are just 11, which keeps them all busy. “The decrease has definitely impacted the number of resources that available for faculty, students and staff,” Mullins said. “The decline is due to retirements, librarians moving to other institutions, and denials of tenure or promotion,” she added.   
Despite having a reduced staff, Mullins is confident the work they do hasn’t decreased and won’t in the future.
“We have a great staff, a great faculty and we all consider this to be ‘all hands on deck’ time, so we have all been taking on multiple duties,” Mullins said. “We also support each other, in order to provide the same level of service, resources, and instruction that we have done in the past.” 
Mullins hires graduate assistants to support the full time library staff. “The graduate assistants are largely in our Palmer School, either in the graduate or Ph.D. program, in order to help support the day to day tasks in the library,” Mullins said. 
Undergraduate students work in the library as well. Nancy Ambrosio, a freshman business administration major with a concentration in management, is a circulation assistant. “My du-ties when I’m working [are] to help the patrons with finding books, taking books outs, and printing on the computers,” Ambrosio said. 
Mullins wants students to take advantage of all of the services offered by the librarians and other library staff. “We have a program that we refer to as ‘research by appointment,’ and it is a free consultation service we provide as librarians,” Mullins said.
This can help students at the beginning stages of research or in looking for resources online or citation management. Mullins said there are also library faculty who can read through students’ research projects. “We can give them additional support and recommendation in terms of research writing,” she said. 
The library faculty also offer chat and virtual services for students. “We have chat, we have texting services and calling, but primarily what I would love for all students to understand is that we are here to support them, make them successful and just would like them to be aware of the services that are given to them,” Mullins said.
Mullins advises students not to be afraid to speak up and seek assistance from library faculty. “I find students who are afraid to approach a librarian and it does happen a lot and we are very nice people and we want to help them 150 percent,” Mullins said. 
Thomas D. Walker, associate dean of the College of Education, Information, and Technology and director of the Palmer School of Library and Information Science, is also optimistic about the work being done by the library faculty. 
“Since I came here in 2017, one of the things that I’ve been most encouraged by is the enthusiasm of the librarians,” Walker said. He also oversees the library at the Brooklyn campus.
Walker encourages students to use services offered at the library, including the Digital Commons, a new service for students conduct-ing research. “Students at one point should take the time to really get to know the library faculty and the staff, even by name; they’ll get to know all the resources that we have; we have electronic books, we have different types of media and it’s a complicated information world out there,” Walker said.
