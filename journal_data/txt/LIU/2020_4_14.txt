As people around the world adjust to living under stay-at-home orders, some are using their free time and creativity to help themselves and others make it through.
With nonessential businesses closed throughout the United States and government authorities cancelling gatherings of over 50 people, people may collectively experience a feeling of isolation from friends, loved ones and co-workers; however, this has not stopped people from banding together in new ways to stay connected to those they miss the most.
Several musical artists and institutions took their live shows and entertainment online to share their art and bring some joy into living rooms around the world. Local Long Island musician Mike Barry had to adjust during this quarantine period just like everyone else.
“It’s tough. I normally do 30-40 shows a month; since March 14, it’s down to zero,” he said. “So, the actual act of driving somewhere, setting up, playing to an audience, breaking down gear and driving home no longer exists.”
With the idea of virtual shows becoming more and more popular, Barry has switched to doing virtual home shows on Facebook twice a week just to stay active.
“Most musicians are doing just that and setting up a virtual tip cup for revenue,” he said.
“Though I heard that Facebook may discontinue that due to stress on the server, we’ll see, Barry said. “Otherwise, I am just rehearsing, writing music, trying to stay creative.”
Some students are enjoying these virtual concerts. Nicholas Mattina, a senior broadcasting major, said he really likes the idea of watching concerts online from the comfort of his home.
Several concert tours were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and fans are disappointed they will have to wait or possibly miss the chance to attend these shows.
“The artists are doing a great job bringing the shows to their fans via Instagram, YouTube, etc. I was planning on buying tickets to go see one of my favorite bands but it was cancelled,” Mattina said. “Luckily, they did a short livestream performing some of their songs as well as covers.”
All of these online concerts serve the purpose to not only keep musicians in business, but to keep everyone together during difficult times.

Central Park’s East Meadow was converted into a field hospital with 68 beds to help New York City battle the number of new coronavirus cases overwhelming its healthcare system.
Central Park, a staple attraction of the Big Apple, along with the 1,800,000-square-foot Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, are being used as makeshift hospitals while the city struggles with a critical shortage of medical facilities and supplies.
The “city that doesn’t sleep” is usually bright and buzzing with people, and some Manhattan natives find the scenes of these famous tourist sites to be somewhat apocalyptic, although helpful in its purpose.
“We are at the point where if you are 18 or older and they cannot revive you in the ambulance, you cannot come to the ER to be revived. This is scary and we need it,” Ashley Damis, a senior broadcasting major, said.
The Central Park site was set up with 14 tents and will receive patients first from Mount Sinai Brooklyn and Mount Sinai Queens hospitals, according to ABC News. The makeshift hospital was constructed with help from the evangelical Christian humanitarian aid organization, Samaritan’s Purse, as the state’s death toll surpassed 1,550.
Construction and staff were provided by Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse, who said in a statement that hospitals are out of beds and medical staff are overwhelmed . The organization is known to provide for those who need aid in the wake of natural disasters such as hurricanes, but is currently doing it’s part to help fight against the virus.
“We just got sent 600 respirators to New York and Governor Cuomo said it will only last us six days until we need more. I think they need to set up treatment centers everywhere necessary,” Damis said.
Actions to build this additional space came after Governor Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency.
“As a mother, just hearing this news I fear for the families and lives of people I don’t know,” Damis said.

Due to the spread of COVID-19, the majority of campus has closed for safety and precautionary reasons. For international students, this news made them face a difficult decision, whether they should stay on campus or return home overseas.
When the news about campus closing was shared, students were still on spring break. Some international students, such as sophomore business administration major Emma Braekmans, were visiting home over the break and haven’t had a chance to return to campus yet.
“I’m from Belgium and haven’t been able to return to school to collect my items,” Braekman said. “It’s so frustrating when I don’t have access to my belongings in my dorm and that I have no idea when I can come back to school.”
Some students have been able to stay on Long Island, while not living on campus. Junior psychology major, Samantha Bell, has been able to study at her girlfriend’s house in Floral Park.
“It’s nice to have a break. I just miss being at school and having practice, but everything was closed so all of us had to go somewhere,” Bell said.
Many international students have also decided to stay at school, Jonna Klein-Holte, a freshman health sciences major, said.
“I probably will go home soon, just because this news came so sudden, I wasn’t able to prepare properly, but hopefully, I will return to [the] Netherlands and see my family,” Klein-Holte said.
A lot has changed for international students, making it more difficult for them to attend classes with the time differences.
“I have been homesick this entire semester and was kind of glad to be home, but now that I don’t have the choice to return to school, it definitely hits harder than if I chose to go home on my terms,” Femke De Goeji, a freshman bio-med science major, said.
