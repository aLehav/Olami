U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday, Sept. 18 due to complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer. She was 87.
Ginsburg had defeated colon, liver and lung cancer during the course of her life, and was the oldest sitting member on the Supreme Court. 
She was known for being a trailblazer for women in the workplace through law and politics. She attended Harvard and Columbia Law School, all while taking care of her child and husband, Martin Ginsburg, who was undergoing chemotherapy at the time.
Ginsburg directed the Women’s Rights Project for the American Civil Liberties Union in 1972, where she advocated for the fair treatment of women. 
She was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1980 and was later appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993. At her confirmation hearing, she spoke at length about her support for women’s rights and abortion rights. 
Before being appointed as a justice, Ginsburg argued six landmark cases on gender equality in front of the Supreme Court, winning five of them in order to eliminate legal barriers that held women back in both the workplace and in civic life.
Some of Ginsburg’s triumphs include helping women earn the right to sign a mortgage without a man present, the right to a bank account without a male co-signer, the right to be pregnant or have kids and work, the right to pension equal to male counterparts and the right for men to receive widowers social security benefits. 
The news of her death was shocking to members of the campus community.
“It was crushing to lose someone who has blazed so many trails in the law and has inspired so many people, especially, but not limited to, women,” Jeremy Buchman, a professor of political science and pre-law advisor, said. “And there was something ghoulish about seeing Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump rubbing their hands with glee about the prospect of filling her seat before she could even be buried.”
Former President Barack Obama waited a month after Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing before nominating Merrick Garland to be appointed to the Supreme Court.
Students were also deeply affected when RBG’s name made headlines.
“When I came across the news I stopped what I was doing to reread the headline to make sure what I was reading was real,” Hannah Winston, a sophomore musical theatre major, said. “My mother is a lawyer and has served as a judge. Women in law have always inspired me because it is such a testament of our raw power of fight and communication of our beliefs and morals to the world. My mother and I have always looked up to RBG as a role model because of her work with women’s rights and civil rights, but also because she persevered through all of the adversities life threw at her.”
Sophomore veterinary medicine major Sarah Henderson also considers Ginsburg to be a hero.
“She was more than just a woman in congress,” Henderson said. “She was an inspiring leader to many people across the country. She worked constantly for over two and a half decades to bring awareness to numerous equality and environmental issues that were overlooked by many of the men in congress. She was a symbol of hope to so many people, myself included.”
Henderson further comments that Ginsburg has shed a light on the democracy that the United States has needed for so long.
“She taught me that I am more than just a girl, but I can be a leader in society. She’s shown me and so many other girls that we are worthy of the positions we earn in our community. That we can fight for what we deserve,” Henderson said.
While America mourns the death of a legendary feminist, both Henderson and Winston believe that the country can take away so much from Ginsburg’s legacy.
“I hope to one day have a fraction of the impact Ginsburg did in my lifetime,” Winston said. “People must remember that we have the power to demand and advocate for change, and that no matter our beliefs we can be like [Ginsburg] and be a kind and decent human being to all.”
Henderson hopes that this loss will encourage more people to advocate for what they believe in and participate in voting this election.
“Vote in order to take the steps necessary to become the place she envisioned and fought so hard to build,” Henderson said.
Buchman further commented on the work Ginsburg did to make her so inspiring. 
“Ruth Bader Ginsburg accomplished so much at a time when the legal profession was overtly hostile to women. In her litigating and institution-building on behalf of using law to achieve significant social reform, Ginsburg was to legal rights for women what Thurgood Marshall was to legal rights for Black [people]. She fought tirelessly against public policy rooted in sex-based stereotyping, even on occasions where that stereotyping might be viewed as favorable to women,” he said. “In her view, breaking down sexual stereotyping was important not only for women, but also for men. And her deep friendship with Justice Scalia showed how people with very different political commitments could still build meaningful connections. It’s a lesson we’re in dire need of relearning.”
If students are interested in learning more about Ginsburg’s accomplishments and life, there is a documentary titled “RBG” available on Hulu, Amazon Prime and other streaming platforms.

With student’s returning to campus and classes beginning, many have been excited for things to return to normal. However, with COVID-19 being a constant threat to student’s safety, things haven’t been able to go back to the way they once were just yet. Instead, students have adapted to a new normal. One event having to make the adjustment to this new normal is the involvement fair.
Promise hosts an annual involvement fair on campus, where students can learn about clubs and organizations, and clubs can recruit new members. In order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on campus, having an in-person involvement fair where crowds of students gather and socialize would not be possible this year. Instead of the typical format where clubs have their own tables and students are free to meander from organization to organization, this year the fair is being done virtually via Zoom. 
Promise assigned each club its own time slot and Zoom meeting, and it was the student’s responsibility to determine which club meetings they wanted to attend. 
Without the typical in-person gathering that is customary with the involvement fair, some students have been worried about how this might affect other students’ interest in the event. 
“They want to actually be there and enjoy it,” junior forensic science major Eric Nazario said. “Online activities will show a decline in student involvement I believe, because students don’t want to be on their computer or phone for a fundraiser or movie night type of event.”
Due to these new restrictions clubs have had to spend more time this year reaching out to students and advertising their event in order to get students to attend their Zoom meeting. 
“Challenges with the online format [were] getting word out,” sophomore business administration major Anna Serro, and president of the fashion merchandising club, said. “We have been posting on our Instagram about the event, and Promise also posted about the event, but normally students will wander through the fair and see what they are interested in.”
Other clubs have been worried about how they will be able to hold any of their own events this year. 
Junior accounting major and president of the bowling club Mike Mele expressed his concerns about how virtual events might impact his club. 
“It will definitely affect how many events are done, as some events can’t happen due to the no in-person events rule,” Mele said. “It will be especially difficult for our club because our whole routine is based on being together in person.” 
In spite of student’s concerns, the involvement fair was able to have a successful start, with Zoom meetings beginning on Monday, Sept. 14.
“The school adapted the best way they could,” Serro said.“I think this was a good way to see some interested students, and now we have some people to follow up with.” 
The Fashion Merchandising Club will be holding virtual events throughout the semester, along with many other organizations across campus.
Greek students have also adapted to the digital nature of Post this year, and they are looking forward to upcoming virtual meetings.
“I’ve been excited for Greek Recruitment for a while now, and can’t wait to see the new members of each organization,” Nazario said.
The involvement fair will continue on Zoom this week, and clubs will continue to host virtual events that students can attend throughout the semester. Students can find out about upcoming events by following Promise’s Instagram account @liupromise.

After taking a year long hiatus, The Runway is back and ready to restore their positive role on campus celebrating students of all demographics on the club’s 10 year anniversary. 
The Runway meets virtually every Monday and Wednesday from 8-10 p.m. Due to this semester’s COVID-19 regulations, the club has been unable to meet in person. 
The Runway prides themselves on being a multicultural club and one of LIU’s only clubs with predominantly Black members. They are a major outlet of support for Black designers, DJs, models, photographers, brands, and creatives. Each year they host a spring fashion show that utilizes and showcases these talents to the campus community. Although The Runway makes a creative point in promoting Black creatives with their platform, they welcome members and outlets of all demographics. 
The Runway prides itself on being a safe space for students to expand their creative niches, showcase both their internal and external beauty and promote self confidence, said Tevani Hibbert, a senior computer science major and club president. “We’re here to promote confidence, self love and individualism to all students at the LIU Post campus,” she said.
Hibbert views The Runway as an integral part of the campus’s culture. “The Runway being back is more than just a club being available. It’s a part of the LIU culture that we wanted to bring back and make even better,” she said.  
The Runway takes active measures towards fostering and enriching the university’s environment for all students, according to Hibbert. They do so by actively participating in fashion, modeling, photography, and confidence centered functions used to enlighten and celebrate the students. 
As The Runway moves ahead this semester, a major focus of theirs is reaching new and eager students with their ambitious messages of positivity. Currently, between the remote and on campus students The Runway has 21 active student members. 
At this time, three of the eboard positions are filled by Madison DeBose, a junior business administration major, as vice president and Kwan Burke, a junior business administration major, as the fashion coordinator, but Hibbert said that they are looking for dedicated students of interest to fulfill the remaining leadership positions. 
The Runway club encourages all who are intrigued by their return and message of self love, confidence and creativity to follow them on Instagram at @liu_therunway. Students with questions are suggested to direct message the account to get in touch with active club members.

Senior psychology major and member of the women’s soccer team Tiana Ono is excited about life after college. 
Ono is currently in her third semester at Post, which is the third university Ono has attended. She started playing collegiate soccer in Nevada but chose to finish her associates at a Junior College in Washington after not getting a scholarship following her first year. She was recruited to play at Post soon afterward. 
Ono would love to live in New York City after graduating. “I went to NYC for the first time on my visit to LIU and immediately fell in love with the atmosphere,” she said. “It enticed me to commit on the spot.” 
Ono says this will be her last year at Post, and her last year playing soccer whether or not she gets a redshirt year. After playing soccer for nearly 17 years, she feels it’s time to move on from the sport following this season. 
Currently, Ono and her team can only have no contact practices. Due to this, she says it has been mostly just running and conditioning up to this point but is ultimately very excited to be back on campus and going back to the day to day life she is used to.
Ono is unsure of the status of her season, since all competition is canceled until at least winter. While it is likely that sports will be back in the near future, Ono feels it may be difficult to get all the teams playing at the same time. 
“Spring athletes should get priority even if that means my sport gets canceled since all winter and spring championships got canceled last year,” she said. 
While Ono was not able to play soccer because of restrictions put in place due to COVID-19, she was still able to enjoy her summer by reading and going to the beach. She also said that she enjoyed picking up surfing again, something she has not done in a while. 
While she doesn’t exactly know what she wants to do with her career, Ono sees herself pursuing a career in marketing. “Marketing is a successful balance between psych and communications because you have to understand the mindset of what people want, and how to present it to them properly,” she said.
