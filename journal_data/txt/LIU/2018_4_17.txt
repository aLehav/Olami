Peter Antingham Grabowski, a political science and philosophy double major, and Kristina Dolan, a fine arts major and digital art and design minor, have been named co-valedictorians of the class of 2018.
Grabowski, who has a 4.0 GPA, was the recipient of the Presidential Award, Steven H. Hornstein Scholarship and Jerry Tilles Endowed Scholarship. He also was inducted in both the Pi Gamma Mu honor society for social science and Pi Sigma Alpha honor society for political science, and awarded the Arthur J. Waterman Prize for the most outstanding senior in political science.
In between his academics, Grabowski worked as a tutor for the philosophy and political science departments, assisting students with coursework. He was also a research assistant for Dr. Michael Soupios, a political science professor, and a teacher’s assistant for Dr. Amy Freedman, chair of the political science department.
“LIU offered me a very generous scholarship, and the location was very convenient for me. I was intrigued. I set up a meeting with Dr. Soupios in August of 2014 to discuss possible classes for Fall ’14, I enrolled in his class, and I never looked back,” Grabowski said about his decision to attend LIU Post. He plans to attend graduate school in 2019 to earn a Ph.D. in political science with a concentration in either international relations or American politics, and then possibly work in academia or for a think tank.
Grabowski is particularly interested in working in academia because of his Post professors. “Dr. Soupios is an absolutely brilliant man; he is a role model in every sense of the word. I took him for all four classes he teaches, and then a few more times for independent studies. He pushed me really hard and challenged me, but it was worth it,” he said.
“Additionally, Dr. Freedman has also been a wonderful professor for me too; I’ve taken her six or seven times and she offered me so many opportunities for networking and advancement. She believed in me when I didn’t even believe in myself,” Grabowski added.
Grabowski, 24, a native of Glen Cove, resides in Brookville Hall. He has an older brother, Dennis, and has Spanish, English and Polish roots. At Kellenberg Memorial High School in Uniondale, he graduated seventh in a class of 547.
“Reading is my strongest passion; it is something I always fall back on if I’m experiencing any kind of stress or issue,” he said. When asked what his biggest challenges were he responded, “My biggest challenge is occasionally I lose my discipline. Sometimes I’ll get distracted or let small things get to me, or I lose sight of the big picture.”
He described obstacles he has faced. “I’ve had some serious health problems since about 2011. Health problems forced me to dropout of high school in February of my senior year. For a few years after that I never thought I would be able to attend college. It’s been an unbelievable journey for me,” he said. “First and foremost, I need to thank my family. My mother, father and brother have been there for me every step of the journey. I would also like to thank Lewis Cabibi (’15) for being a role model for me. I also need to thank my brothers at Sigma Alpha Epsilon for their love and support,” he said.
Grabowski offered advice to other students. “First, most of my regrets in college have been over things I didn’t do vs. things I did do, so definitely be open to trying new things. Second, it is ok to rely on a support system of family and friends. Needing advice or help doesn’t make you weak, it makes you human,” he said.
Dolan, 21, also has a 4.0 GPA. She’s been on the dean’s list for four years and received the O’Malley Grant this semester from the Art Department, a grant given to a student who is working on a large-scale art project. She will receive the Eleanor Lockwood Memorial Award in Sculpture at the Student Award Ceremony. She worked part time in a retail store to help pay for personal expenses in college. She also volunteered for the past four years at an elementary afterschool program, Girls on the Run, that teaches young girls how to stay happy and healthy, both physically and mentally.
A Williston Park native, Dolan commutes to campus.“I obviously really like doing art. It is something that I find very therapeutic,” she said. “One of my strengths is that I never give up, no matter the challenge. I am meticulous with everything I do.”
“A challenge that I have faced is that I am very shy. My college experience helped me to grow, but my shyness is something that I still deal with on a daily basis,” she said.
Dolan has an older brother who attends Hofstra University, and has Irish and Italian roots. “I am a runner, and enjoy walking my dog. I do like to travel too. My family has taken many vacations all over the country, which has left a big impression on me,” she said.
She is excited to be co-valedictorian. “It is a great honor and it really makes me feel like I truly did the best that I could. For me, I strive to do my best with anything that I do,” she said.
Dolan offered advice to students as well. “Always try to stay positive, even when something seems difficult to accomplish, never give up, and do your best.”

The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity (SAE) and the Coalition for Conservation club joined forces to make LIU Post a cleaner, greener campus through their co-hosted campus clean-up event on Friday, April 13. The coalition and SAE were joined by sororities Delta Zeta and Alpha Epsilon Phi to collect trash in various locations across campus, including the residence halls, Hillwood Commons, Pratt Recreation Center, the Winnick House garden and labyrinth, academic buildings, and the Chipmunk Trail. There was also a contest involved: whichever team collected the most trash would win $50.
“We don’t want trash and plastic littered around campus because it’s harmful to the environment and animals,” Makayla Lopez, a sophomore psychology major and vice president of Coalition for Conservation, said. “We have a lot of wildlife on campus,” she added.
Twenty-five students met at Hillwood Commons at noon before splitting up into four groups. The teams met back at Hillwood at 2:40 p.m. to weigh the collected trash and declare the winner. The team of four students from Delta Zeta won the contest by collecting three bags from the Chipmunk Trail near Hillwood Commons.
“That could be considered the most littered area [on campus] in terms of bottles and cans,” Lopez said.
“We are not only trying to make ourselves look good, but also the [LIU Post] community around us,” Gilberto Torres, president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said. “If our community does well, we do well.”
This is the third time the coalition has held a campus clean-up day, once as a part of the Earth Day celebrations, and last semester. The coalition promotes conservation and environmental sustainability through several activities each year, including tie-dying recycled T-shirts, selling succulents and creating a campus vegetable garden. They will host a fourth campus clean-up day again in the fall.

Dear Readers,
As my last issue as your Editor-In-Chief, I must say it has been my greatest pleasure to serve the campus community. The Pioneer has taught me a great deal about journalism, my future career and life itself. Who knew all those long nights putting together the newspaper would be some of the best memories of my college career.
I cannot thank my staff and editorial board enough for helping me create a newspaper that not only informs but stays true to reporting accurate news. Thank you to my advisor, Professor Levin for recognizing my passion, hard work and blessing me with the opportunity to take on this role. I also want to thank our readers, because without you, there would be no Pioneer.
My one word of advice as a graduating senior would be to find your passion and stick with it, no matter how frustrating it may get. As Confucius once said, “choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.”
I wish the new editors luck in continuing to make the Pioneer the best that it can be.
Your Editor-In-Chief,
Caroline Ryan

Registration for the three summer sessions began in March. Summer session one runs from May 21 – June 22, session two runs from June 25 – July 27 and session three runs from July 30 – August 31, with a weekly schedule of Monday through Thursday classes.
There are more than 200 courses offered, including accounting, art, astronomy, biology, business, chemistry, cinema, criminal justice, economics, education, English, earth science, finance, foreign language, healthcare & public administration, history, health science, math, music, nursing, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, sociology and theatre.
Students earn three credits during a six week period at a cost of $1,115/per credit for undergraduate courses, $1225/per credit for graduate courses and an additional $469 university service fee.
Sydney Duffy, a junior political science major, is depending on summer classes in order to graduate in May 2019 and to get better grades in her courses. “I am taking summer classes to lessen my workload during the semester. After I switched my major from art therapy, I realized there was a lot of things I needed to complete and it would be far too overwhelming to do throughout the school year. Taking summer classes will allow me to focus on school and internships as well as still having time for work. I am following my own timeline to success,” she said.
Jennifer Mather, a senior criminal justice major, is taking two courses this summer because she is behind in credits. “I’m supposed to officially graduate in May, however, because my success coach did not tell me I was behind in credits, I am forced to take summer classes,” she said.
Ruslan Mamedov, a sophomore biology major, is excited about taking classes this summer, as it would allow him to get some courses out of the way. “I’m taking organic chemistry during summer session one,” he said. “I’m a biology major and we have so many required science courses and some of them are only offered in the fall. I’m taking this one earlier so that I have the opportunity to take a different course this fall,” he said.
Students can register for summer sessions online on the MyLIUportal, or in-person at the office of enrollment services in Kumble Hall.

Casting your vote for the new Student Government Association(SGA) officers has been postponed from Friday, April 20, to Wednesday, April 25. This change was made so more students could sign up to run for positions. Students will cast their votes for the new SGA officer using their my.liu.edu email. Elections are held at the end of the spring semester for the following academic school year.
Another election will be held at the beginning of the fall semester for positions that are not filled this semester by vote such as, freshman class president. All SGA positions are held for one full academic school year. Candidates will campaign starting Monday, April 16 through Wednesday, April 25.
The current candidates are as listed: Olivia Kavanagh is running unopposed for SGA President, Anand Venigalla and Adam Silverstein are running for Vice President, Rachel Youngleman is running unopposed for secretary, Adam Pilzer is running unopposed for treasurer, Christopher O’Connell is running unopposed for Resident Senator, and Aaron Cooper is running unopposed for Senate Advisor. Representing the class of 2019: Morgan Kashinsky, Griffin Albrecht, and Tom Palliniare running for class President, Erica Ferrara is running unopposed for Vice President, and Angelique D’Alessandro is running unopposed for Secretary.
All full-time students with a 2.5 GPA or better are eligible to run for SGA positions. “This is the first year that SGA has removed the requirement to be in SGA for at least one year to run for the positions of Parliamentarian, Senate Advisor, Treasurer, and Secretary. SGA hopes that this change to the bylaws will encourage people to apply for these positions, and create more diversity [in] SGA,” Giovanna Domingo, the current SGA President, who is a senior accounting major, said. In order to run for President and Vice President, candidates must have been on the SGA board for one full term.
Resident Senator, Commuter Senator, Greek Senator, Senator at Large, Class of 2019 President, Class of 2020 President, and Class of 2021 President are available for new candidacy, no one at this time is running for the listed positions. “All positions are incredibly crucial to the success of SGA,” Domingo said.
The overall responsibility of all positions in SGA is to make decisions concerning any student concerns and to assist clubs and organizations. It is SGA’s responsibility to address student problems.
The President is the official representative of the SGA and the student body as a whole; the president is the voice of the students when speaking to faculty and staff.
The Vice President works with the president and other executive board members in making enhancements to events for the academic school year and oversees funding affairs for the school. The treasurer allocates the budgets of clubs and leads the conversation concerning budgeting with other executive board members. The secretary’s job is to record the minutes in each SGA meeting.
The senator advisor oversees each leader in SGA, ensuring that everyone is in support of SGA assisting in school events and in planning and promotion. The Parliamentarian facilitates meetings and keeps documentation of official votes.
“There are countless benefits to being a member of SGA. Members of SGA work directly with staff to create change on the campus [and] it is a great way to obtain leadership experience,” Domingo said. Changes that members of the SGA work to get range from on-campus food services issues to dormitory cleanliness concerns.
The application submission to run for candidacy is ongoing. All SGA meetings, which are held on Mondays at 5 p.m. in Hillwood room 221, are open to the public. Students who are not members of SGA have the opportunity to participate in discussions and voice their opinions and concerns.
“My advice to future student leaders is to step outside of their comfort zone, and reach out of the community members they normally would not. In order to represent the student body and make change, we must understand the strengths and weaknesses of our community. This can only be done by being present and willing to listen to others,” Domingo said. To learn more about the Student Government Associationstudents can stop by the SGA office, located in Hillwood, room 219.

A walk around campus in the autumn or spring will showcase the colorful foliage of the numerous trees that decorate over 307 acres of property. A closer look at certain tree trunks will reveal labeled plaques with the common and scientific names of trees and the region they naturally grow in. These are all part of what was once known as the Community Arboretum.
The arboretum was coordinated by Vincent Simeone (‘03) as part of his thesis project. Simeone worked with ground staff to identify and properly label each plant. He also helped design and produce a brochure and walking tour map that is no longer available to students. “I saw the little notes describing what the trees were, but I didn’t know it was a tour or anything,” Nikolas Kahl, sophomore art education major, said. “I don’t think we’re losing anything [by not being told about it], but it’s nice to walk around and just happen upon them.”
Now, the arboretum consists of about 40 acres of labeled trees withover 70 different native and exotic species. “We focused on original restoring trees that were part of the estate, and some of the more unusual trees along the walk that highlight them,” Simeone said. Many of the trees hold horticultural or historical value, such as a 100-foot tulip tree, an 80-year-old American elm and a weeping elm planted in the 1920’s. All three of these trees stand around the admissions building.
“Tree Talk” was the name of a semesterly newsletter published about the arboretum up until the winter of 2013. It featured the newest additions to the arboretum and other environmental and horticultural news relative to the campus. “Tree Talk was a really excellent tool to be able to publicize sustainability issues. We lost something valuable when the university discontinued that,” Scott Carlin, associate professor of earth and environmental science, said.
Though new trees and fowerbeds are planted every so often, students rarely take notice that the campus even has an arboretum. Approximately 50,000 bulbs were planted in the central arboretum area by Case Joosse, head groundskeeper. “I feel like it does go really unnoticed, but now that I know about that, I have a lot more respect for the entire thing,” Argyro Papathanasiou, freshman fine arts major, said.
The arboretum contributes to campus sustainability and serves to help students connect to the natural world, according to Carlin. “Trees are an incredible testament to how we as humans relate to the natural world, they are so essential to our health,” he said. “They filter water through the roots in the soil and produce oxygen; they’re incredibly important for purifying the world.”
The arboretum is no longer advertised as a guided tour, but it is maintained regularly for the benefit of students and faculty. “It’s really a wonderful thing to have because people have come to this campus for years and said how beautifully natural the whole scene is,” Kay Sato, director of The Hutton House Lectures, said. “New York City is there but you don’t even realize, you’ve got this wild landscape you can’t find anywhere.”

A recent flood in the basement of Pell Hall has damaged parts of the building and forensic science laboratory equipment. The flood was caused by a drain clog that lead to an over flowing sink in a janitorial closet, according to Roy Fergus, director of facilities services. Facilities services located the source and shut off the running water before draining the water out. Several laboratories and classrooms were damaged by the flooding.
“The water got under the door of some laboratories and anything on the floor took damage. This included a box of les or product,” Fergus said.
The damaged items belonged to the forensic science department, whose faculty and students have already made complaints about working with outdated equipment.
“A finalized inventory of the damage has been submitted, and I am confident that the repairs and replacements will be forthcoming,” Francis Harten, director of the forensic science program, said.
Facilities services and Pell Hall faculty were briefed on how to prevent another situation like this to occur.
Staff were instructed to shut off faucets, report all leaks and to check the area before leaving. “If something isn’t right or a clog is noticed it should be addressed, or someone should be told about it,” Fergus said. He added that all facilities services staff receive “basic training to assure inspections are done, as well as being done properly.”

As college flashes past our eyes, we tend to get nervous as to how fast reality hits us. We spent so much time enjoying our classes, being with friends, and not having to worry about “adulting” quite yet. We start to feel a panic of wondering whether or not this is something we can handle.
For some, graduation is coming up soon, which means full time jobs are right behind them. If those of you are feeling stressed and overwhelmed about it, just remember you are right where you need to be. Finding jobs can be tiring and feel almost as if it is impossible, but things like that take time. Be positive and don’t give up because everything happens for a reason. Feeling lost or alone when leaving college is a lot more normal than you may think.
Even if you land a job that you are not truly happy with, it is an experience worth taking because we learn from every situation we find ourselves in. If you find yourself not truly happy or please with where you currently are, take a step back.
Try and find one thing that you can benefit from and hold ontothat. Finding the little things that make it all worth it can bring you happiness and make the tough situations bearable.

We all know that the foods we eat have an effect on our health, however, it’s amazing to think that just a few decades ago it was almost completely unknown that food components such as trans fats and sugars can affect the body in harmful ways. The next major area of researchseems to be focused around something called the microbiome.
A microbiome is a “conglomeration of microorganisms in a particular environment” as defined by the National Institute of Health (NIH). In fact, the microorganisms in our gut out number the amount of cells
in our body nine to one and since they are alive and possess their own DNA, they are also responsible for a variety of vital functions we may take for granted on a daily basis.
In an ideal internal environment, the bacteria in our intestines, like most things in life, live in a balance of good and bad. At this state, digestion is uninterrupted, the immune system functions appropriately, and weight can be managed without struggle. However, according to The Microbiome Study done by the NIH, when we offset this balance by eating sugar and highly processed, low ber foods, the balance shifts and the ‘bad’ bacteria creates a laundry list of negative symptoms and conditions.
Some of the most relatable symptoms that this ‘bad’ bacteria overgrowth elicits include bloating, indigestion, brain fog and the inability to lose weight despite effort. In fact, a study done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) confirmed this theory in a mass study done with mice where some ‘bad’ bacteria was added to a mouse with a balance of microorganisms. After this addition, regardless of the mouse being on the same exact diet and exercise regimen, the mouse gained weight and was unable to lose it until the ora was returned to balance.
The trends of the modern American diet unfortunately promotes bad bacteria overgrowth. Often times, we only choose meals and drinks based on flavor and taste. Snapple tastes better than water, and mac and cheese taste better than quinoa, however these ‘tasty’ foods act as fertilizers for ‘bad’ bacteria, allowing them to thrive and continue to outgrow the ‘good’, worsening symptoms and conditions. Additionally, it’s been concluded by the Mayo Clinic that stress has a direct effect on the microbiome and that just one high stress day can shift the microbiome into an unfavorable state that negatively affects digestion and slows metabolism.
Diabetes, irritable bowel disease, and food intolerances are just some of the many conditions that can be aided or rectified by adjusting the diet to include less unpronounceable substances, more fiber, and less sugar. Although the complete story is not yet known regarding the microbiome, it’s a hot topic among many of the world’s top scientific organizations. Something, however, that each organization can conclude at this point is that a healthy diet as well as proper stress management techniques promote intestinal and digestive health and should be adopted by all.

Associate Professor of Italian and French, Marco Codebo, encourages students who want cultural diversity on campus to take Italian. In the fall, Codebo will teach a new course, ITL 72 “Contemporary Italian Culture through the Lens of Fashion.”
“This class will explore the ramification of fashion, a highly important business in Italy today,” Codebo said about the class.
Codebo started as an associate professor of Italian and French at Post in September 2018. He also teaches French and Spanish, but said, “Italian remains my primary field.”
Codebo was born in Genoa, a city in northern Italy; he values his hometown’s significance in the middle ages. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it became one of the financial capitals of Europe, as Genoese bankers loaned money to kings and princes. Codebo moved to the United States 25 years ago, after teaching Italian in many high schools.
Codebo shares his past experiences in Italy with his students. “I feel like I am sharing something important, something that comes from a thousand year long history, and I like this feeling,” he said.
“I left when I got a job as a lecturer of Italian at UCLA; it was a position entirely funded by the Italian government as part of a program that supported the teaching of the Italian language and culture around the world,” Codebo said.
After a few years in Los Angeles, he was admitted to the graduate program in comparative literature at UC Santa Barbara. In order to attend, Codebo commuted from Santa Barbara and LA, where he also had to juggle making a living for his wife and two children. “I took a little longer than expected, but I finished my PhD in 2005,” he said.
Codebo believes that learning about a foreign language and a different culture is lucrative in the job market.
“I think this gives students a unique skill; I mean this not only from a cultural point of view, but also from a practical point of view; the best skill you need today, when work or doing business, is flexibility. Nothing can give you more flexibility than putting yourself in somebody else’s shoes, and this is what you do when you try to speak another language or learn a foreign culture,” Codebo said.
“In my classes, I happen to teach Italian to students who want to be able to talk to their grandparents or to help students learn the culture of their ancestors,” Codebo added.
Codebo also teaches ITL 18, a first-year seminar course on contemporary culture in Italy. This class studies three areas of Italian life: the family, organized crime, and migrations from and to Italy.
“My teaching materials include works created through both textual and visual media: a novel, movies, YouTube videos, and newspaper articles. I taught this class [ITL 18] in the fall semester, and I am teaching it this spring; All in all, I am quite pleased with the way students respond to this class and to being exposed to a foreign culture,” he said.
Although Codebo is grateful to help his students have a better lens of culture, he is concerned about the Italian program at Post.
“In the past years, the enrollment in the Italian classes has been down,” he said, for “numerous reasons.”
Yet, Codebo is optimistic that the Italian program will flourish and believes that having a strong Italian program “is an asset for this University.”
The program is important to the Italian American community, “a community that has historically sent a lot of its young members to this campus,” he said.
“We just need to work together to keep this program alive; it should not be an impossible feat,” he said.

When you think of the state of Montana, you may envision the scenic landscapes of some of its national parks such as Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park. However, in “Far Cry 5” a new video game released March 27, things are not so glamorous.
This first-person shooter game takes place in Hope County, a fictional area in Montana. Playing as “Rook,” a sheriff’s deputy, your objective is to stop Joseph Seed, leader of the Project at Eden’s Gate cult. Seed portrays himself throughout the game as a god and speaks to the people of Hope County, preaching that the apocalypse is near and the residents either join him and his brothers and sisters or be marked as a sinner. If you are marked a sinner, you will be tortured and ultimately killed by the Seed family. 
Seed has three siblings, Jacob, John and Faith. The sister, Faith is the most interesting because of what is revealed about her at the end of the game; it evokes sympathy towards her. Faith’s ability to conjure up hallucinations makes for interesting cutscenes, but it’s also a bit demonic, especially at the end.
The other two,  Jacob and John are less interesting. Jacob carries a hypnotizing music box, and when he plays the music he makes you “cull the herd,” a kind of ritual where you have to kill as many people as possible before time runs out. His missions are exactly the same every time.
John is known as the “baptist.” He believes if you say “yes,” to him, all of your sins can be forgiven. While John seems more reasonable, he’s not. If you object to John, one of the seven deadly sins becomes engraved on your skin. Ironically, John has one of the sins, “sloth,” tattooed on his body.
Ubisoft, the game’s publisher, pushed their limits by referencing pop culture and modern-day politics. In one point in the game, you stumble across a sewer opening and see a red balloon tied to a string, a direct reference to the movie “It.” There’s also a mission in the game that requires you to secure confidential information about President Donald Trump.
The game has a lot to offer besides the main story. There are many side quests that require you to collect vinyl records or destroysilos. The game ends when you finish the final mission, so to continue playing, you must return to a previous save, as if you didn’t finish the game. Like a lot of other Ubisoft games, “Far Cry 5” features online multiplayer where you can complete missions with friends.
The game is awed because it is not particularly challenging, even after increasing the difficulty level. It would be more challenging if there were less fast traveling, a setting that allows players to instantly change locations on the map, even during combat.
Visually, the game looks beautiful. The dense vegetation within the forests and lakes filled with trout in Hope County make you feel like you’re visiting Montana. There are things to do such as fishing and piloting planes.
The latter is fun because of the challenge presented by the cockpit’s limited vision. Despite the impressive aesthetics, the game’s story is bland; in order to face Seed, you must take over the land that his siblings control, which becomes a chore after a while.
Compared to previous “Far Cry installments, this is the first game that takes place in America and has references to pop culture. The best part about “Far Cry” is that each game installment is different.
“Far Cry 5” is available via digital download on Xbox, Playstation and Steam for $59.99.

Photography is an art form wherein the artist has only a split second to capture something beautiful. For senior photography major Caroline Bert this could not be more true. Bert is in the midst of her last semester, and she has used her passion and dance experience to fuel her creative works. “Movement is the most obvious form of expression,” Bert said. She has danced for a majority of her life and has been a Zumba instructor since June 2017 for both adults and children at Dance Innovation and Crunch Fitness.
Bert’s work is being shown until April 21 at the Fotofoto Gallery in Huntington, N.Y. in an exhibition titled— “Hang Your Best Shot.” Her senior project, entitled “Opposing Forces,” is her most recent work. The installation was designed to be interactive, “I wanted to turn it into an experience for the viewers,” Bert said. Viewers could engage and alter certain pieces. For example, Bert used a set of blinds and collaged an image on each side so the viewer could control and flip between the two.
This solo exhibition utilized mixed media and installation art, 3D artwork that is designed to transform a space, to create her exhibitions. Bert took shots of dancers and altered them into black and white, and combined the edits of these images to create one piece. The contrast of black and white signals the “opposition” mentioned in the collection title. The concept behind these layers was to conceal and reveal emotions at the same time. “Usually only the photographer is [able to] witness the raw emotions on set,” Bert said.
Bert explained what she loves most about being a photographer. “I like being able to create a scene that isn’t real,” she said. Bert initiated a campus photography club during fall 2017. She will continue to serve as the club’s president during her graduate studies.
Bert reflected on what she has learned over her four years in the photography program. She mentioned that the professors in the fine arts department are always supportive of her “crazy ideas,” such as collaborations. “Photography doesn’t have to be bound to printing and paper,” Bert said. She was encouraged to test her limits and bend the classic rules of camera, subject and photo.
More of Bert’s work can be viewed on her website www.carolinebertphotography.com/ or on her Facebook page, Caroline Bert Photography.

Dedication, time and commitment are things the members of the dance team know well. They gave up their free time and pushed their bodies to the limit to work towards one goal: nationals.
The LIU Post Dance team traveled to Daytona, Florida on Tuesday, April 4. They set out on a 23-hour bus ride to compete in the biggest cheer competition in the nation, the NCA & NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship.
They placed sixth in the “Game Day” division. The university spirit programs worked together, showcasing their talents to encourage students’ excitement in support of their university and its athletic teams. This division allows the participation of traditional sideline cheer and dance teams and incorporates of members of the school marching band, pep band, drumline and mascot.
The dance team found out two months beforehand that they were going to nationals, and this put them at a disadvantage. Other teams started preparing in August while the Pioneers started in late January.
“I think we were as ready to compete as we could have been, but after we found out we were going to nationals, I think we all really started to work harder in practices and our coach did everything she could to prepare us for the stage,” Marina Kilkenny, sophomore health sciences major, said.
The team practiced twice a week leading up to nationals, and their coach, Tiffany Farrell, added extra practices. She expected them to do whatever necessary to be able to keep their stamina up to get through routines and make sure they had the strength to be able to execute the skills correctly, whether it be extra running or practicing certain tricks on their own time.
Farrell prepared them by detailing exactly what was expected on the stage: finals took place outdoors and the dancers would have the sun in their eyes. Farrell coached them to give it their all, dance with clean and precise movements and to be synchronized. Farrell told the team to give it 95 percent, and that would be key to their success.
The dance team did not have a coach at the beginning of the school year, but they overcame this adversity with hard work. They choreographed a three-minute routine for the competition.
The members were proud of how they nished at the competition, especially with the limited amount of time they had to prepare. “Finding our 77 days prior to leaving that we were going to nationals, we knew we had to buckle down and make something happen,” Sarah Meehan, senior early childhood education major, said. “We came together as a team and put out a routine we were all very happy with and the results showed our hard work. It was an amazing experience with my teammates.”
Kilkenny said the experience of travelling and competing in the sport she loves was one for the books. “Overall, my experience at nationals was amazing. Not only was it the best on stage but also even off stage. I wouldn’t change any part of it for the world.”

Everyone has their own definition of the word “happy,” but what exactly does “happy” look like for people with dynamically different lives and experiences? From April 11 to April 14, Hannah Spiegel, senior photography major, showcased original photographs in a collection entitled “Happy.” Photographs of Spiegel’s friends, family and colleagues lined the walls of the S.A.L. Gallery, all donning smiles and showcasing what happiness looks like on each individual.
Spiegel’s series originated when she took a trip to Iceland with the sociology department in June of 2017. Iceland has been named one of the happiest countries in the world by the annual World Happiness Report, so members of the sociology department decided to investigate how happy people really were within the nation. After the trip, Spiegel decided to extend her stay in Iceland and backpack the country with a friend.
“I asked people, ‘what makes you so happy?’ and I found out that they’re not as happy as you would think.” Everyone has a story, and that sometimes cannot be translated into data.
For this exhibition, Spiegel explored types of photography outside of what she’s previously done. “My entire photography career has been nature and landscape, and I wanted to challenge myself,” she said. Despite being interested in and curious about people, Spiegel has always had difficulties photographing them. “For my senior show, I really wanted to push the envelope and meld the two studies together.” Spiegel found inspiration through her spirituality, and uses yoga and chakras to achieve personal growth and to push herself beyond her comfort zone.
Curious, happy, interesting, and inquisitive are the words that Spiegel used to describe her collection. Over the past four years on campus, Spiegel has seen both personal and technical growth within herself as an artist. “I’m more confident in it [making art], I would always try to what was correct academically, and I was always unsure if it was good enough,” she said. “But I realize that there’s a difference between being good technically and then just being good as an artist and then finding a balance between the two.” Alumna Liz Lopez gave Spiegel the best advice she’s ever received: just be yourself and don’t always think about what others will think about you or your art.
Spiegel chose to pursue photography regardless of how frustrating it can be at times. “Art is important in the fact that it is able to explain something in a way words can’t, and [it] expresses something in a language that anyone can understand.” To see more of Spiegel’s work, visit her Instagram @_hannahsp or her website HRSPhoto.weebly.com.

The women’s lacrosse team defeated one of its toughest East Coast Conference (ECC) rivals, the Mercy College Mavericks, 25-18 on Saturday, April 14 at Bethpage Credit Union Stadium.
Alyssa Mallery, a sophomore midfielder, scored the first goal for the Pioneers with no assists. The Pioneers and the Mavericks were toe-to-toe through much of the first period, going into halftime with an 11-11 tie.
The Mavericks seized a strong advantage to start o the second period, scoring three points within the first five minutes, bringing the score to 11-14.
Mallery and Brianna Feldman, a sophomore midfielder, were the Pioneers’ leading scorers in the second half, with six and three points, respectively. The Pioneers held the advantage throughout the second, leading by seven points with less than 10 minutes left.
Olivia Kirk, a senior goalkeeper, who was also named Division II National Defensive Player of the Week after their match against St. Thomas Aquinas College, had six total saves. While her team was on a run in the second, Kirk remained alert and kept up the momentum.
“I always say, ‘Stay hot, D [defense]’ because after a couple sets and you’re not moving as much, you kind of forget how to and you’re not always prepared, so that’s what we work on. I’ve got to keep my head in it the entire time,” Kirk said.
Paige Sherlock, a sophomore midfielder, scored the final point of the game.The Pioneers brought the game home with a seven point victory.
“They [the Mavericks] are a great team and they always push us to be our best and always give us great competition,” Kirk said after the game. “These are the games we come out for – it’s the hard working, close games, the ones that really show you how hard you work and how much more you have to give.”
This win comes after a 18-2 win on Wednesday, April 11 against St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, NY. The Pioneers are now 10-3 for the season.
The Pioneers’ next game is Wednesday, April 18 at 4 p.m. at Queens College, and their next home game is Wednesday, April 25 at 3 p.m. against Lindenwood University.
