On the first day of classes, your professor will often hand out a packet either physically or digitally titled “Syllabus.” The syllabus is a contract between the professor and the student outlining the student’s responsibilities, and what rights they have access to. Many students will often take a glance, review it with their professor during class, and shove it into their backpack for it to never be seen again. The other portion of students may read through it to better prepare for their class. 
Students can expect to find important information such as resources, deadlines, classroom policies, and contact information for office hours. In some instances, a student might find money. 
In an entrepreneurship course, one professor hid a message within two of his class’ syllabi. The text read, “There is one envelope in Dean Fusaro’s office with $40 in it. Just ask her and it’s yours. The first student from the class that finds it gets it.” 
Entrepreneurship professor and CEO of Sage Marketing, Daniel Klein, explained why it’s important for students to read the syllabus.
“I think it’s very important because it tells them how to do well in the class, so to me the syllabus is the instructions for how to do well,” Klein said. “I would hope that students would at least glance at it or look it over. Mine are very specific, I’ll give them all the rubrics for any midterm, any finals. I’ll tell them exactly what they need to do to pass the class — I want the students to do well, I’m going to show them how to do well, and all they have to do is read it.”
Out of everyone in Klein’s classes, only one student came forward to claim the prize. Freshman business administration major Talia Romito was the first— and only— student to secure the forty dollars hidden within the syllabus. 
“I definitely think you should read your syllabus. It helps me personally a lot just to get an idea of the classes you’re going into and just prepares you for your year to come,” Romito said. “I’ve always read my syllabus since high school and I plan to continue doing so throughout my four years here.”
Even after professors emphasize the importance of their syllabus, students still tend to ignore it or not look through it carefully. 
“I think students skip reading the syllabus because it can be long and overwhelming,” Klein said. “You need to know where to look. If I were a student I would definitely look at the rubrics if there are any in there. It’s a bit overwhelming because a typical syllabus is twelve or fourteen pages long.”
Reading the syllabus is often looked at as being responsible for knowing what’s going on in the class. 
“I feel like I went in [to class] like I could answer some questions based on the syllabus,” Romito said. “I kind of knew what my professor was talking about. — gives you an advantage going into the class, you’re not going in blind.”
Hiding money within the syllabus is not something professors typically do, but Klein found it to be an interesting way to see if his students were reading the material.
“I saw that a professor at another college did something like this and I just thought it would be fun to test out to see if anyone would find the money,” Klein said. 
“My initial reaction was confusion… Why did it say to pick up forty dollars in the dean’s office?” Romito said. “At first I thought it was a joke, I actually didn’t pick it up until four or five days after, because I thought it was just a joke and didn’t want to go and embarrass myself. So one day, I asked Professor Klein after the end of class, and he said no it’s not a joke and no one has picked it up so go pick it up you deserve it. Then, I realized it was real and it was pretty cool, I felt proud.” 
In the eyes of an entrepreneur, a couple of lessons can be learned from this experiment. 
“My classes teach entrepreneurship, one of the keys of entrepreneurship is knowing when to look out for opportunities that other people don’t see. So as an entrepreneur, if you find out or figure out an idea before other people, that can be your whole business. I want to teach them through experiential learning that there are opportunities everywhere, where you least expect it. That’s why I hid it inside the syllabus,” Klein said.
“I think that if you’re given the opportunity, take it,” Romito said. “I had the opportunity to win forty dollars and I was hesitant at first, if I didn’t go and see if it was real, I would have never won the money. So I say go with your gut and take the opportunities presented to you.” 
Seeing how this lesson was mostly entrepreneurial, how could a professor in another field of study take this type of experiment and apply it to their course?
“I would suggest that they could put something like this in some of their content where students would have to find the certain information and then the professor would know that they are not just reading information and taking a test, but they’re really understanding the content that they are doing,” Klein said.
In the future, Klein’s students may be more inclined to read their syllabi.

On Sept. 29, news broke in New York that Governor Kathy Hochul (D) decided to adopt regulations requiring all cars sold in New York State to be electric or hybrid vehicles by 2035. The decision also comes on the heels of California already deciding on a proposed regulation for gasoline-powered vehicles, and these decisions will affect a lot of people and many companies.
The primary purpose of limiting gasoline-powered vehicles is to prevent greenhouse gas emissions, and New York is a state with a lot of traffic, so the elimination of gas-powered vehicles would prevent a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. Gas-powered cars are one of the causes of carbon dioxide emissions, a problem that scientists say must be remedied. On the other hand, electric and hybrid vehicles emit less CO2 than gas-powered cars, which means they are less harmful to the global environment.
Global warming is currently causing all kinds of problems around the world. One of the most discussed problems caused by global warming is the rise in sea level. Global warming has led to an overall increase in global temperature, melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice and rising sea levels. In fact, some countries’ average temperature has increased compared to the past. In addition, scientists say there will be more droughts, more storms and more damage than now if global warming continues at this rate. That is why many feel the elimination of gas cars will prevent global warming.
Junior California State University, San Bernardino business management major Takuto Kataoka described the decision this way. 
“I think banning the sale of gas cars is a smart idea. Certainly, if gasoline-powered cars were eliminated from the earth, greenhouse gas emissions would be significantly reduced and global warming would be prevented at a much higher rate.”
On the other hand, if prohibiting gas cars had many benefits for the planet, many car companies would not benefit. With the ban on gas car sales in New York, there may be many other places where gas-powered car sales will be banned in the future. When that happens, so many car companies will be forced to respond by eliminating gas-powered vehicles. In particular, Japanese auto companies are strong in gas-powered vehicles and will be forced to take many actions in the future, including the development of electric vehicles. 
Junior Middle Tennessee State University communications major Kota Sato opposes the ban on gas cars. 
“I can’t agree with this ban on gas-powered vehicles. In fact, the elimination of gas-powered vehicles may actually prevent global warming by preventing the emission of many greenhouse gases. However, there are also many disadvantages, including the fact that some car companies may not be able to handle it. In addition, I disagree with the elimination of these gas cars because of the inconvenience of the current electric vehicles.” 
Currently, it usually takes several hours for an electric vehicle to fully refill its electric battery, and this takes up a lot of time. On the other hand, gas cars take only about five minutes to fill up. Also, electric vehicles are not able to run longer distances than gas-powered vehicles. In this way, people like Sato feel there are many disadvantages to eliminating gas-powered vehicles.
All of this has led to many advantages but also disadvantages to the elimination of gas-powered vehicles, and many opinions are being exchanged around the world.

Hurricane Ian has displaced thousands of Floridians whose homes are now uninhabitable. The storm took their safety nets with it, too.
The monster storm made its first U.S. landfall on Wednesday on Florida’s west coast as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, shredding homes with ferocious winds topping 150 mph. Florida’s death toll has climbed to at least 81 people.
Lee County, which surrounds Fort Myers, accounts for the majority of the fatalities, with at least 35 lives lost in the county.
In Charlotte County, which is home to Punta Gorda, the death toll is 23.
Other fatalities were reported in Sarasota, Volusia, Lake, Collier, Hendry and Manatee counties.
Junior criminal justice Mathew Nieves, who is from Tampa, also got a little bit of this storm. 
“It definitely was a scary moment of life by far,” Nieves said. “Me and my family never experienced something like that by far. We didn’t get it as bad, but the circumstances that happened was definitely a terrible situation.” 
As Florida tallies the immediate tab from its deadliest hurricane in decades, the destruction it wreaked on homes will erase retirees’ nest eggs and families homes, the primary way of passing along wealth to new generations. This exposes the dangers of American dependence on housing as most people’s financial backstop and lifeline.
The initial report property damage estimates for Ian currently range from $42 billion to as much as $258 billion.
If the estimates prove to be more accurate from the higher end, Ian would be the costliest natural disaster in U.S history, after 2005’s Hurricane Katrina which cost $186 billion.
Another issue created by a natural disaster is business interruption. This decrease in economic activity is measured either in terms of lost revenue or a combination of lost wages and profits.
This began when the disaster struck and will continue until the economy has recovered. 
However, these costs do not count lives lost or human misery, such as the number of people left without power or clean water.
“This definitely hurt my family business because of this,” junior Davon Wells said. Wells was also impacted by this storm. “ We just have to pray and hope everything gets better for not just us, but for all the families that lost or had something happen to them.”
The next process for the recovery from the storm is to get everything back to normal. Florida has begun cleanup in the aftermath of Ian’s destruction, as the state is working towards rebuilding infrastructure.
Of course the families that lost someone are not going to be the same, which students feel is the negative impact of this storm. But other than that, the process to rebuild everything back will come together soon.

On a sunny 67-degree October weekend, students, parents and alumni celebrated the annual Homecoming weekend here at LIU Post. 
Spanning the weekend of Oct.15, Post hosted several events on campus, including a late-night carnival, a 48-hour live show marathon on WCWP and the LIU Sharks football game versus Saint Francis University. 
Even though the LIU Sharks football team lost their game by a score of 57-7, there was different energy surging through Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium during Homecoming.
In an interview with The Wave’s Andrew Scarpaci, defensive backs coach of the LIU Sharks Kevin Richardson explained that the fans at Homecoming provided an extra spark. 
“I mean it was amazing to see. Everyone had spoken it up all week. We saw previous home games and you know the crowd wasn’t where we wanted it to be,” Richardson said. “The feeling of having those fans out there, the guys definitely felt that. To have fans out there and support, I think that brought that energy for the guys.” 
In addition to the fans in attendance for the football game, there was a carnival just outside Pratt Recreation Center. Junior business management major Lauren Ritirato spoke about how the carnival was entertaining. 
“The carnival outside the football game was very fun. It was great to walk around with my friends and collect all the free stuff, like fried Oreos, churros, cotton candy and Mets merchandise,” Ritirato said. “My friends and I also got matching tattoos and LIU merchandise, so this carnival really made up for the missing COVID year.” 
Like Ritirato, many students use Homecoming weekend to bond and make new friends on campus. Junior actuarial science major Vincent Randazzo spoke about how Homecoming has introduced him to new friends and passions.
“I attended Homecoming last year and it was my first Homecoming post-pandemic and I was going with The Wave radio station club. I was still new to the radio station so I was kinda awkwardly standing around the station’s tent making terrible small talk,” Randazzo said. “I remember the station folk being very friendly and inviting to me, and I really became more comfortable with them after Homecoming.”
Now being acclimated to The Wave radio station, Randazzo was able to experience one of WCWP’s Homecoming traditions. Every year, WCWP, the oldest radio station on Long Island, runs 48 hours of nonstop live programming. Randazzo talked about how he was able to participate with previous alumni and learn new skills during his Homecoming this year. 
“I was able to talk to some of the alumni who provided some fun and interesting stories of the station’s past. I especially remember one of the old layouts of the station and how they used to have run shows before it was renovated,” Randazzo recalled. “I was also shown how to scratch records live on the radio which was very cool.” 
Homecoming is one of the biggest events on campus for getting involved in student life and showing off school spirit. Ritirato talked about how she felt involved and showed her school spirit. 
“I came all decked out in my LIU best. I wanted to be festive for my personal favorite school event of the year. I think Homecoming is the perfect day to bond with friends at such a fun event,” Ritirato said.
Even though Homecoming was great to many, there’s always room for improvement. Randazzo thought that some things at Homecoming were lackluster and needed to be fixed up. 
“The carnival section to me was lackluster. I understand it’s more about the football game, but the three rides were kind of pitiful and not very enticing,” Randazzo said. “Homecoming was overall a good time for me, but that’s due to the experiences I had with my friends and the radio station rather than the game or school attractions.” 
While students felt that there were a few shortcomings, the general review of this year’s Homecoming is positive.
