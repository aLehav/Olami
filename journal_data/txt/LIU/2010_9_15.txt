The Pioneers rolled through week one of their 2010 season with a 20 – 11 victory over America International College, however, week two provided a much tougher opponent.
Facing fourth ranked Division II – California (Pa.) Vulcans in the home opener at Hickox field, Post got off to a great start when sophomore wide receiver Grayson Laurino caught a pass from quarterback Erik Anderwkavich for the first score of the game.
The Vulcans would eventually tie the game with a two-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Josh Portis. Yet Post came back again and scored on a two-yard run from sophomore running back, Thomas Beverly, however they failed to connect on the extra point due to a botched snap that forced holder R.J Kuhn to attempt a pass that was unsuccessful.
That would be the last time the Pioneers saw the end zone in the game because the Vulcans came right back and connected on a 36 yard pass from Portis to third year wide out Derrick Jones to end the first quarter trailing by one.
The Vulcans would run away with the game in the second quarter scoring early on a safety by tackling Laurino in the end zone for two points and increasing their lead by three. This proved to be the turning point in the game as Post seemed to lose all momentum from then on.
The Vulcans came out strong scoring again in both the third and fourth quarters to push the final score to 40-13.
Although the C.W Post offense got off to a quick start in the first quarter it disappeared over the next three. Anderwvich struggled, throwing three interceptions and fumbling twice, while the running game was halted gaining only 148 yards.
On the bright side, week one PSAC East Defensive player of the week Billy O’Connor had another strong game with eight tackles, including one for a loss of two yards. Sophomore line backer Ty Booth lead the team with 11 tackles and Junior Ronnie Modik helped out with 10.
The Pioneers next game is Saturday at Hickox field when Mercyhurst College visits and Post will seek out their second win of the season. Don’t forget coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com begins at 12:30 PM, kick off is at 1:00pm.

One of the main hopes for instituting the new common hour was to create more involvement among student life.  Keeping students on campus and initializing a pro-active student body were just some of the positive features that helped establish it in the first place.  However, general feedback has produced a multitude of mixed feelings among students on and off-campus.
“The common hour is a great meeting point for friends,” said Mike Dunne, a 21-year-old senior majoring in Business. “[However], the drawback is that Hillwood [Commons] and Winnick don’t have the facilities to seat that many students.”
“It’s insanity,” said Shane Cirella, a 20-year-old International Business major in his sophomore year. “The Subway lines go all the way outside [the door]. It makes me prefer to eat later.”
Sophomore and undeclared major Carla Villacreses, 20, evidently agreed when she mentioned that “Hillwood is filled up” with lines.
Bridgette Snow, 21, is a transfer student majoring in Math Education who feels the common hour can get in the way of how students choose to go about the school day.
“It’s smack right in the middle of the day,” said Snow. “Maybe if it was earlier, students can plan their schedules around it.”
With Post embarking on a whole new school year there are incoming freshmen who have approached a campus common hour as beneficial for student life.
“It’s a good break,” said Kyle Smith, an 18-year-old Forensic Science major. “[It allows time] to eat something, walk around campus and catch up with friends.”
On the other hand, some resolve the common hour would be alternatively better if the break period occurred less frequently throughout the school week.
“It would be good,” said Villacreses, “if it happened [only] once or twice.”
Transfer student and Health Administration major Jenny Mallet, 23, echoed similar sentiments when she remarked that four times a week is too much for a common hour. “It’s hard to wait around for an hour [everyday] when you’re a commuter.”
“It’s a good idea but not every day,” added Snow. “I’d appreciate it if was two days a week.”

Change is one of those words that people like to throw around. Sometimes the word has a negative connotation, but more often, it evokes inspiration and hope of something better.
The funny thing about change as a concept, however, is that people like to talk about it more than they like to enact it. If we lived in an ideal world, change would be a perfecting brushstroke to the canvas that is the status quo. But the world is not perfect.
This fall semester, the administration took a daring step forward and decided that it is not enough that this university maintains adequacy. Sealing a deal with Apple that granted incoming students iPads, Long Island University placed itself in the vanguard of innovative education.
Many have praised the Apple iPad for its potential academic applications. Nick Bilton, adjunct professor at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, points out that the tablet eliminates the need to carry several pounds of books, magazines and the weight of a laptop. And this is only one aspect of it. Bilton explains that it may enable students and professors to turn their textbooks into a radically interactive experience, with everything from shared notes to three-dimensional presentations.
C.W. Post Campus Provost Paul Forestell is just as enthusiastic:”We are developing a framework for communication among faculty members, staff and students that is keeping pace with where technology is taking us in the 21st century”
Others are less positive about the iPad pilot program. A C.W. Post student who calls himself “The Undersigned” started an online petition against the program. Thus far, the online crusade has received some 250 signatures from students who voice more or less well-founded complaints against the university. “Everybody has an issue with our campus [C.W. Post],” says The Undersigned, who goes on to rage about the unjust distribution of the iPads and demands to know where the money to pay for them came from.  To view this petition visit http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/group.php?gid=129980413712265&ref=search.
The question of funding is easily answered. Each incoming class receives an allotted pot of money. This pot is strategically invested to improve the experience of the particular class. Some of the money is awarded to the students upon entrance. For instance, three years ago, each student of the incoming class received a total of $500 in book vouchers.
The unnamed critic is certainly right about one thing, C.W. Post is not a perfect school and there are many students who “have an issue” with the campus. What our malcontent petitioner conveniently overlooks is that the university’s administration constantly looks for new ways to enhance the school and that the iPads are a means of achieving this.
Nevertheless, the problem is not really that the freshmen are receiving iPads but that the rest of the students are not. Incoming students can enjoy the administration’s othe investments, such as some significant nip and tuck to both the television studio and the radio station, and not to mention a brand new off-campus shuttle.  But this leaves the upperclassmen and alumni with thoughts of deception and betrayal.

The C.W. Post Women’s Volleyball team welcomed three freshmen this season, Shayla Hixson and Jordan Schroer from the island of Oahu, and Maka Namahoe from Hawaii. But the girls brought a lot more from the tropical island than their knee pads.
“On Oahu [Hawaii] it’s really Aloha friendly,” said Schroer, an outside hitter. “You smile at everyone, and say hi. Everyone is your uncle and auntie, everyone is ‘ohana; everyone is family.” The other girls didn’t argue this sentiment, in fact they agreed on just about everything except their favorite dishes they missed from home.
“I miss the food from back home,” exclaimed Namahoe. “We’ve had our families ship some food up here and a lot of the people aren’t really feeling it,” she said grinning. “Nobody likes spam here.”
And that could be the only thing they don’t like. The girls were greeted by a couple of teammates as they sat talking about their 5,000 mile journey to Post. “Longest flight of my life,” Namahoe said smirking.  As for her parents, they weren’t too thrilled to see their daughter go so far. “After seeing your kids grow up and watch them play all the time, yeah they weren’t too happy about it, but they’ll get over it.”
“My parent’s kind of took a different side,” said Hixson. “They wanted me to experience something different.”
“You need to go away to appreciate it,” Namahoe interjected. As for Schroer, the decision to come here wasn’t as overwhelming. “I have family from Scarsdale, so it wasn’t that big of a deal for me.” Her aunties and uncles actually filled a small section of the stands and could be seen giving out leis to the girls after their second match of the day, a sweep of the Owls of Southern Connecticut 3 – 0 (the girls swept Pace 3 – 0 earlier in the day).
It’s safe to say the girls are enjoying their new island experience; however, many students may question why they even came. “Every time you tell someone that you’re from Hawaii they look at you funny and ask, ‘Why’d you come here?’” Hixson, also an outside hitter said sharply. “We get asked that every time!”
Their accents make them noticeable off the court and have been the basis for a lot of playful jokes from other students. “Everyone teases me about my accent.” Hixson said laughing and the girls agreed. “But we have our own lingo,” Namahoe added. “Everyone seems to be catching on to it too, I think they like it.”
But what has gotten the girl’s most excited is what will occur once their sports season has ended…a new season will start.  And this is one they’ve haven’t experienced yet. “I’ve never seen snow!” repeated Namahoe and neither has Hixson. Conveniently both of them forgot to pack any type of shoe other than their sneakers and slippers (flip-flops in our region). “I don’t even have a coat,” Hixson chuckled.
The girls became animated at their first sight of a squirrel. “I always get shocked when I see one,” cried Namahoe, an outside hitter who made 11 kills in the second match. “We’re used to seeing them in character form, talking to me!” Schroer said laughing with the other girls. “We have everything but squirrels, so it’s neat to see.”
The three of them are enjoying their first taste of campus life, which surprisingly isn’t the crazy non-stop action they thought it would be and they were amazed at how friendly people are to one another. Schroer explained, “When you live in Hawaii and you bring it here, and get people to say ‘ohana, call people auntie and uncle, it’s just nice to spread that aloha spirit to the east coast.”

After finishing the 2009 season with a 12-5-2 record and winning the East Coast Conference Championship Tournament, it was only fitting that the C. W. Post Men’s soccer team is ranked number one in the ECC preseason poll.
Returning All-Conference players, junior midfielder David Carlsson, and sophomore back Leron Haywood, look for continued success this season under tutelage of their coach Andreas Lindberg who was named Coach of the Year last season.
In the first game of the year, C. W. Post squared off on the road against Franklin Pierce, and lost 6-2. A game in which the score was tied at the time of the half, but four unanswered goals caused an upset for the Pioneers in the end.
In their next game, the men’s soccer team faced Southern New Hampshire University. William Lindberg scored the lone goal, but it wasn’t enough as Post came out with yet another loss, this time the score being 3-1.
The Pioneers played their home opener against undefeated Bentley University. David Carlsson scored the first goal to give Post a lead. Later, senior Rumen Kerekov notched another goal, which proved to be the final score of the game giving Post their first victory of the season and first collegiate win for freshman goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen.
The men finished the weekend on the road against Merrimack College. They got off to another quick start with a goal from Carlsson, but Merrimack College had too much firepower and took control of the game with the final score ending at 5-2.
After the first two weeks of the season the Pioneers hold a 1-4 record with their next game coming on September 18th at Millersville University (2-1) where they will look for their first win on the road.
