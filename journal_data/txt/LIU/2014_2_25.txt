The opening of the new sports bar, The End Zone, on Super Bowl Sunday has received positive reactions from students and faculty. However, The End Zone strictly serves non-alcoholic drinks, which raised a question throughout campus: Why doesn’t LIU Post have an actual wet bar LIIU Post once had a wet bar, “The Rathskeller, that was in the same place as the new sports lounge.
Daniel Cox, the general manager of the campus radio station, WCWP, was a C.W. Post student when the old bar was part of the campus during the 1980s.
“When 3:30 rolled around in the afternoon, I might go over to the bar, ‘The Rat’ as we called it… and I would have a drink,” Cox said.
“…And often times, I wasn’t having that beer with friends. I was having it with my professors, with adults, with people that I respected and admired… It was a much different environment.”
Cox continued to say that also, at the time, the legal drinking age was 18. Cox felt that having a bar on campus, as well as the lower drinking age during that time, helped the students become more “responsible and mature” drinkers compared to today’s binge drinkers.
“In my opinion, because it was on campus and with people we admire and respected, we learned to drink in a more social manner. The professors would certainly set a tone if you had a beer in the afternoon, before dinner or with dinner… it was a much different environment.”
He also playfully explained that because the bar was on campus where the students live, students didn’t run the risk of drinking and driving. “Did I overdo it a few times when I was in my twenties? Absolutely…But, I [was] safe because I didn’t go home. I crashed on campus.”
Cox explained that the bar was also an excellent meeting place, which hosted many different kinds of events. “These were the days of the jukebox… You’d go over and play music on the jukebox… The stage was there, so occasionally you’d have an open mic night of a comedian or you’d occasionally have live performances of a local or smaller band in there,” Cox said. “It was a social meeting place; it’d be packed… They’d also schedule some kind of event on the weekends, so it always kept us here,” he added.
“I feel like what they are doing now, [with The End Zone], is a good move. The highlight [of the old bar] for us was the jukebox and the pinball machines. There were no videogames or Internet, or downloading music. But what they’re doing now with the screens is very up to date, and they show what people want, such as sports.” Cox also stated that he hopes the radio station could eventually get involved with providing entertainment on the stage in there, such as “DJ nights.”
The Rat eventually closed once the legal age was raised to 21. “In the mid ‘80s, when I left here and came back in ‘87 to teach, it happened between then,” Cox stated. “But I know [what] the policy was, at that time: we were a dry campus. [The campus] was going with the law; they didn’t want any alcohol on campus [any longer],” Cox said.
When asked about the campus’ dry bar, Dr. Abby Van Vlerah, dean of students said, “We want to make every effort to ensure all of our students feel welcome, safe, and comfortable in our spaces, including The End Zone.”
As for plans of re-opening an alcoholic bar in the future: “We are always willing to listen to student input and value the opinions of all students. At this time, opening a bar on campus, which serves alcohol is not being discussed,” Van Vlerah said.
It’s hard to tell if LIU Post would ever serve alcohol on campus again. However, The End Zone serves as a reminder to what was, and what could be in the future.
“That’s how it was, you can’t go back,” Cox said. “But, I think what the university is doing with the Pioneer room is a great step forward.”

The student club Do Something! will organize a “Feminist Bake Sale” in Hillwood Commons during common hour on March 3. Men will be charged $1 and women 75 cents to represent the wage gap in America. All proceeds will be donated to the Suffolk County Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

“The reason for the bake sale is to shed light on the problems that women still face today,” said Nicole Balnis, a sophomore Social Work major, and president of Do Something! “Women are still not paid or held in the same regard as men,” Balnis added.
Do Something! is the largest non-profit organization for youths and social change in the U.S., with 2.5 million members, according to its website. They strive for young people to make social change by starting different campaigns that their members subsequently can take to their own communities, without needing money or help from adults. The organization’s social interests are wide; addressing the issues of bullying, animal cruelty, homelessness, discrimination and more via their website.
The LIU Post chapter of Do Something! was established on campus during the 2013 spring semester. The club currently has 20 members, and the “Feminist Bake Sale” will be their first event.
“So far we have been given a lot of encouragement from [the office of] Student Life and Leadership Development. They think it is a good idea, and are excited to see it unfold,” said Balnis.
When Mathilde Bringsjord Laderud, a senior International Relations major, heard about the upcoming event, she thought it sounded like a good initiative. She experienced discrimination when she interned for a well-known international organization last semester.
“I started to receive unprofessional suggestions from male bosses – something I probably would never have had to put up with if I were a guy. At the same time, my female boss started to discourage me, and suddenly she told me they didn’t need me to work for them anymore,” Laderud said. “You’re in a vulnerable position as a young woman with ambitions because you want to make the most out of the opportunities you get and please your employers. But how do you do that when you end up in my situation?” she added.
Anthony Melo, a sophomore Electronic Media major, and a member of Do Something!, has noticed that some people are wary of the word “feminism.” “They treat it as a dirty word, which is sad considering the actual meaning of it,” Melo said.
He thinks that an accurate definition is given in Beyoncé’s song, “***Flawless,” in which Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TedxEuston speech was sampled. Adichie states: “Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.”
“It’s important to spread the information, and have people learn about it,” he said.
Do Something! hopes that the “Feminist Bake Sale” will be welcomed and supported by LIU Post students. “Like feminism, it’s not just for women – it’s for everyone who wants gender equality,” he added.
“If it is successful, we would love to do something like it again,” Balnis said.

On Wednesday, Feb. 19, Dr. Joan Digby, a professor of English and the director of the Honors Program, organized Poetry Appreciation Day at the Steinberg Museum of Art. Students, faculty, and staff were welcomed to read their favorite poems, including poems of their own composition. Poetry Appreciation Day has been a tradition at LIU Post for over 20 years. It is an event that typically brings a gathering of 50 to 60 people, and sometimes even more. This year, the turnout was substantially lower, possibly due to the winter weather. However, this created an intimate and comfortable atmosphere.
Digby began the event with a tribute to Pete Seeger, an American folk singer and activist who died this year. The entire room was silent as Digby spoke through tears to convey the impact that Seeger had on the world, and more specifically, poetry. “I think that folk songs and ballads are among the most sincere poetry written – not just in this country, but in every folk tradition around the world,” Digby said.
Digby’s admiration for Seeger started nearly 50 years ago in 1965 when she first saw Seeger perform at Carnegie Hall. From that point on, Seeger’s influence governed the trajectory of Digby’s education. The spirit of Seeger was alive in the room as footage of his live performances was shown, and the attendees participated in a sing-along of one of Seeger’s most beloved songs, “If I Had a Hammer.” As the tribute continued, it became evident that Seeger had left an unprecedented impact on music that Digby claimed introduced “amazing musicians to the power of folk roots in poetry.”
After the Seeger tribute, Daniel Harris, an adjunct professor in the English Department, was the first to share his poetry. He read three original poems entitled, “Nihilist Pop Lyrics,” “Ode to Mallomars in Form of Word Problem,” and “Animal Planet.” Harris grappled with social and philosophical ideals in the poetry that he presented. In “Nihilist Pop Lyrics,” he used popular songs from artists such as Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepson and coupled them with the philosophy that life is meaningless, despite not being a nihilist himself.
“I think poetry is as important as you want it to be. I think developing an appreciation for poetry can help you to express things that you would have not otherwise expressed,” Harris said.
The only student to share poetry was Richard Renelique, a sophomore Broadcasting major. He shared his poem entitled, “Paved,” and another original poem that remains untitled. “The poem ‘Paved’ was influenced by my future, my decisions, and my career. Thinking about our generation as a whole inspired the poem that is untitled. I was thinking about what we are all meant to do, and our purpose,” Renelique revealed.
One of Renelique’s primary reasons for attending the event is his undeniable passion for poetry. “There is something that compels me to write, but for me, it can’t be in the form of a story or an essay; it has to be in the form of a poem,” Renelique stated.
The next reader was Dennis Pahl, a Professor of English. Pahl read his original short story titled, “Foot in the Door.” The story is an exploration and satire of a popular cliché. “I imagined what would happen if you took the phrase, ‘foot in the door,’ not only metaphorically, but literally, and not getting farther than that,” said Pahl. “Though my stories are not written in poetic lines, I try to make sure that they contain a certain musicality in the rhythm of the story.”
After being personally invited by Digby, Joan Harrison, a professor of Art, decided to read an original poem entitled, “Contentment.”
“I wrote the poem several winters ago – or rather it wrote itself one cold grey afternoon when I was envying my contented cat,” Harrison explained. She expressed her fondness of the poetry events, as they give the opportunity for students and professors to share their work.
Despite not initially planning to share a poem, James Bednarz, a professor of English, was overtaken by the spirit of the occasion and read two Wallace Stevens poems entitled, “The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm,” and “The Idea Of Order At Key West.” Bednarz did not stand at the podium as the other readers did, but rather engaged the audience, and projected his voice to fill the room as he read Stevens’ poems. “Dr. Bednarz’s readings of the Wallace Stevens poems were quite amazing in their intensity, and will inspire me to look at Stevens’ work again,” Harrison stated.
“There are just so many ways that the spoken word forms itself as poetry. Pete Seeger’s social vision and Stevens’ psychological depth – that’s the kind of range that you would have in poetry itself. Poetry that can change the external world and poetry that can change the internal world and make us more conscious of who we are,” Bednarz said of the event.
The next poetry event will be held on March 25 at the Steinberg Museum of Art during common hour. Kristine Doll, a professor at Salem State University, and Dorene Evans, a nature poet, will be sharing their work.
In addition, at the Honors conference on April 4, Ifeanyi Menkiti, a Nigerian poet and professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College, will be reading his poetry. At the Honors conference, Pahl will also share his original short story entitled, “Evening Class,” and there will be a viewing of student filmmaker Greg Cioffi’s film adaption of Pahl’s “Evening Class.”
“People everywhere wake up and find that they are in chains and they are always looking for ways to rid those chains to find freedom again,” said Digby. “Poetry has been used to convey the human plight and it transfers easily from one culture to another.”

“The Woman in Black” tells the story of Arthur Kipps as he recalls his encounter with a malevolent spirit who haunts a secluded village along the English coast. Kips, a solicitor, had gone to settle the affairs of Mrs. Drablow, a recently deceased townswoman, when the figure of a gaunt young woman dressed in black appeared. When seen, there are consequences. Kipps tells his story to an actor, who convinces him to write down his experience. As they proceed to act out his past, Kipps begins to relive his nightmare. Adapted by Stephen Mallatratt from Susan Hill’s novel,
“The Woman in Black” is presented by PW Productions LTD., at the Fortune Theatre in Covent Garden, London. Robin Herford directed the play. I saw “The Woman in Black” on Jan. 31. My ticket was 35 pounds (roughly $58), placing me in the second row from the stage. Being so close, I felt as if I were part of the story, following Kipps relive the horrors of his past.
With a minimal set, props served for multiple purposes. A chest became a desk, a train seat and a bed. The pale grey curtains draped over furniture gave the stage an eerie glow under gloomy lights. Transparent fabric divided the stage in two; upstage houses the furniture belonging to Drablow, while downstage was the center of the house and other locations. The lights casted a dim glow onto the stage, which created a spectral ambiance. The costumes were from the early 20th century. The men wore suits of that time, while the woman in black wore an all-black mourning outfit.
A black veil concealed the woman’s face, but it then was removed to reveal her unsettling features. A paramount factor
of the production was the sound effects. They garnish the play’s haunting atmosphere. The sounds of a horrific horse and carriage accident blasted through the speakers, depicting the cause of the woman’s son’s death. Later on, the blood-curdling scream of the woman’s grief howled through the theatre, as the audience heard a mourning mother’s soul shattering.
Another crucial part of the show was the acting. The actors were very believable, and truly brought the characters and their stories to life. Every movement and every inflection was calculated and precise. Each step served a purpose, and each character had a distinguished walk and talk. Kipps, played by Stuart Fox, was
a quiet and reserved man. His voice was timid and his actions were hesitant. But Fox portrayed other characters in the play, seamlessly changing his voice, mannerisms, and costumes. The changes between the various parts were done incredibly well. Fox never stumbled, and he clearly distinguished his characters from one another.
The character of the Actor, played by Gwynfor Jones, was quite the opposite. He was energetic and exuded confidence. When playing Kipps as a young man, he completely transformed and discarded his grand hand gestures and sunny personality. He became the reserved Kipps, full of curiosity and determination, as someone ready to take on a new job. His confidence disintegrated once the woman in black maked an appearance. He became as frightened as Kipps was, cowering at the sight of this ghastly
figure. Fox and Jones worked very well together. They had wonderful chemistry, working off of each other’s energies. In addition, the actress who portrayed the title character was terrifying, and had such a powerful stage presence. She was menacing in her facial expressions and glared at her fellow actors in utter rage. She entered the stage in a very casual manner. Interestingly, the actress and the title character were not actually listed in the program, nor were they seen anywhere on the cast list, giving the illusion of a real ghost in the performance.
With these characters brought to the stage, the actions that followed caused a wonderful response from the audience. Each moment of suspense elicited a gasp, and every appearance of the ghostly woman made the audience shriek with fear and excitement. They gripped tightly the edges of their seats as Kipps moved through her haunting grounds. The show seemed to rely on the audiences’ reactions, playing off their fear. When the Actor as young Kipps goes to open a door, you expect the woman to be standing there. The anticipation, the excitement, the nervousness builds up tremendously, and the audience holds their breath, preparing themselves to see her. When it is a mere trick, the audience exhales with a sigh of enormous relief. Just as the worry subsides, she enters the stage for the briefest of moments. The element of suspense was consistently in the theatre’s atmosphere, and the story controlled it.
The Fortune Theatre is the perfect venue for this show. The story translated so well onto the stage. The stage is small but deep, allowing dimension to show different locations separated by the see-through fabric. The intimate space created by the auditorium and the stage space is very important to the show. There is an interactive feeling, with the actors entering stage through the audience. The audience was included in the show since the actors entered the stage through the audience. Also, since the woman’s surprise entrances are abrupt, they are more effective on a smaller stage, and the audience is right up against downstage. If it was done in a larger venue, the intimacy would disappear and it wouldn’t be as frightening. The audience could watch the story from afar and not feel involved. In the Fortune, audience members are right in the action.
In terms of actions or scenes, there weren’t any particular scenes that struck me; every moment struck me. Tension remained constant, so I was always on my toes. Overall, the show was excellent. It was frightening and exhilarating.

On Wednesday, Feb. 19, the Lady Pioneers (19-5) squared off against the Mercy College Mavericks (2-22) from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. It was a rout for the Pioneers, as they controlled most of the game and ended up winning by a score of 88-62.

The Pioneers jumped out to a quick lead when senior guard Kiki Sears started the scoring 10 seconds into the game with a layup. The Pioneers took those points and never looked back, as they never relinquished the lead in the first half. The lead reached its peak at 11, when Sears nailed a jumper with just over two minutes in the half. At the break, the Pioneers were up by eight and had a substantial +11 advantage in rebounding. Sears was the high scorer at the half with 12, and senior guard Alexis Peters had five assists.
Looking to extend their lead in the second half, the Pioneers came out strong and went on a 16-6 run, giving them a 52-33 advantage, which sealed the Mavericks fate. For the Pioneers, five players scored in double figures, including Sears, Peters, and sophomore guard Quanisha Ratley. Junior guard Chelsea Williams and senior forward Nijah LaCourt each eclipsed double-digit increments in rebounds and points, also giving them double-doubles. The Mavericks were led by senior guard Maria Nardulli and junior forward Tanayzha Augustine, who each had 15 points.
The Pioneers’ bench outscored the Maverick bench as a team; the Pioneers dominated the paint, leading the Mavericks 42-29 down low. The second half proved to be where the Pioneers took control as they improved their field goal percentage and were also able to shoot a higher percentage from down town.
On Saturday, Feb. 22, the Pioneers squared off against the Spartans of Saints Thomas Aquinas College (11-12) on Senior Day at the Pratt Recreational Center. LIU came out with the win. That victory made it seven in a row, and 14 of their last 15.
The Pioneers jumped out early and grabbed a seven point lead, thanks to a 9-2 run. The Pioneers dominated the first half as they held their opponents to 30 percent shooting from the field. Their terrific defense led to 11 points off of turnovers and to their 39-26 lead going into the break. For the Pioneers, junior guard Chelsea Williams had nine points, five of them from the charity stripe. The Spartans were led by freshman guard Kristen Olsen, who also had nine at the half.
Already up by 13, senior forward Shayna Gatling converted on a lay-up, giving them their largest lead of the game at 15. The Pioneers never relinquished the lead; in fact, the closest the Spartans came was seven points in the second half. Gatling had 10 points in the half, giving her 16 for the game, and she also grabbed 11 boards, giving her a double-double. Williams finished with 15 points and had six rebounds, while Peters scored 11 points, dished out six assists, and had two blocks. The Pioneer defense was suffocating as they had four blocked shots and eight steals. The Spartans had three players in double figures, led by Olsen and senior guard Briana Cook, but it was not enough. The Pioneers came out victorious by a score of 71-58.
As a team, the Pioneers pushed the tempo, outscoring the Spartans in fast break points as well as second chance baskets. This game was the seventh of the season in which the Pioneers held their opponents to under 60 points, and they also held the lead in this game for all but 40 seconds, showing their dominance from the opening tip.
Coach Moore and the Pioneers have their final two regular season matchups this week when they face the Molloy College Lions at home on Wednesday, Feb. 26, and the Queens College Knights on Saturday, March 1, on the road.

Having undergone a hapless week, which included two narrow losses within four days of each other, the men’s basketball team completed their three-game road-trip with a win against Mercy College, in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., on Feb. 19. Although the team’s mindset was expectedly shaken after their loss to both the University of Bridgeport and Dowling College, the Pioneers finished on a high as they defeated the Mercy Mavericks 93-67.
During the first half, senior forward Vaughn Allen, and sophomore guard Chris Orozco, stole the show. Allen netted six
of the first 11 points alone, and Orozco performed a pair of free throws in the final seconds of the period, securing the Pioneers with a comfortable lead of 42-20 as they entered the intermission.
During the second period, the men rapidly increased their advantage to more than 30 points. Only five-and-a-half minutes into the second half, a three-ball performed by sophomore guard Dillon Burns made it a 58-27 contest. By the halfway mark of the period, Post created an additional 37-point lead, forming a score of 70-33. Allen, who was 8-of-11 from the field-goal range, amassed seven rebounds and four assists, in addition to his 21-point showing. Junior guard P.J. Torres scored 16 points in 23 minutes off the bench, and junior forward Tyuan Williams collected 15 points and five boards. Additionally, junior guard Isiah Stokley grabbed seven rebounds and scored 11 points alongside Burns, who also contributed to the team’s success with 11 points, five assists and four steals.
“ I think the team really gave a strong effort against Mercy. After losing two tough games, it would have been easy for us to come out with no energy, but we did not; we played even harder,” Burns said.
“I think that our mindset was very positive and [we] looked at this game as if it were a playoff game, which is coming up in two weeks.” he added. Burns then discussed the matchup on Saturday Feb. 22, where the men faced St. Thomas Aquinas on Pioneer turf. “To get ready for Saturday we are preparing as usual by working hard in practice and going over the other team’s personnel.
The most important thing is that we are mentally ready to play and go into Saturday with a killer instinct. For us, it is all about playing together and playing harder than the opponent we face.” When Saturday came around, the men undoubtedly delivered as they triumphed over St. Thomas Aquinas, and finished with a final score of 64- 57.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers prepare to take on Molloy College on Saturday Feb. 26 at the Pratt Recreation Center. The men will be celebrating their Senior Night by recognizing the achievements of the team’s lone senior Vaughn Allen. Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m.

With enduring support from their two coaches as they push the dance team to reach perfection in every choreography they take on, the 10 dancers of the LIU Post team share a common goal: next year’s College Nationals in Disney World, F.L.
The team usually occupies the Pratt’s multi-purposes room to improve their moves four days a week, plus an additional six hours every weekend. The team strives for perfection when putting their choreography together. Although, dancing together as “one” requires more than just sharpening the actual dancing techniques, the team also runs and engages in cardio exercises, which are important parts of the weekly program.
“We” run a timed mile before every practice, where your running time must beat previous running times,” said Ashley Ioveno, junior team member and Journalism major.
Ioveno also credited Head Coach Cristopher Klein, along with Assistant Coach Angela Stanilewicz, for always being supportive of their members. “The coaches are loved because they push you, yet they never give up on you,” she said, referring to the coaches as the core element for having influenced a great attitude and mentality in the group.
The genre and choreography chosen depends heavily on the competition, but there are some dominant styles. “We learn choreography for the upcoming events, but I believe most of our routines are jazz, hip-hop, lyrical, or pom, which are typical styles for college dance teams like us,” Ioveno explained.
Trying out for the LIU Post dance team is an opportunity open for every student. However, unlike the majority of other sports on campus, being part of the team does not provide any athletic scholarship. Instead, the members of the dance team voluntarily become ambassadors for the University, and participate in an array of events, according to the LIU Post Pioneer website.
The team typically performs at every home game for both men’s and women’s basketball, in addition to the cheerleaders for the football team during fall season. They also often show up on stage for school or organizational events all around on campus, such as the Pep Rally and Homecoming.
However, the team also participates outside of campus, as they perform on local tri-state competitions in order to reach their goal to make it all the way to the College Nationals. Next up for the green and gold will be the New England Dance Championships in Westfield, Massachusetts on March 2.
Both coaches and members of the team constantly try to raise awareness of the program. They encourage students to audition,which is the requirement needed in order to be considered a name on the roster. The official time for auditions will be held on April 27, time and place to be announced.

The LIU Post women’s softball team has returned and is ready to rumble this semester. The 19 team members, as well as Head Coach Jamie Apicella and Assistant Coach Carla Campagna, aim to build on the success of the 2012-2013 season; achievements which includes a first place ranking in the NCAA Regional and a 47-15 overall record, with an inclusive 25-3 record in the East Coast Conference.
Although the team consists of less than 20 members, the women embody the quotation “Quality not quantity.” Consequently, the 2013- 2014 season already looks promising for the Pioneers. According to Campagna, not only is the team currently sitting in 11th place in the NFCA national poll released on Jan. 29, but the women have also topped the preseason voting in the conference. Seniors Liz Weber and Nicole Hagenah have also received preseason awards. Weber for the “Preseason Pitcher of the Year,” and Hagenah for the “Co-Player of the Year” for the 2014 season. In addition to the team itself, the season appears hopeful for Apicella. He is only nine wins away from hitting 600 career wins in his 16-year tenure.
In order to achieve their goals for the season, the Pioneers commenced their preseason training in January. “The goals for this year are like every year; to win the Conference Championship, to enter the NCAA’s for the 15th consecutive year, and to have the opportunity to play for the National Championship title,” he said. “The 2014 team has been working extremely hard to finish what they started last year. The focus and motivation is shown on a daily basis, and we can’t wait for the season to begin. We are returning all players from last season, and have added four impact freshmen to the team.”
Hagenah, who is a senior Criminal Justice Major from Commack, N.Y., shared the same excitement. “The team is looking good. We are raring to go and can’t wait for our first game.”
The Pioneers will continue their hard work over spring break, as they plan to spend the week in Florida before playing their first game at home on March 18, at 1:30 p.m., against Southern Connecticut State University.

On Feb. 16, the LIU Post Equestrian Team lost one of its talented members — George, a grade horse who has been part of the team long enough to watch many of its former and current riders trot off into adulthood.
A school horse at the North Shore Equestrian Center, George was one of the horses chosen to teach the new riders on the equestrian team how to ride. His patience and tolerance towards the fumbling, apprehensive new riders in his saddle created ideal and impeccable learning experiences, allowing the new riders to return to him one day with the skills they needed to compete in horse shows and competitions across Long Island. While most of George’s history is unknown, the barn locals knew he loved spending time in the company of the ponies and squealed cutely when one touched his stomach.
Members of the equestrian team proudly shared their memories of their beloved teammate.
“George was an old soul with a spark of life in him. He aimed to please and his gentle manner made even the most inexperienced rider feel like a superstar. He was deeply loved by all and his memory will live in the hearts of the team,” said Christina Cepeda, a sophmore Psychology major. “He has been with us for so long, it’s hard to believe that he will no longer be one of the few “greeters” at the door when you walk in the barn. He was so sweet and so compassionate, and he just loved to go, go, go,” said Kathryn Brust, a sophmore Management major.
“George was one of the most kind-hearted and loving animals I’ve ever met. He was always so eager to get in the ring and make sure you enjoyed your lesson,” said Christina Kotarski, a sophomore Adolescent English-Education major. “George was truly the ‘one of a kind’ horse who will be forever missed and loved,” Kotarski added.
“He was my first horse, and I was really attached to him. He loved Altoids,” said Wolfgang Kovac, a freshman Science major.
“He was the second horse I ever rode. He was one of the most lovable horses ever,” stated Justin Rankin, a sophmore Psychology major. The riding instructors for the team also felt the loss. “He was a treasure, and our program will be incomplete without him. He was loved by many people and will be missed by many more,” said Jennifer Hennick, one of the instructors for the equestrian team. Linda Crouse, another instructor for the team, also shared her feelings about George, stating that he was “helpful and trustworthy” and “deserves a big plaque.”In dedication, the team will place flowers on his stall and give carrots to the rest of the horses at the barn as soon as possible.
The LIU Post Equestrian Team is a co-educational sport, which is directed by the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA). Through IHSA, students and riders are able to complete in a fair playing field against riders of various skills and financial statuses. As stated on the LIU website, “The LIU Post Equestrian Team competes in IHSA – Zone 2 Region 4 against neighboring schools from Long Island and New York City.” Last semester, the LIU Post Equestrian Team ranked highest on Long Island through IHSA. The team is open to accepting undergraduate or graduate students and welcomes all levels of riders – from experienced to beginner.
All riders are placed into lesson groups and given horses based on their ability level, and hourly lessons are given once a week throughout each semester. The dues, which cover the IHSA membership, USEF insurance and weekly lessons, cost $300 for new members and $250 for returning. Lessons take place on campus at the North Shore Equestrian Center (NSEC), which features a large indoor arena and two outdoor rings, as well as a small café and lounge for viewing lessons.

The stars of the Comedy Central show, “Broad City,” spoke to The Pioneer in an interview conference call with several colleges on Feb. 20. Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson created, write, and act in the TV series. The comediennes spoke of their history, the New York comedy scene, and the series itself, which airs Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central.
“Broad City” is a scripted situational comedy. The series focuses on a pair of friends that are very different from each other; Glazer living life in the moment, and Jacobson trying to get more out of life, feeling stuck and insecure where she is. Like “The Odd Couple,” the show features a goofy duo-dynamic of its characters, but instead of two divorced men, Glazer and Jacobsen portray post-college women struggling with adulthood. The comedy is built upon the awkward situations both characters find themselves in, which are elaborated on and fleshed out in the writing room of the show.
Each episode tells a new story in the daily lives of Glazer and Jacobson, playing fictionalized versions of themselves as struggling women in their 20s, living in New York City. “The stories are all based on [things] that have happened to us, friends, or coworkers,” said Glazer. Jacobson was quick to point out that much of the show is exaggerated, but with a sense of “heightened realism.”
“Broad City” is based on a web-series that Glazer and Jacobson co-created. This transition from the Internet to the small screen was a noted learning experience. “We love the transition,” said Jacobson. “It’s crazy going from a two to four minute story, to a 20 minute situation. We had to have more focus on the story – on the day in the life. It was a big learning experience.”
The AV Club and Rolling Stone have compared the show to HBO’s “Girls,” another story of young women trying to situate their professional and social lives, making the transition into adulthood. “We’re straight up honored to be compared to such successful and established shows. It’s an honor to be in the same sentence as ‘Girls’,” said an elated Glazer.
Glazer noted that “Broad City” is part of a surge in television gender equality amongst shows such as “Girls” and “2 Broke Girls,” that focus on female leads. “We’ve been added to the new wave of feminism, and I’m glad we’re there,” said Glazer. “The world is super ready for equal representation for everyone. We’ve been received well. Where we [come] from, it has never felt like men versus women,” Glazer added.
“We hope to get a second season,” said Jacobson, in regards to their future. “In the meantime, we do have other projects: solo and other. But regardless, we want to continue [performing] together even if the show doesn’t get renewed.”
“Broad City” is a wonderful new addition to the Comedy Central line-up, with its strength found in the relatable and refreshing chemistry of two long-time friends. The humor of the show is instantly apparent, and the strong partnership of Jacobson and Glazer is apparent. The two stars have been involved in the comedy community for eight years: taking classes, doing improv, writing sketches, and working together with the prestigious Upright Citizens Brigade, an improvisation and sketch comedy group. “The New York comedy community and Upright Citizens Brigade totally shaped our ability and network, especially the web series,” said Glazer. “We’re not afraid to try new stuff, and they’re all so very supportive.”
The show is currently halfway through the first season. “Broad City” has a style, seemingly an off-kilter, filthy, and crazy “Odd Couple” set the post-college world that is very sincere.

The search for summer internships has begun. A summer internship can be the gateway to an entry-level position, but unfortunately, they are not always easy to obtain. Summer internships can be either paid or for college-credit. To get college credit, students must have permission from their school, and complete a certain amount of hours interning in order to receive credits. Applying to programs early is your best bet. At this point, there will be fewer applicants, and many companies begin interviewing for positions months in advance. With deadlines for summer internships arriving, students need to act now.
One option is to apply online. Students should think of places they would like to intern at and start there. Companies usually advertise their own internship programs and career opportunities directly on
their websites. Online sites such as internmatch.com, internships.com, collegerecruiter.com, ed2010.com, and linkedin.com constantly post internship opportunities — both paid and for academic credit, for college students of all majors.
The sites are simple to navigate and allow students to send their resume directly to the company. Certain sites are even geared towards particular career fields. “I personally use internmatch.com to search for internships at companies I would want to work for,” said Thomas Durso, a freshman Accounting major. “My profile on linkedin.com is helpful as well. I can look up companies and people, and many jobs are posted directly on the site, so it’s no work to apply.”
It is important to make sure to customize every single resume and cover letter to the specific job opportunity in order to stand a chance of landing a good internship. If truly interested in the position, students can follow up by sending an email to the internship supervisor after submitting their application to reiterate their interest.
LIU Post also has a Career Service Center, located on the second floor of Kumble Hall, where counselors can help students prepare their resumes, advise them on how to search for internships, and even put students in touch with companies and alumni.
Students can make an appointment to see a career counselor by calling 516-299-2251. “The career center helped me to get my summer internship [at a computer startup company] last year,” said Joseph Marra, a senior Computer Science major. “The counselor fixed my cover letter for me, and suggested a few places for me to apply to and gave me contacts for each.”
Students can also make an account on JobNet, which is a site where LIU Post’s career center counselors frequently post job and internship opportunities for students of all majors, and also connects them with employers. The site also posts on-campus recruitment events, career fairs, and networking events. On-campus recruitment for accounting positions takes place during the fall semester, while on- campus recruitment for education positions takes place during the spring semester. On-campus recruitment for all other areas is scheduled as requested by employers. Students can look on JobNet for the schedule of events.
A summer internship gives you the opportunity to learn aspects about an industry where you may want to work. “Every internship I’ve had so far has opened many doors for me, and has given me the opportunity to meet so many amazing people,” said Jacklyn Stringham, a junior Public Relations major. “It’s a way to get experience while meeting people who might be able to help you in the future.”
Many companies rehire their own summer interns. Having an internship on your resume is a career builder — it may lead to bigger positions. Although you might spend your summer stapling stacks of paper and running for coffee, the experience on your resume is extremely valuable and worth it.

LIU Post hosted its annual Wellness Day in Hillwood Commons on Feb. 11. This year’s theme was “Mindful Wellness” – overall health in more than one aspect. Wellness Day is sponsored by Medical Services here at LIU Post. The goal of Wellness Day is to promote complete, holistic health.

St. Francis Hospital sponsored a Community Outreach van for cardiovascular screenings. The van offered services such as taking brief cardiac histories, blood pressure, and blood tests for cholesterol and diabetes. These tests, although quick and virtually painless, can provide valuable information to any patients, who would otherwise be unaware of their potential problems. The Outreach van travels across New York, providing these services to students as well as adults, free of charge. The van travels to multiple locations, including the YMCA, senior centers, and public libraries.
Wellness Day also featured a nutrition wellness station and an informational about hearing and noise, sun safety, and the dangers of texting while driving. The nutrition station, run by the Department of Human Resources and Living Well with LIU, gave advice on healthy diets and foods that you should avoid. The hearing and noise station allowed students to check their hearing and provided information about what loud music could do to their ears over time. The sun safety table showed students how to properly protect your skin from the elements.
The “texting while driving” table showed students the effects of texting and driving, statistics of accidents, as well as advice on preventing the problem, which has become a significant issue in the U.S.
At another event, reiki, healing massages, paraffin hand treatments, and guided imagery were administered by the Department of Counseling and Development. Reiki is a Japanese technique for relaxation and healing. It is performed with the laying on hands to cleanse “life force energy”— the element that promotes health and well-being. Guided imagery is a technique of relaxation that uses visual imagery by picturing a day at the beach. These events were sponsored by all different organizations, both from LIU Post and other institutions, ranging from the Pratt Recreation Center to Jason Cascone, a reiki master and director of career development at Post.
Students who visited seven out of 11 tables were automatically entered into raffles and giveaways for Wellness Day. “We want students and staff alike to become more aware and mindful of their health, in general,” said Sarah Boles, a counselor at LIU Post.
“I think it is a very good thing to inform students and staff about taking better care of themselves. Having a Wellness Day at school gives students an opportunity to become more aware of their health,” said Stephanie Rubenfeld, a junior Psychology major.
The term “health,” however, does not just mean physical health — it also includes mental, nutritional, and spiritual. Mindful Wellness means being healthy in all aspects of health, and leading a generally healthy lifestyle. Many times, students do not get the chance to stop and take care of themselves due to pressures of everyday life, whether it is school, jobs, or relationships.

Eric Krasnoff was elected the new chairman of LIU’s Board of Trustees, the governing body that is responsible for upholding the educational mission and fiscal policies of the university, on Jan. 28. Krasnoff, a retired chairman, president, and CEO of Pall Corporation, is excited about LIU’s future. “I think Long Island University has a great tradition and has a great future,” he said.
About his new position, Krasnoff said, “The chairman is responsible for setting the agenda and making sure all of it is complying with all the laws. I want to make sure that any significant issues are looked at.” The Board of Trustees is composed of up to 45 elected trustees, each of whom brings their own unique set of skills to the university.
Krasnoff was born in 1952, grew up in Glen Cove on Long Island, and currently resides in Oyster Bay Cove. “I have always lived on the North Shore; I have an understanding of LIU Post and what it means to the community,” he said.
Krasnoff graduated from Columbia University in 1974
with a degree in Anthropology. After taking a year off, he joined
Pall Corporation, a Long Island-based global supplier of filtration, separations, and purification products. He served in several Pall management positions, including group vice president and executive vice president, before being elected president and chief operating officer
in 1993. Krasnoff was also the director of the company, and chairman of the Board from 1994 until his retirement from the company in March 2011.
Krasnoff is aware of the Board of Trustees’ significant role at LIU — he has been on the Board since 1992. “The Board of Trustees is for LIU overall and overlooks all campuses. We are the final governing body that approves budget and policy,” he said.
“The most important thing the Board really does is what we did last year, and that was hire the new president of the university,” said Krasnoff.
“I know I speak for the entire LIU community when I say we are honored and grateful to have Eric as our new chair. The Krasnoff family has been an integral part of the university’s leadership for more than 30 years, and his depth of understanding is invaluable. I personally look forward to working with Eric as we foster a world-class educational experience for our students,” said Kimberly R. Cline, LIU president.
Krasnoff replaces Edward Travaglianti, who served as a chair of the Board of Trustees from April 2005 to Jan. 2014. Travaglianti praised his successor. “Eric is a tireless champion for LIU, and it has been both a privilege and a pleasure to work with him for more than two decades,” he said. “I have every confidence that he and President Cline will lead the university to even greater levels of excellence.”

Greek life at LIU Post offers students a chance to improve their social skills, receive support for academic excellence, establish lifelong friendships, and help improve their college community through volunteer work. Students who affiliate themselves with sororities and fraternities receive opportunities to network with alumni professionals, and in turn improve their chances of success after graduation. Theta Chi, a national fraternity chapter at Post that was founded in fall 2013, plans to offer their members just that.
Post currently has five fraternities: Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi, Lambda Sigma Upsilon, Lambda Upsilon Lambda, and Phi Iota Alpha. However, Theta Chi wants to try to stand out.
“We’re putting something out there that’s different… People’s ideas of a fraternity are skewed, I think, and they have their stereotypes,” said Anthony Musacchio, president of the LIU Theta Chi fraternity and a junior Accounting major. “Our major goal is to show that fraternities are about gentlemen. I mean, it’s okay to have fun, but it’s really about being on the right track to be successful,” he added.
Theta Chi has 225 installed chapters since first being founded, but currently has 137 active chapters, according to Thetachi.org. “We’ve been around for over 150 years. It started in 1856,” Musacchio said. Theta Chi started recruitment on campus in the fall 2013 semester, and just recently became colonized. Their official colonization ceremony will take place at the Atrium in the Tilles Center on Friday, Feb. 28 at 7 p.m. The ceremony will officially solidify their presence on campus, by moving forward as not just a supported colony, but an official chapter, with both the support of LIU Post and national Theta Chi representatives.
“The next step is a numbers game; getting members and showing the fraternity that we’re not going to fall off the map. They’ve given us the opportunity to wear letters around campus and represent them,” said Musacchio. Transferring from the University of Tampa in 2012, Musacchio was already a member. He started his first semester in spring 2013 with the intent to bring Theta Chi to campus. “I felt such a strong connection of brotherhood and the fraternity was something that made my college experience, so I wanted to recreate it here.”
In an effort to raise awareness for their organization and improve membership, Theta Chi hosted the “DATE-A-CHI” date auction on Feb. 20. The event was held at The End Zone, Post’s new sports bar in Hillwood Commons. From 4:30 p.m. to 5 p.m., roughly 30 girls, most of who were from the Alpha Xi Delta sorority, were allowed to mingle with their potential dates. The nine men being auctioned were all members of Theta Chi, and they offered the girls a chance to get to know them by presenting information posters, all of which included their hobbies, pictures, and their potential date destinations.
Kristin Mendez, Alpha Xi Delta senior member and Criminal Justice major, announced the auction. She introduced the men to the ladies, highlighting their desired qualities. “It went well, I thought. I went for $45 and I’m looking forward to the date. The girl that bought me is very sweet,” Joe Jenkins, a sophomore and Theta Chi member, said. The money went to Theta Chi to help aid their growing chapter.
Breana Martinez, a sophomore Journalism major and Alpha Xi Delta member, spoke highly of the event. “We helped out the auction by bidding on some very handsome guys. All in all, it was an awesome night and some lucky Alpha Xi Delta girls have some very exciting dates coming up,” she said. “We absolutely are getting involved with them again,” she added. “They’re like our brothers. We love them and will do anything to support them.”

On Friday, May 9, LIU Post will celebrate its 56th commencement ceremony at 11:30 a.m., on the Great Lawn.
“We are excited that LIU’s new president, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline, will preside over the ceremony,” said Rita Langdon, the new executive director of Campus Operations, and formerly the associate provost at LIU Post.
Dr. Jackie Nealon, chief of staff and vice president for Enrollment, Campus Life and Communications; and Dr. Jeffrey Kane, vice President for Academic Affairs; Eric Krasnoff, the University’s new chairman of the Board of Trustees; and Theresa Mall Mullarkey, LIU Post Chancellor and Trustee, will participate in the ceremony, according to Langdon.
The graduation ceremony will be held, as in the past, under a huge white tent, “that runs the length of Humanities Hall,” Rita Langdon said. “I cannot wait to celebrate the completion of my Bachelor’s Degree and all the hard work I have put down,” said Vibeke Aarstad, a senior Accounting major.
“More than 10,000 people, from graduates to parents, family and friends, [have attended] commencement [in the past].” Students who graduated either in September, January or May will be participating. At this year’s ceremony, students who have earned bachelors, masters, doctoral degrees, or advanced certificates from LIU’s three campuses on Long Island (Post, Brentwood and Riverhead), will be celebrated.
“The class of 2014 includes more than 2,200 students,” Langdon said. After the main ceremony, the different schools and colleges at
LIU will hold their own individual ceremonies recognizing the students’ achievements. Each student’s name will be called at these smaller ceremonies, which will be held at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall, and other locations. “At these ceremonies, the dean or chairperson of the college/school will recognize individual graduates by name,” Langdon said.
“Commencement is one of the grandest events at our university and a time to reflect on the many achievements and hard work of LIU Post’s students,” Langdon added. A committee of faculty, staff and students oversee the plans.
“The Offices of Conference Services, University President, and Chief of Staff/Vice President of Enrollment, Campus Life and Communications, coordinate the activities.”
The Valedictorian and Salutatorian, who are selected by a committee of faculty and administrators, will be announced in March, according to Langdon. The commencement speaker will be announced in April. The commencement speaker is selected by, “a committee of trustees, faculty and administrators,” she said.
On graduation day at LIU Post, all buildings will be open, according to Bill Kirker, head of Facilities. If the unfortunate situation arises and it starts to rain Kirker said that, “Anyone who cannot fit under the tent will have the option of going into Hillwood to view it on large screens.”
LIU’s Brooklyn, Rockland, Westchester, and LIU Global divisions will have their graduation ceremony at the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn on Thursday, May 15 at 9 a.m., according to Rita Langdon.

Women have been trying to get equal rights under the law for hundreds of years. Even as far back as the 1700s, Abigail Adams, wife of second president John Adams, realized that women legally were at a disadvantage. In one of her most famous quotes, she states, “We [women] will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice, or representation.”
Years later, many other women were willing to stand up and fight for the rights of women, such as Susan B. Anthony and Cady Stanton. Their efforts helped lead to the landmark decision of adding the 19th Amendment to the Bill of Rights, which gave women the right to vote.
But what exactly are women’s rights in 2014? Is it a struggle to be viewed as equal to men? Or has it been an attempt to gain clout in the workplace? Probably a little of both.
“Breaking through the glass ceiling” is a phrase that was coined to describe the hardships and sexism that women had to endure for quite some time. The glass ceiling is a metaphor in which women see the highest level of success in their field, but are unable to reach it. In many cases, women are getting paid less than men. According to data in the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2012, women earned 77 cents to every dollar that men were paid.
However, women in the U.S. have made progress towards equality in present day society. Even today, the U.S. has not had a female president. However, three women have served as Secretary of State (Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton).
Woomen have served in leadership positions in other countries as well, such Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany since 2005. Golda Meir was a politician, who later became the 4th Prime Minister of Israel from 1969-1974.
Women’s rights have only recently been exhibited in the armed forces throughout the world. These rights in the armed forces, especially in combat situations, are controversial, and only recently were women given more job options in the military. In the 1970s, Western armies allowed women to serve active duty in the armed forces. Only some of these Western armies allowed women to fill active combat roles. Places such as Canada, the United States, Germany, and Israel are among some of the few countries to allow this.
Women’s rights is a sensitive subject for both male and females alike throughout the world because some are hesitant to admit that women are still not treated as equals, and many still feel strongly about income equality. While many are on board, there are a few that still suffer from prejudicial thoughts towards women.
Women are no longer expected to stay at home and be house wives (unless they choose to), but instead are readily being inspired to lead careers in jobs that used to be for men, such as doctors, lawyers, and business positions. Women are in schools and universities (and running universities, like Kimberly R. Cline, LIU president), involved in government, and have complete freedom to lead lives equal to, and alongside men. According to today’s standards, the rights of women are an extraordinary improvement to those of the past, and now the world can head in a society where women are more equal to men.

Marijuana has already been made legal in both Colorado and Washington, and as of Feb. 13, 2014, according to ProCon.org, New York is now listed among 13 states with pending legislation to legalize medicinal marijuana. On Dec. 11, 2013, New York state legislators proposed a marijuana legalization bill, for the possession, cultivation, and retail sale of the drug. What do LIU Post students think about the debate?
“I don’t want it to become legal. But I know many people my age, adults included, who have no problem with marijuana being legalized,” said Cara Frank, a junior Electronic Media major. “I would not be shocked to see parents across New York broadcasting negative opinions about it, if the bill were to be passed,” she added.
“I think overall it’s a big step, but a big step worth taking. I mean the possibilities of any negative consequences are slim to none. It would cause very substantial economic growth,” said Jordan Vogelsang, a sophomore Education major.
“The fact that it can be used as a crop for many different uses other than recreational and medical, such as oil, fuel, paper, and even clothes could also be very beneficial,” he added. Vogelsang believes that the benefits outweigh any negative consequences. “It shocks me that it isn’t legal already,” he said.
“I think it would be great if marijuana was legalized because of the taxes the government could collect on it. From a business standpoint, itis a great idea and it clears up the courtrooms a little bit,” said Joe Voce, a senior Electronic Media major.
“Not many consequences other than it being legal for idiots to be idiots,” said Voce. “If the decision to pass marijuana gets declined, I’m pretty sure people will decide to riot, but before they do, they’ll smoke and forget to riot. So nothing will happen,” he added.
Brooke Troiano, a sophomore Criminal Justice major, disagreed that legalizing marijuana in New York would do well. “I don’t think it will end up being legalized in the state of New York because I think we just don’t have a want or a need for it. With so many people crowded into a small area like Long Island, having a recreational drug like that legalized would cause more harm than benefit,” she said.
“I know if it was legalized, it would probably be a split between people who want it and people who oppose it. I think it’s mostly the younger generation who wants it legalized. Parents would oppose it, and I personally don’t think it’s beneficial at all,” Troiano added.
There are a few propositions to legalize marijuana like the Senate Bill proposition, which is now in custody of the Assembly’s hands, according to ProCon.org. According to Huffingtonpost.com, both sides of the argument include the idea that “New York leads the nation in marijuana arrests,” and that, “New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is set to announce an executive order… that allows for 20 hospitals in the state to treat seriously ill patients with cannabis.”

Have you ever thought, “We sit in class for hours a day to learn, why do we have to do more work when we go home?” We have always had homework. From a very young age, teachers have been sending students home with more work to do. And college is no exception.

But is the workload in college really fair? Students don’t all take the same classes. They all have to take core classes, but other than that, it is just major requirements. Students shouldn’t get an intense workload from core classes. Some students want to take their major classes because it is something they care about. However, in most cases, a Criminal Justice major probably wouldn’t want to take an algebra class, and an English major probably wouldn’t want to focus all of his or her time on a science class. In a lot of different cases, core classes take away from the work students want to do and are doing in their major classes.
A Chemistry major might have to go home and read chapters and memorize formulas, while an English major might have to write a few essays, and an Art major will have to do full art projects. Every major has its fair share of work, but it’s work the student might not mind doing.
Is it really fair for an English major to be assigned a five-page essay to write in , or an Art major to construct an entire project, or a Dance major to choreograph a new routine, in a short time? Yes, it is very strenuous, but the important words to remember are “time management.” Students should learn how learn how to plan out their week accordingly. Time management is one of the most important tools for balancing the workload of different classes. “As a photo student, you get a lot of shooting assignments usually from multiple classes, so if you can’t manage your workflow it will become overwhelming. Photography just takes a lot of time,” said Lindsey Bauer, a Photography major.
All majors are different, and the workload is different. Some people have classes five days a week, others just two days. It is almost impossible to judge which students have the heaviest workload. Some students can handle multiple assignments due in a week, while others could only handle one assignment per week.
Thankfully, other than core classes, students can enjoy the homework in their majors. After a certain time, most of the homework has to deal with a topic that the students finds interesting or important. When students find something that they enjoy doing, they probably won’t mind reading a few chapters, or writing a longer essay, because they are learning about a topic that they are interested in.

Have you ever wondered what might be in your food? Are you one of those people who will eat anything without thinking about it? A May 2013 article in The Guardian listed 10 ingredients most people didn’t know could be hidden in their food. According to the list, traces of arsenic have turned up in foods, such as rice to cereal; and human hair has been found in L-Cysteine, which is a preservative found in foods, such as breads.

 
The article also lists antifreeze, beaver anal glands, fish bladder, coal tar, silicone breast implant filler, boiled beetle shells, rodent hair and Borax, which is used in fire-retardant compounds.
LIU Post students were asked about their experience with foods and nasty hidden surprises.
“Sometimes, everything is processed. You never really know,” said Abigail Brosnan, a sophomore Broadcast major. “I do [care], because I would be much more comfortable knowing what’s in my food, but it’s better not to know sometimes.”
Rebecca Rosenberg, a junior Early Education major, thinks that it is important to know what is in your food. “No, I don’t know what’s in my food. However, I do know that it IS food,” she said.
She also takes to heart what is in her food, and what other “ingredients” may be included. “I care what’s in my food because I would like to know what I’m digesting. “[I] also [want] to make sure that what I am eating is healthy. I like to eat healthy a lot of the time, so not knowing what’s in my food is probably not good for me,” she said .
“I get so grossed out. If I see something that isn’t supposed to be there like a Band-Aid, I will probably never eat there again.” Her Band-Aid story is not for the squeamish. “One day my friend and I went to ‘Sissler’, and he found a Band-Aid in his soup. After we saw it we immediately got up and left. Before that, though, we told the manager that we were not going to pay for the soup. It also turns out that after that incident, the place went out of business,” Rosenberg said.
“I don’t know fully what’s in my food, but I’m content that it’s listed somewhere. I really don’t care what’s in my food as long as it’s edible,” said Peter Sacoulis, freshman Information Systems major.
“If something fell in the food that’s not supposed to be there, then I start to care,” Sacoulis added.
Sacoulis shared his own personal experience as well. “I experienced eating something that felt like a rock in what I got at a hot dog stand. I threw it out and swore off eating food from any kind of stands.”
Sometimes you can’t avoid having some sort of stomach-turning item ending up on your plate. However, you could probably lessen your chances of biting into something unexpected by cutting out fast foods, eating naturally and considering organic foods. Foods with the “USDA Organic” and “Certified Organic” seal must contain 95 percent certified organic ingredients, according to LifeHacker.com. Certified organic ingredients are free of synthetic additives, such as pesticides, chemical fertilizers and dyes.
