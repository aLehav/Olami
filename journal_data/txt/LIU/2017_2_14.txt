The Digital Commons, as the Pioneer reported in a story by Nicole Curcio on Feb. 1, is a new repository introduced by the LIU libraries in fall 2016 to share and save works by students and faculty. Although it was created as a way to highlight student scholarship, many students have mixed feelings about the new repository.
Students in the broadcasting program often create videos for their senior projects, and sometimes include art, music or other minor content from third parties. Yet, the Digital Commons requires these students to have all copyright paperwork before publication. If these videos are uploaded without copyright paperwork, the students could run into legal issues.
Jean Carlomusto, professor of broadcasting in the department of communications & film, said, “When you have a project, a documentary, you often times are commenting on copyrighted material. So, you may have a situation where you don’t have the copyright, but you are making a fair use argument.” In order to make a fair use argument when using copyright, you must know the four different criteria that define fair use. “I don’t think any of our students want to go to court,” Carlomusto said.
Brittany Mitchell, a senior broadcasting major in the honors college, believes it’s hard for students to qualify for the Digital Commons because of legal issues. “There are some issues with regard to copyright laws that would make it very difficult for many students to participate in the Digital Commons,” she said.
Grace Udoh-Oshin, another senior broadcasting major in the honors college agreed. “This database would make it hard for broadcast students, like myself, who use third party sources for their projects to be able to legally publish their senior projects. If students were given access to more resources or given more support when compiling footage for their senior projects so that everything could be original, then I would get behind the concept of the Digital Commons.” Oshin was unaware of the Digital Commons until she was interviewed for the Pioneer.
Carlomusto discussed tips that she gives students before they make a project that may be published in the Digital Commons. “You want to discourage them from using copyrighted material unless they have to, or see if they can get a license to use the copyrighted material,” Carlomusto said. When using copyright material, every video that you use as a source in your project would need its own license. Carlomusto believes the first step before making your project is asking yourself if you really need this copyright material, because if so, it will make matters more difficult.
Although students have raised concerns about the Digital Commons, it is a great way for them to have their work published worldwide. “The Digital Commons is really great in terms of getting students’ hard work recognized,” Mitchell said. Carlomusto agreed. “The Digital Commons is a great way for people to put their projects online, but if they have copyright issues, then they shouldn’t do it.”

The Bush Brown Hall, at University Center on Northern Blvd. next to the NYIT entrance is being redone and upgraded. LIU is looking to upgrade the space and the lack of technology in this historic building. The assistant director of facilities William Kirker said, “The initial phase of the project is progressing as expected and has been paid for through a grant.”
The new Bush Brown Hall will house the T. Denny Sanford Innovation and Entrepreneurship Institute, which LIU hopes to become a key recourse and outlet for the students. In addition to the new technology and space being done, Kirker said new programs are coming which are designed to nurture innovation and creativity.
When completed LIU sees Bush Brown Hall to be a source of regional civic organizations and a place where start up business looking for advice can find LIU expertise in business development, and engagement and growth, Kirker said.
The President of both LIU Post and Brooklyn Kimberly R. Cline refused to answer any questions about the renovations.
William Kirker didn’t answer, for when the project on the Bush Brown Hall will be completed and ready to move into.

The campus office of Employer Relations is an underutilized resource for students at LIU Post.
To those who seek them out, job opportunities can arrive sooner than graduation. In an effort to get more students involved, Moreen Mitchell, University Director of Employer Relations and Career Success as of June 2016, and Joan Yonke, Campus Director of Employer Relations, decided to bring awareness to their department through a table in Hillwood Commons during common hour on Tuesdays.
Employer Relations is an outward-facing office, meaning most of their time is spent outside of the office meeting with employers. Mitchell expressed, “I want to go out and meet students on my own.”
Beginning in late Nov. 2016, Mitchell and Yonke created “Tabling Tuesdays” to draw attention to the job database for students listed on www.career.liu.edu and to talk with students about opportunities available to them.
Yonke and Mitchell sent lists of student jobs, internships and job shadowing opportunities to professors, departments, and the Promise office, yet the student engagement remained low.
Mitchell advises students to think of their future career and aspirations simultaneously with their studies. Internships are the key to securing a job after graduation. “Students should take advantage of being a student.”
Mitchell explained that employers are doing a cost-and-benefit analysis of hiring a graduate that has interned with them, versus a student that has done nothing with the company in the past. She commented, “Internships are a leg in the door.”
A prime concern Mitchell notices among students not applying for internships is how their grades reflect on potential employers. “Most employers are not looking at grades,” Mitchell explained. “They want someone hardworking, dedicated, and genuinely interested in learning about the field. It is ultimately about what you bring to the table.”
Yonke and Mitchell are working on a survey that will be sent out to students to determine the efficiency of tabling. Jenise Carter, a senior business management major, came to them last semester for help with applying to trainee programs at Enterprise, and successfully landed an interview.
Carter explained, “I asked them if they knew of anyone who could help me with my resume, because
that seemed to be my weakest spot.” Yonke and Mitchell worked with Carter and talked about her past job experiences, action verbs to put on the resume, and resume structure that would help her stand out. Yonke connected with Carter over winter break to go over her revised resume.
She shared her success in her first interview, “[Yonke] sent me a few companies that were looking for students, and Enterprise was the first company I’ve heard back from.”
The Employer Relations office also provides other services in Hillwood such as on-campus interviews where employers are brought on campus to engage with students, “Employer-in-Residence” where an employer can speak directly to students about current job openings, “Employer Spotlight” where a single employer speaks about their work to a group or class and “Career Roundtable Connections” in which various employers from similar industries speak with students in small groups.

After the snow storm on Thursday, Feb. 9 and the recent freezing rain on Sunday, Feb. 12, the icy campus pathways and stoops have become hazardous, according to students who attempted to navigate them. Because the average temperature has been in the low thirties, Chipmunk Trail has turned into Chipmunk rink, students have said. Many students have also cited icy resident hall stoops as a major concern.
“I almost slipped and fell on the stairs outside my dorm this morning while I was going to my 8 a.m. class,” Skylar Hornak, a sophomore art therapy major said, on Monday, Feb. 13. “They were covered in black ice! I’d really appreciate it if someone could take care of this situation so it doesn’t happen again,” Hornak said.
“The black ice around campus causes so many problems this time of year,” Kames Davis, a sophomore business major, said “Many students are often running late to their early morning classes because the sidewalks have yet to be salted in the early morning. Students are rushing and often putting themselves in danger on the slippery sidewalks. On Tuesday the sidewalks didn’t appear to be salted until after common hour. By the time the sun sets, there is new ice on the ground causing more danger to students returning to night classes,” Davis said.
Beth Funfgeld, Service Response Coordinator for Facilities Services said, “When we receive calls reporting areas that are slippery or icy, groundsmen are immediately dispatched to salt those areas.”
“We want to make sure students can get in and out of the dorms and use the roads in regards to the continual plowing in parking lots and roads on campus.”

Several weeks into the spring semester, student athletes must once again learn to manage their time to successfully complete their academic and athletic requirements. Students may apply to college due to the presence of team sports or for academic and economic opportunity. While college students become athletes for many reasons, athletic and academic obligations seem to exist in an antagonistic relationship with one another and student athletes must learn how to successfully balance both.
Some athletes, like freshman English major and women’s soccer goalkeeper Katie Bendersky, handle the balance between sports and academics with ease; they can manage their time in an effective way and don’t have to sacrifice their passion for sports for their education. “It’s a lot of time management,” Bendersky said. “It’s not hard if you manage it well. There are some late nights, but you know, everyone has them.” Despite the pressure of sports, Bendersky feels those late nights are worth it due to the friendship opportunities sports offers. “Being on the team, you have a set of friends who are there to support you. Even though school seems rough, you always have people to go to for help.”
Others however, like senior health administration major and men’s football safety Jared Chester, have a greater struggle with maintaining the sports-education balance, often finding that they need to compromise on one in order to excel in another. “I would either go to class late or practice late,” Chester said. “I’ve had friends who had to drop classes in order to make practice on time. They were told that if they didn’t drop the class, they wouldn’t play. They would end up dropping the class and [would take] it later on.”
Chester stated that sports do have an impact on grades, “due to the time that football asks of you. We have to watch film aside from practice and meeting time and there might be only little time for class.” For Bendersky however, sports has no impact on academics – the two exist in balance, and that balance can be reached with the help of time management.
While balancing sports and academics may require some creative time management, it might allow athletes an extra hour to devote to their schoolwork. Chester suggested “mandatory library time” as something he would like to take part in. “After a game, an off day, just to spend one hour in the library for schoolwork, away from the dorms, away from football.”
The athletic department has a mandatory study hall on Monday and Thursday evenings; according to head women’s basketball coach Deirdre Moore. While the study hall is open to all student athletes, any student athlete with a GPA under 2.5 is required to attend. “During this athletic department study hall there is a staff member that monitors the session and we get tutors for the subject areas that the student- athletes request help in. We work closely with the library and Writing Center to assist student athletes with papers and writing assignments,” Moore said.
Besides mandatory study hall twice a week, coaches also hold additional study hall for their entire team. Moore stated that she holds study hall two or three times a week for two hours in the library and believes that student athletes are able to successfully manage their academic and athletic commitments. “More than 50 percent of our student athletes have achieved a 3.0 or higher fall term GPA. That is something to monitor and recognize each semester. Being a student athlete allows each to learn how to manage their time. They are often given a calendar that outlines their class time, practice time and study time. For women’s basketball, we have a team cumulative GPA of 3.17 and that includes several players who did earn a 4.0 last semester. The cumulative GPA of our department is over a 3.0, which shows that the student athletes have learned to manage their time well.”

Associate Professor of History Willie Hiatt’s book, “The Rarified Air of the Modern: Airplanes and Technological Modernity in the Andes,” was published by the Oxford University Press in October.
The book is a detailed description of how Peruvians used aviation developments and other technological advances in the early 20th century to transform Peru and the rest of the Andean states and modernizing the area.
“It tells the story of technology, but through a very human lens,” Hiatt said. “It is an accessible book that really allowed me to tell what I find to be a very compelling story of human aviation, while at the same time, making a bigger statement about technology,” he said. “There are a lot of lessons we can learn today from that time period.”
“The book is interesting for history majors, but also is accessible for any college student,” said Vanessa Verni, a graduate student in history who purchased Hiatt’s book. “He writes in such a way that is easily read and intriguing no matter how much background knowledge of Latin American history you have.”
“The book was a multi-year project,” Hiatt said. The book was part of Hiatt’s dissertation, the lengthy thesis usually required in obtaining a doctor of philosophy degree. “The quickest you can go from beginning a dissertation program to getting a book published is about five years,” he explained. “But very few people are able to do it.” He said that for some “it could easily take 10 years” to complete the process.
Hiatt said he’s “happy the book is out” and that it is a “relief” that it was finally published. Hiatt spent over a year in Peru researching and learning about the topic, another year writing about it, and then several more years turning it into a book manuscript while also teaching classes at Post. “He’s been talking about the book for as long as I’ve known him so he is definitely very proud of his accomplishments,” said Verni. Kyrsten Polanish, an LIU Post alumna who had Hiatt as a professor, said “I know he has been working on it for years now and has put endless hours into the research and writing of it.”
Hiatt has been a professor of Latin American history at LIU Post since 2010. “He cared about his students and he would always push us to stretch the boundaries of our capabilities,” said Polanish. “And I’m sure his book is a prime example of him pushing his own capabilities.”
Hiatt’s interest in Latin American history was piqued when he was studying Spanish at the University of Kentucky, and he decided to take a two-week trip to Cusco, Peru. “I just fell in love with Peru,” he said. “At that point I had no plans whatsoever to do a masters, much less a Ph.D., but I got the urge to go back to school and do a masters, and chose a Peruvian topic for my masters thesis, and absolutely loved it.”
Hiatt earned his Ph.D. in history from the University of California. This was Hiatt’s first published book, although he has helped edit and translate a previous published book titled “In Search of an Inca: Identity and Utopia in the Andes,” and has also contributed several articles and entries to multiple historical encyclopedias.
Hiatt’s book is available for purchase in hardcover on Amazon.

With Valentine’s Day right around the corner the sisters of Alpha Epsilon Phi thought it would be a perfect time to fundraise. The sorority set up two tables in Hillwood Commons from Tuesday, Feb. 7 through Monday, Feb. 13. to sell candy grams.
The candy grams allowed people to buy a card, write their valentine on it and attach it to a piece of candy. The sorority members would then give that candy to that person’s valentine.
The girls handed out these candy grams on Valentine’s Day in Hillwood to people they knew, and for the people they didn’t know they received their numbers and texted them. The sorority only took people who live on campus, but for people with a significant other they gave them the candy gram directly for them to gift themselves.
Courtney Cabo, a senior speech pathology major who was the sorority president last year, said, “with Valentine’s Day coming up, I thought it was a perfect time to fundraise; it is the first time we are doing this, but the first day was a great hit.”
With the two tables in Hillwood and a lot of foot traffic, senior pre pharmacy major Antonia Christodoulou said, “it was mostly Greek life that bought our candy grams even with a lot of people passing by.”
The sisters made $70 on the first day of the fundraiser. Cabo and Christodoulou said their end goal for the sorority is $200.
“The sorority does a lot of fundraisers throughout the year such as bake sales and chipotle fundraisers, but this one is nice because of the timing,” Cabo said.
The candy grams cost $3 , which included hand delivery. But AEPhi also had some fun next to the candy gram called Pie a Phi.For $1, you could smack a pie of whip cream in the face of the one of the sisters.
The Pie in the face was for AEPhi’s philanthropy, which is to raise money for breast cancer and spread awareness of breast cancer. All the money that they raised will go to Sharsheret, a non-profit breast cancer awareness center.
All of the sisters wore pink on Feb. 7 to spread knowledge of breast cancer. “We call in pink day,” Christodoulou said.
AEPhi President Meagan Byrne, a junior marketing major was unable to answer questions during the busy fundraising week.

Post Theatre Company (PTC) presented the Virgil J. Lee New Play Festival: “Reporting Live” on February
3 and February 5. Originally written by Michael Finke and directed by Chris Carcione, the cast and production team included Taylor Bass, Ethan Moore Dodd, Marlin Slack, Melissa Bianchi, Aaron Cooper, Paul Bakey, Logan Dewitt, Brandon Bennett, Jenna Gadille, Cayla Michael, Lauren Gissentanna, and stage manager Kayla Bernie. 
Reporting Live, as mentioned on PTC’s Facebook page, is based on a true story about Christine Chubbuck, an American television news reporter who committed suicide during a live television broadcast in 1974, leaving viewers and the nation in shock. The story follows the events in Chubbuck’s life that led to her broadcast. The piece explores media outlets in the 1970s, while also having particular political relevance to problems today in relation to broadcasting and media and how influential they are.
The show was captivating and the cast did a good job of telling the story. “I thought that is was a very interesting way to add to the discussion around mental illness. It painted the realities and even the grey area of mental illness in such an original way, fully illustrating how all consuming the topic is. It was also very interesting to see the show as a work in progress rather than a finished product and I think that in its completion it could really affect some people,” said Tanner Bolin, a junior musical theatre major who went to see the show.
The level of emotional involvement and intimacy with the audience was unexpected. “I thought the show included a superb group of young actors and actresses that told an interesting story. There was a perfect balance of sadness and humor throughout the play and it really drew me in,” mentioned Lauren Hiraldo, a sophomore dance major. The fact that this was something that happened in reality really made the whole of it overwhelming. However, it is fair enough to say that the show should have advertised a warning. The play could have been intense on the audience’s emotions, touching personal topics such as mental illnesses, and suicide that could potentially upset members in the audience, unintentionally. “Even I had to get up and leave for a minute, simply because I was so overwhelmed,” Griffin Lockette, a sophomore theatre major, said.

Associate history professor Willie Hiatt and psychology professor Dr. Robert Keisner will speak at the Hispanic Association Club’s upcoming discussion on Feb. 15 in Humanities 008 at 12:30 p.m. The discussion will be focused on the “sanctuary campus movement, in which colleges and universities seek to protect students who are undocumented immigrants” Hiatt said. A sanctuary campus can provide legal support for students, protect sensitive information about a student’s citizenship status “refuse to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and raise awareness about immigration issues through demonstrations, vigils, and
other actions.” The discussion is a response to President Trump’s executive order, which is no longer in place, which prevented citizens from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States.
Junior international studies major Aida Enaorado and president of the Hispanic Association Club, stated that the purpose of the club is to “build a community of Hispanics and Latinos on campus where we feel we are not represented enough, to create a more positive view of our community, to help organizations that help countries of Latin America, like Operation Smile, and to educate people on campus about our community.” While the Hispanic Association Club is not directly associated with the executive order, Enaorado said that “Hispanics and Latinos are facing similar struggles as many other immigrant groups and because of that, we need to stick together.”
Hiatt and Keisner will lead the discussion titled, “Protective Walls: Immigrants and the Sanctuary Campus Movement in the Trump Era.” Keisner stated that the purpose of the discussion is to “create an environment where people can openly discuss how such religious based bans and deportations affect them and what actions we all might take.”
Hiatt, one of the faculty advisors of the Hispanic Association Club, asked Keisner to take part in the discussion because “he was aware of my interest and concerns about the threats to the civil liberties of those among us who have become even more vulnerable following the election.”
Hiatt and Keisner encourage all students to attend to learn more information about the issue or if they know someone who was affected by the ban. “Any student who is concerned about immigration issues can learn more about this important movement, meet other students who share their concerns and/or desire for advocacy, and meet engaged faculty members who are working on this issues either as part of their research or personal interests,” Hiatt said.
“Protective Walls: Immigrants and the Sanctuary Campus Movement in the Trump Era” will take place on Feb. 15 in Humanities 008 at 12:30 p.m. The Hispanic Association Club meets every Monday during common hour with the location depending on which events are scheduled.

On Tuesday, Feb. 21, Black Tie Brass (BTB), a band composed of LIU Post alumni, will perform a convocation in the Hillwood Recital Hall during common hour. The program, entitled “The 21st Century Musician,” includes a presentation outlining what it takes to be a successful musician in 2017 as well as a performance. 
According to Lisa Meyer, production coordinator for the music department, the majority of the attendees at the event will be music majors, but all students are welcome to attend.
The group, which was founded in 2013, is a horn-driven, jazz band that “combines the presence of a New Orleans brass band with the sound of a funk band,” according to its Facebook page. The band members include Ryan McNulty (trombone), Randolph Smith (trumpet), Mike Alvarez (saxophone), Jason Reese (keyboard), Vinny Muscarella (guitar), Charles Jourdan (bass), and Glenn Chiarello (drums).
Alvarez came up with the idea for BTB to present and perform for current music majors, Meyer said, since he, as well as the rest of the band, are department alumni. “The department keeps in touch with many of our alums, and we were delighted to be able to work out a mutually convenient date for them to come back and perform for our current majors,” she said.
“The whole band met through LIU Post, so we felt it only fitting to come back and show the students how to adapt to the changing world of music,” McNulty said. “We have started to figure out our way by trial and error, and if we can help any other musicians not make the same mistakes, then we want to try and help them.”
“This is a partnership that we would like to see continue because we enjoy inspiring up-and-coming professionals, and showing off our talents to students at our alma mater,” Smith said.
“It feels very fulfilling coming back to where I learned the most about music to share my experiences,” Muscarella said. “I hope everyone can take something away from this event and apply it to their future musical careers.”
The band members said the repertoire of songs they plan to play at the event is a mix of original compositions as well as covers and arrangements of popular songs. They have been preparing for “The 21st Century Musician” in between gigs at various venues across Long Island.
“We gig regularly, so each gig and rehearsal is an opportunity to hone in on the music we want to showcase for the convocation,” Smith said.
“Our writing process never ends, so we are constantly tweaking our arrangements to make them more enjoyable for us and the listener,” McNulty said.
Meyer said that although the program is mainly intended for aspiring musicians, she believes the content of the presentation will be beneficial for any students, regardless of their prospective career path. A major aspect of the presentation, she added, is how positive social media branding plays such a big part in one’s success. “Through hard work, initiative, and good use of social media, creating a viable career is possible.”
“We are honored to be able to come back and share our real world knowledge with the current students there, even though just a few short years ago we were in those seats,” McNulty said.
“We look forward to meeting and performing for the current Post students,” Smith said.

Located near the front of the Pratt Recreation Center, Kevin Buckley’s office is packed with paperwork, supplies for his track and field teams, and people. Runners and coaches constantly file in and out, creating an energy mirroring Buckley’s personality. Buckley became the head coach of the LIU Post men’s and women’s indoor and outdoor track teams almost exactly a year ago, in February 2016.
Born and raised in Astoria, Queens, and a current resident of Elmont, NY, Buckley is a true New Yorker and describes himself as frenetic. “I guess I’m the baroque coach. I’m kind of organized chaos,” Buckley said.
Junior distance runner Ryan Gioe said Buckley is very strict about sticking to a schedule, but balances that with humor. “Buckley is definitely a character,” Gioe said. “He likes to make a lot of historical jokes and sing classic rock and roll. Overall, his personality is positive and uplifting.”
Track and field was not Buckley’s first sport of choice when he began teaching and coaching at St. Agnes High School in New York City, also his alma mater, but after a previous coach left his position, Buckley could not turn down the opportunity to take the job. Before track, his main passions were basketball and baseball, and he only ran one year of track in high school and one year in college at St. Francis in Brooklyn. He began his career at St. Agnes, where he got his first job as a head coach at the age of 22, and he has not stopped for more than 40 years. After leaving St. Agnes in 1986 and moving to Kellenberg Memorial High School, where he taught multiple history classes, he continued to coach boy’s track.
“All of a sudden, I was there for the next 40 years,” Buckley explained. “It’s intriguing in that way because you don’t wind up in the place you think you’re going to wind up, but you wind up in the right place. If it wasn’t the right place for me, I wouldn’t have been doing it for this long.”
Buckley retired from teaching at Kellenberg in June 2016, and originally planned to retire fully, but with the encouragement of many coaches in the area, including his current assistant coach at LIU Post, Anthony Perrone, he took the job as head coach of the running teams at Post, replacing Pat Slevin. At first he was reluctant to apply, waiting about eight weeks after the position was announced to submit an application. One day last year he came to Post and had the job the same day. “It was probably by default,” Buckley added, jokingly.
His relationship with the coaching staff has made his new job easier. Perrone, the assistant coach who encouraged Buckley to apply for the job, also boasts an impressive resume with experience as head coach at Columbia University, North Carolina Wilmington, and NYIT.
“I have wonderful assistants,” Buckley said. “We have a bunch of guys who think on the same page.”
One thing that did surprise Buckley about his new team is how young the program actually is. He hadn’t realized that just three years ago at LIU Post, “there was not track and field program,” he said. The university announced the addition of men’s and women’s indoor and outdoor track and field programs, along with three other new NCAA Division II sports in December 2013.
Coming into such a young program can be challenging, and Buckley is recruiting to build a more diverse team in terms of the variety of events that athletes compete in at each meet. For example, the women’s team currently has no sprinters, which makes it very difficult to score well as a team. “We’re trying to get the whole gamut,” Buckley said. “It’s track and field, not just distance running.” The men’s team currently boasts a roster of 21 athletes and the women’s has 15, fairly small numbers for track and field teams.
Buckley is using his connections with other coaches to sign more recruits, and he said he is very happy with the progress they have made so far. He has some early commitments for fall 2017 that specialize in a variety of distances and field events that he is very excited about.
Junior distance runner Talya Williams said Buckley has been putting a lot of time into his new job. “He is very committed to our team,” Williams said. “Although we’re still struggling a bit, he does show a lot of effort in trying to build the team for the years to come.”
Finding a time and place to practice has not been the easiest task either. The only track located on campus is the one on the upper level of Pratt Recreation Center, which Buckley said is great when the weather is bad, but when over-used, can lead to injuries such as shin splints. They have signed on to use Kellenburg Memorial High School’s outdoor track in Uniondale, but conflicts in scheduling are making it difficult to get the entire team there at the same time.
Regardless, these minor setbacks have not brought the team down. Buckley understands that team members’ schedules are different, especially at the college level. “This is not one of those dictatorial Division II programs,” Buckley said. “You have to be exible.”
Buckley likes to see his athletes working hard, but also does not want to take things too seriously all the time. “Practice is fun,” he said. “Everything is supposed to have a humorous element to it.”
“Buckley has a philosophy that less is more but understands when we need to be pushed,” Gioe said.
Buckley said the team dynamic is great, and everyone gets along really well. As for the future, Buckley said it’s all about improving as a team. He wants to add as many kids as he can in the coming years, and eventually be able to compete for the top spot as a team at each meet. “You want to be number one,” Buckley said. “That’s why you’re here.”

Kevin Buckley was my History teacher and coach for Track and Field when I attended St. Agnes on E 44th Street during the years of 1981 – 1985.  I remembered at the time that Mr. Buckley was not a fan of the singing group Hall and Oats.  He took us (the track team) to Van Courtland Park in Riverdale , Bronx for practice.  Other teachers at the time were Ms. Pearce, Ms. De Galbo, Brother Dennis (he was Strict) , who was a Mathematics teacher, Mr. Lupack, Mr. Pinkleton,  Principle Conte, brother  Timothy Richardson (RIP), Mr. Doyle, who was a Chemistry teacher, Mr. Compano to name some.

On Wednesday, Feb. 8, the men’s basketball team beat the Mercy Mavericks, 81-55, at the Pratt Recreation Center. The Pioneers were hot from behind the arc all night, hitting 15 three-pointers. It was only the third game this season at which the Pioneers had 15 or more threes.
LIU got off to a hot start, opening the game with a 13-3 run in the first 3:38. Senior forward Greg Dotson, junior guard Kyle McLeggan and freshman guard Jared Rivers all hit baskets in the early run.
The men shot a crazy 59.3 field goal percentage in the first half, with 66.7 percent from downtown. The green and gold took a 45-21 lead into half.
The Pioneers, who never trailed, went on a 22-7 run for eight minutes starting at the four-minute mark of the game.
Dotson recorded his team best eighth double-double of the year, having 18 points and 15 rebounds. Dotson shot a perfect 4 for 4 from the free throw line and 6 for 11 from the field.
Aary Bibens also sunk 18 points, along with five rebounds and three assists. Mcleggan earned 11 points and two rebounds, and Mosley collected 12 points, four assists and two rebounds.
Head Coach Erik Smiles was pleased with his team’s performance “We performed well, we executed and made shots. Anytime you make shots you are going to look better than how you played overall, but we guarded in the first half and made shots throughout the game.”
Smiles and the Pioneers will head to Rochester on Saturday, Feb. 11 to play Roberts Wesleyan College, an ECC rival that they defeated earlier in the season, 84-64.
“Roberts is a good team with good size and length on the perimeter,” Smiles said. “We have to do a good job of guarding their guys and taking away their shooters.”
The Pioneers currently sit 7th in the ECC polls, with a 6-7 conference record. The team has five games left on the schedule, all against ECC opponents. “We are going to have to do what we did tonight,” in order to make the playoffs, Smiles said. He stressed that his team would have “to have guard, execute, rebound the ball, stay together, and be positive. “

The women’s basketball team came back from a 14-point deficit to come away with a 74-68 win over Mercy College during a home thriller Feb. 8.
The Pioneers were able to snap a three game losing streak with five girls tallying point totals in the double digits. Sophomore guard Shannon Doyle led the team in total points and assists with 15 and 7, respectively. Junior guard Kristen Olsen and freshman forward Mikaiya Patterson both scored 14 points for the Pioneers, and senior guard Kylie Garret and sophomore forward Sasha Patterson each had ten points.
It was a battle for the lead early in the game, with the two teams tied at 18 at the end of the first quarter. Mercy dominated the majority of the second quarter, pulling away to a 14-point lead with only 1:40 left to play in the first half. The Pioneers were able to battle back with an 8-0 run over Mercy and went into the half down by six points.
Coach Deirdre Moore said she told the girls during halftime to “try to keep the energy and the effort high, try to get easy shots, close shots, and we have to get stops on defense.”
That high energy was visible as both teams were in another tug-of- war for the lead during the third quarter and the game entered the final quarter tied at 53.
The Pioneers continued to battle during the fourth quarter and took their largest lead of eight points with 4:26 to play. They never relinquished their lead and came away with a 74-68 win over Mercy College.
The Pioneers are now 10-13 overall and 6-7 in the East Coast Conference. They only have five more games left in the regular season, all East Coast Conference match-ups, before they compete in the first round of the conference championship on March 1.
