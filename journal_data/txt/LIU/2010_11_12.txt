The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

The C.W. Post Volleyball team celebrated ‘Senior Night’ with a 3-0 sweep over Mercy College at the Pratt Center last Tuesday.
The win was big for the girls as it brought their overall record back to .500 on the year. For their last home game, seniors Kim Lubeski (Bishopville, MD), Sammy Figliolia (Wantagh, NY), Amanda Ostapow (East Setauket, NY), and Marilena Guadagnini (Huntington Beach, California) were all honored for their volleyball careers at Post.
Leading the team in kills on senior night ironically was freshman, Shayla Hixson (Honolulu Hawaii) who had 12 kills along with 8 digs. The seniors however, did not disappoint. Ostapow totaled 30 assists and four service aces on the match. Figliolia had seven kills and 11 digs while Lubeski recorded six digs. Guadagnini also added eight kills. These girls combined for 30 kills and 41 digs when the team total was 41 kills and 50 blocks.
The remaining kills went to Makamae Namahoe (4), Geony Fisher (3), Lisa Delfs (3) and Laura Garbarino (1). Fisher also recorded 9 digs.
Mercy started off with an early 4-1 lead against the Pioneers in the third set and almost set the game to a fourth set. But the Pioneers had a 7-0 rally and eventually won the match with a score of 25-12. This was the Pioneers fifth conference win and 19th win of the season.

How long have you been playing at Post? 3 seasons, transferred from Hofstra Fall 08.
What did you first think about Post? I loved the campus and the aspirations the team had. I wanted to be part of something leaving a legacy behind.
How do you feel about Post now? I have mixed emotions, it is bittersweet that my years here are almost over, but Post has been a big chapter in my life providing me with memories that I will carry with me forever.
Lesson(s) you will take from Post? Speak up. We have a fabulous support system of faculty and staff here at Post that all want the best for you, but they can only help if you give them the chance.
Best memory with the team/of Post? I am still hoping for this season to be the best one in my college soccer career, ask me in December and hopefully I can say my best memory is becoming National Champions.
What do you want to do after Post? I am not sure yet, but I am most likely moving back to Sweden to take the next step in my life in to the grown-up world.
What will you miss from Post? Definitely my team, they have grown to be a second family to me.
Coming from a different country, was it hard to adapt to America? Absolutely! It is a totally different culture and finding out how things were done around here was a challange.
Or did being part of a team make that easier? 
Being part of a team made it a lot easier, I was thrown into a group of students who all had the same interest and were on the same page. We sort of figured everything out together.

Under the bright lights of the playoffs the C.W. Post Men’s Soccer team (7-8-2) went head-to-head against ECC rival Dowling College (10-1-5) that ended in a thrilling upset for the Pioneers.
The match was a nail-biter, as even two overtime periods was not enough to decide the outcome. Penalty kicks were needed to see who would advance to the ECC Championship. In the end, Dowling won the match with a 4-2 lead in penalty kicks.
During the first half of play, both teams played exceptional defense and both goalkeepers, Chris Kucera (Dowling) and Marco Jorgensen (C.W. Post), played tremendous, each making several stops in goal.
Midway through the second half, Dowling got on the scoreboard with a goal off a penalty kick from sophomore forward Stefan Draskovic.
The Pioneers fought back as they tied the game with only a few minutes remaining off a penalty kick, which was awarded when Dowling was called for a handball, by sophomore forward Betim Bajrami forcing overtime.
Through the first two overtime periods neither offense could get going forcing the game to be decided in a shootout. Rumen Kerekov was robbed of a goal by Dowling goalie Kucera. Later, William Lindberg also could not connect with his penalty kick as his shot hit off the crossbar.
Dowling freshman back Joseph Henton beat goalie Marco Jorgensen leading to Dowling junior back  HYPERLINK “http://www.dowlingathletics.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=1010” Vladimir Milosavljevic’s chance to finish the Pioneers season in one of the most difficult ways possible. Milosavljevic’s shot beat Jorgensen putting an end to the Pioneers season.
In an amazing match-up between fierce rivals, this was a game that proved to be worth the hype. With both squads vying to get to the Championship game, only one could make it there. Unfortunately, Post was on the losing end of a great battle against Dowling, who later in the week defeated the University of Bridgeport 2-1 to become the Champions of the East Coast Conference.

The Great Northeast Collegiate Hockey defending champion C.W. Post Pioneers defeated New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), 3-1 on October 29th but suffered their first loss Saturday in overtime against Kutztown University.
Against NJIT, the Pioneers took a 1-0 first period lead on junior Lawrence Kutsovsky’s first career goal off a scramble in front of NJIT goaltender, Mike Lipinski. Securing a rebound off a John Ninivaggi shot, Kutsovsky lifted a wrist shot over Lipinski’s left shoulder at 12:23 of period one. Just 5:04 later, Brian “Sully” Sullivan put Post on top 2-0, with his fifth goal of the season. Carrying the puck down the right side, the senior winger shot the puck towards the net, where it deflected in off a NJIT defenseman.
In the second period, the Pioneers extended their lead to 3-0, as senior Shawn Hroch scored a power play goal. The screaming wrist shot at 8:42 was assisted by freshman Chris Joseph and Sullivan. For Hroch, it was his league-leading 13th goal in five games. Junior Andrew Palladino, playing his first year as a Post goaltender, was sensational all night making 37 saves. He was finally beaten at 7:18 of the third period on a shorthanded breakaway by NJIT’s Rob Amos.
In their battle against Kutztown, the Pioneers (5-0-0-1 GNCHC/5-2-0-1ACHA) blew a 3-0 first period lead, by taking eight penalties while Kutztown only had three. The Pioneers, who last year were top ten in the nation in penalty killing, gave up four power play goals in eight attempts; including the game winner.
With the Pioneers leading 3-0 from goals by TJ Kilbride and two from Shawn Hroch Kutztown cut the lead to 3-2. Sully Sullivan scored a shorthanded goal to put the Pioneers up by two goals midway through the second period. Two Kutztown goals tied the score at 4-4 going into the third period. Post’s Conor Reeves and Kutztown’s Doug Coughlin traded third period goals to send the game into overtime tied at 5.
After a goal crease skirmish, Post goaltender, Andrew Palladino was assessed a five minute major with 1:45 remaining in the third period. In overtime, Kutztown’s, Vincent Stagliano beat Palladino with his third goal of the night for the win on that power play.
The Pioneers are set to play two home games this week, Friday, November 12th vs Princeton at 10:30pm and Saturday, November 13th vs Muhlenberg at 8:15pm. Both games are at Parkwood Ice Rink in Great Neck. Admission is free.

After losing two straight games the C.W. Post Pioneer football team rebounded against the Cheyney University with a 63-28 victory.
The Pioneers jumped to a quick lead with consecutive touchdowns from Anthony Brunetti and then added another when Erik Anderwkavich tossed a 21-yard pass to Darnell Williams. The Cheyney Wolves did however get on the board when they rushed for a 9-yard touchdown to make the score 21-6.
Post would increase the lead with a 1-yard pass from Anderwkavich to Williams, but the Wolves would cut the lead in half with another touchdown of their own. The Pioneers closed out the half with a 42-14 lead. Brunetti added another touchdown and Aderwkavich connecting with Grayson Laurino for a 16-yard touchdown.
Brunetti, who finished the day with four touchdowns, racked up 143 yards on the ground as the Pioneer offense soared past the Wolves. The offense didn’t turn over the ball and continued to pile on points. The running duo of Brunetti and Jeff Mack ran for a combined 281 yards and five touchdowns. Quarterback Eric Anderwkavich completed 14 of 19 passes for 144 yards connecting for three touchdowns.
The Pioneers defense was effective the entire day, stumping the Wolves on how to score, and forcing them to make poor choices all day.
The Pioneers improved to 5-2 in the PSAC east and 6-4 overall, they have one game remaining next Saturday when they visit Slippery Rock, coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com begins at 12:30pm.

Greetings Post Pioneer!
I am an avid reader of the Pioneer and would like to say your doing a great job! I do however have a suggestion. What about a page for job opportunities on campus. I work at the Hilllwood Commons Information Desk and students always ask, “Whose hiring!” I send them to the Pep Office, but why not have help wanted ads for jobs that are searching for work study or budget students. Just throwing it out there.
Sincerely,
M. Bencosme
I would like to hear about activities taking place on campus and hear more about greek life. I am Vice President of Delta Phi Epsilon and I can tell you that all greek organizations do so much on campus and dont get recognition from Post at all.
S. D’Avella
To “The Pioneer”,
Hello. Recently I read the first the first issue of The Pioneer and saw the ad in the back about “what you’d like to see”; so here I go! I am a currently enrolled Art student at the C.W. Post campus. I would love to do a comic strip per issue of the newspaper on campus life, commuter life and general college life. I think readers would really enjoy “seeing” this in their campus paper. I plan on making it some-what humorous and personal to the school. Please let me know if this is a possibility and I will send some comic strip ideas. Also, if there is ever any need for illustrations or photographs I would love to get involved with that too.
 
Thank you for your time!
P. Stewart
Some Contest Responses from Upperclassmen:

Dear Editor:
I would like to comment on your new story, “Course Canceled Due to Low Enrollment.” In the article, it does not mention that in lieu of Journalism 56/Broadcasting 54, students may also take Advanced Editing as a substitute. In Advanced Editing students look at the construction of a television news package as part of the
curriculum.  They have the opportunity to go out and shoot news packages and edit them.  This is an excellent alternative I would like all students to consider.
Sincerely,
Sandra Mardenfeld
Assistant Professor/Director of Journalism Program

Sororities and fraternities are a great way to make friends on campus.  There are four sororities and two fraternities on campus plus cultural sororities and fraternities. There is sure to be one that peaks your interest. This week we’re featuring CW Post’s own sorority Alpha Epsilon Phi.
Seven women founded this sorority in 1907 at Barnard College. The main idea behind starting this sorority was for girls not to feel like they had to be a certain elite in order to be chosen for a sorority. These girls wanted everyone to feel welcome and hold life-long friendships.
Megan Doodian, junior Photography major, transferred to Post her sophomore year and wanted a place to meet some friends. She joined Alpha Epsilon Phi this past spring. “I joined Alpha Epsilon Phi because I was a transfer commuter student and I really wanted to get involved with my new school.  I also wanted a group of solid friends who I knew would have my back no matter what.”
Doodian she connects well with her sisters because, “we are very diverse, in background, values, and ideas but we all respect each other and are willing to learn from one another. We can’t describe it to someone looking in, it can only be an experience once you’re inside, it’s a very special bond we have.  Our bond is much deeper than being friends, you truly feel that you are sisters with each girl in your organization.”
Not only do the girls make bonds with one another, they help others and organizations as well.  Their local philanthropies are breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, and anything that affects one of their members. Their national philanthropies are the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric Aids Foundation. Glazer is a sister of Alpha Epsilon Phi.
Jessica Matilda Pereira, a junior Education and History major, joined Alpha Epsilon Phi, “because for my first year and a half in college, I did nothing but come to school, go to work, and come home. It’s hard as a commuter student to get involved in school because the majority of us have part time jobs. I wanted to be a part of something that was more than just a club, rather a group of people who were going to be there no matter what.”
When asked what types of philanthropy they do, Pereira said, “We do more than just wear letters, we go out and help people around us.”  They have bake sales for breast cancer many times in Hillwood.  They also attended the Jones Beach walk last year, and the Diabetes Walk at SUNY Old Westbury, which was in support for one of their own sisters.
When asked if she has already made life long friends in her sorority, Pereira stated, “ I know I’ve made them here at Alpha Epsilon Phi because these girls are my sisters no matter what, even after I graduate I will still be able to count on them for anything.”
To make your mark on C.W. Post, choose the right extra-curricular activities that fit you. If you are interested in a fraternity-sorority, check out our school’s website and see when the sororities and fraternities meet. Or wait till Rush week when the Greek organizations are recruiting new members.  These girls have found where they wanted to be, now it’s your turn!

C.W. Post’s Senior Assistant Director of Student Life has successfully completed his first round of P90X, and he’s ready for more. Eric Zirlinger, 30, began the fitness program five months ago. He has since lost 50 pounds and gone from a 33” to a 28” waistline. “I feel… glorious,” Zirlinger said with a smile. “I’ve lost the weight of my bulldog.”
The P90X fitness program is a 90-day program that is designed to get its users “ripped” in 90 days. It consists of working out six days a week, and parallels a nutrition plan.

Zirlinger said his motivation for starting P90X was to look and feel better about himself, but also his realization of his increasingly slow metabolism. “When I was in college, I could eat an entire pizza pie, a dozen chicken wings, and go to the gym and work it off in no time,” he said. “Now I can eat seven french fries and need to be in the gym for two and a half hours!”
In recent times, the DVD-based P90X workout advertised on Beachbody.com is all the rage. Is it because it’s new? Or because your almost-50-year-old trainer is in better shape than the condition of most others his age? Maybe because of the convincing “Before and After” videos of people posting their results after completing the plan?
Zirlinger’s insomnia inspired him to buy P90X. “When you’re up late at night, there is basically one of two things to do — buy the ShamWow, or P90X.” After researching the P90X infomercial and seeing other users’ ‘before and after’ results on YouTube, ShamWow just wasn’t quite as appealing.
The arrival of the P90X was described as being very exciting for Zirlinger. “I don’t have time to go to the gym, but I could manage to turn on my DVD player,” he said. “I opened the box… and I was RIPPED… nah, just kidding.” Zirlinger said that he saw his first results after one week of following the program religiously.
“Doing this six days a week was like going to a sport — I mean I treated it like a sport,” he said. “Tony Horton was my varsity coach and I was the number one player on the team, which was pretty sad because I was… the only one there.” Zirlinger kept up his motivation by sticking to his routine and loving his results. “The first few weeks were rough, but you weigh yourself and see the weight come off little by little,” he said. “It’s kind of addicting.”
The workouts are a combination of different exercises lasting between one and two hours, meant to be completed on a daily basis six days a week — leaving one day for resting and stretching. “You have to do weight-lifting, pull-ups, push-ups, plyometrics, yoga, core synergistics, and martial arts,” Zirlinger said. His favorite moment of the entire program was the day he could keep up with the professionals in the videos. “I was doing as many reps as them, and at the same weight.”
Zirlinger described one time that brought out his real determination. “In one of the videos, there is a guy with a prosthetic leg. I’m thinking, he makes this look easy, and I’m struggling on two legs!”
According to the P90X nutrition plan web site, there are three phases to the diet. The first phase is called the “Fat Shredder,” and is based on eating less carbohydrates and and a higher amount of protein in order to fuel muscles and burn fat efficiently. The second phase of the plan is the “Energy Booster,” and is a healthy mix of proteins and carbohydrates with a slightly reduced amount of protein to maximize endurance and energy levels. The last phase is the “Endurance Maximizer.” This phase focuses on complex carbs, lean proteins, and reduced fat, fueling the body help avoid plateaus and promote body muscle definition during the last few weeks of the system.
Zirlinger said he eats a large breakfast of egg whites and wheat toast, and tries to eat every two hours. The only supplements he uses are the occasional protein bars or shakes. After realizing his major problem with late-night snacking, Zirlinger has resorted to indulging in healthy snacks, such as fruits and vegetables.
Prior to starting P90X, Zirlinger made sure to pay a visit to his doctor to be sure it would be safe for him to start this particular workout program. After being monitored several times throughout the next three months, his doctor had some very pleasing news. “My doctor said after the 90 days of P90X I’m now in the best shape of my life and I’ve never been healthier.”
At Day 90 of the P90X, Zirlinger said it felt like he had finished a marathon. “You feel like you want Tony Horton to show up at your front door with a huge trophy or something.”

In one hand, you’re holding a conventionally grown granny smith apple. In your other hand, you have one that’s labeled organically grown. Both apples are firm, shiny and green. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. This scenario, provided by the Mayoclinic.com/health, leaves us with the questioning which one to actually choose. However before making this decision, it is important to become educated on what the word “organic” even means and why it is beneficial. There are several distinctions between the organic and non-organic growing process. The conventional way of farming consists of chemical fertilizers, insecticides, chemical herbicides, as well as hormone and antibiotics given to animals.  On the other hand, organic farming consists of natural fertilizers, insect traps, rotating and mulching crops, and organic feed for animals. Just the sounds of these words gives us a good idea of which products and techniques are harmful and which ones are natural and safe.
 
However, how do we know if a product is really organic? This is a common question that many consumers ask. To verify the credibility of sellers, the U.S Department of Agriculture (better known as the USDA) has created a seal for products that meet government organic standards. If a product is branded with a USDA ORGANIC seal then we as consumers can be assured that at least 95% of the product is produced with natural ingredients. Products that are purely organic carry a label that states 100% Organic and a small USDA seal. There are also products that contain at least 70% organic ingredients and these are labeled as “Made with organic ingredients.” It is extremely crucial to look for these labels because companies have ways of making products seem safer than they really are. If you see a product that says “hormone free,” it is an important distinction and is not to be confused with an organic product. One particular place to be aware of when shopping for organic foods is at the “Ma & Pop” stores. Many of these places, often times local farms, claim that their food is organic.  Although it may be, according to mayoclinic.com/health, it is difficult to prove because producers that sell less than $5,000 worth of products throughout the year are exempt from the USDA certification. Now that you are aware of the labels you need to specifically look for, you may still wonder “why should you still purchase organic rather than non-organic?”
 
The American Chemical Society claims that fruits and veggies grown organically show significantly higher levels of cancer-fighting antioxidants than conventionally grown foods, according to a new study of corn, strawberries and marionberries. Aside from potentially shielding us from a deadly disease, organic foods also offer more nutrients than conventionally grown foods. Many studies are still being conducted to see what other benefits there are from organic products, but for now we do know that they are safer than those that are chemically filled. Many experts do say however, that it is not so much about food being organic but about what type of food one is eating. But the questions remain over how we eat in general. It may feel better to eat an organic Oreo than a conventional Oreo, however according to Marion Nestle, a professor at New York University, organic junk food is still junk food. So before we go out and by the more expensive organic food we need to make a commitment to ourselves that we want to become healthy.
For those of us on campus, we are faced with a limited choice of food options.
Although the origin of the food served on campus is somewhat questionable, there are still a number of healthy choices that we can make. Organic or not, choosing a salad with fresh vegetables over a burger with fries is still the ideal health choice to make. If you are picking up a quick snack, instead of choosing a sugar filled carbonated beverage and a salty excessively filled carbohydrate why not go for some hummus and an all natural Odwalla drink? C.W. Post does offer many healthy choices and it is just a matter of looking for them. Including more organic grown products may be slightly more expensive for C.W. Post, but senior Rob Misseri says, “I would definitely rather see more organic food, even if it cost a little more.” However, all students don’t feel this way. Junior Ashton Zabatt states, “I personally don’t care about organic foods, in grocery stores I always choose the regular food over organic and I would do the same if it was offered at school too.”
So, next time you are standing in the grocery store and debating between that organically grown granny smith apple and the conventionally grown one, maybe you will remember the differences between both and such information will aid you in making the better choice. Which ever you choose and for whatever reason, the most important thing is that you still chose the apple over the bag of chips. Gaining knowledge on what you are eating is a choice that can only benefit us as individuals and guarantee a healthy lifestyle.

Food is an essential part of every student’s college experience. While food service may not make or break college life, it definitely affects it. At C.W. Post, ease compels most residential students to eat most their meals in the Winnick Student Center. Sentiments about the food range from good to terrible.
“It’s not so much the food, as the people who work there. Some of the people who work in Winnick just do not give a crap and cook it poorly,” said Freshman Eric Holloway. “For instance, sometimes I wait around Jimmy, the pizza guy, because he makes remarkable pies. I wish that everyone cared about their job as much as him.”
Some college dining services go the extra mile to ensure the caring to which Holloway refers. A feature piece in the Daily Beast lists the best college dining services in the country, and ranks the service at Oregon State University as the best in the country.
The Beast describes how one OSU student wrote a column that complained about the lack of spicy chicken in the cafeteria. Reportedly, the dining services at OSU contacted the student personally, a few hours after the piece had been published, to inform the young complainant that a buffalo chicken wrap had been to the menu of all the dining facilities at the university. According to the head of OSU’s dining services, Rich Turnbull, this is an expression of his staff’s overall commitment to customer service.
One could of course make the case that it is unreasonable to compare C.W. Post’s dining services to those of a state university. The sheer economic power of a state university could explain why its food maintains an exceptional quality.
Babson College is of a size and economy that is more similar to C.W. Post. An unlimited meal plan at Babson costs about $2,200, which is only $100 more expensive than C.W. Post’s equivalent plan. Even though Babson students may have to pay slightly more than their peers at C.W. Post, it is unlikely that they complain.
Last year, the Babson dining services place top ten in the University Business Magazine’s Dining Halls of Distinction program. On the college search engine, Collegeprowler.com, reviewers have given dining services at Babson an “A-.” Even the student government association at the college speaks well of the dining services. “The friendly staff, the variety and quality of food, and the impeccable service make every meal a real pleasure,” said then-SGA President John Campbell.
Back at C.W. Post, few students expect Winnick to earn any awards or distinctions. In fact, it often seems that many students are content with leaving a few acid remarks on the Winnick comments board every now and then. These comments are often rude and unconstructive, and disregard the fact that Winnick has improved its services during the past year. Open hours have been extended, nutritional information is available for some meals, and some new culinary creations appear from time to time.
Though, there is one important factor that has not been addressed. The C.W. Post freshman, OSU’s head of dining services, and Babson’s SGA president all mentioned the same thing: Service. It would be a gross exaggeration to claim that the Winnick staff is rude. Indeed, some of the staff is very service-minded and polite. But then there are the rest those who give rude looks to students who ask for something extra, and those in the staff who let their favorite students pass ahead of the line. “It is not as easy as you think,” said the managers at Winnick when asked about the questionable conduct of some staff members.
Easy or not, do not C.W. Post students have the right receive a service comparable to that of other schools? Should they have to satisfy with a sub-par dining experience just because it is not easy?

As of recently, the bullying epidemic has been taken into serious account by universities all over the country.  High-level forms of violence such as assault and murder are frequently receiving great amounts of media attention Bullying consists of three types of abuse – emotional, verbal and physical and is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person and the more powerful individual or group abusing those who are less powerful.
Last month, Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi, committed suicide because of cyber bullying. According to reports from Fox News, Clementi’s roommate posted a message on his Twitter saying “Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went to Molly’s room and turned on my webcam.  I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.”  Clementi’s roommate Dharun Ravi and accomplice Molly Wei posted a live recording of Clement having sexual intercourse with another male.  Ravi did so again two days later and on September 22, 2010, Clementi posted a message on his Facebook page saying, “Jumping off the GW Bridge sorry.” Clementi was just 18 years old.
Zack Graczyk, an outfielder on the C.W. Post baseball team, notices bullying on a daily basis. “I think people bully to make them feel better about themselves and feel strong. I also feel like people bully to make peers and friends laugh at the expense of others.”  Clementi’s story shows that homosexuality tends to be an even bigger target for bullying. It’s a reoccurring theme with bullying that students who are not homosexual tend to emotionally attack those who are homosexual.
However, C.W. Post student Eric Pietrangolare has never felt targeted personally. “I do feel that gays are targeted more than straight people.  I really don’t like being segregated from other people, so I would take homosexuals and straight people and put them on two sides of a room.  The only difference they would find in homosexuals is their sexuality. Other than that we are all the same.”
Pietrangolare feels as though when he was a kid in elementary school, the trend was bullying boys against girls. In middle school, it was the popular students bullying the “nerds”. But now that we are older, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and religion are all targets for bullying. This is when bullying is at its most dangerous because, as we can see with Clementi, we all have our breaking points. According to a recent study at Yale University, bully victims are 2 to 9 times more likely to commit suicide.
As college students we are all witnesses to bullying. But now we are adults and it is time to grow up. We must stop judging people based on sexuality, race, ethnicity and religion. Bullying does not just happen in schools anymore. It’s everywhere, including mobile phones and the Internet. It’s an ongoing problem that seems to never end. People need to look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves, “Who are we to judge anyone?” It’s a question that can’t be ignored anymore, and something needs to be done.

This Monday marked the start of Veteran Appreciation Week on campus.  Veterans in the faculty, among the student body, and in the community, will be honored all week long through a number of different events around campus in their name.
Monday’s festivities included a talk by Daniel Murphy in the Hillwood Cinema.  Murphy, whose son, Lieutenant Michael Murphy, received the Medal of Honor from President George W. Bush, spoke about his son’s service in the United States Navy.  While leading a four man Navy SEAL operation, Lt. Murphy gave his life in order to make a satellite radio call for support after being ambushed.
Tuesday featured a discussion by motivational speaker and veteran Sam Cila.  Cila, who lost his left hand as a result of injuries sustained in Iraq in 2005, now competes in Iron Man competitions worldwide and hosted a talk about “overcoming adversity.”
Wednesday’s event, a lecture titled “Women in the Military,” will be held in the Hillwood Cinema from 6p.m.-8p.m.  Co-sponsored by ACP, the talk will also discuss international students in the United States’ Military.
Thursday is Veterans Day and C.W. Post will celebrate its annual ceremony at the Flag Pole outside Hillwoood Commons at 12:45p.m.  Stephen Siwulec, President of the C.W. Post Club Veterans and Students United (VSU), is scheduled to give the keynote address and refreshments will be served at the Top of the Commons following the ceremony.
Friday, the final day, VSU will join forces with Men Respecting All Women and Women Appreciating Real Men to host a concert in the Pioneer Room featuring the alternative rock band Lights Resolve.  Prior to the concert will be an open mic night beginning at 8p.m. and food will be served throughout the evening.  All donations collected from the concert will go to the Wounded Warrior Project.
C.W. Post was recently named one of G.I. Jobs’ “Military Friendly Schools.”  The magazine, a veteran-owned publication geared toward those with a history in the service, looks at help offered with tuition costs, credit available for military training, and on-campus services accessible for veterans in developing this list.  For more information regarding Veterans Appreciation Week, contact Adam Groham, Director of Student Conduct and Community Education Coordinator of Veteran and Military Affairs.

The voter turnout among youths aged from 18-29 is not as substantial as it should’ve been. The Chronicle of Higher Education reports, “roughly 20 percent of Americans under the age of 30 voted in Tuesday’s midterm elections, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.”
However, youth voters dominated the 2008 presidential elections, and a difference was made. With 66% of youths voting for Democratic candidate Barack Obama, America welcomed its first interracial president. But why did youths choose to avoid the polls this past week?
According to the New York Times, “experts say the usual midterm effect, in which young voters are especially likely to disengage, has combined with an unexpected distance that has arisen between Mr. Obama and many young constituents.”
CBS reported that the youth vote was down to nine percent this year, opposed to 18 percent in the 2008 election and about 68 percent of the youth voters favor Democratic candidates. Some C.W. Post students believe that if there were more time or information, there could have been a diverse turnout. Sophomore Matt Virga said, “If more students voted, results could’ve been different,” and classmate Chris Pierce agrees, “it’s important to get involved because it’s our future.”
Yahoo news reports that, “the red wave of Republicans projected to win the midterm elections rose as predicted after the first polls closed on the East coast.” With the GOP representing the majority of the house, tables have turned in Washington.
According to http://www.politicsdaily.com, President Obama told a rally audience that if Republicans win, “they will spend the next two years fighting for the very same policies that led to this recession in the first place. We cannot sit this one out!”
It was clear that even C.W. Post students realized the importance of casting that ballot, but there was just not enough action to follow through with the notion. With that, sophomore Caitlin Kluko, gave one piece of advice to all college students, “If you didn’t vote, don’t complain about anything.”

On Friday, November 5th, honors students gathered on campus to attend the annual honors conference co-sponsored by Apple Inc. and the C.W. Post Provost’s Office. This year’s theme being communications, the conference offered a wide range of lectures and workshops.
C.W. Post alumnus, Michael Allen began the conference with a keynote lecture all students had to attend. Allen is a photojournalist who travels the world chronicling the lives of different people. His most recent work has been in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
Students had an opportunity to ask Allan questions at the end of the lecture, and used up every minute doing so.
Students then had to choose four of the 31 lectures to go to. Topics ranged from dream analysis, to first amendment rights, and even communication with whales and dolphins, which was presented by C.W. Post Provost, Dr. Paul Forestell. With virtually every workshop filled to capacity, it is clear the students enjoyed the range of options. “I liked the topic way better than previous years,” said Heather Norris, a junior in the honors program. “All the lectures were really interesting.”
It wasn’t only the attendance, which made it clear the students appreciated the event; the amount of student involvement in the lectures was tremendous. “The sessions were well attended,” said Professor Carolyn Levin, presenter of The Silencing of Student Expression. “Students were very interested and engaged.”
Mike Greco, a junior in the program, claims that the lectures were more fun to participate in compared to previous years. “The lectures I went to were all excellent and informative,” said Greco. “They were the best out of the three years I’ve gone.”
Dr. Forestell provided the honors students with a boxed lunch, complete with sandwich, soda, chips, and other snacks. Each student also received a free Apple drawstring backpack courtesy of Apple Inc.

Last Wednesday, the Newman Club held a demonstration on campus to raise the awareness of homelessness on Long Island.  Over 30 of the club members dressed in hats and gloves and posted up by Humanities Hall and the Great Lawn.  The demonstrators asked the people of the C.W. Post community to drop small donations into their cups.
“I don’t know if our hope is to end homelessness on Long Island. That’d be wonderful if we could,” said Father Ted Brown who was representing the Newman Club.  “But what we’re trying to do is bring attention to the fact that there is homelessness here on Long Island and that it takes all of Long Island to become aware of that to begin to solve this problem.”
The earnings made by the club were to go straight to the Interfaith Nutrition Network (INN).  According to the-inn.org, “The INN addresses the issues of hunger and homelessness on Long Island by providing food, shelter, long-term housing, and supportive services in a dignified and respectful manner for those who seek our help.”
Homelessness is an issue that affects college campuses across the country.  “There are many homeless college students. The INN is beginning to work on a facility for homeless college students.”
One aspect that was missing from this year’s event was the overnight sleepover outside.  Instead, they were only allowed out on campus until 5pm.  Sophomore Myana Grey was displeased with C.W. Post administration for preventing the students from sleeping on the Great Lawn.  “It’s actually our choice if we want to stay outside or not. I think they should have given us an opportunity.”
“It would make more of an impact if we were outside,” said Tess Dixon, the service Chair Person of the Newman Club.  Dixon added that the administration came to this decision because sleeping outside on campus is “a safety issue.”
Last year, the Newman Club raised $2,500 for the INN. Regardless of the final tally this year, the event was a success.  “As much as we can,” was the goal stated by sophomore Mikaya Newell.  “Homelessness is a real thing. Some people don’t actually realize it or know what homeless people go through. Hopefully they’ll look at it and want to help,” said Grey.  For more information on homelessness on Long Island, visit http://the-inn.org.

For the fourth consecutive year, the Princeton Review has named C.W. Post’s College of Management among the top 300 business schools in the country. This was based upon a student survey.
Unlike other ranking systems like US News and World Report, the Princeton Review collects data directly from students in the form of surveys. College students were asked to comment on a number of categories including, academics, career and placement, student life and environment, and admissions. In this particular survey, students specifically commented on the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program in the College of Management at Post.
In the 2011 edition of “The Best 300 Business Schools,” students cited flexible schedules, engaging teachers, and a beautiful campus among the advantages of studying at C.W. Post.  “Classes are not too large which makes for a better learning environment,” said one student.  Another stated “professors are responsible, nice and professional, as well as knowledgeable in their respective fields.”
George K. Andreadis, Director of Graduate Programs for the School of Management agrees with the student responses. He also cites the college’s flexible schedule as advantages for students and the program.
The MBA program gives students the opportunity to take classes during the week, at night, or a 5-week session offered on Saturdays. The college also allows students to mix weekly classes with Saturday classes, which as students stated, is a unique and resourceful feature of the college.
“The majority of our students have full time jobs, said Andreadis “We give them this flexibility because we understand that life happens and we want to do everything to help them succeed.”
Along with the flexible schedule there are other unique features that set the college apart from others. The college is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The MBA program is a 36-48-credit program instead of a 48-60-credit program, which some schools offer. “This allows students a reasonable amount of time to get their degree,” Andreadis commented. Students are offered advising separate from the general advising for the entire university, as well as a specialized careers services and job placement.
Andreadis noted that the College of Management takes careful consideration of students’ comments, Although they are taken anonymously, Andreadis said students still come to visit him and state their opinions. “While we can’t help with things like parking and registration, we try to follow up and do as much as we can for the students.”

Dear readers,
Just take a minute to sit back and relax.  Don’t be worried that it’s already past half way through the semester. There are six weeks (to the day) left of school…and that’s including Thanksgiving!  Not that we’re counting or anything, but the spring semester is slowly creeping up on us and we’re leaving the fall one behind.
It all happens so fast, Homecoming’s already come and gone, midterm he** week is done (hallelujuah!) and Halloween party days and nights have past (but are well-documented on Facebook).  Regardless of the time of year or week in the semester, let’s look at the present.  And there sure are plenty of things to view on campus this week!
In our news section, one writer informs you all about Veteran’s Week, so be sure to stop by one of the daily events being held in honor of our veterans.  A very notable and common face on campus is being featured as well this week, curious? Turn to page eight to find out who it is!
Also this week, as we promised, we have featured a sorority and this week it is Alpha Epsilon Phi.  Not to mention, we have another photo collage of what you and your friends are doing in between those hour and twenty minute periods (and by that we mean classes.)
Enjoy this week’s edition of the Pioneer and don’t forget, your comments and suggestions are always welcomed.  Be sure to email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.com.  Have a wonderful week everyone!
