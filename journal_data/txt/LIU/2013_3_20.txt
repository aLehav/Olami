On July 1, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline will take on the role as LIU president, a position previously held by Dr. David J. Steinberg for the last 27 years.
As LIU’s tenth president and first ever female to hold the office, Cline will be responsible for overseeing five LIU campuses, 630 full-time faculty members and all other university employees and over 24,000 students.
The presidential search firm Witt/Kieffer contacted Cline, who was in her Garden City home when she was informed that she had been chosen to succeed Steinberg. “It was certainly a full-vetted national search,” she said during an interview with the Pioneer’s News Editor on Friday, March 8.
Cline is currently serving as the president of Mercy College. She has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Industrial Relations from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a Masters in Business Administration, Juris Doctorate Degree and a Doctor of Educational Administration from Hofstra University.
As she gears up for her new role and her move to the presidential mansion provided to the LIU president on the Post Campus, Cline shares her hopes and aspirations for LIU, her feelings on being LIU’s first woman president and her plans for the future.
The Pioneer (TP): How did the opportunity to become LIU’s next president come about?
Dr. Kimberly R. Cline (KC): Well, it happened over the course of a few months.  I was contacted by the search firm and then eventually met the entire search committee.
TP: How do you feel about becoming LIU’s next president?
KC: I’m thrilled. I have lived on Long Island for a majority of my adult life. I’m originally from North Carolina, but I’ve been in New York so long, I feel like a New Yorker. I’ve always felt there was something special about LIU. It’s such a unique position to be able to offer the beautiful suburban campus at Post, and at Brooklyn, it offers students the opportunity to engage in an urban environment. So, I believe we will be the strongest university not only in the Long Island area, but we are going to gain national prominence as well.
TP: How does it feel to be serving as president so close to Hofstra where you obtained your graduate degree?
KC:  I worked at Hofstra a good many years and obviously I’m proud of the education I have from there. However, my husband is a graduate of Post, so we also have long-term loyalties to Post as well.
TP: How does it feel to become the first woman to serve as LIU president?
KC: I don’t think about it as being the first woman president. The most important thing I try to encourage anyone that I’m mentoring is to just be prepared. Don’t think of yourself in a particular category, but think about what skill set you need to be a strong leader. So, I’m just happy and thankful to be a leader that’s following David Steinberg, who’s done such an amazing job over a long period of time.
TP: Are you excited about your move the presidential mansion on campus? 
KC: I am. I have never lived on a college campus. Mercy’s house was off campus. However, I believe the wonderful opportunity to live on campus is one where you can really connect with faculty, students and campus constituencies and really become a part of the community. I am also going to have an office in Brooklyn and I’m going to spend a good amount of time there because both campuses are essential to LIU’s future.
TP: You are Mercy’s 10th president and now LIU’s 10th president, how will the roles differ and how will they be the same?
KC: I find in higher education, the challenges that they’re all facing now with the economy and also ensuring that they provide value to the students means that we really have to be focused on strategic enrollment and ensuring our retention is strong and also collaborating with faculty and students. The faculty members are the ones that are in front of students everyday. We need to build financial resources, which includes building revenue and opportunities. I feel like I did all that with the great team at Mercy and we will be doing that at LIU. However, I think that LIU is in a unique position having that suburban and urban mix of campuses because they complement one another and then you add in LIU Global, which can offer students a worldwide learning experience. Those are offerings that other colleges and universities don’t have and all of that along with some of the health care areas and the performing arts and the other strong programs, I think there are ways we can work to gain national prominence for LIU.
TP: You mentioned that the Presidential Search Committee contacted you. Was it something that you knew about beforehand?  Were you interested in applying for the role?
KC: I didn’t know about it until the search firm reached out to me, but I spoke to them and it was certainly an opportunity that interested me, primarily because of all the great things I previously mentioned. But also because I feel like I know LIU well.
TP: What do you foresee will be a great accomplishment for you in your new role? 
KC: Well, I believe the greatest accomplishment will be if we could all work together to move LIU forward on a number of fronts. We have to work to make sure we have enrollment retention, financial resources for faculty and students. We also have to leverage the community and we need to showcase our brand.
TP: How important is it for you to be named LIU’s first president during Women’s History month?
KC: I think it’s an honor, but the most important thing is that LIU feels that they have hired the right person for the job. I am honored to be the first woman, but I’m most happy that I am the best candidate for the job.
TP: What do you foresee will be one of the hardest challenges you’ll face as the new president?
KC: I believe there are many more opportunities than challenges. There are opportunities in growing programs and growing fields. There are opportunities in finding innovative ways to fulfill our mission of access and excellence, but we have to recognize there is an academic challenge and it’s becoming more important to provide value for our students. Not just to provide the great education, which is equally important, but that we’re helping students move forward in their career of choice.
TP: President Steinberg has been LIU’s president for over 25 years. In which ways will you follow in his footsteps? 
KC: Well, it’s humbling to be following in his footsteps. But, he has also built a wonderful team and laid some critical groundwork that’s going to make it possible to move LIU to the next level and to gain regional and national prominence.
TP: How will you make your own path? 
KC: I think we have to do that all together. As a president, it’s not really about me, it’s about LIU. So, we have to pull together as a community to determine what are the areas we need to work on in order to move forward. That’s going to come from working with faculty and students, looking into academic programs and looking at opportunities and together we’ll find a strategic footprint that will take us to the next level.
TP: What will your first initiative be as the new president? 
KC: My immediate plan is to create a dialogue among faculty and students and then to develop some programs that are transformative. However, we won’t know what those are until we all work together, but I think as soon as we develop them, we’ll take the steps to make sure they are successful.
TP: What are your roles as Mercy’s President?
KC: It’s different on any given day. However, as the president I was on the executive team. We provided strategic leadership for moving the university forward. We did that in a number of ways. Over the past five years, our enrollment has increased significantly and our academic quality has increased as well. We have financial security; we hired a significant amount of faculty over the past few years. I think it was pulling all that together and providing strategic direction in order to lead Mercy into the next decade.
TP: What are three things students should know about you?
KC: I have an intense passion for education; my goal would be that everyone that entered LIU would be successful all the way through graduation. Another would be, I’m a mother and wife, I have three children and my family is very important to me. The third is that this opportunity is one that will really offer me the opportunity and challenge to help LIU move into a new direction and I am intensely thrilled about it.
TP: How will you combine your skills as Mercy President and as Chief Financial Office of the State University of New York in your role as the new president?
KC: Well, more and more, it’s important that presidents understand the whole enterprise and the core of what happens at a university is centered on academics. However, I believe that the finance area is also important. The federal government has had to impose a lot of compliance issues that are necessary to follow on college campuses and my background, I think, enables me to understand that and ensure that the university would be in full compliance.
TP: What are you most looking forward to? 
KC: I’m most looking forward to meeting the campus community, the faculty, the other employees and the students and to understand what attracted the students to LIU and how we could work together to make it better.
TP: What are you least looking forward to? 
KC: I’m a very positive person, I can’t think of anything that I’m not looking forward to.
TP: Where do you see yourself in five years? 
KC: Well, I see myself at LIU and that’s where I would like to be and I see the University moving into a direction of national prominence and for it to be a place of choice for students when they enroll. For companies, educational institutions and doctoral programs to look for our students because they are educated with great quality and for it to be the number one university on Long Island.

Elizabeth Wollman, a music professor and published author, shared her career advice and experiences with Post students on Thursday, March 7 at the “Food for Thought” lecture series.  She studied adult musicals for the majority of her career as a writer and published two books on the topic.  At the lecture, she gave advice on how to find your passion as a writer and how students could get their thoughts published.
Wollman began her career interning at Rolling Stone magazine and was also the Broadway editor of Playbill.  Her first book, The Theater Will Rock: A History from Hair to Hedwig, based on her college dissertation, was published in 2006.
Currently, she is an Assistant Professor of Music in the Fine and Performing Arts Department at Baruch College at the City University of New York (CUNY).
When researching her first book, Wollman became intrigued with adult musicals that depicted incredibly intimate sexual songs and acts.
“As a writer, you never know when inspiration will hit and in what form,” she said on why she decided to write a book about a time when many musicals were pornographic in nature.  The topic became the theme of Wollman’s second book, Hard Times: The Adult Musical in 1970s New York City. Many of the “adult musicals” she wrote about in the book dealt with the sexual revolution, feminism and gay rights.  However, many of the off-Broadway plays, such as musical Hair and the long-running Oh! Calcutta! received mainstream successes, but others like Let My People Come were not as popular.
“While writing this book, I had to learn to deal with a particular brand of embarrassment,” said Wollman.
A piece of advice she gave was that as a writer, you sometimes have to reassure sources that you will respect their privacy.  As a writer, everything is a learning experience, especially when you are investigating something that you don’t understand or know much about.
“I have always been sort of a freak in my career choices,” said Wollman.  Her fascination with local New York theater, music and culture began in college when she was an English major and Music minor.  In graduate school, she studied ethnomusicology, which is “basically an anthropological approach to music.”
Wollman said that she always had a strong interest in music as a cultural force: how it functions in society, how music differs in other places, how it’s used in society, and the way people make music.  She recalled that these intellectual interests began with the death of John Lennon of the Beatles, when she was 11 years old.  She said she was curious as to why his death impacted the lives of so many people.
Additional advice she gave to the Post students was to find what interests you and what your passion is and then write about it.  As a writer, according to Wollman, you need to focus on what intrigues you and what you think is worth writing about even if other people disagree with you.  “My parents never wanted me to be a writer”, she added.
“I thought she was a great presenter. Almost theatrical in her delivery, yet very real,” said senior Journalism major, Anna Scheblein.
According to Matthew Applewhite, a senior Broadcasting major and Journalism minor, this was one of the top lectures that he has attended in the series.
“I really enjoyed her speech.  It was very entertaining and she was extremely honest in what she was saying,” said Sang Geun Yoon, a senior Journalism major. “I think her field of study was more interesting compared to others [lectures] and she gave valuable advice on how to write about your passion.”
While discussing her experiences writing her books, Wollman stated that the absolute best question to ask someone you are interviewing is for additional sources to contact.  She stressed that most of the time writers get other sources through word of mouth.  She applied her advice as a book author to the journalism students in the audience.  “As a journalist you shouldn’t shy away from everything,” said Wollman. “Strange things can present opportunity.”
For those interested in writing a book, Wollman spoke about the changing business of publishing.  The best way to get a publisher, she said, is to make a list of your dream publishers and send your book to each one.  She stressed the importance to constantly and consistently write because it will be easier to your particular voice.  “Her advice was real because she has gone through the process of publishing books and having to re-work so much of the stuff she wrote and love,” said Applewhite.
“I thought she gave a lot of insight into journalism and writing,” said Potoula Anagnostakos, a sophomore Journalism major.
According to Scheblein, the anecdotal stories Wollman used to share her experiences both as a student, a writer and as a professor were very insightful.
Through stories about the various experiences she has had as a writer, she informed the students that they could do it all.  “It was nice for a professional to acknowledge the hardships writers confront,” added Scheblein.
Wollman is currently working on an idea for another book, but she said that juggling family, students, teaching, and her writing can be difficult.  “When it’s time, just jump in and do it,” Wollman said.  “Things balance each other out and it doesn’t matter how long it takes you to finish a goal, as long as you finish it.”
Wollman’s speech was the final lecture of the semester in the Media Arts Department’s “Food For Thought” series.

Last week was this year’s highly anticipated and needed Spring Break. Students and faculty had the chance to take a break from school and relax. Some of us decided to stay at home and be with our families, while others seized the moment to travel. For me, the latter was true.
Having a family living on the other side of the world, Sweden to be more exact, going home was not an option. So I packed my bags and went to San Francisco, California, with my four best friends from school. This trip would not only give me lots of joy and good memories, it would also burst my bubble of the romantic San Francisco I had seen in the movies.
San Francisco is one of the top destinations for tourists, famous for its warm weather, rolling hills, eccentric architecture and liberal mindset. It’s hard to come by anyone who hasn’t heard of the Golden Gate Bridge or the former prison Alcatraz. Movies like Harvey Milk and Vertigo, or series like Full House and Dharma & Greg are all set in San Francisco. There is no doubt that this city attracts people from all walks of life.
My friends and I did all the must-do sightseeing, but also went beyond just the common tourist places. On our first day, we went to the piers to spend time at a market with authentic San Franciscans selling local art and cuisine. We got the chance to enjoy good food and mingle with the locals. The sunny weather brought a smile to everyone’s lips.
On another day, we rented bikes and rode through the Golden Gate Park all of the way to the very end of the park where you could spend time by the ocean. The view from Louie’s Diner at a cliff right by the sea was an amazing sight. The most memorable moment was when we bicycled through the park Land’s End and suddenly the fog cleared up in the distance and the majestic Golden Gate Bridge was suddenly visible. On a later date, we also got the chance to get closer to the bridge and take a million pictures by it, just like all the other tourists. For the locals, the sight of the tourists must have been amusing.
But it was not only the attractions that were exciting for us. The well-known hills that the city is located on were a sight in itself. Looking at these hills was mesmerizing, however, walking up and down, drove me crazy at times. I now understand why they have their famous streetcars.
However, despite San Francisco’s lively and colorful appearance, the city turned dark and scary sometimes. During our first hours in the concrete jungle, we saw an abundance of homeless people, most of them under the influence of different kinds of substances. While walking down one of the biggest streets, an older man in worn out clothes came up to as and asked how much we cost, and what he wanted to do with us. These kinds of suggestions and comments became a daily occurrence, and we all felt threatened at times. This not only became scary, but also ruined large parts of my trip. Since I am one of the most easily scared people, probably in the entire world, I had to build a human shield of my friends around me in order to not run away screaming. We always had to make sure to look over our shoulders and not walk on the “wrong” street.
But there were not only “crazy” homeless people. When sitting at a bench, looking over Oakland, we had a woman come up to us and sell us a paper made by the homeless community. She told us that instead of choosing the wrong path, she sells papers while trying to get by on the streets. I became so impressed by her that I bought the magazine and gave her some change.
After my six-day journey, I came home with new memories, and experiences, both good and bad. It was not at all as I expected. I failed to find the romantic little city I expected, but found a large city with diverse locals. It was sometimes breathtaking with the hills and views, but sometimes scary and frightful with screaming homeless people and sketchy streets. If you want to go to San Francisco, you have to be aware of where not to go, like the Tenderloin area, especially during nighttime. I am glad I went to California during Spring Break, but I feel oddly happy and safe being home in my city, New York.

In recent weeks a particular question was posed to me, ”Has dating died?” No, I would not say that dating has become extinct. However, I would say that traditional means of finding a date have most certainly changed. Gone are the days where a girl can go out with her friends, catch a guy’s eye, and then have him proceed to ask her out on a date.
The closest you can get to that happening these days, is the guy may come grab your name only to go home and stalk your Facebook or Twitter for a little while. Perhaps after that you’ll receive a Facebook message saying something slightly less than charming like, “Heyyy baby girl,” or, “So, you’re really hot.” Creepy messages like that are not exactly going to entice the female to want to talk to you. A simple, “Hey, I met you the other night at so-and-so place. How are you?” would get you a lot further in the dating department.
I feel as though our generation and the younger ones do not go out on a date to get to know one another. The two people may finally go out after a few weeks to a month of chatting via Facebook or maybe even texting; and no, not phone-calls, just texting. Picking up the phone to have an actual conversation with a new guy or girl seems to frighten today’s college students. It’s odd, because I feel as though these younger kids will never know the fear of calling their crushes house phone and having a parent pick up, the way it used to be when I started dating in high school.
Generic ways of meeting people have fallen to the wayside in place of social media and dating websites. Not only is it effecting the way people are dating but I also think it’s having an effect on the conversations people are having. You don’t just ask for people’s phone numbers and email addresses anymore, you ask for their Twitter handle, Facebook name, or Snapchat ID.
I met my boyfriend roaming the hallways of our high school. Back in the days when you had MySpace; Facebook was for college kids only. Seven years later, we still talk on the phone whenever we can instead of texting or Facebook messaging. Social media and dating sites have made the art of dating almost cold and impersonal.
So has dating actually died? Not exactly, but like everything else in the world, the Internet and social media have changed the dynamics and the rules. I encourage whoever is reading this to try meeting someone the “old-fashioned” way. Facebook stalking or texting is not required.

The Pioneer recently spoke with Paul Allender, lead guitarist for U.K. heavy metal band, Cradle of Filth. The bands tenth album, “The Manticore and Other Horrors,” released on October 30, entered the Billboard Top 200 at number 96 with its first-week sales last fall.
This month, Allender launched a contest through his business, Vomitorium Art Prints, offering fans the chance to win a PRS SE Paul Allender signature guitar and strings. Customers who purchase two Vomitorium Art Prints before March 28 will automatically be placed into the drawing.
On February 14, Cradle of Filth announced it was forced to cancel its headlining North American, “28 Days Closer to Hell Tour,” due to U.S. immigration issues. The tour would have marked the band’s first return to North American shores in nearly two years. No immediate plans to reschedule the dates have been revealed.
The “Manticore and Other Horrors” album can be ordered online via the Nuclear Blast web-store and digitally through iTunes. You can follow Allender on Twitter @AllenderPaul.
The Pioneer (TP): “The Manticore and Other Horrors” is Cradle of Filth’s tenth studio album. To what do you attribute the band’s continued success?  
Paul Allender (PA): Through hard work and perseverance. We are not stuck in one genre and don’t have tunnel vision where it comes to music.
TP: You composed all of the album’s new music. What inspires your compositions? 
PA: I have no particular inspirations. The way I create new music is I get a drumbeat, I play along with it to come up with riff ideas and it just develops from there.
TP: As lead guitarist, you are offering fans one-on-one online guitar lessons over Skype. How are they going, and what is this kind of interaction with fans like? 
PA: The guitar lessons are going very well. I have three students a day but some days are obviously busier than others. Interaction with fans is going good; they are respectful and they listen. Anyone interested in lessons can contact me paul@winterlandstudios.com for details. I give lessons from 30 minutes to 1 hour.
TP: What is your advice for college students who want to get ahead in the music industry? 
PA: Work hard and try to come up with something original. I also help with song writing, arranging and can assist with getting into the industry; contact me on email for more details.
TP: What’s next for you and Cradle of Filth? 
PA: As for Cradle of Filth, we are doing more touring, including Australia and the Far East. I have two more bands coming out, I’ll be teaching more guitar lessons and I will be putting more artwork up for sale. Feel free to come chat with me on my official Facebook page: facebook.com/officialpaulallender

The series “Sports You Did Not Know Existed” has finally reached my favorite of all unusual sports: Wife Carrying. Most of you would probably believe I am joking, but a few of you will look at this as an opportunity to take your hobby to a competitive level.
Men are often portrayed as more masculine and stronger than women…at least that’s the stereotype. We want to lift things all the time. We want to move the big tractor wheel in the back yard, and we love to help the old neighbor with the groceries even though she is more than capable of doing it herself. We lift everything we come across, and what do we do when we don’t have any thing to lift? Well, we start to carry our kids or even our wife. We carry them into bed, and carry the bride over the threshold when we get married. It is tradition and it is accepted. In Finland, the need to carry your wife has turned into a competitive, semi-professional sport. Sound crazy? Well, yes it is.
The objective is simple: the male carries the female around a special obstacle track in the fastest time. The International Wife Carrying Competition Rules Committee (yes there is such a thing) has set only a few guidelines for all official wife carrying competitions. The most important guidelines state that the track needs to include two dry obstacles and a water obstacle, and the participants need to have their own insurance.
There are no set rules on how the male needs to carry the female, just that the woman cannot touch the ground throughout the course. If the husband drops the wife, he is given a 15 second penalty, and unfortunately this happens all the time. That is why a helmet is required for all females in the competition. Piggyback, fireman’s carry (over the shoulder) and Estonian-style (the wife hangs upside-down with her legs around the husband’s shoulders, holding onto his waist) are the most popular ways for the husband to get her wife over the obstacles, and the best carriers often have well-developed strategies for what style is the best for the upcoming event.
Estonian-style is named after the country that has won the last 11 consecutive World Championships in the beginning of this millennium. The last few years we have seen a change in the hierarchy. Finland has taken over the throne as Taisto Miettinen and Kristiina Haapanen have won the last four years. Are they married? Surprisingly not. There are no rules stating you have to be married, or in any way related to the women you are carrying, but you do need a written consent.
It is not only the Baltic and north European countries who are strong wife carrying nations. Australia, Hong Kong and India are all nations who have their own national championships every year. The North American Wife Carrying Championships take place every year on Columbus Day Weekend in October at Sunday River Ski Resort in Newry, Maine. You can sign up when you arrive.
There is no official wife carrying occurring in New York, but if you want to compete among the best in Sonkajärvi, Finland, the competition is open for everybody. The price to participate is 50 Euros and the World Champions take home the wife’s weight in beer. Tempting for many redneck Americans.
If you do decide to book your tickets to Finland to participate in this year’s World Championships, make sure you prepare. Pick your partner up and carry her around as much as possible, up and down the stairs, to the supermarket and while walking the dog. Just make sure you tell your neighbors before you begin carrying a woman around, especially if it’s not your wife…

Going to the gym is not the most flattering activity. During your workout, you become hot, sweaty and smelly. Sound attractive? No, but these are not excuses for not looking trendy at the gym. Putting together fashionable gym looks are quick and easy.
When going to the gym, always take off your makeup. Yes, you are most likely going to run into people you know. So what? A clean fresh face is better looking than a face with running makeup. If you must have some sort of makeup with you, try Burt’s Bees Beeswax, a chap stick that comes in many different shades. This is a better alternative since it is not a lipstick that ends up smearing. It costs $2.99 and it can be found at local drugstores.
Do not go to the gym with your hair down as if you are going out to dinner. When you are working out, it is always best to keep your hair tied back. There are many different gym hairstyles. You can slick your hair up in a tight ponytail or a bun. You can put it in a low braid, a fishtail braid and a low bun. You can throw on a cute headband or clips to add to your look.
Ditch the basketball shorts and supper baggy tee shirts. Instead, opt for clothing designed for the gym. Many different brands carry spandex pants, leggings and shorts. Some brands are Under Armor, Lululemon and Adidas. They come in a ton of different colors and designs. These brands also have many different styled tops as well. You can choose from tank tops, tee shirts, halters and so much more. Gym pants like these will keep you comfortable at the gym, while looking good.
Sophomore journalism major, Potoula Anagnostakos, explained that she likes to wear work out gear because she feels it is easier to move around in. “I wouldn’t wear baggy clothes to the gym because it could get caught in the equipment,” she added.
Senior journalism major, Genna Apfel, said that she prefers wearing spandex or yoga pants from Victoria’s Secret and a t-shirt. “I still feel like I need to dress fashionable to an extent when I work out but I don’t go crazy doing my hair or putting on makeup,” said Apfel.
Sneakers are the only type of shoe you should wear to the gym. Why not have fun with it? Brands like Nike, Adidas and Sacuony have huge colorful selections. Be bold. Choosing a bright sneaker can add to any gym outfit. If you are not into the colorful sneaker option, then choose a subtle color and play around with your color choices in your outfits.
The gym may not be the most fashionable place, but when you look good, you feel good. There is no reason you cannot put together a stylish workout look.

Wednesday, March 6, was the Red Flag Campaign’s 6th annual “Break the Silence” campaign in Hillwood Cinema. The event was cosponsored by The Runway, LAWS, MRAW&WARM, Lambda Pi Chair Sorority Incorporated, Masters of Social Work Club, Social Work Club, ACP, and Student Counseling Services. The focus for the night was how students, male and female, can lower their risk of sexual assault and date or acquaintance rape. The informative and heart-breaking presentation featured alumni stories, and tips for safety from campus professionals as well as outside sources. Just about every seat in the cinema was filled with students, faculty and staff.
Sarah Boles, a Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW) initiated the presentation. She asked questions about the students’ awareness of red flags and described what the campaign is. “The Red Flag Campaign is a public awareness campaign designed to promote awareness and prevention of verbal, emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse on college campuses,” she said.
Following Boles was Yanira Ildefonso, a 2010 LIU Post alumnus. Ildefonso was the President of the Rainbow Alliance Club at Post as a proud and open lesbian. She roamed the campus with acceptance for all and a mission to complete her studies. During the fall of her junior year, Ildefonso had gone to a party off campus with several of her friends. She did not know the other people in attendance, but mingled and met a friend’s acquaintance named Victor. “It took me a year and a half to publicly speak about my situation, let alone say Victor’s name simply because I could not stop myself from crying,” said Ildefonso. Prior to leaving the party, she went to the bathroom only to find Victor standing in front of the door waiting for her to come out. He claimed that a movie was being played in the other room and that her friends were also there….unfortunately she went with him. Ildefonso described the setting as such: “The lights were off and all I could see was a bed, there was no television and the room was empty; I knew I was in trouble.” Gasping, Ildefonso paused before she said, “he pulled out a knife and told me “I’m going to show you, you are not gay.”
As anyone would after being assaulted, all Ildefonso wanted to do was go home and forget. She could not bear to think about the trauma she had gone through and was numb, nervous and shocked. Instead of directly telling her friends what had happened, she told them she was tired and just wanted to go home. A few weeks later, Ildefonso begun experiencing morning sickness and rushed to the doctor only to find out that she was pregnant. Ildefonso said, “The only professional I told at first was the nurse, Sylvia, that examined me that day. Besides her, everyone else, especially family, treated me as though I went out looking to get pregnant.” Several months of trials and tribulations, moving from family member to family member ended when she had her daughter Liliana on June 16, 2009.
Even after her daughter was born, Ildefonso made it her mission to complete college. “I woke up at 5 a.m. every morning; I got on the train and dropped Lily to her sitter’s in Manhattan, got on the 4 train, 7 train and the N20 and made sure I got to class every day,” Ildefonso said, describing her daily routine. With dedication and determination, she graduated in May 2010 as she planned. “To all the people that think they will not be targeted for their clothing style, popularity statuses, or sexual orientation, just know it can happen to anyone,” Ildefonso warned the students as she exited the stage.
Later, Post parent, Diane Calise, led a Find Your Courage at LIU Post presentation.  Calise, a Library Media Information and Research teacher at Half Hollow Hills High School and Sensei at Ryu Te Do Martial Fitness Academy, informed students and faculty about campus facilities that can be utilized in case of emergency. She provided information about LIU’s counseling services and the number to contact Public Safety. “The Line,” a clip that she showed, represented an elevating verbal abuse session between a boyfriend and girlfriend on the phone. After the clip, she asked the audience to participate in some self-defense exercises. Calise offered security options, including self-defense lessons, the ability to say no, pepper spray, and the Dusk Scream Alarm. The Dusk Scream Alarm is a new invention that when activated lets out an extremely loud shriek to draw attention to anyone in danger. The product can be purchased at www.dailygrommet.com.
Kimberly Sanchez, a social worker from Bellevue Hospital who works with victims, took the stage next. “I took on abuse cases because of a volunteer experience with a rape advocate I had during college. Once I took on that case I felt it was where I needed to be in the world.” She informed the audience of the difference between acquaintance, stranger, and date rape. Sanchez told the students and faculty that “over 75% of rape cases are acquaintance rapes and about 60% of college rapes occur in residence halls.” This information shocked those in attendance, who were unaware that friends attack more frequently than strangers do.
Each ticket, free of charge, acted as a raffle ticket for the attendees.  Several raffle items were given out at the end of the program for iTunes, cinemas, and restaurants, but the big prize was a 32” LED flat screen television. The lucky winner of the television was freshman Chemistry major, Kaiyi Lei, who said “I am so happy for this new TV, thank you all for the opportunity.”
Senior Criminal Justice major and Sigma Delta Phi Epsilon fraternity brother, Shaun Jackson, said “I’m sure students know about red flags, but they still need to be reminded of the possibilities. Junior Broadcasting major and Lambda Pi Chai Sorority sister, Natalie Villanueva, was surprised about the ratio of students that were not aware of red flags on campus. She believes that “everyone should take into thought that anything can happen.”

Twenty-five years after “The Phantom of the Opera” opened at the Majestic Theater in 1988, it has become Broadway’s longest running musical.
“The Phantom of the Opera” is about a beautiful young opera singer, Christine Daae, who stars in an opera production after a stage accident led the original lead singer to quit at last minute. After the show, Christine is reunited with her childhood sweetheart Raoul until a mysterious Phantom appears. Though the Phantom’s face is deformed, he looks for true love, which he finds in Christine. The show follows the Phantom’s desperate attempt to win her heart.
The production, written by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1986, originated in England, and is based on a novel by Gaston Leroux. Due to its major success on the West End, it came to Broadway two years later.
A major twenty-fifth anniversary event included having superstar Sierra Boggess perform at the Majestic Theatre as Christine from January 21 to March 2. Boggess first played Christine in the 2006 musical, “Phantom – The Las Vegas Spectacular.” In October 2011, Boggess performed in three special filmed performances at the Royal Albert Hall in England. She also starred in the 2010 sequel musical, “Love Never Dies,” which follows the lovable characters ten years later. Boggess is considered by Broadway critics as one of the most famous actresses to ever play the role of Christine.
Since 2010, veteran actor Hugh Panaro stars as the lead role of the Phantom. After 14 years of playing the Phantom on and off, Panaro gives a convincing portrayal of a tortured mad man with a desire to be more than just a monster. He makes the audience fear him at certain moments and also sympathize with him as he realizes simply training Christine to sing is not enough to gain her affection.
“The Phantom of the Opera” is a funny, entertaining, dark and clever production. Boggess was enjoyable on Broadway. Her singing was flawless, making each audience member fall more in love with the character. It is easy to see why the show is still in high demand after 25 years on Broadway.

Hillwood Commons is the place many Post students flock to during common hour. By common hour, you have most likely already sat through at least two morning classes and are starving. If the sight of long lines at the Cafe and Subway do not appeal to you, there are many alternatives for lunch.
LIU Post offers a break from 12:20 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., when classes are not supposed to be scheduled. This gives students enough time to venture off-campus for their lunch break.   Some students have mixed feelings about staying on campus for lunch. They are forced to eat what is available in Hillwood or bring food from home. Off-campus lunches provide students with the opportunity to try a variety of foods each day rather than having the same lunches day after day.
It is not news that buying lunch, both on or off campus, may be expensive. “I generally leave campus for lunch, but I do live close enough that I can go home,” said Mark Ermmarino, a sophomore Criminal Justice major. “Whether it’s buying lunch in Hillwood or off-campus, the lunch break can be expensive but I would rather pay for food that is better than what’s in Hillwood.”
Prices in Hillwood Commons are generally expensive and can cost just as much as going out to eat.  The campus has many commuter students who travel in packs to Hillwood to spend their break. The lines in Hillwood are continuous. You wait on line to get your food and then you wait on line to pay for your food.  Once you paid for your food, you have to basically fight for a table to sit and eat.
Dorm students have the option of eating at either Hillwood or Winnick. Commuter students only have one on-campus dining option.
“I always leave campus for lunch. The lines are too long and as a commuter, you just sometimes need a break to clear your head,” said Christina Sbarro, senior Public Relations major.
The roots of off-campus lunches lie in the desire for students to take a break from their daily scholastic life and have the feeling of freedom for a short time. Whether you commute or dorm, sometimes leaving the campus surroundings can cause a new burst of energy and creativity. It can be a long day if you are confined to campus.
The top places to go during break seem to be the closest, anywhere from a 10 to 15 minute drive from campus. The Wheatley Plaza Shopping Center located where Glen Cove Road meets Northern Boulevard has a few dining options. There is a Starbucks and also two restaurants: Ben’s Kosher Deli, which has many lunch special options, and Bar Frites Restaurant, which is expensive and always crowded around lunch time.
On 6255 Northern Boulevard, East Norwich, students have two dining options.  Messina Market is a gourmet deli that has everything from omelets and sandwiches to burgers and pasta. The food is excellent, but it is expensive. Red Tomato pizzeria is located next door and serves typical Italian food and personal-sized pizza.
“I always leave campus for pizza, it’s my favorite food,” said Michelle Morey, a junior Journalism major. “The pizza in Hillwood oddly doesn’t taste anything like pizza.”
If students are looking to get an actual pizza pie, they can travel a little farther into Oyster Bay for Marios’s pizzeria located on 253 Pine Hollow Road, where a regular pie is $13.75.  Abeetza Pizza, located at 86 Glen Cove Road in Greenvale, has authentic Italian pizza and homemade pasta, a regular pizza is $14.25. Another option is Lontza Pizza located at 38 Glen Cove Road in Greenvale, which has many student and lunch specials. Students can also get coupons from inside issues of The Pioneer. These pizzerias are in the normal price range.
Kitchen Kabaret is another option for students; it is a gourmet deli roughly 15 minutes from campus, on Glen Cove Road, near the entrance to the Long Island Expressway. It offers a 10 percent discount with a college ID. If you are in the mood for Chinese, try Hunan Taste, which is directly across the street from Burger King on Northern Boulevard and has a special lunch menu from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
“My personal favorite place to go is Bar Frites or Messina Market,” said Matthew Applewhite, a senior Broadcasting major and Journalism minor. “I sometimes will even leave campus to grab Starbucks just because the lines in Hillwood Commons are so slow.”
If students choose to stay on campus, they do have options, which range from the more standard cafeterias to food-court-style dining to grab-and-go conveniences in the snack machines. Hillwood has broadened its dining offerings to suit more students’ preferences. LIU Post has also made the effort to accommodate dietary restrictions by incorporating vegetarian and vegan options, kosher and ethnic food.  The campus also has franchise eateries like Subway and, of course, Starbucks.
Even if you do not have a car, a shuttle from the campus Chapel does run to Pathmark in the Wheatley Plaza shopping center in Greenvale. The problem is the shuttle schedule. The shuttle runs every hour. Therefore, taking the shuttle at 2 p.m. would make a student late for an afternoon class.
Talia Charlton, a junior Journalism major, who dorms on campus, said. “I do not have a car on campus, but the shuttle takes long and only comes every hour or so. If you miss a shuttle, you are stranded for another hour. It’s just not worth it to leave campus when you don’t have a car—unless you have a friend who is willing to drive.”
“I always leave campus with my group of friends. We will go and meet up with our friends that go to other schools,” said Jason Kanyike, a junior Psychology major and Journalism minor. “I think common hour is super helpful because you can either do some homework or socialize for a bit.”
Lunch off-campus does also present the opportunity for students to put away their schoolbooks and meet up with friends to have a carefree hour. Just make sure to return to campus for afternoon classes.

As spring break ends, winter officially turns into spring. What better way to welcome warmer weather, tree buds opening and finally having hung your winter jacket in the closet, than spending the first spring days in New York City? Here are four budget-friendly spring activity suggestions that are great for a weekend excursion.
Rent a Bike in Central Park:
The world-famous Central Park, located between the Upper West and Upper East Sides, is huge. Why not explore the park by bike?
Renting a bike is a great opportunity to enjoy the scenery in the park at your own pace. In addition, it is ideal to visit many famous spots in less time than it would take on foot. Make sure to include the Conservatory Garden, the Belvedere Castle, the Jackie Onassis Reservoir and the Bow Bridge, to name a few.
There is a basket included in Central Park’s official bike rental, so it is convenient to buy food or bring a homemade lunch and then sit down for a picnic at the location of your choice. Why not join many other picnickers on the Great Lawn located in the middle of the park, behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If arriving by subway, get off at 86th Street on subway trains 4, 5 or 6.
The official Central Park bike rental is located at 1710 Broadway. You can reserve the bike 24 hours prior by calling (347) 871-4499. One hour costs $15, add an extra $5 for two hours or choose a whole-day rental for $40. The price includes a helmet, a map, a lock and, as mentioned, a basket.
Bring Your Books to Bryant Park:
During spring, Bryant Park transforms from an ice-skating rink to a big, green lawn surrounded by French-style tables and chairs where people can sit down for coffee, conversation and even studying. It is located between Fifth and Sixth Avenue and 40th and 42nd Streets in Midtown. You can get off at Bryant Park/ 42nd Street subway station with B, D, F or M subway lines.
Bryant Park offers free wireless internet, which is a great benefit if looking to combine a spring day in the sun with catching up on your coursework. Multiple coffee shops, including Starbucks and Le Pain Quotidien, surround the park. You can buy something to drink or eat and bring it with you to the table.
One might imagine that the location in the middle of the city might be noisy, crowded and inappropriate for reading, but surrounded by skyscrapers, Bryant Park feels more like a peaceful and colorful oasis.
Whenever you need a break from too much studying, relax with some of the park games that are offered. On 40th Street Plaza, a new games area has lawn and tabletop games for no charge. Scrabble, Chinese Chess and Kubb are just some of the games and activities from which to choose.
Ice Cream in Washington Square:
On Fifth Avenue Waverly Place and West Fourth Street and MacDougal Street lies Washington Square Park, a 9.75-acre large gathering spot for avant-garde artists, tourists, students, dog-owners and anyone who enjoys spending time outdoors. In fact, there is so much to look at here that a short stroll through the park could easily end up lasting hours.
There are many restaurants, coffee shops and venues surrounding the park where you can buy ice cream or frozen yogurt. Try Popbar, located at 5 Carmine Street, which offers “ice cream on a stick” and a wide selection of popsicles in multiple flavors and colors. Why not treat yourself to this season’s first ice cream and then sit down by the large fountain, which faces the grand marble arch donated to the park in 1895 for George Washington’s inauguration.
Make sure to turn your head from left to right and then back again. You will not be surprised if there is a man fearlessly mastering a unicycle, a woman professionally juggling with beer-bottles, a break dance group from Brooklyn performing their latest number to pumping music or a street artist preparing a comical drawing of a couple in love.
Then, of course, there are hundreds of dogs and their owners. Washington Square is a popular spot for dog walking. During weekends, there are also markets where one can buy or look at everything from clothes and books to food.
A Stroll on the Highline:
In 1999, community residents of Manhattan rebuilt what used to be an old freight rail line located 30 feet above street level into a public park known as the Highline. Today, it is a pathway that stretches from Gansevoort Street to West 30th Street on the Lower West Side.
There are multiple access points to the Highline, including West 18th Street, 23rd Street and 28 Street. Visit www.thehighline.org for more information. During the winter, parts of the Highline close due to maintenance, but as spring approaches, visitors return.
Highline is the ultimate place to take a stroll with friends, go for a jog or power walk or simply relax while people watching. The largest benefit is that a day on the Highline is entirely free. It is also not as crowded as many other Manhattan must-see destinations. Do not miss bringing your friends or perhaps a good book to the green lawn on 23rd Street. The lawn area is ideal for picnics or relaxing in the sun. There are also wooden benches and sun chairs located along the pathway where one can sit or lie down to take in the view of the Hudson River and the New Jersey skyline. And of course, remember to look at the old rails and the beautiful plants and trees that now cover large parts of it.
With these four suggestions to choose from, get on the train to Manhattan to enjoy the first days of spring to the fullest!

Junior attacker Jackie Sileo tied an NCAA Division II Career assists record on Saturday, March 16, tallying her 204th assist as the Pioneers women’s lacrosse team crushed Holy Family University 22-6.
Sileo finished the game with 12 points (4 goals, 8 assists). Senior attacker/midfielder Ashley Olen scored a game-high five goals and contributed two assists. Junior midfielder Samantha Losco had four goals of her own and junior attacker Morgan Chiarenza recorded a hat trick and an assist.
The Pioneers quickly jumped on the offensive to start the game. Sileo tallied her first goal of the contest at the 26:56 mark to give Post the 1-0 lead. Less than two minutes later Losco scored unassisted to give her squad the two goal advantage. Junior midfielder Marissa Lawson scored several minutes later for Holy Family to cut the Pioneer lead to one, but Losco and Sileo quickly made it 4-1 with back-to-back goals. Chiarenza scored a goal at 16:54 to make it 5-1.
Junior attacker Brigit LaRose scored for Holy Family to make it 5-2 with 16:13 left in the first half, but the Pioneers added three more goals to extend their lead.
Holy Family scored two more goals in the half, but the Pioneers added another six goals of their own before halftime to take a commanding 14-4 lead over their opponent.
The second half was the same kind of game for the Pioneers. An early goal by senior attacker Ashley Olen began another offensive surge for LIU Post. The Pioneers securred two more goals before Holy Family scored their first of the half at the 18:26 mark.  The Pioneers recorded another four goals after that to make the score 21-5. Sophomore midfielder Jenna Pierro’s goal at the 9:22 mark was the moment Sileo recorded her record-setting assist.
Holy Family and the Pioneers each got one final goal to round out the game and reach the final score of 22-6.
LIU Post outshot Holy Family 31-12 in the contest and dominated the draw controls 19-10.
The win helped preserve the Pioneers perfect record through their first five games of the season. To date they’ve defeated Saint Anselm College, Philadelphia University, Southern New Hampshire and the University of New Haven.
They will play their first East Coast Conference game of the year today when they host Dowling College at 4 p.m.

As the seasons change from winter to spring, so does our apparel. The spring eases the transition from the extreme cold to the summer heat, but sometimes it’s hard to figure out what clothes to wear in-between.
For shoes, you can soon replace your warm, fuzzy boots with flats. These, along with being a comfortable choice and keeping your toes warm, don’t look like you’re jumping into a summer state of mind just yet. They provide a great transition and are practical yet fashionable. My recommended flats are Sperry’s. They have stability in their soles, a wide variety of options to fit your individual style, and are trendy no matter which shoe you strut. Not to mention, they have both a women and men’s line!
As far as pants go, that’s easy! More options become available as the season changes, giving us the opportunity to dust off our cropped denim and take them for a spin. If you’re looking for a good quality pair this year, Abercrombie & Fitch is your go-to store! The skinny ankle jeans are a perfect example of cropped transition jeans, leaving space between your ankle and calf. This space is both comfortable and fashionable during the spring, giving your leg air to breathe, as well as focusing more attention on your shoes. Why not get as much attention you can for the prices you paid?
Shirt selections are a bit trickier. A lot of people don’t know whether they should go for the short sleeves and risk being a little cold, or the long sleeves with a chance of being too hot. I usually find a medium between the two; instead of picking one or the other, I’ll pair a short sleeve/tank top with a cardigan or zip-up, leaving me the option of both. It’s the best of both worlds! Is the AC too high in class? No problem, you remembered your cardigan. The same goes for guys. Pair your t-shirts with a casual hoodie or zip-up. This gives you on-the-go options, and can ensure your comfort no matter the weather. Rummage through your shirts from last summer, because these are often the best choice when it comes to the following spring (especially when you’re saving up your money for new summer clothes)!
Ladies, don’t forget you can accessorize your spring-transition selections with a light scarf. These add style to your outfit but aren’t designed to keep your neck warm in winter weather.
The transition from winter to spring often happens without warning, so make sure you’re prepared; don’t leave your shopping for the last minute because you’ll be stuck wearing apparel that’s either too hot or too cold. Check out discount stores such as TJ Maxx or Century 21 for good deals on your clothing. These stores usually have an abundance of discounted brand names. Next time, be sure to visit your favorite stores while the winter is still at its peak. Sales for winter vacation at warm locations are often discovered and this provides cheaper buys for the same style clothes you will get once spring and summer roll around.

College students who dorm on campus have made a new home for themselves, one they presume is equipped with wireless Internet connection. However, because of housing infrastructure and cost of wireless devices, there isn’t any Wi-Fi in student dorm rooms at Post.
The residential halls are constructed in a traditional way with concrete walls in order to protect the building from the elements. However, these concrete walls are not so conducive to wireless router signals, creating challenges for the University when it comes to providing students Wi-Fi in their dorms, according to Nancy Marksbury, the deputy chief information officer for Information Technology (IT).
“Access points that generate the Wi-Fi signal are blocked by the construction of the building,” said Marksbury.
Marksbury explained that while most residential routers are relatively inexpensive, an enterprise-grade infrastructure (programs that ensure certified products meet performance requirements applications) that supports the dorms wireless Internet network costs $700-$1,200 per device. The cost of these devices is one of the reasons why the dorms don’t have Wi-Fi.
The University has done testing of various configurations of Wi-Fi coverage, and has found that a single access point for every third room is required to provide sufficient signal. “This represents a significant financial investment for the campus we have not yet been able to fund,” she said.
Students often ask why they can’t simply bring a router from home. “Since we don’t have Wi-Fi in the dorms we need to use an Ethernet cord, since we aren’t allowed to bring our own Wi-Fi connection,” said junior Public Relations major, Alyssa Yanuzzi, who dorms in Riggs Hall with one other roommate. “My friend tried to bring in her own router and had it taken away,” she added.
Some dorm rooms only have one Ethernet cord for the students to connect with. There can be up to four students in one room, according to Yanuzzi. She has one cord in her dorm and the length of the cord, Yanuzzi says, determines how far you can move your laptop once connected.
Some students, according to Marksbury, bring their own routers but this creates problems. “These brought-from-home routers tend to mirror the Internet protocol address of a nearby device, and we have seen this mirroring corrupt an entire floor or building,” she said.
“Students can purchase Ethernet cords for about $15,” said junior Broadcasting major Vaughn Allen, who lives in Nassau Hall. He explained that this might be necessary if students wanted to do their homework in their dorm and find they need a cord.
For those that are unable to obtain an Ethernet cord, “students can go to the second floor of Nassau Hall to the lounge where there is free Wi-Fi connection,” Allen added.
In addition to exploring access point reach, IT has also worked with the Office of Residence Life to establish mini computer lounges in several of the residence halls. These mini lounges are equipped with 2-4 desktop computers and these rooms do have wireless accessibility.  In addition to the Ethernet connections in the dorms, each residence hall lobby also has a wireless Internet signal.
“Wi-Fi availability throughout the campus has been a priority for Information Technology, and specifically, Wi-Fi in the residence halls is something we all wish to accomplish,” said Marksbury. The IT staff is interested in meeting with a student-empaneled group to explore the possibilities of bringing Wi-Fi to the dorms.

The women’s basketball team played its final game of the season as it lost 68-57 to Bentley University in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday, March 15. Falcons’ forward Lauren Battista created matchup problems all night long for the Lady Pioneers as she had a game-high 27 points on 12-17 shooting from the floor.
The Falcons, a number one seed, made their record 30th appearance in the NCAA Division II Tournament and brought a 28-1 overall season record into the game. In addition, they had not lost any of their 16 home games this year and boasted a 26-game home winning streak. To top it off, the Falcons entered the contest as the third-ranked team in the entire country.
The Lady Pioneers, the eighth seed, gave Bentley a run for their money as the score at the half was 31-29 in favor of the Falcons. However, to open up the first two minutes of play in the second half the Falcons went on an 8-2 run. Battista scored six quick points and junior guard Christiana Bakolas also added two points to put the pressure on LIU Post.
The closest the Lady Pioneers were able to cut the deficit for the rest of the game was with about 11:30 left to play in regulation as Bentley led 45-43. The Falcons proved why they are such an elite team as time and time again they made clutch shots. The Falcons made quick, crisp, clean passes during the game and found the open on multiple occasions to hurt the Lady Pioneers’ chances of making a run late in the game.
The Lady Pioneers stayed competitive in the game due to the strong performance of senior center Samantha Kopp. She finished with 19 points on an efficient 7-11 shooting display from the field. Kopp also nailed both of her attempts from beyond the arc and grabbed eight rebounds. No other Lady Pioneer finished in double-figure points.
Sophomore guard Chelsea Williams finished with nine points and four rebounds. Senior forward Nicolette Marciniak had a difficult time getting into rhythm during the game as she finished with eight points, three rebounds and four assists. Junior guard Alexis Peters finished with seven points and hauled in four rebounds. All three of these players finished with fewer points than their season averages.
The Lady Pioneers stayed tough and hung around with the Falcons. In the final statistics, the two sides finished almost identical in several categories. Both teams were excellent from three-point range: LIU Post was 46 percent, while Bentley was 44 percent. The Lady Pioneers took control of the offensive glass (13-8) and won the overall rebounding battle (33-29). Entering the game, the Lady Pioneers had an 18-3 record when winning the battle of the boards. The Falcons still found a way to win despite LIU Post edging out that category.
Another similarity between the two teams was the turnovers. The Falcons committed 20 turnovers, while the Lady Pioneers ended with 22 turnovers, one more than their season average.
The Falcons only held a noticeable advantage with eight more points in the paint (36-28), as well as a better field goal percentage. The Falcons converted 53 percent of their baskets, while the Lady Pioneers shot only 43 percent from the floor.
With the loss, it puts an end to a 19-10 season for the Lady Pioneers. This year marks the third consecutive season that the Lady Pioneers have made it to the NCAA Tournament. However, they have been eliminated in the first round in each of the past three years.
The Lady Pioneers have three seniors that will no longer be on the team next season. Forward Nicolette Marciniak, center Samantha Kopp, and guard Ashley Caggiano. All three played crucial roles during their time at LIU Post.
Marciniak was an East Coast Conference All Conference First Team Selection as she averaged 13.6 points and 9.3 rebounds for the season. Kopp was close to averaging a double-double for the campaign with 8.2 points and 8.4 rebounds. Caggiano led the ECC with a 42.4 percent clip from beyond the arc. She averaged 7.6 points, 2.3 rebounds and 3.0 assists.

Witty jokes, exploding cars and ridiculous action sequences are just what you expect from the fifth installment of the “Die Hard” series. Once again, in “A Good Day to Die Hard,” which opened on February 13, we join John McLane (Bruce Willis) in a movie where the point is nothing more than to blow stuff up.
For the first time, John McLane, a New York City cop, finds himself on an international stage in Moscow. “A Good Day to Die Hard” introduces McClane’s estranged son Jack, an apple who has not fallen far from the tree and who may even be more of a hard-ass than his father is. John and Jack must put aside their personal and professional differences, and work together to keep each other alive and stop the Moscow underworld from controlling nuclear weapons.
This 98-minute movie starts immediately with a high-speed chase. There are no limitations when it comes to weapons, explosions and a general disregard for human life. Despite the fact that the first “Die Hard” movie was released in 1988, this sequel to the franchise still hit number one in the box office. “A Good Day to Die Hard” does not stand out from the crowd of action movies. There were some funny jokes, good action sequences and the classic “yippee-kay-a” catchphrase.
Even though the majority of the movie was pretty predictable, it was fun to watch. After all, how much more could we really expect from a five-movie action series? It is a good date night movie and an enjoyable addition to a classic series.

We’re halfway through March, which means halfway through the spring semester, and it’s time to figure out where we are with our grades. At this point, it’s now or never; students have to make a choice whether they’re satisfied or not, and then fix the problem, if there is one. If we wait for much longer, it’s going to be too late. However, this is easier said than done. Many students tend to fall behind at this time of the year, and summer break seems to be too far away. It’s hard to find motivation, and a lack of motivation equals a lack of energy and a lack of enthusiasm.
If you’re falling behind, is it ok to ask your professors for help? Yes, of course it is, and you absolutely should. They usually know how to help you if you tell them about your struggles, and you should therefore talk it out with them, and try to set up a plan for how to succeed. If you still need help after this, form a study group. It’s always easier to work with others in the same situation, and a group of people can be motivating. I know I prefer to study with somebody than by myself. Yes, you can get distracted, but it’s a good kind of distraction because you’re being social. Also, someone might see things differently than you, which could inspire you.
However, if you get too distracted in a study group, then a tutor might be the correct answer. You’re sitting with only one other person who wants you to understand and to focus, and he or she doesn’t care about other not-school-related things in your life (usually). Contact the Learning Support Center at 516-299-3057 for more information about tutoring services.
If you like to do things yourself, then all you have to do is to refocus. Start over again, and plan your days. Write down important messages or tasks, and tell yourself to study every day, and then take the weekends off. Find something that motivates you. You could, for instance, tell yourself that if you manage to study well this week, then you’re going to go buy that dress or video game you’ve been wanting for so long. The library hours are Monday through Thursday, 8 AM – 11 PM, Friday, 8 AM – 5 PM, Saturday, 8 AM – 5 PM and Sunday, 12 noon – 8 PM. Or you could take your homework to the Hillwood study lounge or the study lounge in your dorm building.
“Since I’m a senior, I can feel myself tapering off. But what is keeping me motivated is the fact that I’m graduating in less than two months,” said senior Biology major, Hailey Brosnan.
“Well, I’m in my last semester and have been feeling ‘senioritis.’ When I’m falling behind, I make a list of all upcoming due dates, quizzes, and tests and so on. Once I’ve made a list, I tackle one thing at a time and try not to get overwhelmed. Also, working on campus, at the library, seems to help me get school work done,” said senior Radiology major, Kimberly Lynne.
Finals begin on May 3. Don’t fall behind! Tell yourself that you can do this and find a way to succeed that works for you.

LIU Post scheduled Hickox Field to be renovated by July 1. However, as of March, the restorations have been postponed due to zoning regulations.  The university is currently awaiting clearance.
“We were hoping the renovations would be starting by now, but we are awaiting permits,” said LIU Post Provost, Paul Forestell.
Before beginning construction, LIU Post has to have approval from the zoning board of the village of Old Brookville. The university submitted a 25-page plan to the Village of Brookville’s Building Department on August 23, 2012.
The village, according to Forestell, is concerned with the noise parameter and height requirements of the project. The village has a height restriction of approximately 32 feet, and the bleachers in the Hickox Field improvement plan exceed the limit by 10 feet. In order to go through with the plan, Post needs to be awarded variance by the village, which is causing the delay in the renovations.
Bryan Collins, athletic director and football coach at Post, said that the village seems most concerned about the noise that will come from the new loudspeakers; however, he added that they are not going to be louder than the ones currently in place. If Post doesn’t receive variance for the height requirement, Collins said they might have to remove the top few rows on the bleachers.
Representatives from Post have been appearing at the village meetings in attempt to speed up the process in getting the permits, said Forstell. These representatives are from the University Council; Jim Murphy, attorney for Post, and William Kirker, facilities services according to Collins.
“There was a need to renovate the stands since I became provost in 2008,” Forstell said. He said that the stands are old, unattractive and unsafe.
The bleachers on the far side of the field, according to Collins, were original bleachers from the first football field on the campus in 1950. The location of the field moved since then, but the bleachers were transported.
“These bleachers [on the opposite side of the field] are from 1965, the understructure and the cement footing and the rusted steel that is underneath obviously becomes a safety issue that we are extremely concerned about. Also, the codes of what bleachers should be are not up to standards,” Collins said. He adds that the only reason that the bleachers are still standing is because they were grandfathered in.
Besides the age of the bleachers, according to Collins, they are also unsafe due to the open spaces underneath the seats where fans could fall and get hurt. In addition, there is no handicap access and they are uncomfortable for fans to sit on for the duration of a game, he added.
The renovation plans would provide new fencing and concrete around the perimeter of the field, draining systems, bathrooms, a loudspeaker system and a press box. There would also be three sections in the new bleachers that will have backs on the chairs. Additionally, the bleachers will be wheelchair accessible for the first time.
Some students and faculty at Post are showing positive feelings toward the idea of renovating the field, despite the delay in construction.
“I support any improvement at Post,” said Harry Wittig, staff member at the Information Technology office, referencing how much he liked the recent improvements made to the Hillwood Café.
Similarly, Bridgett Soares, senior lacrosse player, said, “It’ll be nicer, nicer seats, so I guess more people would come. When you think about that you have to think about the different sports. For our sport, I don’t think it would really matter, but for football maybe a little more.”
Collins agrees that the renovations will likely improve the audience size and atmosphere at games in the athletic stadium. “There is an excitement when there’s a new facility. People want to go some place and have a comfortable seat,” added Collins.
The expected duration of construction, according to Collins, was four months. William Kirker, head of the Facilities Department, declined to comment about the construction and directed the Pioneer to Rita Langdon of the Public Relations Department. Langdon has not responded to the Pioneer’s request for the name of the contractor. Although Collins suggested that there might already be a company chosen to renovate the fields, Forestell said that it’s not finalized yet.
The Athletic Department has raised about $2 million so far to pay for the renovations of the stadium through the use of a fundraising campaign. However, the total cost of the renovations is estimated to be $4 million. Many of the donors, according to Collins, were football alumni. Some members of the community bought a brick, which costs $500 a piece. The university agreed to help pay for the field by matching the amount of money the athletic department earned.
The naming rights of the field are still yet to be bought. Forestell said that there are a few prospects that the university is working with; however, they have not found someone yet. The naming rights are being sold for $1.5 million. Forestell feels that it is inappropriate to release whom the prospects are until it’s finalized.
Hickox Field is currently being used for men’s and women’s lacrosse. When construction begins, Collins arranged for the women’s home games to be played on a field in Oyster Bay and the men’s games to be played next door at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT). Collins said that he is anticipating that the renovations will be done before the first home football game in the fall on September 14.
Although the construction may inconvenience the teams while the renovations are going on, Collins believes that the end result will be beneficial to the fans. “I think successful teams give pride to the school and get fans out. If fans have to sit on bleachers where they’re getting splinters or fiber glass splinters in their legs and the bees are stinging them and it’s very hot—I think that’s not an enjoyable venue for our students and our fans to watch,” Collins said. “But if it’s something that’s new, that’s nice, that’s clean and you go there and you have a good experience and you see that the Post teams are winning, I think it’s great for Post as a university,” he added.
