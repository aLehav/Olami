Dr. Elliott Sroka, Executive Director of LIU Post’s Tilles Center, was honored as one of the “Top 25 Art Advocates” by the Long Island Arts Council at Freeport on January 25th.
The first Advocate for the Arts reception honored individuals who are passionate about and dedicated to the arts, said Marnie Katzman, Executive Director of the Long Island Arts Council at Freeport.
Sroka was honored because he devotes his time and energy to the arts, Katzman added.
“It’s a gratifying emotion,” Sroka said of the honor, adding that it’s always a pleasure to see how much the performances mean to people.
“Dr. Sroka’s ability to create innovative and traditional programs is second to none,” Dr. Noel Zahler, Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, said.
The Tilles Center is the home to the performing arts and has been around since the early 1980s.  As the Executive Director of the Tilles Center since 1986, Sroka oversees the artistic planning and programming. He is responsible for deciding which artists appear at the Tilles Center as well as what types of programming are shown. “Those artistic decisions are primarily mine, and that’s the fun part of the job,” he added.
Sroka also performs senior level management duties, such as supervising the staff, scheduling, negotiating contracts with artists and spreading the word about the Tilles Center by meeting with media and community members. Fundraising is the most challenging part of the job, Sroka mentioned.
Regarding his biggest accomplishment, Sroka said that presenting world-class artists and sharing them with the community, despite the troubling economy, is his greatest triumph. “Given the economy, our goal is to continue to change with the times, present new artist and maintain quality of the programming,” Sroka said about what he plans to accomplish in the future.
The Tilles Center fosters relationships between students and professional artists while remaining deeply committed to the surrounding community.  The Tilles Center is also a major employer of Post students. It employs approximately 1,000 students according to Sroka.
Working at the Tilles Center has been great experience, said Potoula A., a freshman Speech Pathology major who works at the box office. She added, “It makes you a better person because you learn responsibility and teamwork.”

“A new student organization is looking for a helping hand in its mission to help LIU Post students in need of pay for their college textbooks.
Described by President Arianna Liverri as a club “for the students run by the students,” It Takes a Village seeks to help students pay for their textbooks, a necessity that many are finding it increasingly difficult to afford.
“The club doesn’t have a budget; it operates solely on donations,” Liverri, a senior Psychology major, said. “A majority of our money has come from ACP’s spring concert. When we co-sponsor events on campus, we receive half of the proceeds. Those proceeds form a scholarship for a student here at Post.”
But, the group can’t accomplish its mission without donations and new members. Club meetings are held in the Hillwood Commons TV Room during the Common Hour on Mondays. The meetings are not long, and when a student volunteers, there is flexibility in how he or she participates.
“For example, one student sat at a table and sold tickets for Runway,” Liverri explained.
Anyone who is willing to help is welcome, and being part of this club can also give you some community service hours. This is not a book drive; the group does not collect old textbooks for students. It is an organization that gives out scholarships to students, and it operates without outside help.
To apply for the scholarship, students should check their MyLIU emails for the application. Applicants must maintain a 2.5 GPA and have a current FAFSA. However, to be eligible to reapply for this scholarship, the recipients must help out and complete their six hours of community service to the Post community.
The amount of the scholarship is based on the number of donations the club receives. To find out how to help out, students can email the club at liupostvillage@gmail.com. Students should take part in this club to really have an impact on the Post community and lend a helping hand to an issue that nearly every student is affected by.
“Our slogan is,  ‘Your Penny + My Penny = Our Education,’” Livrerri said.

“Our goal must always be, and is, to focus on the students,” said the President of Long Island University during his speech at the Rebranding Party on February 1st.
Hillwood was abuzz with more activity than usual, as balloons and people crowded the lobby. Faculty and students were all sporting t-shirts with the new LIU Post logo and the campus’ new slogan: “Find Out How Good You Really Are.” Games and prizes were being given out; a pep band was playing, and the mascot was there, which added to the excitement in Hillwood. At the center was a large LIU Post cake.
Fernando Mendoza, the Associate Director of Student Life, said that the Rebranding Party “demonstrates Post pride.” After asking everyone in attendance to put on their brand-new LIU Post t-shirts, President Dr. David Steinberg said he wanted the world to see that Post is not just one college but, rather, a part of a “constellation of resources, academic talent and faculty.” He added, “We are a single community, a proud community and a diverse community.”
LIU is one of the largest private universities in the United States with six campuses, including Post. After the speeches, cake was handed out to all of the faculty and students, while a banner was dropped, revealing the new slogan and name for LIU Post. Members of both the administration and the faculty said that the new name for Post is “simple and fresh”. Marguerite Barone, an alumni member from the graduating classes of 1969 and 1986, said that new name “is a positive change and is keeping up to date with the times.” Cathleen Joseph, a junior studying Digital Arts and Design, said that the new name “is a nice change,” and “I got a new shirt, which was nice, but it was very crowded.” She also said that “the advertising of the new name was commendable.” There is still a mixed opinion among the students regarding the name change, but the party, itself, was exciting and an enjoyable event for the faculty and the students.
The Rebranding Party marked the start of a new look for LIU as well as launched the university into the 21st century as much more than an average college, but, rather, as large community of students, professors and academics.

When can you be positive that you are in a committed and official relationship? That you can call that guy or girl you’ve been seeing your boyfriend or girlfriend? The answer may vary depending on whom you ask.
To me, it’s when you get asked. However, my last long-term boyfriend asked me out in the ninth grade and we dated for the next five years so I’m not sure if that’s something that guys still do. These were the days before everyone and their grandma had a Facebook, even when I made one during the end of our relationship, we were not “Facebook official.” I didn’t feel that it was necessary; we both knew that we were together and that’s what mattered.
It’s not the same way right now. It seems that if you are not Facebook official, then you’re not together at all. I’ve heard a few girls say that they got mad at their boyfriends for not listing themselves as in a relationship and picking fights about it. For real ladies (or gentlemen, you’re not excluded)?
So what you’re saying is that you need a website to confirm your real-life relationship? Why is having a living person commit to you in person not enough? You need a website to broadcast your relationship to the world. That just seems a little silly to me.
Maybe you’re just looking for the acknowledgement, maybe your insecure, I don’t know. Truthfully, I’m not too interested in the answer. It’s probably just as ridiculous as the situation itself. But to pick a fight over it? Come on people, chose your battles a little more wisely.

Nuclear Weapons, the two words that can instantly scare almost anyone. Nuclear power and nuclear weapons have been the cause of a lot of international conflict since nuclear weapons were first used in World War II. With anything that causes conflict, comes political instability.
Here’s a little background on the whole issue. There was only one case in history during which nuclear weapons have been used. The United States army used them against Japan in World War II when they dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the effects of which are still felt today. On April 26, 1986, during the cold war, in Chernobyl, Russia, a major nuclear meltdown occurred. The nuclear fallout traveled throughout Eastern Europe, causing hundreds of cases of radiation poisoning stretching from Russia to Poland. The area of Chernobyl is still unlivable and will be for several hundred years. Today, there are five countries that have nuclear power and are permanent members of the United Nations Defense Council, the United States, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, the People’s Republic of China, and France. Several other countries have achieved the ability of nuclear power, including India, Pakistan, and the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea. Still, other countries are currently working on developing nuclear power and weapons, which makes some other countries very nervous.
So what is the big deal? The big deal is that for every country with nuclear power another country is worrying about the possibility of being bombed and basically completely destroyed by one of these weapons. However, not since World War II has a country ever used their nuclear weapons, even during the Cold War, which was a giant nuclear arms race. How is it possible that a nuclear war has never happened? How is it possible that the world can go through rifts, conflicts, and wars and never use a single one? The answer is not quite clear, but it does revolve around one single thing: politics.
There are two very popular theories as to why two nuclear powers have never, and will never, go to war with each other. The first is called nuclear deterrence, and it was the political tactic and theory used during the Cold War. Basically, the theory is that one country won’t bomb another because they know the other country will bomb them back. This is how the Cold War was fought. The Soviets and Americans would use their weapons as not only a threat but a defense. Both countries threatened to bomb the other but also said that if any missiles were launched then they would bomb them back. This tactic can work but is dangerous. Each government involved will continuously increase the amount of nuclear weapons they have in order to show that they are not only more powerful but have a bigger defense than the other. By the end of the cold war, the Soviet Union and United States had enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire world seven times over.
Yes, nuclear deterrence can work, but is just building up a nuclear arsenal to stop another nuclear arsenal really that smart? To many, the answer is no. That single answer sparked an entire treaty among the countries in the nuclear world. The heads of all the nuclear countries gathered at the end of the cold war and signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This single treaty stopped the spread of nuclear arms from circulating around the world, ordered nuclear states to limit their nuclear arms, and pushed for these nations to use their nuclear technology for power sources and not weapons.
So is this working? Yes and no. For the countries that signed this treaty it is working, and the number of nuclear weapons has decreased. But there are other countries that are developing nuclear technology and quickly. Iran is one of them. Iran is a country that is quickly producing nuclear technology and possibly nuclear weapons. Iran having nuclear weapons scares countries that Iran doesn’t have good relations with, most of all Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United States. So what is being done? The United Nations has openly asked Iran to not produce nuclear weapons. Iran has claimed they are not building them. President Obama has been very clear that he and the Israeli government are on the same page with Iran and their nuclear project; they disapprove and will do what it takes to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons. In an article published by www.bbcnews.com on Sunday February 5, 2012, President Obama said that he wishes to resolve things democratically but will basically do what it takes to make sure nuclear weapons stay out of an already unpredictable area, the Middle East.
So what happens now? If Iran acquires nuclear technology there are a few possibilities. The idea always lingers that deterrence has worked in the past and can still work. Maybe by Iran gaining nuclear weapons it will mean that they will never use them except as a threatening defense, as so many other countries have done. Of course the other members Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty could push for Iran to join the NPT and limit their arsenal. And of course there is war, the least wanted of all the political options. A war could possibly rid Iran of nuclear weapons but could cause major catastrophe before that is completed. Perhaps the best bet is to let the world leaders’ deal with it, but the question is whether they will make the best choice.

From the very first moment after I arrived in the USA and on the LIU-Post campus, I noticed something very funny thing to me. Every time when I wear some adorable pair of shoes like my beloved high heels and walk through campus paths, I see widely opened eyes, looking at me with amazement, and mute question in the air: “Is everything OK with her? Why is she wearing heels?” From time to time I am asked, “How can you walk on them?”
Well, I can walk in heels. I can dance in heels the whole night in a club; I even can jump and run in them I am Russian and I wore shoes with heels for the first time when I was 13, since then I practically don’t take them off and I swear-I prefer them to any other kind of footwear!
Maybe it sounds amazing to you, but any Russian girl surely wears shoes with heels for partying, dating or studying, and may be for going to the nearest grocery or walking with her dog- at least I do.  And I assure you- I’m not alone!
What is really a funny thing is that here in a foreign country, we Russian girls recognize each other not by faces or language, but by the high heels. As usual we are the only ones who wear high heeled shoes in general life.
I don’t know why it’s so. I’m from the generation that has grown up on the series “Sex and the City”. Before I first came to NYC, I was sure that all women in Manhattan, like Carry Bradshaw, were wearing shoes with high heels by Manolo  Blahnik. The reality turned out to be quite the opposite and disappointing.
But anyway, this series can’t explain why we Russian girls are so faithful to heels.  “Sex and the City” is an American production, but it’s so famous and extremely popular all round the world. Nevertheless, it’s obvious that only Russian women are so crazy about fashion in general and about shoes with high heels in particular. My mother and my grandmother used to wear heels, though they didn’t have such shows in their youth.
Maybe the answer to this question lies somewhere in our origin or inner culture. But, I can see the proof of it that when I was a kid, I really adored trying on my mother’s shoes with heels and making attempts to walk like a model in my tiny room. I don’t remember it (my mother told me), but what I can see now is that the most favorite game of my little sister (she is just 4 years old) is to come to my room when I’m not there, to drag off my innumerous pairs of shoes and dresses from the wardrobe, to clothe in and to spin before a mirror. It’s so funny and sweet to watch it.
So, for the first time I think about the question why we Russian girls like shoes with high heels so much- and I still can’t give the exact answer. But what I surely know is that I do love heels and I will never stop wearing them, even when I’ll be 70-something years old!

Living in dorms is not like living at home. Maybe you are used to walking around your house barely dressed and spending an hour in the shower twice a day. Perhaps you like listening to your music really loud or falling asleep with your TV on. But now you live in a shared little rooms in a hall full of others. What are the rules now?
After talking to several dormers around campus, they all mentioned the most important rule: Always remember to be respectful. Clean up after yourself both in your own room and the bathroom. The walls are not sound proof, so don’t play your music too loud at all hours of the day and night; people might have early classes or studying to do. Don’t have your TV on if you’re roommate is planning on sleeping. It also isn’t a good idea to bring people into the room without notifying the person you are sharing it with.
“A perfect roommate respects when you have homework, when you have class early, respects your things, and lets you know if she’s having a boy- or girlfriend over,” said Sophomore Public Relations major, Malin Woll Skotnes. “Personally I live with one of my best friends, and I love it,” she adds, explaining how they can communicate and discuss problems without fighting.
It’s important to communicate with your roommate. Make your rules together. Find a way to compromise if you disagree with each other and figure out a solution where you’re both comfortable. Figure out how you should handle situations, before they actually happen. If you are having trouble with people next door, try talking with them before you give your complaint to the RA. Maybe you can figure out an agreement that works for everyone.
“The most annoying thing that a roommate could do is to keep you up at night or interrupt your sleep if you have an early class in the morning,” said junior Music Education major, Steve DeBellis. His description of the perfect roommate is “a close friend that shares a similar schedule, and who you enjoy hanging out with.”
Sophomore Digital Arts and Design major, Ivanna Fortunato, also hates when people are loud when she’s trying to sleep. She thinks dorm etiquette should revolve around being respectful, which she explains as not being loud at odd hours of the night and to be clean in the bathroom and the halls.
Sophomore Nutrition major Aurora Kronberg said that all the unwritten rules you live by at home with your family should also apply living in a Residence Hall. That shouldn’t be so hard, right? Follow these couple of guidelines and encourage your fellow dorm mates to do the same.

To begin with, this article will probably be interesting mostly for girls— sorry, boys!  But we are girls and, of course, it’s natural that we are crazy about shopping. So can you imagine your emotions at that very moment, when you see THIS—“OMG! It’s a new Victoria’s Secret catalogue!” With inexpressible excitement, with shivering hands, and absolutely preoccupied, you grab the catalogue and start looking through page after page to find out what will be trendy for the spring/summer season!
But, after turning a couple of pages and noticing every detail of the pictures, I personally start to feel sort of inferior! Couple of pages more—what?! How are these girls able to have such perfect bodies? Such flat stomachs, slim legs, and such big boobs! At that very minute, I’m getting an inescapable desire to stick my mouth together with super glue forever in order not to eat any more my of favorite  minty chocolate or fruit jelly bears. Also, I’m starting to run around like a madwoman. What should I do first? Should I run to the gym or make an urgent appointment with the best plastic surgeon in town?
Brilliant pictures with awesome sea landscapes and pretty girls, like Venuses with perfect bodies, who beautify these bright and colorful swim suits even more are shown in this catalogue. It seems that if just given a chance to be in their place, I would be the happiest girl in the world…
But, wait for a minute…a sudden memory came to my mind. In my late teens, I used to be a model—not a world famous one, just a model for the local magazines. I used to take part in many photo shoots for various advertising–it wasn’t as easy as it seems at first sight. It needed from you not just a perfect look, but a lot of emotional efforts as well. My point is that when I looked at my advertising pictures, I had to confirm that it wasn’t truly my body. It was too ideal, which is common in fashion magazines and catalogues.
I am not ashamed to say that I’m absolutely pleased with my appearance, but at the same time—I’m not a perfect Barbie doll. I have some small flaws as others do. But if you looked at those pictures in magazines, you could not notice anything because they were the works of talented photographers and a smart computer program known as Photoshop.
So, girls, my advice is don’t believe in these perfect bodies in catalogues and don’t be upset that you do not look like Victoria’s Secret Angels. Just be self-confident and believe in yourself in any situation. This is the key to being attractive and happy without any Photoshop manipulation.

What is Lent?  It’s pretty obvious when it starts – one can’t help but notice a bunch of people who walk around one day a year with ashes on their forehead. However, what’s the real meaning of Lent? And why is it necessary for me to give something up?
There’s more to it than just giving something up to prove your love to God.
Lent begins 40 days before Easter.  The number 40 holds a lot of meaning within the bible and the practicing of Lent.  Forty represents the number of years the Israelites spent in exile and represents the number of days that Jesus spent in the desert.  Ash Wednesday is the start of Lent.  On Ash Wednesday, observant Catholics attend church and receive ashes on their forehead.
Many people seem to misinterpret the reason as to why the ashes are worn on their forehead.  Some think it’s to pronounce their holiness.  The real reason is to acknowledge that we sin and are in need of repentance and renewal.  Ash Wednesday is a way of reminding us that we are not perfect, we’ve made mistakes and should be thankful for the sacrifices that have been made for us.
Part of Lent is being able to get through 40 days by either giving something up, or working on something that will improve yourself.  You are supposed to make some type of change that will allow you to connect with the suffering Jesus experienced while in the desert. Mary McCabe, a Sophomore Information Management and Technology major, is going to work on improving herself during Lent. “I will read a passage from the bible each night before going to bed. If I read a passage from the bible, I feel I learn more about how I should live my life and hopefully it will be a habit I will continue,’ she said.
McCabe recalled when she was little, she would indulge in what she had given up and once the 40 days were over.  She expressed how she hadn’t really learned anything from this experience until she became older.
Newman Club vice president Sally-Ann Gaughan, a Junior Early Childhood Education major, said she is still unsure what she will be doing for Lent, but will eventually decide following prayer and meditation. She admitted that she would most likely work on improving herself.
“Lent is about dying and becoming new, about second chances,” she said. “This is the time to truly concentrate on myself, and to start over in the part of me that needs changing for the better, so I may live a fuller life.”
Newman Club president Erik Raessler, a Junior Physics major, talked about his plans for Lent as well. “I’m giving up my choice to choose to do wrong,” he said.  I’m doing this because it is every person’s right to be treated as the human they are.”
Raessler also spoke about repenting and making your way back down the right path when you have gone astray. The more you observe Lent, the more you see your faith grow.  When you are young perhaps you give up candy, soda, video games or television.  Throughout lent you find yourself cheating or giving up.  As you become older, lent becomes more important.
“As a kid, I would give up candy or ice cream, but give in halfway through Lent. Now it’s much more spiritual since I’ve developed a deeper faith life,” Raessler said.
Lent begins on Ash Wednesday, Feb. 22.  Masses will be held that day in the Interfaith Chapel at 12:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.

Maybe you have been waiting months or even years for this day, but whenever it does happens, it’s epic – yes, I’m talking about your 21st birthday. At 21, you can drink, gamble and get into any bar or club. No more restrictions on your life! Time to celebrate! Many cannot wait, and they count down the days and even plan to go bar hopping ahead of time on their special day. Others are more laid back about the day and prefer to have dinner with friends. Either way, this day is one to remember.
Some eager college students, like Malcolm McDaniel, a Junior Speech Pathology major, plan their 21st birthday bashes months in advance. He’ll be turning 21 in April and he has the whole weekend planned out two months in advance.
McDaniel said that since his birthday is on a Friday, he is going to, “sleep all day and then go to Manhattan to the club Latin Quarters all night, because I finally can!”
Later that weekend is reserved for a special person and a plan that’s years in the making.
“I’m going to the casinos in Atlantic City with my grandma to blow some money!” he said.
Rachel Kurtz, a Senior Forensic Science major, has fond memories of her 21st birthday. She went to a restaurant/bar called Strawberries in Huntington village. Kurtz said by her third drink she was drunk and broke the hand dryer in the bathroom after she banged her head into it.
“At the table, I combed my hair with a fork like Ariel then started to sing “Part of Your World” into the fork for 15 minutes,” said Kurtz. The night ended with a food fight with red velvet cake, which stained everything, including her dress.
Bridgett Soares, a Junior Criminal Justice major, had a fun-filled night for her 21st as well. Soares said, “I went to the Beer Expo in Nassau Coliseum, after 30 minutes I was drunk, and the night ended in Rockefeller Center.”
Some Post students did not celebrate the day at all. “My aunt unexpectedly died on my 21st birthday. I didn’t get to celebrate because I had the wake and funeral to go to,” said Kassandra Thomas, a Senior Fine Arts major.
Everyone celebrates this day differently, whether it’s a night of drinking or a sober night with friends. An epic night of partying at a bar is not for everyone – Maria Bivona, a Senior Public Relations major, went out to dinner at a café with her friends. And Antonio Martinez, a Junior Forensic Science major, embraced childhood as he reached a major milestone.
“I saw Toy Story 3 on my 21st birthday – great movie,” he said.
So whether you are planning an epic all nighter at a bar or a more mellow dinner with friends, your 21st birthday is one you will never forget.

Let me set the scene. The good-looking guy in your Psych class finally realizes what you have known all along and asks you out. After the initial excitement of having a date this Friday night, panic totally consumes you as you stand in front of your closet, wondering what the heck you are going to wear.
Believe me, we have all been there—unless you have a closet the size of Texas. We all want to look fabulous and make a great impression without trying too hard. First dates are stressful and nerve-racking enough, so I have devised four outfit ideas to lend a hand.
Ready For Anything: This first outfit combination is perfect if you and your date are playing mini golf, going to see a movie, or any other more casual rendezvous. There is a balance between being overdressed and being underdressed so pay careful attention to your ensemble. I suggest wearing a cute cardigan or blazer, your favorite t-shirt, a pair of skinny jeans, and flats. This ensures that you will look like your outfit is put together without being overly styled.
Rock His World: For those of us with a more edgy style, opt for this outfit assemblage instead. Think of an awesome leather jacket, a comfortable tunic, skinny pants, and combat boots. Whether you are going to a concert or to a coffee house, this outfit will provide major cool points. If going for an edgy yet more dressed up look, rock a form fitting dress or body-con skirt under the leather jacket.
Strut Your Stuff: Chances are your date is going to want to impress you by taking you to a fancy place. In that case, dresses and skirts are the way to go. Try to incorporate floral prints or lace to give this look a more individualistic air to it. Whip out your favorite little black dress and some flattering heels with a pop of color and knock him dead. Channel your inner bombshell!
Playing The Field: Whether or not you are actually into sports, attending a game is still a really fun and exciting first date idea. You want to look like you are into the game; however you still want to look cute. I suggest a pretty fly-away long cardigan, a t-shirt or jersey for whatever team you are seeing, and leggings. If you do not follow the team or sports in general, try to borrow one from a friend or a relative. If you are really at a loss, wear the team’s colors at least.
As per usual, be certain to wear whatever makes you feel comfortable. You do not want to be fidgeting or second-guessing your outfit because that might distract you from the real task at hand.
Features editor Kathleen Joyce gives some advice on the first date outfit. She says, “I don’t wear my best outfit because that will come later on if he decides to take me out again and again. I wear something nice; I never actually buy something new since I have enough to wear already. I make sure it’s casual yet dressy. Usually skinny jeans, flats, a nice blouse, and a sweater are my go-to. Later on, you’ll see more skin.”
Remember, confidence is key and the opposite sex definitely responds to confidence. Good luck and happy dating everyone!

The only day I’m on campus now is Monday, so parking on the great Post campus doesn’t bug me as much as it used to. I was driving through one of the closer parking lots, not the large one in the back and eureka! I saw a spot! But, stupidly I drove past it, I reverse and I see a SUV, quickly fly by and take it. I was startled and angry. I put my car in my park and decide to give this (insert your own word here) a piece of my mind. But as I walk over there, I stop. Why start a war or a fight over a small parking space? So I held my head up high and walked back to my car, but of course in my perfect fashion, not without giving the girl the bird first.
I decided to not start a fight over a parking space because I’m young and in decent shape. I also had some time so I wasn’t in a complete hurry, so I could have just sucked it up and parked farther away and taken the walk. But as with so many of you Post students, you guys want to park closer (I’m guilty of this too). You don’t want to walk a half-mile to your class when you can just wait in the parking lot for ten more minutes and pester an innocent student for their spot. I find that this is the most annoying thing in the world. First of all, if you ask nicely, I’ll be more than happy to walk faster and give you my spot. But most of the time, when I was asked, it was nasty or the person just followed me, like a stalker, to my space. Excuse me? Let me just call the police and they’ll handle the situation. How should I know you want my spot and not my bag full of goodies? So, students if you are planning to take a spot, ask the student walking to their car if they’re leaving, NICELY, and thank them afterwards.
Second off, many students walking to their cars sometimes are just dropping off books or getting something they forgot. All of a sudden, you have five cars lined up for your spot. Ah! It’s scary. This used to happen all the time to me. I would drop all of my heavy textbooks after class and go back to another class. I used to dread walking to my good parking spot because I knew that I would be asked more than once if I was leaving or better yet followed. I would run, throw those books in, and run back. Yes, maybe I looked crazy, but I was avoiding the parking war that was about to ensue.
In my later years as a student, I gave up. I just parked in the farthest parking spot that you could find because I had a newer car and I wanted to avoid the parking spot stalkers. I like the walk (not on a rainy day) and it gives me time study if I have a test. I would walk and read to pass the time it took to walk. I know it sounds nerdy and nuts, but it’s true. Parking far away also gave me a reason to walk through Hillwood and check out the Starbucks line. So I woke up and got smarter with just a walk. I know some professors are nuts when it comes to being late to class, but they have a parking lot next to the buildings, so remind them that. So my fellow commuters good luck and avoid a parking war as much as possible because it’s not worth it.

Meeting someone is difficult for anybody, but sometimes when you’re queer, things are a bit more complicated. The queer nightlife seems to be the place to find yourself a little steamy romance, but if you don’t have an affinity for bars or clubs, you might find yourself out in the cold.
Now, if you’re like me and you just can’t seem to get a date (not that I’m begging), I’m sure you’ve heard just about everyone say, “I have a friend that’s gay, you’d love him!” Now, the question I pose is: How do you know? Is it an assumption that because we’re both single gay men that we’re definitely going to get along, get married, and adopt Angelina Jolie’s leftovers?
Now, I know that this is meant to be helpful and polite. Though, I have had some unfortunate encounters in the past with men whom my “friends” thought I would “love”. My favorite of which was a gentleman whose terms of parole forbid him to leave Suffolk County. Of course, I didn’t know any of this until after I was in his car on our way to Manhattan as he drove well over the speed limit.
I guess what I’m getting at here is sometimes our friends don’t always know what’s best for us. Don’t get me wrong, I’m totally guilty of asking my friends to set me up (to no avail, I might add), but we can’t assume that two people will get along simply because they’re both queer. There are so many deciding factors that go into picking a significant other and having the same sexual orientation is really just the tip of the iceberg.
Being gay, bisexual, or heterosexual doesn’t define who we are as people, it’s just another piece of a larger puzzle. Therefore, there should be more to a “love connection” than the fact that you both happen to be gay or straight.
I find that depending on how well you know the friend who is playing matchmaker usually defines the accuracy of the match. If we barely know each other, I’m probably going to be more skeptical of the man you assume will be my future ex-husband. Also, I can’t help but notice the fact that best friends usually don’t set their friends up on dates. This is probably because your best friends are more critical of who takes you out than you are.
Now when someone turns around and tells you that they’re not interested in meeting your friend, it becomes awkward. It’s not that it’s not appreciated, but maybe they’re just not that person’s type, or maybe they’re too busy to be dating at the moment, or maybe that person was just on an episode of “Cops.”
Before you suggest that your gay best friend and I should meet because I’d love him and we’d get along so well, try asking me what my type is and get to know what I look for in a romantic partner. If your friend does not fit these criteria, it’s likely that you just assumed that we’d get along because we’re both gay. Or, better yet, introduce us to one another as friends and let us get to know each other without your influence. I know I feel much better about myself when I think I did it all on my own.

Hank Lawson (Mark Feuerstein) was making a name for himself in the New York City medical community until he lost everything fighting for one of his patients. His younger brother, Evan (Paulo Costanzo), convinced him to join him on a trip to the Hamptons, where a billionaire and a guest fell ill at the social event they crashed. Hank came to the rescue, impressing the social elite, becoming the Hamptons’ newest doctor-on-demand.
Obviously, the Hamptons are located on the east end of Long Island, and that’s exactly where the show is filmed, some of the time. Scenes for the current third season were filmed on Sept. 16th, 2011, in Morgan Park, Glen Cove, just eight minutes north of LIU Post. In June 2009, an episode was filmed at the North Shore Equestrian Center, located on the LIU Post Campus. A Hamptons horse show was staged with approximately 200 actors and extras as a female rider fell from her horse, needing Dr. Lawson to come to her rescue. The episode featured student riders from Post’s Equestrian Team as well as theater majors from the School of Visual and Performing Arts. It’s fantastic to see a show on television filmed basically in our own backyard. Tune in as you might recognize a location.
You won’t believe what kind of patients Hank runs into. USA Network’s “Royal Pains” is currently concluding the second half of its third season Wednesdays at 10 p.m. with a sixteen-episode fourth season on its way.

Alcatraz, America’s most infamous prison, which housed the nation’s most notorious murderers, rapists, kidnappers and thieves until 1963, is the premise of FOX’s new thriller from executive producer J.J. Abrams.
When Detective Rebecca Madsen (Sarah Jones) is assigned to a homicide case, she runs a fingerprint in the police database only to learn that it belongs to Jack Sylvaner (Jeffrey Pierce), a former Alcatraz inmate who died decades ago. He is not only alive, but he also has not aged a day. She remembers that her grandfather and uncle were guards at the prison and wonders what really happened.
Government agent Emerson Hauser (Sam Neill) involves himself with Rebecca’s investigation after she turns to Doctor Diego “Doc” Soto (Jorge Garci), an Alcatraz expert and comic book enthusiast, for help in capturing the convict back from the dead. It becomes apparent that Sylvane won’t be the last prisoner to reappear from Alcatraz and that Agent Hauser has known about the prison’s secret history, how the prisoners just disappeared, and how he has been awaiting their return.
“Alcatraz” is the third television series this season to be set, well, at least partially, in the early 1960’s following NBC’s “The Playboy Club” and ABC’s “Pan Am.” New viewers won’t get confused with the premise of the show, as every episode features flashbacks that unlock the keys to the new prisoner of the week. What I really want to know now is: Where did the prisoners go? Who took them, and why? This show is part cop drama, part action, and part mystery, which makes for one really good series.
“Alcatraz” airs on FOX Mondays at 9 p.m.

You may have noticed the words Downton Abby appearing in your Facebook news feed, in your friends’ Tweets, in the newspaper, on the Internet… basically, everywhere. What is this Downton Abby, you ask yourself? It happens to be the latest British invasion. Our friends from across the pond have brought us a new show that is sweeping the nation.
Downton Abby is the story of the Crawley family – the Earl and Countess of Grantham and their daughters: Mary, Edith, and Sybil. The Crawleys live in the lap of luxury in an English country house that the series’ name comes from. In addition to the family, Downton Abby is full of servants, who run and keep the house. The stories of upstairs and downstairs weave in and out, showing what life was like for the haves and the have-nots. The story begins with the sinking of the Titanic and the effect it has on the family. The pace quickly moves from there. Now, in its second season, Downton is thrust in the middle of World War I.
Downton first aired in Britain in September 2011, and PBS picked it up in January 2012. The show has been an all-out hit ever since. By winning an Emmy and the Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or TV Film, Downton proved it has earned its place on American television. With the plots of a modern day soap opera, you will be hooked after the first 10 minutes. Three love stories; two revenge plots; adultery, deception, and so much more draw audiences in each week. What really makes the show are the complex and drama-filled characters. There is Miss O’Brien, the Ladies Maid, who, along with Footman turned Solider Thomas, have a hidden agenda. Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes, Butler and Housekeeper, keep the peace downstairs among the servants. Lady Mary brings the drama of her privileged family with her scandalous ways and cold-hearted attitude.
It is impossible to talk about Downton Abby and not mention Maggie Smith. At 77, the actress known for her role as Professor McGonagall in the Harry Potter series, plays an equally strong character in Downton. As Countess of Grantham and grandmother of the family, Violet Crawley, Smith is a favorite among viewers. Tumblr pages, Twitter accounts, and You Tube videos have been dedicated to the many one-liners Violet has become so famous and well-liked for: “Put that in your pipe and smoke it.” “Edith, you are a Lady, not Toad of Toad Hall.” “Oh, really! It’s like living in a second-rate hotel, where the guests keep arriving and no one seems to leave!” Just a few of the many quotes you can expect from Violet.
Downton Abby is a show you just can’t stop watching. The writing and acting come together flawlessly and make it a show that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Downton Abby is in its second season, airing Sundays on PBS at 9 p.m. until Feb. 19. If you want to catch up, the first seasons are available on Netflix, iTunes, and Amazon. Episodes of the second season can be streamed on PBS.com. The show was renewed for a third season.  It was recently announced that Shirley MacLaine would join the cast, playing Lady Grantham’s mother. Downton Abby’s third season will premiere in Britain in September 2012; a date for the American season premiere has not been set yet.

Known as the world’s northernmost capital, Reykjavik is located in the center of the volcanically and geologically active nation of Iceland. A sparsely-populated North Atlantic island, Iceland is famous for its hot springs, geysers, and active volcanoes. However, most of the action is settled in the vibrant capital, which offers a sizzling combination of village innocence and big-city zeal. In summer, the streets are washed by 22 hours of daylight; in winter, they’re scoured by blizzards and exposed to never-ending nights. Reykjavík is a city that treasures its Viking past but certainly holds a tight grip on the future.
 
Airlines/Travel: There is a wide selection of international flights to Iceland, both from Europe and the United States. Its main airport, Reykjavík-Keflavík Airport, which is named after the famous explorer Leif Ericson, is the largest airport in Iceland and the country’s main hub for international transportation. The main carriers at Keflavik are Icelandair and Iceland Express, which fly directly to and from JFK International Airport. The best time to travel to Iceland depends on which seasons you want to endure because each season offers a unique experience. The winter, for example, is “off-season,” and flights to Iceland are less expensive; it would also be interesting to experience the snow-covered landscapes and to witness the Polar Lights in the sky.
 
Hotels/Lodging: There are hotels and guesthouses to suit all tastes and budgets, from the most luxurious to the simple and sufficient. Summerhouses are also ideal an economical choice for small groups and families. Some of the most popular hotels in the center of Reykjavik include Hotel Borg, Hilton Reykjavik Nordica, and Radisson Blue Saga Hotel. Be sure to expect warm hospitality, clean air and great security since Iceland is one of the safest nations in the world.
 
Sightseeing/Attractions: The Icelandic capital is surrounded by a beautiful landscape, which adds to the activities offered to visitors. For example, there is the “Blue Lagoon,” Iceland’s famous geothermal spa, where guests relax in seawater heated by Mother Nature. It is a heated pool (104°F) that is surrounded by piles of snow all year round. In addition, the shopping is endless, as one can browse through Scandinavian designer stores in the famous Kringlan shopping mall, a hub of social activity in Reykjavik. Fur clothes are a particular Icelandic specialty; they are found at many markets. For an exciting sea adventure, try one of the many whale-watching tours that are available from Reykjavik. The ocean around the city is a natural habitat for many types of whales and dolphins. Reykjavik museums offer a great combination of fun and learning for the whole family. The National Museum and Saga Museum, for example, allow the children to experience how the Vikings fought and feasted in an interactive way. Additionally, Reykjavik’s Videy Island is a unique site that combines history, culture and nature and is only a few minutes away by boat. There are hiking paths around the island, which is renowned for its varied bird life. Reykjavik is surrounded by the ocean, and the waterfront paths are perfect for a relaxing stroll, some jogging, cycling or rollerblading. The city’s northern waterfront is a popular area, with a view of Reykjavik’s landmark mountain, Mt. Esja.
 
Cuisine/Dining: Despite high prices in Iceland, it is possible to eat on a smaller budget, especially in Reykjavik, where you’ll have many more options for cheap eats. Try Icelandic fish and chips, super-fresh fish battered in barley and with a variety of dips. Sixty percent of Iceland’s national income comes from fish, and tasting it explains why. Almost any restaurant will serve a creature that was swimming a few hours earlier in cool, clean waters, and cosmopolitan chefs do much of the cooking. Icelandic hotdogs are among the best in the world and are made of locally-raised lamb and covered with fried and raw onions, a kind of gravy, and mustard. If you are looking to pick a “unique” choice of meal, try Icelandic pizza with an upscale edge: shrimp and scallop toppings. Either way, you are bound to find a restaurant and meal in Iceland that will certainly suit both your taste buds and budget.

The LIU Post Pioneers women’s basketball team defeated the NYIT Bears 73-68 on Wednesday, February 1st, and the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights in overtime 77-72 on Saturday, February 4th.
The two wins moved the Pioneers record to 16-7 on the season and 7-4 in ECC play.
During the Pioneers win over NYIT, senior guard Felicia Joyner led the team with 24 points and added two assists. Junior forward Nicolette Marciniak contributed nine points of her own, while grabbing 10 rebounds. The Pioneers shot 41 percent (26-63) from the field but only shot 18 percent (3-16) from three-point range.
The Bears opened the game by scoring seven unanswered points to jump on top early. The Pioneers responded by going on a 10-0 run that featured buckets from sophomore guard Alexis Peters, Marciniak and Joyner. At the end of the first half, the Bears led 34-32.
The Pioneers and Bears traded leads several times in the second half. With 1:21 left in the game, and the Pioneers ahead by two points, Peters fouled Bears’ junior center Chloe Johnson. She hit her two free throws and tied the game at 65. Pioneers freshman guard Chelsea Williams gave the Pioneers the lead back, making a layup in the paint to make it 67-65. A pair of made free throws sealed the win for the Pioneers.
On Saturday, the Pioneers got off to another slow start. They allowed their opponents to start the game on a 6-0 run but answered back by going on an 11-2 run. However, the Purple Knights pulled off a 10-4 run in the final seven minutes of the half to lead 35-24 at halftime.
The second half saw the Pioneers extend their lead to 16, but the Purple Knights began to claw back into the game. Purple Knights’ junior forward Tanisha Carter started an 11-4 run for Bridgeport with 11:43 left in the game. Senior forward Julia Colley hit a jump shot to give the Purple Knights the 54-53 lead with 8:22 left. The two teams traded the lead several times late in the game, until it looked as though Bridgeport had secured a win. Senior guard Edna Marant hit a crucial three-point shot that gave the Purple Knights a 66-64 lead. Colley then made it a three-point game after hitting one of two free throw shots. But, the Pioneers managed to get the ball back in the final seconds, and graduate forward Catherine Lutz hit a game-tying three-pointer to head to overtime right before time expired.
In overtime, the Pioneers and Purple Knights remained neck and neck until LIU Post managed to pull away. Sophomore guard Kenyatta Sears hit a jump shot with 3:11 left to play, and Joyner knocked down a pair of free throws, giving the Pioneers a 73-69 lead. From there, they held the Purple Knights at bay and won the game 77-72.
The Pioneers shot 44 percent (29-65) from the field and 28 percent (6-21) from three-point range. Joyner led the Pioneers in scoring, putting up 25 points. Junior center Samantha Kopp scored nine points, secured seven rebounds and blocked five shots.
The Pioneers’ next game is at home on Wednesday, February 8th, when they host Mercy College at 5 p.m.

LIU Post’s women’s swim team showed its strength by racking up seven victories at the East Stroudsburg Invitational in Pennsylvania on February 4th.
The team walked away from the meet, which also featured teams from East Stroudsburg University, Millersville University and Kutztown University, with five wins in individual events and another two in relays.
The Pioneers started the day with a win by the “A” team in the 200 medley relay. Next, senior Cornelia Hanes completed the 50 Free in 24.44 seconds to take first place. Hanes later added another first to the Pioneers’ points column when she beat out the competition in the 100 breaststroke with a 1:11.17 finish. Freshman Johanna Pettersson also contributed to the individual victories for the Pioneers when she finished the 100 backstroke in 1:00.24.
The LIU Post team continued to look good later in the day. Sophomore Tamara Garriock took first in the 100 butterfly with a 1:01.77, just one event before junior Mairi Morrison put another W on the boards for the Pioneers with a first place finish in the 200 individual medley with a finish time of 2:19.33.
A team effort capped off the wins for the Pioneers when Garriock, Morrison and Hanes joined with freshman Courtney Delehanty to finish first in the 200 freestyle relay. The team finished the event in just 1:40.44.
The Pioneers have a two-week break before their next competition, when they head to Piscataway, N.J., on February 17th, to compete in the Metropolitan Conference Championships.

The men’s basketball team is no longer undefeated in East Coast Conference play this season after falling 88-86 on the road to the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights (13-8) on Saturday, February 4th. In the second half, the Pioneers (15-5) led by as many as 15 points but were unable to hang on for the win. Senior guard Stefan Bonneau’s game-high 31 points were not enough to propel the Pioneers to an eighth consecutive win.
In a game that featured 10 tie scores and 12 lead changes, the Pioneers had the upper hand early, leading 46-39 at the end of the first half. The Pioneers had the advantage in getting to the free-throw line, shooting 9-12 from the charity stripe. At the same time, the Pioneers defense did a great job of not allowing any attempts for the Purple Knights from the free-throw line through the first 20 minutes of action. In addition, the Pioneers showed why they are the most efficient team from beyond the arc in the ECC by shooting 5-7 from three-point range.
However, the second half was a different story, as, just minutes into the half, the Purple Knights went on a 12-0 run to narrow the deficit to only three points. The Pioneers had no answer to stop the points being scored in the paint by the Purple Knights. In the second half, the Purple Knights scored 38 points in the paint and totaled 62 points for the game. On the other hand, the Pioneers were held to 24 points within the paint.
The Purple Knights also had 12 fast break points in the second half, while the Pioneers did not have a single bucket in transition. The Pioneers could not come away with a victory despite finishing 12-21 from behind the three-point line and attempting twice as many free-throws (30-15) as the Purple Knights.
The Purple Knights had four players finish in double-figure points, led by junior guard Hakeem Rodriguez, who finished with 22 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. The Pioneers also had to deal with junior guard Darian David who is currently second in the ECC, averaging 20.3 points per game. David finished with 21 points on 8-15 shooting from the field.
The ECC’s leading scorer, Stefan Bonneau, finished with 31 points on 10-26 shooting. Bonneau was in rhythm from beyond the arc all game long, nailing seven of his 11 attempts. Sophomore forward Vaughn Allen finished with 20 points on an efficient 7-11 from the field and hauled in five rebounds. Senior guard Terry Coleman filled up the stat sheet, putting up 14 points, including 4-5 from beyond the arc, four rebounds, five assists and four steals.
With the loss, the Pioneers’ overall record moves to 15-5, and their ECC record now stands at 9-1. They will look to get back in the win column on Wednesday, February 8th, at home against the Mercy College Mavericks (3-18), with tipoff set for 7 p.m. The last time these two teams met on January 11th, the Pioneers cruised to a 108-74 victory on the road.
