Safety isn’t a word we take for granted. It is a continuous notion we always keep in the back of our minds, until we feel the need to pose the question: are we safe where we are right now?
An article by Aimee Lee Ball from The New York Times, entitled, “Students Fear Venturing Out Alone at Night on Campus,” published July 20, 2012, reflects some of the worries and distress surrounding students and their campus safety.
Some of these worries and fears include “news of shootings and assaults,” which sends signals of fear “through students, parents and administrators,” according to Lee Ball. Major actions in safety precaution took place after the Virginia Tech shooting massacre of 2007. The incident had such a huge impact that alerts of potential danger became normality. The University of Ohio State received 20 danger alerts in 2011.
Sara Rosenberg, a student from Ohio State University, took the chance to “organize her friends into a posse of self-protection.” Rosenberg had no other ulterior motive other than protecting her friends — and herself. “We always make sure we have somebody to walk with after dark,” Rosenberg said.
Not only that, Rosenberg also “signed up for a self-defense class and became a connoisseur of mace dispensers.” Being aware of the possibilities of danger at all times, Rosenberg expressed, “You have to realize that you’re on a big campus — so big that we have our own zip code — and the city is around it. Things can happen.”
Even though it’s true that things can happen at any given moment, should students be wary of their own college campuses? What about LIU Post campus?
“Of course LIU Post is safe,” said Mr. Rapess, a representative for Public Safety on campus. He spotlighted the decency of Post students and put emphasis on the way they carry themselves. Neither Mr. Rapess, nor any other Public Safety official, would answer any further questions.
Given the Public Safety response, students critique on the matter still varies.
Senior Broadcasting major Tom Finn thinks that Post is in the green light when it comes to safety. “I think Post, for the most part, has a relatively safe campus because it’s located in a particularly good area of Long Island,” Finn stated. Are there any areas on campus that have potential to be dangerous? Finn thought so. “There are a few areas on campus particularly. Chipmunk Trail or the back parking-lot near Chipmunk Trail could pose as potentially dangerous areas, if a person was walking to their car alone late at night,” he said.
Senior Sociology major Nathalie Souffrant does not think that Post is as safe as it can be. “Anyone can get on campus with no questions asked. There isn’t any ID checks or public safety checking,” she stated.
With claims from both sides of the coin, what do Souffrant and Finn suggest for ways to make Post truly as safe as it can be?
“To make the campus safer, I think cameras in all the parking lots would be beneficial. Not only for safety, but they could help clear up the various fender benders that occur each school year,” Finn said.
Souffrant added, “I think that Post should provide more shuttles for the commuter students. Those who live in areas such as Hicksville, Hempstead, and Garden City, for example, to make sure they reach their destinations safely.”
Taking into account research and student opinions, I personally believe that LIU Post has a safe community. Although, in my opinion, there are also multiple ways that our university can adapt in order to make changes for the better. Not only its security as an institution, but also the safety of its students. I agree with Souffrant that the addition of more shuttles could prove as a positive change. I also agree with Finn that more cameras could help boost the stability of security, here at LIU Post.

LIU Post recently applied to Andrew Cuomo’s START-UP NY program, potentially turning the campus into one of the first private colleges on Long Island with a tax-free zone for businesses.
In June 2011, Governor Cuomo signed a legislation that established the use of State Small Business Credit Initiative funds to aid growing businesses in New York. If an application gets approved, businesses will not have to pay local and state taxes for up to 10 years. Since businesses will not have to worry about paying taxes in these tax- free zones, they can focus on establishing themselves and growing as an entity.
“START-UP NY is a state government program that helps businesses start, expand, or relocate to a tax-free zone,” explained Michael Glickman, LIU’s Chief of Strategic Partnerships and University Advancement. “LIU applied for a START-UP designation, and was recently chosen to participate in the program.”
Glickman explained that his next goal is to “connect with qualified businesses to take residency at The University Center.” The START-UP NY space will be located in Bush Brown Hall. Glickman did not say which businesses will set up residence at LIU, or even if
any businesses have approached the university yet to participate in the program. He stated: “The University is working to establish a process for identifying and vetting potential businesses that meet New York State’s requirements. The process will take some time to evolve, and the timing has not yet been determined.”
Glickman stated that these start-up businesses will positively affect students. “START-UP NY[s initiative] aligns quite well with LIU’s mission of sharing knowledge and resources with our surrounding communities. Our goal is to connect with businesses that will create opportunities for our students to gain marketable experiences through professional training. We are excited about the potential of this program, and by the possibility it holds for LIU to play a role in economic development within our community.”
“This is the first time I’m hearing about this,” said Rebecca Rosenberg, a senior Education major. “I’m worried that having more business on campus will raise our tuition.”
“There are so many businesses opening up on campus now,” said Cara Frank, a senior Broadcasting major. “The school screams that they’re about the students, but in the end it seems like we’re just the customers and it’s mostly all about business.”
“We applaud Governor Cuomo for his leadership in establishing this groundbreaking initiative, empowering centers for higher learning, business, and members of the community to create jobs and support economic growth” stated Glickman.

LIU Post has officially restructured the medical services offered on campus. Instead of segregating medical, mental, and community health in different departments located in separate locations on campus, these departments will be collectively located and re-named the LIU Post Center for Healthy Living. The new LIU Post Center for Healthy Living will be available for students Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Life Science/Pell Hall, rooms 154 and 155.
“LIU Post Center for Healthy Living provides medical and health services to our campus community. The center encompasses our medical, mental health and counseling, and community health education programs in one comprehensive entity,” said Adam Grohman, the Associate Dean of Students. “Students are encouraged to utilize the center for any of their health related needs. A registered nurse, social workers, and counselors are available, as always, to provide assistance,” Grohman added.
Director Lynne Schwartz oversees the Center for Healthy Living, and the staff includes a full-time senior social worker, two part time mental health consultants, and a full-time registered nurse. In addition, the team includes a part-time administration assistant, two nutrition interns and seven second year graduate interns.
In previous years, the medical services provided on campus also included the option to see a medical doctor and a gynecologist by appointment. Some of the services provided on campus were AIDS information and referral, birth control counseling, and pregnancy tests with a minimal fee; gynecological examination and treatment, medical care including diagnoses and treatment, medication and laboratory tests with a minimal fee; and a referral, if necessary, to local specialists.
For this 2014-2015 academic year, these medical services will now be offered at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) Academic Health Center. “The Ocelot shuttle now includes a stop at the NYIT campus to facilitate ease of access. In addition, students are also able to utilize their own personal convenience to utilize the facilities at NYIT,” Grohman said. Students are encouraged to make an appointment at the NYIT Academic Health Center but it is not necessary and health insurance is accepted.
The LIU Post Center for Healthy Living also partners with the North Shore LIJ Behavioral Health College Partnership program for additional psychological services. However, according to psychologist Dr. Laura Braider at LIJ, since the program works with 36 schools, the LIJ Behavioral Health College Partnership program is only for students enduring an acute psychiatric crisis.
“The formation of the Center for Healthy Living is an excellent example of the evolution of our various student services offerings at
LIU Post,” Grohman said. “The administrators and staff members of the Center are excited, as always, to assist our students as they navigate their educational pursuits by providing sound answers and support to our students’ health-related questions and needs.”
While Grohman believes the centralization of the two health- related departments on campus is a positive change, students believe this could be a step in the wrong direction. “I’m a little nervous that a lot of the medical services are no longer available here on campus and [are now located] at NYIT,” said Kate Gambino, a junior Broadcasting major. “A lot of students that live on campus don’t have cars. Or even worse, what if there is an emergency? The time it takes to get from here to NYIT could mean the difference between life and death.”
However, Grohman stays true to his claim that, “the centralizing of our two health related departments into one center will provide a greater scope of educational and health-related offerings.”
Only time will tell if this will be a positive change on the LIU Post campus and if the student needs will be met. For any additional questions, please feel free to email Post-HealthyLiving@liu.edu.

LIU Post’s renovated football stadium opened on Saturday, Sept. 6, after months of delay. The stadium was officially opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony for the first football game of the season. William Kirker, the director of LIU Post’s Facilities Department, said that the stadium has many improvements and features that the old stadium did not possess. “The new [home] side of the stadium holds just over 3,000 people,” said Kirker. The stadium will also add a press box to the middle of the newly renovated home side that will contain two areas for filming and VIP seating. Construction on the stadium was supposed to start in Nov. 2013, but was pushed back due to complaints by residents in the Town of Brookville.

On Saturday, Sept. 6, Post Hall residents had to evacuate the building due to the fire alarm sounding at approximately 3 a.m. The alarm forced every resident out of bed and onto the lawn in front of the building. RAs and students awaited information on whether the incident was serious, or just an oddly timed drill. The alarm was set off by a small fire in the microwave room in the basement of the building. Public Safety handled the situation quickly, and residents were allowed back into Post Hall after about 20 minutes. The fire department was not dispatched. According to Katie Muniz, a junior Dance major and RA in Nassau Hall, no one addressed the residents as a group to tell them what had actually happened. Word spread quickly that it was just popcorn. Christian Altamira, the Campus Life Coordinator of Post Hall, said, “We made sure everything was safe in the building before allowing students back inside.”

The entire Post campus area blacked out for a short amount of time on Sunday, Sept. 14, sometime after 6 p.m. “It is generally caused by something happening to the utility system within a mile or so of the campus,” said William Kirker, the director of Facilities. “It could have been a tree branch coming down on power lines causing a brief interruption.” The power dip was brief enough not to cause any major problems. “What happens to the campus is that many systems will see the interruption and will [then] shut down and restart,” Kirker said. “Depending on the length of the interruption, it could also trigger generators to start. You could also see lights flicker.” The reason for what affected the utility system to turn off momentarily is still unclear.

1)  Today, LIU Post has 15 varsity sports: football, basketball, baseball, swimming, field hockey, lacrosse, and soccer, among others. This year the university announced the addition of seven NCAA Division II sports. Those sports are men’s and women’s indoor and outdoor track and field, women’s golf, women’s fencing, and wrestling.
 
2)  In the university alma mater, one of the verses refers to College Hall, a historic mansion on Campus that is used today as the Admission’s Office.
 
3)  LIU Post University was founded on November 29, 1954, which was the 100th anniversary of Charles William Post’s birth (1854-1914).
 
4)  The school colors are Green and Gold. Green symbolizes the Campus’ expansive green lawns, small hillsides, and magnificent trees. Gold represents the location of the campus on Long Island’s glittering Gold Coast, an exclusive affluent community featuring mansions and private estates.
 
5)  The Tilles Center for Performing Arts was originally called the Bush- Brown Concert Theater, named after LIU Chancellor Dr. Albert Bush- Brown who resigned in 1985.
6)  The rose arbor and all gardens on the estate were originally created by Marian Cruger Coffin, a very famous landscape architect during the 1920s.
7)  Coffin attended MIT and was given all kinds of roadblocks to build the arches on campus. Therefore, they were nicknamed the “Gates of Hell.”
8)  The brick arches at one time had roses all over them and ended in a round rose garden with a bench built in the wall. There were also chains connecting to all the pillars for roses to grow around. The circles and the round rose garden portion is considered Coffin’s trademark. The arches were recently restored.
9)  The best of Coffin’s work on the estate was considered Hillwood. She designed the plans for the building.
10)  In the 1960s, LIU Post had Democratic and Republican student clubs. This year, a Republican club has been reinstated on campus. There is no Democratic or other political party club today.

Everyone knows the cost of living is high, especially when one is on a college budget. School tuition, room and board, and expensive textbooks are just some of the reasons why it is financially difficult to be a college student in 2014. Of course, we all want some extra spending money to buy what we want and to do fun activities with friends over the weekend. Consider yourself lucky if your parents are well-off enough to pay for all your college expenses without asking for any help on your part. Most college-aged students maintain a part-time job of some sort while enrolled in college; others just work throughout the summer as counselors at day camps or other seasonal jobs.
For students looking for a job throughout the school year, JobNet is an invaluable tool to aid you in finding jobs, as well as internships, both on and off campus. Not only is this online job database available for current students at LIU Post to use, it is even open to alumni. JobNet can also help you build your resume and cover letters by giving tips on exactly what future employers are looking for.
JobNet is a career-centered service that specializes in teaching candidates the necessary skills to be hired, and in matching employers to those job hunters. The Office of Career Services, located in Kumble Hall, encourages students to register for JobNet through their LIU student accounts. Registering is simple; all you have to do is fill out a quick survey about you and what good qualities you have to offer for a job, such as being bilingual or having good work ethics.
JobNet is a super easy website to use. It even includes an updated calendar with dates of recruitment workshops on campus, in addition to a resume builder that allows you to enter your achievements and then format a resume correctly. On the left hand side of JobNet’s home page, one tab is the Resource Library with informative attachments one can be downloaded. The attachments include a users guide for JobNet, career fair tips, identifying fraudulent and scam job postings, and medical school resources, just to name a few.
Searching for jobs and narrowing it down by certain criteria can also be completed on JobNet. A “Favorites” tab is available for you to see a job advertisement or opportunity you may be interested in and want to come back to later. Underneath the “My Activity” tab, JobNet users are able to see referrals every time either their resume is sent to an employer, or if they view it. The tab allows you to track your
job placement, and organize your job interview times in an easy-to-read configuration.
If you are looking to make a little more money on the side, or are in need of a serious full-time job but are unsure of how or where to get started, give JobNet a try: https://pep.liu.edu/liu/student/ The hours of the Career Services Office are Monday through Thursday 9a.m.-7p.m. and Friday 9a.m.-5p.m.

Last year, there was a lot of buzz about changes being made to Hillwood Commons and this year there will be more. On top of The Student Body boutique, The Post Treat Shoppe, and The End Zone that opened last year, as well as the re-named movie theater, three more businesses are planned.
All of these changes are costing students more than they are gaining. Not only does building these amenities cost money, but it has also cost students a computer lab that was so convenient to stop into on your way to class if you needed to print something out. Students also had to readjust to the game room being relocated downstairs, as well as losing some extra seating during common hour, where The End Zone now rests.
“I really don’t understand why the school can complain about money and raise tuition when they can afford to do all of these pointless things to Hillwood,” Jacklyn Stringham, a senior Public Relations major, said. “This is a school, not a mall.” Many other students felt similarly to Stringham: this is not supposed to be a mall, but a school.
Students have complained that the boutique is ridiculous and overpriced, especially for college students, and that’s not the only thing they complained was overpriced. “Why would I spend $10 on candy at the candy store, when I can get candy much cheaper at the Hillwood café?” Christina Scozzari, a senior Broadcasting major, said.
One change that students don’t seem to mind is the revamping of the theater to create “The Gold Coast Movie Theater.” This offers students an opportunity to watch movies that were in theaters before they are released on DVD and cable. This amenity not only offers free admission for students, but free snacks as well. You can find the list of movies that are scheduled to play on the schools website, along with the dates and times of these showings. Unfortunately, this is the only added amenity that is free.
Students can only wonder, “What will be next?” If you have any further questions about the changes being made to Hillwood, you can always go to the Information Desk across from the candy store in Hillwood Commons.

Sept. 22 was the second annual “Car Free Day,” a day where students and faculty were urged to carpool and use less car fuel. While at first glance it seems like a great concept, I don’t think that it is the most effective tool in the fight against climate change because I don’t believe people are using their resources in the best way possible.
With all of this talk about climate change and pollution, one would think that we would start to make changes in the way we live
our lives to reduce our impact on the world. While the “Car Free Day” seems like a great idea, it seems to be a bit farfetched. The sponsors want us to fill out a form as a pledge to ditch our cars for the day, but that isn’t going to accomplish anything. It makes it too easy for us to cry “environmentalist” without making much change. It might encourage us to go without our cars for the day, but what happens after the day
is over? We all go right back to the way things were, without any real impact.
Change is necessary, but it isn’t feasible with the way things
are right now. Public transportation takes far too much time out of our already busy schedules to be used on a steady basis. It seems that we are already too far gone for a “Car Free Day” to be the force behind any kind of environmental change.
Sarah Pomerenke, a senior International Studies and Geology major from the Sustainability Committee said, “You would have to re-do the entire infrastructure to get more trains and better train systems, to get people to want to use them. If people don’t want to use public transportation because it’s difficult and time consuming, it’s hard to expect them to stop driving to take trains and buses.”
Personally, it would take a lot for me to give up the use of my car. I love the convenience of being able to go where I want, when I want. I like having privacy on my commute, rather than being surrounded by cranky strangers who all seem to be in a rush, and I’ve never felt overly safe on a bike. While I definitely understand the negative impacts that it has on the environment, like many people, I choose to ignore them out of convenience.
I think the major problem with the “Car Free Day” is in its title. It is a car free day. I don’t think that all efforts to reduce pollution should be centered on a single day and then be forgotten. The sponsors should be pushing for legislation for better transportation and raising awareness for the negative impacts that cars have year-round, because that’s what it’s going to take to make any kind of real change.
I’m all for saving the planet, but I think that we really need to take a step back and see if what we’re doing is effective. Right now, I don’t think it is.

Have you ever sat in a class and questioned to yourself why the class amused you? Or why it seemed so boring? Was it because of the subject or was it because of the professor? Well, I believe that no matter how much you dislike a subject, if your professor interacts with the class and shows his or her passion for teaching, you will end up loving the class. John Henrik Clarke once said, “A good teacher, like a good entertainer, first must hold his audience’s attention, then he can teach his lesson.”
How many of us walk into a class, find a professor so enthusiastic about the subject, and decide to drop the class? Generally, none! When we see that a professor is enjoying every moment of the class, we also enjoy attending the class. Good teaching involves passion. The professor should not only be able to motivate students, but also be able to teach them the content.
Professors that are enthusiastic about their work will make sure their students learn in a way that is memorable and relevant. A good professor would care for his or her passion and will convey that passion to the students. Charles Kuralt once said, “Good teachers know how to bring out the best in students.”
Teaching certainly does not mean opening up a textbook and trying to force the students to absorb all the information. A good professor is someone who understands the students; who understands that the only way the students can learn something is if you walk them through it little by little.
“It’s best for the professor to interact with the students because [they] will feel more comfortable knowing that their professor is able to understand them and help them through anything. Also, this will make the students want to enjoy learning and not wasting their tuition money.” Awais Chaudhary, a senior Psychology major, said. Certainly, the best way of teaching is to understand the students’ abilities. The professor should be able to nurture his students through this, develop their mind and enhance their talent.
Sometimes, going through examples is not always the best way of explaining and that’s where interacting comes in action. When a professor interacts with the class, it gives the students a chance to speak out and ask for help openly. “When professors get the students involved, it helps each student express themselves and learn more. They learn more because when they give their opinions, the professor can elaborate the opinion/answer and help explain,” Alexandra Botie, a junior accounting major, said.
Knowledge is a gift we will carry with us our entire lives. Therefore, no student should sit in class and waste his or her time. Instead, you should focus and if you feel like there is something the professor is doing wrong and you don’t understand, don’t be shy and ask. Letting the professor know what works best for you can sometimes make the professor rethink his teaching style. Last but not the least, Guy Kawasaki once said, “If you have to put someone on a pedestal, put teachers. They are society’s heroes.”

Classes, school — words that have an automatic response of a ‘sigh’ or an ‘argh’. However, although I once was one of these students, I have to say I have loved my first couple weeks of my new classes and lectures. Whether this is because of my professors, my classmates, the subjects I’m taking, or whether it is just a collective notion of academics that has brought this feeling of fulfillment to me (which I doubt), I cannot say. But by the end of this column, I want to see if I can get my fellow students — yes you — to enjoy the perks that college classes offer, like I have.
I am not like most overseas students partaking in this rollercoaster journey who have come to America solely to fulfill the dream of a perfect academic grade. No. I have also come here to pursue
a career in football (which you, unlike the rest of the world, for some reason call “soccer”). Being from England, “soccer” is huge. However, the development of the sport in the last few years here in America has been dramatic and simply fascinating. When my coach, Andreas Lindberg, was talking about “student-athletes,” I snubbed the idea. I thought, “Yeah, soccer is the thing I am going to concentrate on. School? Please…” I sound like a real jock that doesn’t have anything between my ears. But since I have been around this beautiful culture of erudition — where the development of wisdom and academic brilliance ties in with crazy sports fans (you Americans have tons of them), intense hard work, and athletic greatness — this “student-athlete” idea resonates with me.
I have started to understand what it means not only to the university, but to the other athletes as well. While for many students
the struggle to understand the importance of academics has never been the case, to me, in the past, it has. But as my own mentality is changing, schoolwork has made me realize I could be getting somewhere else away from soccer, such as becoming a sports psychiatrist.
When I landed from that plane journey from London, where my bum was numb and my legs were sore, it finally struck me that I
am actually in New York. I thought, “my time has come,” and of course this was in a sporting sense. It wasn’t until I had experienced the crazy, bright, and captivating lights and culture of “The Big Apple,” and taken the long journey from Penn Station to Long Island, and then a taxi to the enchanting world of “Pioneer Country,” when it hit me that football (soccer) wasn’t the only thing that brought me here, and it wasn’t the only part that made me shake with excitement. Deep down I couldn’t wait to start a new chapter of widening my knowledge and learning so many different things, not only in an academic sense, but in life as well.
So as the inferno and pain of pre-season infected my body and soul, I went into it with an open and excited mind; a mind that couldn’t wait to be part of this student-athlete culture and start college classes. However, when I was running that two-mile test, I certainly wasn’t thinking about anything else apart from the end of it.
My good friend and housemate, Oliver Hollingsaeter, a freshman like myself, who is also on the men’s soccer team, came to LIU Post this year. He came here to pursue a dream of getting a master’s in business. He wanted to excel in his academic studies to reach this aspiration. When Oliver was planning on making the move from Alesund, Norway, he knew academics were just as important — or maybe even more so — than soccer. This doesn’t mean he has scrapped the idea of becoming a professional “baller,” but has rather realized that gaining a great degree, such as an MBA, is an amazing asset to have. This is the same with me since I needed something to trigger that realization, and now that it has kicked in, I feel unstoppable. Well, maybe not in math…

WCWP (88.1 FM), the campus’ radio station, will be hosting a free party on the Hillwood Commons rooftop during common hour on Sept. 24. The station will be treating Post students to free food, give- aways, and live music. “It’ll be a huge blowout! We want to get our voice and the students’ voices out there – from videos, to live routines, to mu- sic,” said Christina Kay, WCWP’s assistant program director. “It’s really a good way to see who we are [and] what we do. It’s definitely something different to do during common hour”.
A DJ and live band will be present, with a performance by Trish Torrales, a senior Broadcasting major. According to Daniel Cox, director of Broadcasting at WCWP, Torrales is very versatile. “Trish does rock, country, pop – she does it all,” he said.
“[It’s] not only about us, but about the students, too,” said Kay. There will be giveaways at the party for all in attendance, including t- shirts with the station’s logo.
Will Bruner, the promotions and sales director of WCWP, said that their objective this semester is to try to get new faces involved with the station. “We like to help increase the ambitions of our students,” said Bruner. “We love to bring innovative and fun broadcasts, as well as emphasize that everyone should come to our events.”
“Midday Madness,” a student-run live show, brings entertain- ment and information about what is happening on campus. Students can tune into WCWP’s “Midday Madness” on 88.1 FM or channel 95, Mon- day through Thursday from 12:30 p.m. to 1:45 p.m.
It can also be heard in Hillwood Commons over the loudspeakers, as well as on the station’s website at mywcwp.org. “The Pioneer Newscast,” a five-minute broadcast that relays the news featured in the paper, can also be heard at this time, and is hosted by Jaclyn Gangi and Julian Wilson. The staff of WCWP has a few more events up their sleeve. Up- coming live radio play performances of “The Philadelphia Story,” “War of the Worlds,” and “It’s a Wonderful Life” will be performed at the Hillwood Recital Hall of the Tilles Center during the semester, starting on Sept. 27 at 1 p.m. These performances will be streamed live on the website, and will be performed by the Play Troupe of Port Washington.
“We’ll be doing our own tribute [to each of the performances.] We [will] present different genres of music for students to hear,” said Bruner. Tickets can be bought online via the radio’s website. The price for general admission is $10. For more information, check out their web- site at mywcwp.org.
The Tilles Center representatives will also be making an appear- ance at the rooftop party in an effort to promote MTV’s new official live show, “Guy Code + Girl Code Comedy Tour.” The MTV and MTV2 televi- sion series, “Guy Code and Girl Code” have merged to create this perfor- mance, which will be held at the Tilles Center on Oct. 10. The comedy tour will feature the TV celebrities of “Girl Code,” Nessa and Jamie Lee, as well as Damien Lemon and Andrew Schulz of “Guy Code.” Tickets can be purchased online at tillescenter.org.

Between Aug. 15 and 17, students from LIU Post’s Film department participated in and won the 2nd Annual Huntington Cinema Arts Centre’s 48-Hour Filmmaking Contest. The contest challenged local filmmakers to create a short film in just one weekend, starting at 7 p.m. on a Friday, and having the finished piece done by the same time on Sunday.
11 groups were assigned a random genre, and all had to employ a strict set of required elements. This year’s elements included a character being named “Prudence Barebones,” the imagery of a doll dropping to the floor, and the line “You fool, those were my mother’s feathers!” For an added challenge, each film needed to be clocked in at less than five minutes.
The event was sponsored by Sparkboom, a project of the Hun- tington Arts Council funded by the New York State Council on the Arts. Judging was conducted by film industry professionals from various institutions nation-wide, and culminated in a special screening of all contenders on Aug. 28, where the winner was announced.
Team leader Andrew Barell, a senior Film student, met the challenge. His company, Requiem for a Team, was victorious with their comedic short “Dating 101 – In The Apocalypse.” The short centers on finding love when you’re one of the last people on Earth, and lampoons the “end of the world” genre. Team members included Barell, his brother Peter (a junior Film major), and seniors Connor Gaffey, Mabel Santos Haugen, and George Cayea. The crew received additional aid from senior Michael Mirabella, and sound designer Thomas Saltman, a 2010 LIU Post alumnus. Michael Staffieri offered his acting talent, along with actress Megan Kapler.
“My experience with the festival was great,” exclaimed Barell. “I got everybody together, managed the whole weekend, and then edited what we came up with on Final Cut Pro. We participated in the festival last year and had a blast, but didn’t win. We learned a lot from last time and formulated a new strategy to improve our chances of winning.”
Despite the time constraints and logistical problems attributed to making films, this year the team was more organized, even with fewer members. “It was tough figuring out what we were going to write, and staying up late makes you crazy. But my brother, Pete, a junior Film ma- jor, came through with an awesome script that we ended up going with,” said Barell.
Gaffey, who served as director, explained more about the difficul- ties of making a short film: “The hardest part about making a short film is spending thousands [of dollars] to make it, knowing it will
not make any back because of a near non-existent sale with short films.
It’s almost a very expensive business card. Once we get to these festivals, we are always meeting new people who are aspiring storytellers, and we work from there with new relationships to start bigger projects.”
“Dating 101” did not require such a large budget, but over $100 was spent on food and utility costs. The money was made back with the first place prize of $500, and having the film screened at the Cinema Arts Centre.
Professor Susan Zeig, the head of the university’s Film department, expressed her excitement for the student’s win and involvement in the contest: “I am proud of their talent and their drive,” Zeig said. “Each of the people who were part of the team is a promising young filmmaker with interesting projects in their future. The 48-Hour Festival is an excellent way for students to solidify their ability to work together, to practice their craft with an extreme deadline, and to try out new ideas. I am very glad they entered, and of course it is extra nice that they actually won.”
LIU Post students currently have many film projects in the works right now. Among them, Mirabella, Barell, and Cayea, have thesis shorts that will be shot at the beginning of October. Barell is currently in pre-production for his thesis short film, titled “Bluebird Weather.”
“We just launched our Kickstarter campaign, and hope to get funding so we can shoot in late October,” he said. There is also a Facebook page for the film, with frequent updates.
“I plan to send this film to festivals around the world, and have been loving the process of getting it made,” continued Barell. “I usually am a cinematographer but being able to step out from behind the camera and write, direct, and produce has been awesome.”
Gaffey has started his own production company called Dreamcatcher Pictures, LLC. “It will give us a name to label our outgoing films, and stand as an entity for investor relations to correspond with,” he said. “We currently have a no-budget feature film hitting the submission market within the next month, and I am currently producing two thesis films at Post with Andrew Barell and George Cayea.”
In addition, Gaffey’s thesis film, “Washington Boulevard,” has crossed the pond to France. “The lead actor in my thesis film was visiting France during the Cannes Film Festival, and [we were] able to set up a screening there as part of the Marché du Film,” said Gaffey. “We continued the summer screening at the Downtown LA Film Festival, as well as Long Beach International, where I won Best Student Film.”
Stay tuned for more information regarding student films and projects. In addition to thesis films, the school has commenced its production lab class, which will include four new projects.

Last week, the New York State Governor’s Office for Motion Picture and TV Development sent representatives to conduct a seminar for LIU Post students. The free event, hosted by the Film department, was held during common hour in Kahn, room 119. Locations Department Manager Dwight Craver and Deputy Director Jerry Stoeffhaas discussed the process of acquiring a location for filming, and how their office may aid in that effort.
Pizza and drinks were provided, as around 40 Film students
and professors turned out for information about the basics of scouting locations, the application of the office’s website (nylovesfilm.com), and free services for finding locations within the state that are both cost- effective and legal. Craver and Stoeffhaas detailed Governor Cuomo’s extension and enhancement of the New York State’s Film and Television tax credit incentives, which help alleviate costs for feature film and television pilot productions
Kathy Mendall and Theresa Duggan, director and associate directors of conference services, were contacted by Craver several weeks ago to set up the seminar as a part of a new effort to generate awareness for his offices. “This is the first school they’ve [visited] to talk about locations with film student[s],” said Mandall. “They are very invested in having the film students stay here in New York, and really growing the industry in the state.
While most Film students at LIU are working on short films, and are not yet applying for tax credit incentives that require a larger budget and crew, the information proved valuable as an insight to future endeavors. Film students expressed their gratitude about the free services that may help them in finding hard-to-create locations for films they are currently working on.
“I think it’s the hardest thing, people trying to visualize themselves in the future,” said Susan Zeig, a Film program director. Zeig assisted with gathering the student body for the event, and spoke about the importance of resources and networking within the substantial film industry.
“To be able to say ‘could you help us with a hospital room, a jail, or a road?’ and have them say ‘yes’ is very important,” continued Zeig. “For people to see that it is an art and a business, part of our culture, [and that] there are so many ways to get yourself involved in it if you follow your nose, it’s very satisfying. That’s the most important part for me.”
Sophomore Film major Nicholas D’Agosta said, “I will definitely use this information to help me with my film projects for the future. It’s always good to know that there are services willing to help filmmakers do their thing.”
“I was unaware of many of the particulars of locating and securing locations,” said senior Film major Mike Mirabella, who is currently working on his thesis film, a story set in the 1920s. “They helped clarify a lot of these potential issues and requirements, in addition to being very supportive in offering whatever help they can in ensuring we as filmmakers are happy, and successfully find locations that have the right look for our film.”
Katie Mulz, a junior Film major, was one of several students who agreed that similar events would be beneficial to Post’s Film community. “I would like to have maybe a special effects or an animation event,” said Mulz.
Errol Nicholson, another junior Film major, said that he would like to see seminars about internships and acquiring job opportunities of more tangible benefits for the student body. “The Film department tends to get people to talk about what they do in the industry, and that’s great, but at the end of the day it would be nice if those people offered us an internship or job opportunities because that is more likely to help us in the long run,” said Nicholson.
The university has served as a location for several film productions in the last few years. Most recently, the campus was home to shoots for the television shows “Madame Secretary” and “Hostages,” as well as films like “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “The Rewrite.”
LIU Post has hosted film lectures, screenings, and Q-and-As in the past with filmmakers such as Jim Jarmanuk, Nick Singer, Tom Gilroy, David Posamentier, Geoff Moore, and Norman Steinberg, a professor at LIU Brooklyn’s TV Writer Studio.
“The school is looking to have more filming on campus,” said Mendall. “[President] Cline is looking to work with more [film productions] on campus, and [continue] these relationships with the NY State Governors’ film office, the Nassau County Film office, and their Head, Debra Markowitz. Having that connection, being able to network with people in the industry, is great.”

On Wednesday, Sept. 17, the men’s soccer team (4-2) took on the Marauders from Millersville, Pa (1-4-1). The Pioneers came out strong and notched their third win of the season in a 3-0 shutout. The Pioneers wasted little time getting going offensively, tallying 11 shots as opposed to three for the visitors, and struck the first goal of the match in the 22nd minute. Graduate midfielder Tom Bowen connected on a free kick from just outside the box. The goal gave the Pioneers the lead, one they never relinquished.
In the second half, freshman forward Jason Lampkin gave
the Pioneers some breathing room with a goal off a pass from junior midfielder Per Forgaard. The score gave LIU a two-goal lead, and boosted the energy levels and momentum for the hosts. Graduate forward Dale McDonald put the cherry on top in an already impressive day for the Pioneers, with a goal in the 72nd minute. The Pioneers enjoyed their third shutout of the season, winning the match handily 3-0.
The Pioneers led the Marauders in shots and corner kicks for the match while junior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom kept the visitors off the board. The Pioneers hit the field again on Saturday, Sept. 20 to face off against the Spartans from Saint Thomas Aquinas College (1-2-2).
The Spartans got off to a quick start in Brookville N.Y., as senior back Laurie Child connected for a goal in the ninth minute of action to give his squad the lead. The early goal stood until the 32nd minute, when McDonald sent a header passed the Spartan goalkeeper, thanks to an assist from freshman midfielder Harry Pearse. With the score tied at one and halftime approaching, the intensity level picked up and the Spartans were awarded a penalty kick that they converted, giving them a 2-1 lead over LIU.
As the second half played on, the Pioneers were able to tie the game in the 55th minute via a McDonald cross that found the feet of sophomore back Johannes Forgaard, who in turn found the back of the net to even the score at two. Less than 10 minutes later, the Pioneers sent another cross into enemy territory and senior forward Eivind Austboe headed the goal to give the Green and Gold the go-ahead and eventual game-winning goal.
For the match, the Pioneers held a 20-5 advantage in shots as well as a 12-3 advantage in corner kicks. Head coach Andreas Lindberg and the Pioneers return to action on Wednesday, Sept. 24 when they battle the Lions of Molloy College. Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m.

The Pioneers (4-1) took on Southern New Hampshire on Wednesday, Sept. 17, in Manchester N.H., and survived a late revival
of life from the Penmen. A very defensive and physical first half limited Pioneer scoring chances, but they got a golden opportunity when they got a corner kick in the 37th minute. Junior forward Susanne Vistnes was the recipient of a pass from senior back Lauren Bellone. The goal put the Pioneers on the board, and gave them a lead they would not forgo.
In the second half, the Pioneers connected for another goal, this time sophomore forward Julia Backman was given a precise pass from Vistnes. The goal proved to be the game winner after a late goal by the Penmen made the score 2-1.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Sept. 20, when they welcomed fellow East Coast Conference opponent St. Thomas Aquinas to Brookville, N.Y. The Pioneers took some time to get going offensively, but like the saying goes, “all good things take time.”
After a scoreless 30 minutes for each side, the Pioneers struck first. Backman notched her second goal in as many games, giving the Pi- oneers the early edge and the momentum. Less than nine minutes later, the Green Machine was back for more as Vistnes connected for a goal, her first of three that afternoon. It was clear the offense was working well; they scored three goals in each half. The capper for the match came when freshman forward Alex Lynn scored the sixth goal of the game for the Pioneers in the 65th minute. The Pioneers cruised to a 6-1 victory.
The Green and Gold outshot the Spartans 22-3 for the day, and also had their goalkeepers protect the nes well, only allowing one goal. The win was the fourth in a row for the Pioneers, and they will their con- fidence and momentum from the streak with them when they play the Bears from NYIT in the “Battle of the Boulevard” on Saturday. Sept. 27.

After a tight 6-5 win in the season opener at Princeton University on Saturday, Sept. 20, the LIU Post ice hockey team started their 25-game seasonal route in the right direction. Now, the co-educational club is striving to raise awareness and participation from fellow students in order to reach their set goal for the season: to be ranked top ten in their Conference.
The Pioneer squad counts 18 at the moment, with a mixture of both locals as well as international skaters. Although the facilities are located in Great Neck N.Y., about a 10-minute drive from LIU Post campus, the team is optimistic to see cheering fans at home games. “We are working on getting shuttles to drive Pioneer fans to the home games during the season, which would make it easy for supporters to come see us play,” sophomore international student Maximilian Riesterer said.
As members of the Division II American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA), the Pioneers face teams from the northeast region, within and around the state of New York. Head Coach Mark Peters, with support from four assistant coaches, works hard with the team. They practice twice on ice with two extra fitness workouts each week, excluding games during weekends. While putting the almost daily effort in for each other, the Pioneers not only seek support, but are willing to give some back. “[Our] team is into promoting charity and [is] willing to support or help any good causes or groups on campus,” Riesterer said.
Riesterer is one of the new players for this season. The opportunity to get an education while playing made his decision to fly overseas an easy one. “What got me here was the combination of big city life and hockey. I mean, who says no to a good university, 45 minutes from Madison Square Garden that allows you to do what you love most?”
The next ice hockey game is set for Sunday, Sept. 27, from the Parkwood Ice Rink in Great Neck against Wagner College at 10:15 p.m.
 
There is still time to try out for the team, if interested. All levels of skaters are welcome. The cost is roughly $1220 for any new member, which covers practice and game ice time, travels, dues, and the yearly membership fees. Contact Rick.Hamilton@liu.edu to find out more.

With only four minutes remaining in regulation, the Pioneers (1-2) held a 17-13 lead over the Warriors of Merrimack College (2-1), but were unable to hold off the hosts who rallied past LIU for the 19-17 victory on Saturday, Sept. 20, at Martone-Mejail Field in North Andover, Mass.
The Warriors drew two crucial defensive penalties during their game-winning drive to
set themselves up with excellent field position at the Pioneer 40-yard line. Just a few plays later, freshman Warrior quarterback Joe Capobianco connected with junior tailback Armond McRae for the 26-yard game-winning score. However, the Pioneers blocked the extra point, which gave red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino the chance to showcase his late-game heroics for
the second straight week. The Pioneers ended
up failing to secure a first down as Laurino’s fourth down pass attempt was batted away by the Warrior defensive line. LIU Post racked up 409 total yards compared to 386 for Merrimack. The Pioneers out-gained their opposition, but the Warriors played tough and won the defensive battle by shutting down the Green and Gold on their final possession.
After leading 3-0 in the early stages of the contest, a 28-yard pass from Laurino to junior tight end Seann Binckes set up the Pioneers with a first and goal from the Warriors’ four-yard line. Two costly penalties knocked the Green and Gold out of field goal range, forcing them to punt. Three possessions later, a Laurino fumble led to a Merrimack score giving them the 7-3 advantage, which would hold up heading into halftime.
As the 3rd quarter commenced, the Pioneers got off to an electric start, and forced the Warriors to turn it over on downs leading to a six-play 52-yard drive, capped off by a four-yard touchdown scramble by Laurino. Holding onto a 10-7 lead into the 4th quarter, the Pioneers allowed the Warriors to regain their momentum as Capobianco hit junior wideout Jere Brown for a 46-yard pass on the opening snap of the period. With the ball at the nine-yard line, the Warriors faced a 3rd-and-goal, where Capobianco fired a bullet to freshman wideout Cody Demers to put Merrimack back ahead 13-10. Senior kicker Nick Zwaan failed to convert on the extra point keeping it a three-point deficit for the Pioneers. Post responded with a vengeance, as Laurino rolled out and threw a 30-yard touchdown pass on third down to Palmer at the 7:46 mark. The Pioneers, who had an impressive 7-of-15 on third down in the game, jumped back in control for the time being and had the lead 17-13.
Laurino finished 20-of-39 for 229 yards and a touchdown. In addition, he picked up 66 yards on the ground and a touchdown. Red-shirt sophomore tailback Mike Williams led the squad with 97 net yards on the ground. Palmer and red- shirt sophomore wideout Shane Hubbard each hauled in seven receptions. Defensively, red-shirt junior linebacker Brandon Cheney and red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti made 13 tackles apiece. Brunetti added a fumble recovery and an interception to his stellar outing. Junior linebacker Jhaleel Oswald forced two fumbles and recorded six tackles.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers look to bounce back as they continue their three-game road trip against NE-10 rival Assumption next Saturday, Sept. 27, in Worcester, Mass. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m.
