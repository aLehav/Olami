A panel on immigration will be held on Wednesday, April 12, between 12:30-2 in the Patrons Lounge at the Tilles Center. Topics will include immigration, DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), a U.S. immigration policyn started by the Obama administration in June 2012 that allows certain immigrants who entered the country as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and eligibility for a work permit.
The speakers on the panel will include Murtzaza Hussain, a journalist, who has been on CNN, BBC, NPR and the Intercept covering the recent immigration order and issues pertaining to Muslim Americans; Susan Gottehrer, the director of the Nassau County Chapter of the ACLU and an adjunct professor at LIU Post who teaches a graduate course on radical social movements, Laura Lemus, special projects coordinator and Maryann Slutsky, executive director from Long Island Wins, will talk about DACA, ICE raid, rapid response network and know your rights training.
Other topics will include sanctuary spaces and local activism (where students have the opportunity to become engaged in organizations that better inform them on immigration issues affecting them at local, national and global levels.) By participating in organizations like the ACLU, Immigrant Rights and Long Island Wins, students can make their voices heard on immigration issues.
Shaireen Rasheed, a professor of philosophical foundations and multiculturalism, encourages all faculty and student organizations to attend. “If you are an international student who has questions you might want to attend this,” she said. “For those of you who want to get involved at the local level in organizations like the ACLU, Long Island Wins and others, representatives from the mentioned organizations and more will be there,” Rasheed said.

As graduation approaches for the class of 2017,  planned, end-of-semester senior events will bring them together for one last time before commencement. April is filled with senior events, including  a graduation fair, cap decorating, paint night and formal, all leading up to the commencement ceremony on May 5. 
The senior events will be held throughout the second half of April. On April 18 and 19, a “grad fair” will be held in the Hillwood Commons from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. “The Grad Fair offers graduates an opportunity to pick up their cap and gown, take senior photos, order a class ring, and take care of other graduation related tasks all at the same time,” Michael Berthel, associate dean of students, said.
Students of all years will line up outside of the Winnick Student Center on Wednesday, April 26 at 9:30 p.m. for Midnight Breakfast. An open buffet, featuring pancakes, waffles, french toast, hash browns, bacon, sausage, fruits and pastries will be available while students listen to music  played by a dj in the main dining area. Students will be able to sign up for free massages in the Long Island room  as a relaxer in preparation for finals week.
A senior formal will be held on April 27 at Jericho Terrace from 7  p.m. to 12 a.m. Buses will depart campus at 6 p.m. from Hillwood Commons. Tickets are $60 and guests are $75.  Each senior may bring one guest, according to the campus concierge, where tickets are being sold. Seniors and their guest may purchase tickets together but pay separately if desired. The formal will include a dinner, open bar and DJ. “I’m excited for senior formal because it is our last celebration together as undergraduates,” Alyssa Navas, a senior dance major said.
Senior events will continue on May 1 for senior paint night. Tickets are $10 and limited one per LIU senior ID. From 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. soon-to-be graduates will enjoy paint night at the End Zone in the Hillwood Commons.  According to Berthel, wine will be an option for all seniors at least 21 years of age. On May 2, a cap decorating event will take place in the End Zone for those interested in making their graduation cap unique.
On the eve of graduation, at 8 p.m., graduating seniors will join together, clinking champagne glasses for the traditional senior toast on the patio of the mansion, overlooking the tent that they will be under the next morning. “The night will include a passed-down speech from the student government president, music, and an opportunity for graduates to reflect on their time at LIU,” Berthel said.  “I think the toast at the mansion is very honorable and makes me feel proud to be an LIU Post graduate,” Navas said. The Nassau Community College transfer says she is grateful for Post’s events as her prior school “would never have something so intimate.”
Commencement is the final event of the week, with the entrance of graduates beginning at 10 a.m. Seating will be first come, first serve under the tent, with additional seating in Tilles, where a live stream will be presented. No tickets are required to attend the ceremony.
“We received a very positive response from senior week last year,” Berthel said. All of the events are designed to celebrate the class of 2017 and to end the seniors’ LIU undergraduate career on a positive and memorable note.”
Tickets for senior events, including the formal and paint night, can be purchased at the Campus Concierge Desk in the Hillwood Commons. Ticket purchases will be open through April 10.

Last year, the office of campus life installed an alarm system connected to the four side doors of Brookville Hall. The alarm goes off between the hours of 7p.m. and 7a.m. if the doors are opened. The alarm repeats, “Warning, warning, you have violated an area of protection. Violation security system. The authorities have been notified. Leave immediately.”
Although this alarm is intended to provide safety for Brookville’s residents, it has also caused concerns.
The alarm is very loud and if students keep the doors propped open throughout the night, residents who live close by are woken up or cannot sleep. Many students in Brookville leave the side doors propped open because they do not want to walk to the main entrance at the front of the building.
On Sunday, March 26, a resident placed a sign on a dorm room window directly above a side door asking residents to keep the side door closed. Another sign was placed on the side door closest to the chapel on March 27, again asking residents to keep the side door closed.
Samantha Negron, a senior broadcasting major who resides in Brookville, said, “It’s getting out of hand with the side door. I’m constantly woken up in the middle of the night by the alarm going off. The door never gets closed all of the way and I have to go downstairs to close it in the middle of the night.” Negron said she spoke with both the CLC, who is the person in charge of Brookville hall, and the hall’s security, and both told her they are taking care of it. Negron has yet to see any changes. “I’m just frustrated. I pay alot of money to live in a room where I’m constantly disturbed. It’s affecting my sleep and concentration greatly,” she said.
Breana Rowe, a junior public relations major, who also resides in Brookville, said, “I hear it all the time, at night like at 3 a.m.” Rowe said she’s lucky because she is a heavy sleeper so it does not wake her up as much as other students. What annoys Rowe the most is the people who bang on the dorm windows closest to the side doors asking for residents to open the door for them. Representatives from the office of campus life have yet to respond to inquiries about the ongoing issue.

Reliable wireless internet access on campus is crucial for students. It helps them complete their work while they are between classes, in the dorms, or on other parts of the campus. It’s also used to leisurely watch Netflix in between classes.
In the past, some students have expressed frustration with the performance of the wireless internet on campus. The strength of the connection in many areas is poor, which forces students to complete their work somewhere that might not be the most convenient.
Freshman fashion merchandising major Melissa Lysse is one of the students having trouble with the university’s wireless internet. At first, Lysse thought it was only her phone having difficulty. Over time, she realized it was not her phone, but the school’s internet. “It works sometimes,” she said. “ [Other times] it just doesn’t work, it’s like I have no Wi-Fi at all. Upon their return from spring break, a new Wi-Fi login screen greeted students, and Lysse and others have noticed a bit of an increase in performance.
Freshman digital arts and design major Thomas Farrell uses the Wi-Fi quite often in Hillwood Commons. He has noticed that “the Wi-Fi strength varies in several locations around the school.” “In the library, the Wi-Fi is not bad at all. When you get to Hillwood Commons, the Wi-Fi isn’t that strong,” Farrell said. Despite the shortcomings with connection strength, the difficulty connecting to the internet has not affected Farrell’s ability to get his work done. “As long as I know where the strong areas are…then I’ll be able to work,” he said. Farrell notes that the Wi-Fi connection is often stronger in the morning, when there is less traffic.
Sophomore psychology major Corey Mitchell also has had trouble with the Wi-Fi. “It’s pretty bad. There’s very few spots where it’s actually strong. Most spots take a pretty long time to load,” he said. Mitchell said one of the weakest spots for internet is Pell Hall, while Humanities Hall and Hillwood Commons rank among the best in his opinion. Poor connectivity has affected Mitchell’s ability to get his assignments completed.
“I’ll need to go on a website for [an assignment] and it just won’t load,” Mitchell said. He feels as if it’s gotten worse over time. Mitchell has not noticed an improvement in performance after spring break.
Freshman business administration major Michael Orlik, has noticed the shoddy Wi- Fi connectivity. “The Wi-Fi was always inconsistent. It would end up disconnecting [me] and I’d have to reconnect…sometimes it wouldn’t connect anymore,” he said. In Orlik’s experience, Hillwood has the weakest connection strength. He recommends going to one of the neighboring buildings such as Khan. While losing progress on documents isn’t always an issue, when using Google Docs, Orlik admits he must be careful not to lose any documents.
Esther Cho, senior director of the Information Technology department confirmed that, “over spring break, we upgraded LIU’s wireless portal. The upgraded system includes a new login page for LIUNET, an improved user experience, an easier registration process for guests and some basic security improvements.”

After seven years of service to the LIU community, university nurse, Constance Montalbano retired on Feb. 28, 2017. The staff at the Center for Healthy Living agreed that Montalbano’s presence in Pell Hall will be missed. Montalbano was loved by her staff and colleagues. “There are no negative words to describe her,” Lynne Schwartz, Director of the Center for Healthy Living, said. “She’s on to the next venture in life. We all wish her well.”
Montalbano’s retirement has left a vacancy in the registered nurse position for the Center of Healthy Living. In her absence, students are unable to receive health care on campus or referrals for specialized care or treatment. The campus health center was moved to NYIT in 2014, when the campus no longer provided a doctor nor on-campus ambulance service. Health care services for LIU Post students is available at the NYIT Academic Health Center.
While the search for a replacement nurse is being conducted, students are being seen by the staff, consisted of part-time counseling consultants, at the Center for Healthy Living in Pell Hall, room 154. LIU staff members refer students to NYIT for any student that needs medical services, or students can contact the center directly at 516-686-1300.
If the student does not have a car to travel to NYIT, the university will provide them with transportation via shuttle service, according to Schwartz. In the case of an emergency, in accordance with university protocol, Public Safety and/or a Northwell Health System ambulance will be called for immediate attention to the situation. “[So far] everything has been going very smoothly,” Schwartz said. Representatives from the NYIT Academic Health Center did not respond back to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the recent services provided for Post students since Montalbano’s retirement.
There are plans to replace Montalbano with a new nurse on campus. The Human Resources Department is working with the Dean of Students and the Center for Healthy Living staff to interview qualified NY State licensed registered nurses(RNs) or licensed practical nurses (LPNs) with clinical experience in a healthcare setting and experience in a college clinical, health or medical setting, according to Abigail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students. Other qualifications for the replacement include a degree from an accredited nursing program and current CPR/AED and First Aid Certifications.

U.S. Representative Adam Schiff will speak on campus on Friday, April 7 at 10:30 in Kahn Hall, Room 119, as part of a student-leader event hosted by the LIU Global Institute. Congressman Schiff, a Democrat who represents California’s 28th congressional district, is in his eighth term in the House of Representatives and is currently the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The House Intelligence Committee is currently looking into President Trump’s ties with Russia after reports of the country’s alleged involvement with the 2016 presidential election emerged.
The event will include Q&A with former Congressman Steven Israel, who joined LIU in January as Chair of the new Global Institute. When speaking about the significance of Schiff visiting campus, Dr. Amy Freedman, Chair of the Political Science and International Studies Department said “given the investigations of the Trump administration’s ties to Russia and the ongoing investigations in the House, Senate, and FBI, this is a fantastic opportunity to learn more about what the process is and the possible outcomes.”
This will be the second event hosted by the LIU Global Institute; the first event was a speech and Q&A by General Colin Powell at the Tilles Center on March 2. The Pioneer previously reported about this event on March 7.
Since Congressman Schiff is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, “he is the perfect person to ask about these issues. Students who are interested in foreign affairs, or in checks on Presidential power would be well advised to attend the event,” Freedman said.

Representatives of The American Society for Quality (ASQ), a global community of “knowledge-based quality professionals,” will hold a “Quality and Innovation” conference on campus on Friday, April 21 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the College of Management Incubator in the basement of the library, room 127.
The conference is an opportunity for students to network and learn about, “promoting and advancing quality tools, principles, and practices in their workplaces and communities.” Members of ASQ will explain to students various ways of improving customer experience. Brian Galli, assistant professor in the college of management, defines quality as, “Meeting users’ expectations defect-free and doing it right the first time.”
ASQ is made up of divisions that each focus on different industries, including health-care, manufacturing and education, and all pertain to assuring quality in a selected field. Galli, who is a member of ASQ, explained that the group does “everything from improving processes, to new product development, to improving [the quality of] education, to government and all different areas.”
Five speakers will cover quality and innovation “in relation to education, health-care, computer science, business, technology, and even one on environmental sustainability.”
ASQ emphasizes product improvement and enhancement, aiming to achieve overall customer satisfaction. Galli anticipates this conference “shows [students] the role that quality plays in a wide variety of different industries, and at the same time that it brings some more notoriety to the university and the great diverse programs that we have.”
Admission to the conference is free, and registration begins at 9:30 a.m. All students are invited to attend. “The event is good for all students, but those especially in: health professions, environment science, management, business, technology, computer science, design and gaming, and entrepreneurship,” Galli said.

On Feb. 6, the Palmer School of Library and Information Sciences was awarded a $500,000 grant from the Robert David Lion Gardiner Foundation. “The Robert David Lion Gardiner Foundation, an independent charity, established in 1987, supports the study of New York State history. The grant is going to be used to “digitize materials in the collections of local historical societies,” Gregory Hunter, professor of library and information science, and leader of the doctoral program at the Palmer School.
According to a Feb. 27 press release from the University, “With the Gardiner Foundation’s grant, LIU will digitize and preserve a collection of historical documents currently held by historical societies across Long Island, with a particular emphasis on Suffolk County.”
Kathryn Curran, Executive Director of the RDLG Foundation said, “ After intense site visits I realized that many of our Long Island historical societies have wonderful collections that have never been catalogued or properly managed. I was aware of the Palmer Library, I approached LIU for a proposal for our support to their archivist program. I approached President Cline and the Library School working with Dr. Hunter [and] they applied for a Gardiner Grant.
Hunter will lead the project to digitize and preserve historical documents that are being held by historical societies across Long Island. “Most of the digitization will take place in the local historical societies. Some items may require special handling, because of size, format, or physical condition. With the permission of the historical society, we will digitize these items in our lab at the Palmer School,” Hunter stated. The historical documents will then be showcased at an annual Gardiner Symposium, an event to highlight the rich resources in the local historical societies.
LIU Post graduate and masters students will be working on the digitization project. Hunter will begin conducting assessments with the local historical societies to determine which students will be participating in the project. The grant includes scholarships for 9 students and 2 Ph.D students at the Palmer School. Students will be “digitizing historical documents, creating descriptive information (metadata) about them, performing quality control checks, and loading the images into a cloud-based digital archives,” Hunter said.
“Students will be digitizing the materials at either at LIU or on site at the historical societies, however Dr. Hunter thinks best after assessing the historical societies’ collections,” “The grant will be used to catalogue and digitize historical archives. Students will be going to the historical societies and working with them for first hand archivist experience. This will also help the historic society to learn how to handle its collections, as well as being able to share these items for research,” said Curran.
“In the digital age, the work of archivists and librarians has changed in exciting ways. Our Gardiner Project is an indication of the new career paths open in these professions,” Hunter said.
In the press release, President Cline stated, “Long Island University is proud to partner our nationally recognized Palmer School with the resources of the Robert David Lion Gardner Foundation to help preserve Long Island’s history.”

Rebecca Sapan, a senior broadcasting major, transferred to LIU Post in fall 2016 from the now-defunct Dowling College. Sapan runs a fashion blog called “The Wardrobe Style.”
The Pioneer: What is your job outside of school?
Rebecca Sapan: I intern at Americana Manhasset, a high-end shopping center in Manhasset. I work with the social media with their personal shopping team.
TP: Are there any cool projects you’re working on that you’d like to let others know about?
RS: I have my fashion blog, The Wardrobe Style. I collaborate with the Americana Manhasset. I get to post pictures on their behalf and it helps expand my audience and their audience because I get to wear high- end designers. I get to work with a lot of different clothing brands and collaborate with them. I would say, overall, my blog has really helped me expand and strengthen my marketing skills a lot. My blog has given me the opportunity to get a great internship. I get cool things sent to me, like a Polaroid camera, and I work with companies like Coca-Cola and Topshop.
TP: Who are some of your inspirations in fashion?
RS: I really like Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner; I also love Olivia Culpo. They’re definitely my fashion inspirations.
TP: Why did you transfer to LIU Post from Dowling?
RS: I didn’t really have a choice. I had to transfer because Dowling shut down. Post really worked well with getting all my credits transferred, and they allowed me to graduate on time.
TP: How do you juggle your responsibilities as a student, blogger, and intern?
RS: It’s definitely hard to balance the blog and school. I always put school first. But with my internship, it allows me to create content for my blog, so it makes things a little easier.
TP: Have you noticed any interesting trends in your industry?
RS: I would say a big trend right now is athleisure and denim-on-denim. These are two trends I really like.
TP: What advice might you have for those who are interested in fashion blogging or just fashion in general?
RS: My biggest tip for starting blog or Instagram is post as much content as you can. Try to be super active with your followers. Try to post as much as possible. Don’t give up. It is hard to get followers, but just be persistent.
TP: How are you enjoying your time at LIU Post as a broadcasting major?
RS: I really like it at Post. I think everyone’s super-nice and welcoming. So I’m really glad I transferred here.
TP: Why is broadcasting your major?
RS: I was a communications major at Dowling and it transferred to a broadcasting degree here.
TP: Where can people follow you on Instagram?
RS: @TheWardrobeStyle, which has about 15,000 followers.

With graduation right around the corner, many seniors are excited and counting down the days. Meanwhile, others might still be figuring out what they are going to wear to the momentous occasion.
Some students are playing it more business-casual, like Taylor Bass, senior musical theatre major. Bass said, “I’m thinking of wearing a dress and heels,” and at the same time, she is considering the weather, remembering how it was freezing and muddy out during graduation last year. “Wedge heels and a cute dress,” are what she has chosen to wear to the event. “We have a toast after, and we always like to get dressed up for [it].” The outfit will be shrouded by the black gown at first, but later on, it will be perfectly suited for the celebration after the graduation ceremony.
Many are taking the simplistic route. Senior musical theatre major Daniel George said he’s going with something, “Simple, professional, and nice-looking.”
A few people have put in great detail towards what they have decided to wear and have already assembled their outfits. Senior broadcasting major, Kaitlyn Veygel, has chosen to wear “a yellow flapper-style dress paired with royal blue heels and a matching royal blue sweater.” She explains that the style of dress is “very relaxed,” in the way it fits. Veygel is aiming to make a bold statement with her “classic- yet-modern” style. She plans to complete the ensemble with, “a royal blue ribbon to wrap around [her] waist, as well as some jewelry.” Veygel added, “In my opinion, it’s a style that’s never really gone out of style but only improved and modernized a bit.”
Others are incorporating a level of personal significance and meaning into their attire. Marlin Slack, another senior musical theatre major, is taking a simple three-piece suit (a vest, tie, and jacket) to another level entirely. “I’ll probably wear a crazy color in rebellion of the formality of some forms of government [to symbolize] the fake formality and chaos they put on a suit and pretend the world is okay when they’re actually making it fall apart,” Slack explained. Also taking the changing weather into account, Slack mentions that he’ll wear the entire three-piece, “Unless it’s way too hot, then I’ll just do the vest.”

Graduation is officially less than one month away. While seniors and graduate students scramble to get their respective portfolios and resumes in order, they have not put the prospects of celebrating their graduation on the back-burner.
Take for instance, Muhmaet Hassan, senior finance major who is slated to graduate this May and will become the first college graduate in his immediate family. For him, the road to graduation has been earned, not given. While working as the treasure of the TKE chapter, Hassan, has been working “double”. “Managing finances both inside and outside of school has been challenging. When I graduate this spring, I’ll be honest, I’d like to celebrate,” said Hassan; but how?
According to Hassan, being the first to graduate college in his family carries, “a lot of sentimental value.” Hassan said, “I think I’m going to have a big Turkish barbeque with my family, but then, the job search will begin.”
Hassan is the not the alone when it comes to being the first to graduate of his family.
McKenzie Carroll, a senior education major, carries that same torch, and when it comes to graduation, she’s already begun to dabble in ideas of how she’ll celebrate her graduation.
“I’m torn between going away for a few days with either friends or family, but, at the same time I would like to start my job search immediately.” After a moment’s thought, she said, “I think I’m going to go away with my friends.” While discussing some possible get-away destinations with Carroll, she expressed interest in Miami, and the West Coast. “I’ve heard many things about Los Angeles and San Francisco; I guess we’ll have to see.”
Here are some quotes from students when asked: “Why does graduation deserve such a celebration?”
Stephanie Athanasopolous, senior digital arts and design major, intends to graduate this spring. She said, “Graduation is about you and the work you put in of course, but it’s about family and friends. You need to celebrate with the people who helped put you in the position to succeed. Celebrate however you see fit.”
Muhmaet Hassan, senior finance major, is also graduating this spring, and said “People take everything for granted, even education sometimes. Graduation is one of those moments where you press pause, smell the roses, and celebrate with the people you love. It deserves such a celebration because it’s a reflection of you and the people around you.”
McKenzie Carroll, senior education major, said, “Life is too short not to celebrate the little things, and in this case the big things like graduation. If it weren’t for my friends and family, I don’t know if I would have been walking down the aisle towards my diploma. So after, we’re going to celebrate. Why not?”
Why not, indeed? For most students, graduation from college is only a onetime event. In fact, for most Americans, graduation is a rare feat to accomplish. According the 2015 American Census Population Survey, only 33% of Americans reported having a bachelor’s degree. Given the current landscape of the private sector, most employers view a bachelor’s degree as a “must,” while some students feel pressure obtaining a masters degree to solidify better chances of finding employment after graduation. All in all, no matter how students decide to celebrate, they have earned it.

On Saturday, April 22. the Music Industry Club will hold a music festival at Nuti Park next to the Pratt Recreation Center. The festival MIC Fest, will take place from 1p.m. to 9p.m. and will feature 10 music acts ranging from pop singers to rock bands. “MIC Fest is Music Industry Club’s annual spring music festival. This year it will be held in Nuti Park and will have American Idol finalist JAX as a headline,” Sal Ciulla, junior arts management major and president of the Music Industry Club, said. Tickets are $10 for non LIU students and $5 for LIU students. This year will be the second year the Music Industry Club has held MIC Fest.
“MIC Fest has taken over five months to plan between booking acts, ordering the proper equipment, and planning and scheduling marketing material,” Ciulla said. “We are estimating around 200+ audience members for the event.”
The festival will feature three students who won a competition to qualify for the festival. The singing competition, Music Phenomenon, was held in the fall and was judged by the president of Music Industry Club, the previous year’s winner, and a senior music major. “We typically have around 12 solo artists compete for a chance to win the grand prize of $200, an opportunity to perform at Runway’s fashion show, and a slot to perform at MIC Fest in the Spring,” Ciulla said. “The final three contestants each get a slot to perform at MIC Fest.”
Savanah Cummings, a senior nursing major, will perform at MIC Fest. “Last year around the end of March, I won Phenomenon. Phenomenon is a talent show, but mostly just for vocal performance…it was more fun than I even thought I could have with a competition,” Cummings said. Cummings was one of the three students who qualified for the MIC Fest by winning Music Phenomenon.
Eric Carter, a freshman vocal performance major, will also perform at MIC Fest. “I’ve been singing since the age of two [and] approaching my 18th year doing my first hobby,” Carter said. “I expect that those who attend MIC Fest will surely be entertained. There are many performances in various genres and I think that’s most important,” he added.
The festival will also feature several other local music acts including Bad Mary, Innocent Persona , Flight of Silence, Megaweapon, Lennon & Katie and DJ DETOX.
Along with musical acts there will be food for guests and several boutique pop-ups including charity causes and local businesses. Tickets can be purchased at www.micfest.eventbrite.com or in Hillwood Commons during common hour at the Music Industry Club’s tables.
The Music Industry Club was founded by Sal Ciulla two years ago and is comprised of music artists, students interested in the music business and music lovers. Speaking about establishing the club Ciulla said “I wanted to know what it would be like to work with artists, market events, and cultivate an audience… People interested in the arts management and business fields could get the opportunity experience working with budgets, discovering and working with talent, and learning how to create successful events.” Students interested in joining the Music Industry Club are encouraged to view their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/LIUMusicIndustryClub.

Hip-hop album releases just keep on coming lately, and there’s much more in store for April.               Super-producer turned artist Mike Will Made It released the second installment in the ‘Ransom’ series to fan praise and critical acclaim. Although Mike Will Made It’s vocals are only heard sparingly throughout the album, his presence is still felt throughout the length of the project thanks to his hard-hitting and varied production style.
Mike Will first bursted onto the scene with the help of Gucci Mane (Gucci mane has played a role in launching several careers out of Atlanta) and ever since then, Mike Will has capitalized on Gucci’s endorsement of him. Mike Will branched out of his typical trap-influenced style to produce for stars such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna. His placements and collaborations with highly successful artists have launched his career into a new stratosphere. The producer/artist now has a record label of his own, under the Interscope label. The first group he signed, Rae Sremmurd, consists of two brothers from Mississippi, responsible for the smash hits ‘Black Beatles’ and ‘No Type’.
The two brothers from Mississippi play a major role on this ‘Ransom 2’ project and serve as some of the many highlights on the record. Their collaboration with Chicago drill artist Chief Keef is a standout on the album. Each of the brothers voices compliment each other and make for an interesting sound. Other major players in the rap game today are featured on the album as well. Legends like Pharrell Williams and Lil Wayne are featured as well as trap stars Gucci Mane, 21 Savage, and Migos. The instrumentals on this album are a highlight as one would expect from a producer, but sometimes the production and the rapping do not complement each other well. For example, Kendrick Lamar’s feature on this album seem forced and out of place, as compared to Future’s feature in which the artist rapped over the beat effortlessly as he’s done several times in the past. The intro track on this album is perhaps the strongest on the project. Big Sean’s passion can be heard through his voice and the subject matter hits home for many listeners, reminding them of Sean’s struggle to rise to fame. The opera vocals on this beat are a nice surprise and pleasantly compliment the rest of the track.
Mike Will’s sophomore album is a welcome addition to many of the rap albums that have been released this week, time will tell if this project can stand the test of time and hold listener’s attention spans through the rest of the spring.

Baseball returned to campus for the first time since March 10 in an East Coast Conference match-up against Mercy College.
Due to inclement weather and its effects on the LIU Post Baseball Field, the Pioneers have had to compete at Baseball Heaven in Yaphank, NY for their last six scheduled home games.
They won their first game since returning to their home field against Mercy College 4-2, also breaking a three game losing streak.
Mercy started off the game strong in the first inning with two runs but remained scoreless for the rest of the game.  The Pioneers were able to respond and tie the game at the bottom of the first inning, and also added runs in the third and eighth innings to end the game with a 4-2 win over the Mavericks.
Senior pitcher Jake Decarli pitched the entire game, allowing nine hits, two runs with eight strikeouts.
The victory over Mercy gave the Pioneers a winning conference record of 3-2 and an overall 11-11 record.  They return to action April 7 when they travel to Bridgeport, Conn. to take on the University of Bridgeport.  First pitch is at 11 am.

The Pioneers started off the first game down by one in the second inning, but a four run third inning brought them in the lead for good.  The Knights tried to come back with two runs at the top of the fifth inning, but the Pioneers immediately responded with three more runs.  They won 7-3.
In the second game of the night, the two teams ended the fourth inning tied with one run each, but a solo homer by sophomore designated hitter Ashley Melendez brought the Pioneers in the lead.  The Knights responded with a game-tying run at the top of the sixth, but the Pioneers responded again with 2 more runs.
The two wins gave the Pioneers a four game winning streak, and a winning overall record of 11-9 and 2-2 record in the East Coast Conference.
Senior infielder Kayla McCoy said it felt great to get the two wins and return to their home field to compete in good weather.  “This past week was a very positive one as a whole because each player contributed to each win in some way,” McCoy said. “Each game we play, we look to win every inning.  With the help of every player on our team, we were able to put together a solid and aggressive 14 innings of play.”
The Pioneers return to action April 5 when they travel down the road to Old Westbury, NY to take on New York Institute of Technology in a doubleheader.  First pitch is at 3pm.

For sophomore sociology major Karis Fuller, swimming is just one of the many things she can do. She earned a black-belt in karate at the age of 8. She can play four instruments: the violin, viola, guitar, and piano. As a child, she danced and played soccer. Once she could even recite pi to about the first 60 decimal places. Growing up in London, England, Fuller was encouraged to try different activities. “I was pushed into a lot of things as a child,” Fuller said. “[My parents] didn’t want me to be confined to one thing. They allowed me to find what I wanted to do.” But it wasn’t until she was nine years old that she found swimming. “It just kind of stuck,” she said. Fuller joined a swimming club at the suggestion of a teacher, and took a liking to it. Within a few years, she found herself in the British nationals.
Swimming has now become ingrained in her life. “It’s been part of my life for about 10 years, half my life now,” Fuller said. “So I kind of put a little bit of who I am into swimming.” She decided to come the United States for college because, in England, she would have had to pick either swimming or going to school. “They don’t really mesh the two together very well,” she said. So she came across the pond to pursue her passion while earning a degree.
And all of her hard work was rewarded this year when Fuller, along with three of her Pioneer teammates, qualified for the 2017 NCAA Division II Men’s & Women’s Swimming & Diving Championships, which took place from March 8 to March 11 in Birmingham, Ala. Fuller made it to the finals in both the 200-yard backstroke and the 100-yard backstroke, and finished 10th overall and second in the consolation final in both events.
“It was an amazing experience to be there,” she said. “I wasn’t prepared for how nervous I’d be. My teammates were the ones who calmed my nerves and kept me in check, so I owe quite a lot of it to them.”
Qualifying for the nationals this year came as redemption for Fuller, who narrowly missed the nationals last year. “I finished something like 20th, and they took 19. That’s what pushed me even more this year,” she said. Instead of taking a month off in the summer like she had done the year prior, this year she swam the whole summer without taking a break. “I came in fitter this year,” she said.
Going into next year, Fuller says she knows what she must do make it back to nationals and get even better. She plans to spend a lot of time in the gym during the off season to get stronger and more agile. “I’ve seen the times that win nationals and I don’t necessarily think I can’t do them,” she said.
Although college swimming season is over, Fuller won’t be taking a break from the pool. She is also part of another swimming club in England, and she wants to qualify for the British nationals, which take place in July. “I find out then where I sit among my own nationality,” she explained. “And among people up and down the country, which is good to know.”

Alex Rand, a senior health science major and member of the equestrian team, has qualified to compete in the IHSA National Championships in Lexington, KY at the Kentucky Horse Park from May 4-7. Rand learned she qualified for nationals on March 19 at the team’s last show of the season at the Suffolk County Show, in Medford.
The equestrian team has 21 members and became an NCAA sport during the fall 2016 semester. This is Rand’s first year going to nationals, to qualify, Rand earned the title of Cacchione Rider for the region. To qualify for nationals, you have to earn the most points throughout the regular show season. Since being named Cacchione rider, Rand received a direct ticket to nationals to compete against all the other Cacchione riders from different regions around the country.
“Having one of our riders go for Cacchione is an amazing way to end our first year as an NCAA team,” Mallory Slack, a junior biology major who is also a member of the team, said. “Not only does it show we’re committed but also competitive and Alex Rand is the definition of both those qualities. I can’t think of a more deserving rider to be representing LIU Post in Kentucky this year!”
Rand, who is looking forward to representing the Post equestrian team, has been working hard to prepare for the event. “I am working with my coaches Brooke Chasin and Nicole Palmero to perfect my riding position and ability to adapt to different horses. When I qualified, I was overwhelmed with emotions. This was the best possible way to end my intercollegiate horse show career.”
“It’s really awesome that Alex qualified for nationals in her last year. We are really excited for her to attend and are so glad the team is doing so well this year,” Brooke Chasin, who has coached the equestrian team since 2015, said.
According to Rand, the national competition is judged on the ability to hold the correct position while effectively communicating with the horse to complete the tasks given. “It’s important that I practice on many different horses because like any other IHSA (Intercollegiate Horse Show Association) competition I will be drawing a horse at random and will have never seen nor sat on until right before I walk in the show ring to be judged,” Rand said.
“We are all very proud of her. The team has practiced so hard this year and it is showing through the results we are earning. Nationals will be great exposure for the team and we hope to get more national qualifiers this weekend at Zone finals,” Jessica Sulkers, a sophomore business major on the team, said. Zone finals are the semi-finals, which take place Saturday, April 8 at Skidmore College.

Almost 500 fans filled Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium to watch East Coast Conference rivals NYIT and LIU Post battle it out on April 1. The Pioneer men’s lacrosse team was handed its second conference loss of the season by the now seventh ranked Bears.
The Pioneers trailed 7-3 at the beginning of the third quarter, but rallied back with three unanswered goals to get within two of the Bears. Still down 8-6 with just 1:37 left to play, the home team knew they had a chance to stay in the game.
“On the defensive side, we just knew we had to keep making stops to give the offense more opportunities to score,” junior mid fielder Kris Alvarado said. “We took it goal by goal and eventually saw that we had a chance to come back.”
Two quick back-to-back goals within the last 50 seconds of the game, scored by junior mid fielder Dylan Harned and freshman midfielder Dan Foley, forced the game into overtime. Unfortunately, the Pioneers were unable to stop a strong Bears offense, and lost 9-8.
“We made a lot of little mistakes, which cost us some goals,” Alvarado said.
Collectively, the Pioneers and the Bears each caused 17 turnovers, and senior mid fielder Anthony Galeota ore had a strong showing, winning 14-of-20 face-off attempts. The home team struggled to find the back of the net, only seeing success on 8-of-49 shot attempts.
The Pioneers’ next four games will be on the road, the first scheduled for April 12 against Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, NY at 4 pm.
The team, keeping focused on what they can control and taking it day-by-day and one step at a time.
