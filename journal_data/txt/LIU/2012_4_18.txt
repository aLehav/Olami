In my four years here at LIU Post, I have been so lucky and grateful to have had such incredible experiences. In my last two years, I have been able to contribute to a fantastic publication – the Pioneer – and this year I was able to become a student leader, Editor-in-Chief. I was going to have a voice on this campus and provide fair and balanced news for my fellow students. However, I came to find, providing fair and balanced news is difficult with an uncooperative system.
 
Last semester, we had amazing stories because of the abundance of activity on this campus. We were there to show you the good and the bad about Post. Seeing students reading the paper over lunch in Hillwood Commons or before class in the library was one of the most rewarding sights. However, this semester, the Pioneer faced quite a backlash.
 
Our most controversial story this semester caused us a lot of resentment from the student body. While we understand, the story was not flattering; it was our job to report it. If we had not done so, we would not be doing our job.
 
There was a huge lack of support from the administration. While we understand that bad publicity is not ideal in terms of marketing and promotion, if there is a situation on campus that needs to be reported, it is our job as students training to be journalists to do so. We never wrote a story without contacting administration for their side of the issue. We would not be fair or balanced if we did not receive feedback from them. It seemed that for every story that required investigating, we were stonewalled once we asked for input from our school administrators. Staff and faculty apparently live in fear of being quoted by the Pioneer along with students.
 
Students, this is your soapbox. If you want your voice to be heard, this is a way to do it. So many of you are fearful of providing your major, year or even your name, that doing so  will somehow affect your reputation on this campus. A college campus is nothing without its student newspaper.
 
Now, here I am, writing my editorial for our last issue. It feels like only yesterday, Jacqueline and I were eager and nervous to be “in charge.”
 
Overall, this has been an incredible experience. I am so proud of the work  done here at the Pioneer by our writers, editors, photographers, and layout staff. It is because of our amazing staff that this campus is able to have a paper every week and for that I say, thank you. As I walk into the real world, I have experiences that no internship could have given me. I was able to be a leader of something that contributes so much to this campus.
 
Next year, Alex Parker and Olivia Wicik will become the new Editors-in-Chief of the Pioneer. Jacqueline and I are more than confident that they will continue to provide a fair and balanced newspaper to this campus. Hopefully, there will be more support than this year. Good luck girls! You’ll do great and I know you will continue to carry on the tradition.
 
To our readers – Have a fantastic summer! Thank you for supporting us! The Pioneer will be back in September!

A Professor of mine once told me, “If you seek to change to the world, then journalism is the perfect weapon.” I’ve tried to remember this throughout my time at Post, and at The Pioneer. When I first arrived at the newspaper, it was being totally remodeled and revamped. When my co-Editor and I took over we wanted to continue to build up The Pioneer’s reputation as a solid, trustworthy news source. This goal was not reached easily, however, it was both a challenge and a struggle.
It is nearly impossible to please and satisfy everyone. This is true in journalism and in life. No matter what kind of story is printed, there is bound to be some party that is not thrilled with the content. Of course, it is the reader’s right to voice their dissatisfaction with a particular story, just as much as it is the journalist’s right to chronicle the event. It becomes something different, however, when another party tries to hinder any type of information that could be used by a writer to provide a fair and balanced story.
When there is censorship, the truth is distorted. It is putting the public at a disadvantage, and ultimately manipulating the news to reflect a certain view or idea. A press can never be called free if the news it prints is restricted.
This is where The Pioneer will forge on. Despite the bumps we’ve hit in the road to objectivity and truth, we have always, and will always remember our purpose. Our loyalty lies with what is true, and we hope the Pioneer continues to serve the LIU Post community. As Editor in Chief of TIME, inc, Henry Anatole Grunwald, once said
 
“Journalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.”
 
It has truly been  an honor to work on this publication, and I thank those who have supported and stuck with us through it all.
 
Truth will out.
 
Jacqueline Favaloro
Editor in Chief

On Sunday, April 15th, the 5th annual PlayExpo made its debut at LIU Post with almost 300 attendees. The PlayExpo allows for talented developers of video game media to showcase their works to be judged and compete among each other for fame and cash prizes. The event was engineered by Elena Bertozzi, the director of LIU Post’s Digital Game Design and Development program.
The first PlayExpo was held at the University of Wisconsin in 2008, but this wouldn’t be the first iteration of this event.  Bertozzi explained that during the political climate of the late 1990s and early 2000s, due to the shootings at Columbine, videogames, which were never respected as a medium to begin with, were now being scrutinized as catalysts for violent behavior.
“We will have a title with game in the title over my dead body,” was the kind of responses she received when trying to form a festival that allows for people to display their talents for creating games.  Video games had become taboo, and no one was willing to tolerate it on the university level, she explained.  She would eventually call her first festival Interactive Digital Environments, Art and Storytelling or IDEAS, as a way around using the word “game.” It was held at Indiana University in 2002.
This was a breakthrough.“[Before this] People didn’t have the opportunity to show their work.” It opened up opportunities for those with talent, who were being held back in an institution that’s supposed to help progress the development of ideas, she explained.
Though the environment has settled down, and video game media has been allowed to develop in the public square, there are still many who oppose the spread of video games. From experience dealing with these critics, Bertozzi contests that “most critics haven’t even played the games they slam.”
One of the games on display,“Against the Wall,” is a first-person puzzle solving game developed by Michael Consoli, a developer visiting from New Jersey.  It was a platformer that tasked the player with scaling a wall by using a staff to pull out huge blocks for you to climb on to.  The higher up you reached, the more advanced the puzzles became, and the more interesting the environments.
“Delve” was another game featured.  Kevin Porras represented a small team of developers from NYU that themselves Blacktorch Games. He was on hand to display some game play elements.  The game was a puzzle game, not unlike bejeweled, but with a twist.  It had an impressive storyline, which is traditionally vacant from puzzle games of this type, with an emphasis on solving puzzles, while boss characters disrupt your progress with attacks.  Porras explained the game allowed for a simple design accessible to casual gamers, but the boss fights, themselves, would always trip you up and change the rules that you were previously accustomed to.  Porras was particularly pleased with the PlayExpo. He said, “I am very proud of our team and how we performed at this showcase. This was the first time we have showed Delve to the public, and we were really pleased with the reaction we got. We are grateful that LIU and Elena Bertozzi gave us the chance to show off our hard work. A big thanks to the judges for seeing what we see in our game and to our fellow peers, who also presented that day. It was great to be involved.”
There were two speakers at the event prior to the awards ceremony: Dave Johnson, art director for the original Donkey Kong, and Cindy Au, community director for Kickstarter, an organization that assists independent game developers draw in a fan base and fund their works.
Dave Johnson briefly lectured on the development of art design from games from the era of Donkey Kong all the way to mobile games you’d find on your iPhone.  He noted that technology is always changing radically, and sometimes, it actually goes backwards.  The case he made was that the games found on iPhones are not quite as advanced as those found on Xbox, but they’re just as popular and important in many ways.  The point he was driving home is that for young game developers, it’s more important to focus on things, like color theory and artistic goals outside of the computer, because they’ll always be important to you on any technology you utilize them on.
Cindy Au was the keynote speaker and brought forth an impressive demonstration for Kickstarter.  The idea behind Kickstarter is to allow a developer to make a presentation that anyone can watch for free online.  The developer sets a goal, and people can choose if they want to back the project with their money; this allows for an early development of a fan base and for projects that would be impossible because of financial reasons to finally get the wheels turning.  For instance, Consoli’s “Against the Wall” was made possible due to the donations of backers that he collected through assistance from Kickstarter.
The awards ceremony followed the end of Au’s lecture, and the winners were decided.  For the efforts of Blacktorch Games, they won the coveted Games for Fun Award.  Consoli won the People’s Choice Award for “Against the Wall.”  A group of Dutch game developers, represented by a Dutch visitor named Francesco Coan, won the game design document category for “Planetary” and the games for programming category for “Horus.”  The game “Oh, No!,” developed by Brian Lamey, won the 2D design category.
The big winners of the night were Matt Cooper and Lauren Perugini for “History Investigator: The Case of Alfred Dreyfus.”  They took home awards for best game with a serious tone, sound design, and interactive conversation.  The judges were unanimous in these awards.
Freshman Connor Carey, a Psychology major and music minor, enjoyed the event. “The environment of the forum was very positive with only constructive criticism.  The game developers could showcase their games without any negative backlash.  The audience was also able to benefit by talking to the people who made the games,” he said.

The Catholic Campus Ministry, the Newman Catholic Community, leaves the U.S. to help build houses in Tijuana, Mexico, from May 27th through June 2nd. For a cost of $800, LIU students can share the experience in Mexico while helping those in need.
Since 2000, the Newman Community has participated in a house building program by Esperanza International. The tasks include various stages of building a brick house. “We dig ditches for the foundation, lay bricks and put in the foundation, pour the floor, put up walls and a roof,” said Father Ted Brown, He added, “We usually don´t do all of this, but often, we do two or three of these tasks, depending on what needs to be done.”
The group works together with those who receive the house when the building is done. “We build great bonds with them,” Father Ted said, explaining an experience from last year’s trip when a family that received a home 10 years earlier came to visit them while they were working. “The children were now in their teens, but they remembered me and that original team,” he said. But building houses is not the only experience our students get.
“This is life changing,” said Father Ted. “The situation in Tijuana has changed tremendously, and it is not unsafe now,” he added. With years of effort, Father Ted has had many different experiences, including building homes for the elderly, young couples, and a family with a blind and a deaf child. “Each trip is unique,” he said.
All LIU Post students are welcome to join the effort for the price of approximately $800.They will have to attend a meeting in the Interfaith Chapel on Sunday, April 29th. Sign-ups can be done at tinyurl.com/mexicoapp.  The trip often includes visits to an orphanage and an immigrant center, a trip to the Mexican border, some shopping, and a sporting event.

“It feels like a family here, which we are; we are a family.”
Over the last 30 years, LIU Post students have come to love chocolate chip and corn muffins. Plain bagels come in at No. 1, sesame second, wheat third. Favorite candies and chips vary. Joan Lavin, the cashier in Humanities Hall, knows what her customers want. She has gone to graduations, been invited to sit in on classes, and has seen students crying, happy, and opening up to her. This September, the Humanities Café will continue without Lavin, as she is retiring.
“I feel I have done my time,” said Lavin. “I will miss everybody. I see almost every student. I am sure they will miss me; at least I hope they do. We have gotten to the point where we can have a one-on-one conversation. I worked in grammar school, high school, and college. I guess you can say that I am going to graduate.”
In 1982, Lavin began working at Hillwood Commons, preparing salads and sandwiches. From the grill, she went to the Winnick Student Center. She then bounced back to Hillwood and into Pizza Works. When that closed, she started cashiering. From cashiering, she was approached to open up the store in Humanities. She remembers wearing a green bib and wrap-around skirt that nobody really liked, along with red, orange, and black taxi-driver colored shirts before the current black on black.
“Students, I have seen them mature in four years, some five years,” said Lavin. “The freshmen will come in out of high school, then they grow and mature, and I tell them no ‘Yos’ and ‘Give Mes.’ They are respectful. I haven’t had one problem with any of the students here.”
In the past, students have come into the Humanities lobby after donating blood, not drinking their juice or eating. One almost passed out on the bench. Another began to have seizures on the front lawn. In both instances, Lavin phoned Public Safety.
“I know exactly what all of my regular customers want,” said Lavin. “All I have to do is look at their faces. I may not know their names, but I know what they want. I have got two girls who come here every morning, lean over this counter, give me a hug, give me a kiss, and ask how are you, how are you feeling. It makes me feel good. Some of them call me ma. I try to give advice to some of them. They ask me or if they say something that’s inappropriate, I will say something to them. They don’t get mad at me. They say I am sorry.”
“The school has its history, you know, it’s past,” said senior and Criminal Justice major Melinda Fuentes. “This woman, she always has a smile on her face. She is always friendly and always polite to everyone. She will certainly be missed. I wish her all the best. Her time here was definitely worthwhile.”
The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 mandated 21 years old as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages.
“The Pioneer Room used to be called the Rathskeller, where they would serve alcohol, and you could sit and socialize,” said Lavin. “When they changed the drinking age, they stopped it. A couple of kids were killed leaving campus. One was killed by the Chapel, hit the tree. There was another killed on Northern Blvd.”
On October 12th, 1994, The Buffalo News reported that 300 full-time faculty members went on strike in a dispute about a shorter workweek. On September 27th, 2003, the New York Times reported a 19-day faculty member strike ended, as union members ratified a three-year contract. on September 11th, 2011, the Pioneer reported that full-time faculty went on strike in response to a said walk out on contract negotiations by the University’s administration.
“I just feel kind of bad for her that she had to see all of that stuff,” said Matthew Schwartz, a freshman with an undeclared major. “Good for her that she gets to retire.”
On September 11th, 2001, 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four passenger jets, crashing them into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks.
“Everyone was totally devastated,” said Lavin. “Students came here crying. You try to talk to them and comfort them, and you’re in shock over this. Everybody has become more aware of what is going on, what’s happening, their surroundings. When they had the Fashion Show, they went out to a club afterwards. One of our students was shot. After that, I don’t hear anyone talking about going to the clubs. They had cards that they would put out on the steps. That got stopped.”
In June 2001, Aramark, a leader in providing award-winning food services, facilities management, uniform and career apparel to health care institutions, universities, school districts, stadiums, arenas, and businesses around the world, took over food service for the LIU Post campus.
“I was here when Lackman Culinary Services had the contract,” said Lavin. “I am glad we kept our jobs.”
One of the biggest changes came on July 24th, 2003, when New York State cracked down on smoking in public and work places. Smoking is not allowed in places of employment, bars, food service, and all public and private colleges, universities, and other educational and vocational institutions.
“That was a big one,” said Lavin. “When Pizza Works was here, where Subway is, there were tables all over and people would smoke left and right. I mean, the place was full of smoke and then they said ‘no more.’ It wasn’t too far before they passed the law. The school decided no more just like they did with the drinking and the gum. We used to have a store in Hillwood where [you could get] anything you wanted. That got stopped. That was across from the Information Desk.”
Several other noteworthy incidents have occurred on campus in recent years, including an attack by 1-800-Flowers and a missing student, which resulted in detectives asking questions, looking, and wondering what happened.
“I may come back just for lunch and just look and listen and see what’s going on because I am going to lose a big family,” said Lavin. “One of our coworkers passed. She was like the mother, the grandmother. She gave her heart and soul to her job. When she passed, it was very upsetting. Things have changed since she has gone, as far as we go.”

There isn’t a girl in the world who doesn’t gush over big screen romances. That Jack and Rose, “You jump, I jump,” or Noah and Allie, “If you’re a bird, I’m a bird,” type of love. A love so strong and passionate that it feels like you will literally burst if you can’t be with that person. I highly doubt this is something that guys in their twenties think about, but I am positive that girls think about it all  the time and have done so since they were old enough to have an idea about what love is. Now that I have hit 20, I’m really not sure that this exists outside of the movies.
Am I really supposed to think the human race is capable of a Twilight romance? A human lifetime isn’t enough for Bella, no no no, she has to turn herself into a vampire so she can be with Edward for eternity. Let’s be real here. There are limits and boundaries to how far love can go.
Of course we are capable of being in love but I just don’t think that this fairytale love is attainable. I am not always this “glass half empty” but in all seriousness, how could I not be pessimistic about this? Divorces are just about as common as chewing gum these days. Then of course we have celebrities who seem to just get married to make a quick buck off all the hype. Insert Kris Humphries/ Kim Kardashian joke here.
Maybe it’s because, in my opinion, people get married too young these days. It’s not like it was back in the 1900s when getting married in your early twenties was commonplace or appropriate. As a whole, we are completely different kinds of people now. There’s no reason to get married that young. People want different things when they’re 20 than they do when they’re 30. Your twenties are supposed to be the time in your life when you have fun and see the world. Instead, many of us are under the impression that it’s the time to settle down.
So say you do get married, and then you wake up in ten years and want different things out of life and your marriage. Too bad, you got married, you took vows. We forget the “‘til death do us part” portion. It’s all taken completely for granted. When and if I decide to get married, I only want to do it once. The earliest age I would even consider it is 28 and even that is pushing it a little.
I have a few friends who are either engaged or married already. I haven’t come right out and said that I think they made a bad decision because it’s not my business. There’s no need, we’re too young and there’s no guarantee that you will feel the same about this person in a decade.
So for right now, if you jump, I will not be following you, if you’re a bird, chances are I’m not, and I will not be attempting to turn myself into an immortal for anyone. But hey, maybe my prince charming just got lost on his way to my house and refuses to stop and ask for directions. I’ll be sure to let you all know if he shows up.

As we all know, there is a very important election coming up in November, the race to see who will be the next president of the United States. Will President Obama be re-elected or will the Republican candidate be given a chance? But, then again, we don’t even know who that Republican candidate will be yet. Currently, we are in a race for a race. The Republican primary pushes on and we get closer and closer to the final candidate. However, before the race is even over, we may have our victor.
On April 10, 2012 candidate Rick Santorum made the announcement that he would be dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination. This announcement came as a shock to some at such a pivotal time in the race. Santorum was proving to be a very tough opponent for front-runner Mitt Romney. So why would he drop out of the race so suddenly? Well, according to an article published by BBC News on April 10, 2012 entitled “Rick Santorum Suspends US Presidential Campaign,” it had to do with his three-year-old daughter being admitted to the hospital. His daughter suffers from a genetic disorder and became ill. This is more than a good reason to drop out of the campaign and I do wish Isabella Santorum a quick recovery. However, politics stops for no one.
This declaration by Santorum basically leaves the gate wide open for Mitt Romney. Santorum was already barely hanging on and considering Newt Gingrich, who’s primary victories I can count on one hand, and Ron Paul, who has yet to win a primary election, are Romney’s best competition, it seems Romney has become virtually untouchable. Romney has everything going for him right now—popularity, little competition, and enough money to keep a campaign going in almost every state. It seems that it is almost impossible for him to lose at this point, unless by some miraculous occurrence. Even then, it would be amazing. So, now I am willing to throw in my personal opinion and say that we will be seeing Mitt Romney on the November ballot right next to the words “Republican Candidate.” But the question still lingers, can Romney truly beat Obama in the 2012 Presidential election? That is the true test of popularity, and will make for a very interesting November.

Every semester, dormers dread room inspections. Room inspection is when a Resident Assistant and the Resident Hall Director show up at random to go through your room and make sure you have nothing in there that is on the “can not have” list. It’s often hard to keep up with the list of things that are not allowed in your dorm room. Some students may pass, and others may be written up by the Resident Hall Director and have some hefty fines to pay. Imagine a dorm room with no restrictions – what would you like to have in your dorm, penalty-free?
According to Long Island Universities code of conduct, students cannot have: extension cords, hanging lights, appliances (coffee pots, burners, blenders, toasters etc.), heaters, air conditioners, microwaves, micro-fridges, candles, combustible liquids, incense, pets of any kind, wine glasses, beer mugs, shot glasses or empty alcohol bottles. Any students who are caught with these items can face fines, which vary on what items are found in your room, and how much of it.
Many students complain about not being able to have things like a microwave in their room. Students like Ashley Abney, a junior Public Relations major said, “I live in Brookville Hall, and it’s such an inconvenience to go all the way to the basement just to heat up my food. By the time I get back to my room, which is on the second floor, my food is cold.” All the microwaves in Brookville Hall are located in the basement.
Abney, a resident of Brookville for two years also mentioned how last year the microwave room had been shut down for most of the spring semester because of vandalism. “Besides a microwave, I would love to be able to have a coffee pot in my room. I drink coffee a lot, and it would be a lot easier to make my own then spend a good amount of money each week on coffee,” said Abney.
All types of pets are prohibited from being in the dorms. Students are not even allowed to have goldfish. Adwoa Boating, a senior Psychology major said, “I wish I could have a dog. They’re such great company, and they just make you happy. I get that dogs are a lot of work and can make a mess so that’s probably the reason we can’t have them on campus, but I mean we aren’t even allowed to have fish. That seems ridiculous, if you ask me.”
Ara McPherson a junior Sociology major said, “I would like to have one of those little George Foreman grills in my room. It’d be nice to make my own fresh food. Winnick gets tiring, and when it’s cold and rainy outside, I don’t like walking over there.”
The list could go one forever as to what students want to keep in their dorm rooms. To make sure you are not at risk for a fine, be sure to check the schools website under student life resources and click the link, “Thing To Bring”.

While many American students enjoyed the Super Bowl game with family and friends, the experience was different for international students studying at LIU Post whom were unaware of this cultural phenomenon. “I didn’t know about the game, was it something fun?” Phuong, from Vietnam, asked. When The New York Giants won the Super Bowl, many students donned Giants jerseys after the game. “I wanted to enjoy the parade, but I felt weird to join a parade when I don’t know why everyone is happy.” Phuong went to play soccer on Superbowl Sunday.
With the number of international students on the rise here at LIU Post, the cultural education may prove more challenging for some than others. Some international students are having a great time, but some are unhappy and report feeling isolated.
Sang tan Park, from Korea, said he was looking forward to making new friends when he came here. He even studied English in Manhattan before coming to Post where he mingled with international students and made friends quickly. But then he came to Post and ran into what he calls a “cultural wall.”
He recalled that time and compares it to his experiences: “There were many international students in city. We did not speak English well. However, we were very happy to know someone from other countries, I believed. I stopped talking to new people since I got here. I get so shy when I speak English to native speakers. It is not hard to talk to Asian students. I think Americans and Europeans do not like Asians. I can feel an invisible wall between Americans and me. I may make the wall myself.”
Kana Takenaka, an exchange student from Japan, says she has been studying at LIU Post for two semesters. When she came to Post years ago, she says, people at Post treated her very nice.
“I am satisfied with my digital art program, teachers are always helpful,” she said. She’s also satisfied with her classes, but she is not especially happy living here. Kana admits that it is “hard for me to integrate with American students.” She said that the school could be more helpful than simply offering the new student orientation. “Events from ISS are always just for international students,” she said. “I think Asian students are afraid of speaking English. They don’t have confidence even though they came here to study English. I am one of them. I think that is really stupid and a waste. The school can give us more help (or opportunity), but if we don’t change, nothing will change.”
Thomas Egnoto is a Music major who transferred here in the fall 2011. “I was so surprised to see so many international students,” he remembered, “I used to know some students from China, but they just don’t say hello when I see them on campus. I don’t say hello anymore. I think Asian guys are boring.”
That is an unfortunate reaction to many Asian students whose reluctance to use the English language for fear of getting it wrong is taken for aloofness.
Not every international student is feeling marginalized. Yuya Hagiwara, from Japan, came to LIU Post two years ago is having a superior time here.
Yuya said, “I really like living at LIU Post. There are so many international students such as people who are from Korea, China, Sweden, Germany, France, India and Japan, which means we have an opportunity to learn another culture briefly. Actually, I have learnt a lot of differences in regard to culture since I came here.” But Yuya also makes a great effort to integrate. “When I have free time, I always visit my friend’s room to chat for a short time and have dinner together. It is so fun for me.” He has also involved himself in many clubs and activities. “Actually,” said Yuya, “I belong to one club called The Newman Club. I went to Mexico to build houses for the poor through this club. Post give us opportunities to participate in a lot of school activities. I like it.” Yuya has become a convert when it comes to understanding how much of a difference making and effort can make. “I thought American students were not interested in communicating with Asians especially,” he said. “However, I was wrong. When I started to communicate with them, they are more outgoing than I thought. We are here. Therefore, we should enjoy this life. Just staying here for studying seems to be boring.”
Some international students were excited when they arrived at Post. Chao Feng, an international student from China, was one of them. “I am so excited to be here, “said Feng. “It is much better than I expected.” He is member of LIU C.H.A.T.S, Conversations Helping and Teaching Students, a service offered by the Office of International Student Service. He said it is very helpful. He has a chat partner, Michael, who is also learning from Chao. “It is a really good experience I think,” said Michael. “It is really hard to study other cultures from books, right? Chao teaches me Chinese culture and I help him improve his English. How good is that?” Chao is in an ESL, or English as a Second Language, course now, and is working at learning English so he can improve his educational and social experiences here. “I can’t wait to finish ESL course and start real college life,” Chao says. He is off to a good start!

Bryan Gallucci
Life can change in a moments notice. You are here one day, and gone the next. For one Long Island family, tragedy struck on a quiet January night, when a loving husband and dedicated father died of a heart attack. A man who had just had a physical and was given a clean bill of health, passed away without any warning signs. John Gallucci was only 55 when his life was cut short. An autopsy revealed that it was due to heart disease and artery disease. Heart disease has not only affected this family, but has impacted the lives of many people.
Heart Disease has caused 25 percent of deaths in the United States and most cases have gone undetected. The American Heart Association has stated that cardiovascular disease is the number one killer amongst Americans every year. According to its website, every 38 seconds someone dies from cardiovascular disease. With these statistics in mind, it is clear that heart disease is a major concern in America today. Too many people have problems with their heart and risk death because they do not even know it or there is nothing that can be done.
Someone you know may be at risk, so the American Heart Association, along with many others, are fighting this concern each and every day. They do this by letting people know about heart disease, improving care given to people with heart disease, protecting people and warning them if they are at risk, and encouraging people to live healthier lives.
One way that the American Heart Association raises money for research and education to help stop heart disease is through their Heart Walks, which are run across the entire United States. The walks persuade people to get out and get exercise, while raising money to help remove heart disease and stroke from people’s lives. On Long Island, the walk usually takes place in September at Jones Beach. Teams are put together by loved ones, people who care, and companies. Once a team is started, fundraising is done and people can join in on the walk or donate money. They walk to create hope, inspire change, and celebrate success.
Despite their loss, the Gallucci family was inspired to spread the message and raise money for the cause close to their own hearts. They created a team, Team John, and have now decided, as a family, to do this as an annual walk in honor of their father each year. They want to help others. During an interview over lunch with the leader of the team, Michelle Gallucci, she explained why they are involved with the walk. She stated: “It was such a shocking feeling on that January night and I thought to myself, how can I prevent this from happening to another person? My family just jumped in and helped out with everything from fundraising, stuffing envelopes, and most importantly, spreading the word.”
Gallucci explained how news of their team and the walk even spread to the local town paper, the East Meadow Herald. The family and their friends have said that doing the walk makes them feel good and helps them to remember their father. They want to make people aware and help change lives. “In the first year, our team raised nearly 4,000 dollars,” said Gallucci. “The goal for the second walk, which is September 23, 2012, at Jones Beach, is to double that amount.” Michelle Gallucci and her family have big plans for the 2nd Annual Team John walk. This family is well on their way to helping others learn more about heart disease and making sure that people will not have to lose their loved ones due to this silent disease.
For more information about how to get involved, go to the American Heart Association website at americanheart.org and find a Heart Walk near you.

From leopard print to polka dots, incorporating a bold pattern into your outfit is a simple yet fashion-forward way to get noticed. Although prints may seem unfeasible or even a little frightening to many of us, it is easier than you may think. No need to fret, ladies: Professor Marisa is here to provide a crash course in Bold Prints 101.
Take the time to explore the wide range of patterns in stores today. Make sure that you are able to experience these interesting patterns while remaining true to your spirit. Patterns are supposed to enhance an outfit, not detract from your personal style. You don’t want to get lost in a sea of prints that don’t really flatter your body type, hair color, or even your skin tone.
Paying attention to color is extremely important. Printed colors that match hues in your hair, skin, eyes, or even makeup tend to appear more natural and seamless. Color tones that are stronger or bolder than your natural coloring will come off as dominating and overpowering. On the other hand, choosing a print that is too cutesy or weak will not work, either. Try to find the perfect balance between strength and color.
Larger patterns have the tendency to make you look larger. Therefore, strategic placement of prints should be considered. For example, horizontal strips elongate your physique while vertical stripes make you look boxy and oversized. The easiest and safest way to style patterns is with sold, neutral colors. If mixing prints though, using identical or at least similar colors promotes synchronization.
Popular prints this spring and summer include chevron, floral, leopard print, and stripes. Whimsical patterns such as galaxies and stars have also been seen on runways and in fashion magazines lately. Other stylish alternatives are birds, bows, and keys. Patterns such as these can be found in Forever 21, H&M, and Target especially. As always, higher-end brands such as Marc Jacobs, Betsey Johnson, and Diane von Furstenberg also carry many fabulous patterns.
When it comes to choosing the best prints for you, the only way to figure out what looks best is trial and error. Step outside your comfort zone and try something new. Beginning with printed accessories, such as scarves, or shoes is a great idea to enhance your style. Try not to rule anything out because you may be surprised as to what looks great on you!

As this is my final commuter column, I’d like to take a moment out to reminisce about the good times I’ve had in these two years. For four and a half years, I had the pleasure of not living on-campus, but commuting to LIU Post. As a dork, I found new routes to the campus every day and even traveled to places around the campus.
Each week, I traveled on lovely Northern Boulevard and visited the stores or just looked at them from afar. My favorite place to go was the Miracle Mile or the Americana at Manhasset. So many high-end stores and so much to choose from, I just couldn’t help myself. I would visit the stores and look, but never buy because that would be impossible. The Americana mall is the greatest stress reliever – the place is like a utopia. It’s beautiful, perfect, clean, and sunny. I highly recommend it to those young shoppers looking to window shop – or if you’re lucky enough to shop.
From reading my columns, there’s a lot to look forward to when commuting, yet there’s always those downfalls, like parking, seeing the parking lots blocked off, walking to class in the rain, traffic, and more.. But as drivers, we can all agree the drive there is easier than the drive back. On the way there, we’re rushing to get there, listening to music, maybe smoking a cigarette or whatever you prefer before class, texting your friends, looking forward to seeing them, stopping for coffee, etc. The drive back is the hardest, now you have to go back to life, or like me, go straight to work or do homework. Now as I take my last drive home, I have the realization that I’m never going to be driving back and that breaks my heart. Those who are freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and even seniors, remember the good times in college and I hope you had them because I know I did. As for the new freshman coming in, take each drive as if it’s your last because in a blink of an eye, college is over and you’re an adult doing the same boring drive every day. Enjoy these days as much as you can. So as a farewell to my fellow LIU Post students, I wish you safe driving from here on out.

With the warm weather in the air, you would think lying out in this beautiful 80 degree warm weather on the Great Lawn or maybe in your backyard is a perfect way to get a golden glow. With only a week left of classes and bikini season right around the corner, it seems students are on a mission to look their tannest. However, why have students become so highly addictive to tanning beds and tanning in general? Ultraviolet rays are so dangerous and harmful to your body and can damage your skin fibers, damage elasticity, and worst of all, cause skin cancer.
According to an article titled, “Hurts So Good: Why You Don’t Care if Tanning Is Bad For You,” by Lisa Jaffe Hubbell, Dermatologist James Spencer says, “Essentially, UV rays increase brain chemicals that make you feel good. Current research, although preliminary, seems to indicate a relationship between melatonin stimulating hormone (MSH) that helps you turn a golden brown and endorphin production.”
So the question we must ask ourselves is, “Why do we do things to our body when we know it is unsafe in the first place?” Is it truly because we feel better about our body and complexion when we are tan or is it just for vanity reasons? I mean don’t get me wrong, a great glow for your skin is great for summer time, but then again, skin cancer is not quite so pretty.
You may be wondering what tanning beds actually do you your body. Well, I am going to tell you and maybe it will change your decision next time you are about to lay down in once of these beds. To start off, UVA rays consist of long wavelengths that penetrate deep into your skin and UVB radiation affects the outermost layers of your skin. With that said, “Tanning is directly linked to skin cancer, specifically malignant melanoma, and other numerous health problems. Long-term effects of UVA rays include premature aging and wrinkles. Although rays are less likely to cause burns, they are still linked to damage the immune system and weaken the skin’s inner tissue,” according to Elizabeth Carruth’s article titled, “Do Tanning Beds Cause Skin Cancer and Other Harmful Effects?”
In fact, the American Academy of Dermatology states that every day in the U.S. more than 1 million people use tanning beds. Also, the tanning industry’s 2010 revenue is estimated at $2.6 billion. Of course people can agree that tanning beds are readily available all the time for a guaranteed tan and take less effort to get color versus lying outside and positioning yourself in the sun. But is that really a reason tanning in a tanning bed is so popular? Ironically enough, tanning salons use advertisements all the time to show how being bronze is more beautiful than being pale or just accepting your natural skin color. Don’t be fooled! These businesses are just doing this to make money and lure you in.
Remember: Protect your skin at all times, even when you’re not in a tanning bed. You can’t go wrong with any sunscreen or moisturizer that has high SPF in it.

Summer vacation is on the horizon, so if you are seeking a vacation in the Caribbean, consider the most eastern island in the Caribbean Sea that has a population of about 260,000.  Barbados, a beautiful, small nation island is surrounded by white, sandy beaches and azure water, while the interior is drowned with acres of sugar cane fields. Culturally, Barbados is a wonderful juxtaposition of two groups of people: the natives and the tourists. Just one visit to Barbados is accessible to everyone, especially due to its close proximity to the United States. There is something for everyone on this majestic island.
Airlines: Barbados is sought after from all corners of the globe, ranging from the Americas, the UK, and countries from the Pacific. Thus, getting there is quite simple since there is a large selection of airlines to choose from. Here’s a list of the top airlines offering regularly scheduled service from the U.S. and Canada to Barbados: American Airlines, Jet Blue, Caribbean Air, British Airways, and Virgin Atlantic. These airlines safely take you directly to Grantley Adams International Airport, located at Barbados’ capital, Bridgetown. Always remember to consider the most cost-efficient airline that will suit your financial needs.
Hotels/Lodging: The commercial term “all inclusive” is frequently associated with anywhere you go in the Caribbean. Barbados is famous for its all-inclusive resorts, which come in all price ranges. Once known as one of the more expensive Caribbean destinations, Barbados now boasts a grand selection of affordable accommodations without losing its edge as a luxury destination. Accommodations include lavish 5-star hotels, cozy seaside retreats, apartment hotels, and quaint seafront guest houses. Coast wise, the South is mostly favored over the others thanks to its extensive selection of moderately priced stays, diverse eateries, and the irresistible nightlife. However, there are great east coast hotels and guest houses as well as remote northern hideaways.
Attractions/Sightseeing: Although Barbados is a relatively small island, it holds endless activity that keeps you busy no matter how long you stay. Enjoy the shimmering, crystal-clear waters on a pleasure or party cruise, or explore the exotic marine life on a snorkeling trip. Suspense seekers may prefer a rugged outback or safari tour, exploring the gullies and hidden treasures by horseback and hiking. Since Barbados is the birthplace of rum, it imperative to visit its several rum factories located throughout the island. Historically, stop by the Barbados Museum to inform yourselves about the intense Barbadian timeline, and afterwards, consider the grand Harrison Caves if you are in for an adventure. Barbados also has one of the oldest parliaments in the Common Wealth, so the government buildings are also worth a look around.
Cuisine: An alluring blend of old and new, Bajan cuisine (Barbadian culture/dialect) incorporates the influences of West Indian, Caribbean, African, and European delights to create a unique culinary experience. The Bajan diet includes flying fish, a national symbol. Seafood is a staple of the Barbadian’s diet due to the surrounding waters that provide an abundance of saltwater delicacies, such as tuna, red snapper, shark, salmon, cod, kingfish, and lobster. From elegant hotel dining to informal meals available at the many fast food establishments, sports bars, bistros, and beach bars, you are sure to find the perfect Barbados restaurant that suits your needs.

Beauty Balm or Blemish Balm (B.B.) creams began as a dermatology treatment in Germany during the 1950s. It has become extremely popular in Asia, especially Korea, over the past few years. This skincare and face makeup trend eventually traveled over to the United States but only by higher end cosmetics brands. Garnier recently debuted the first ever drugstore B.B. cream called the Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector.
According to Garnier, “B.B. Cream is a hybrid formula that offers advanced skincare and immediate skin perfecting coverage that is becoming popular all over the world. It combines several beauty routine steps in one single product.” I would say that a B.B. cream is the middle ground between a tinted moisturizer and a liquid foundation. It is extremely moisturizing and lightweight like the former but still slightly more pigmented like the latter.
The Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector retails for around $12. The packaging boasts very lofty claims, which appear nearly impossible to execute, on its packaging. It is marketed as an all-in-one product, replacing the need for a moisturizer, a foundation primer, concealer, and foundation. Garnier alleges that this face makeup “renews radiance, brightens complexion, evens skin tone and blurs imperfections, hydrates for 24-hours, [and] protects with SPF 15 UVA/UVB sunscreen against harmful effects of the sun—the #1 cause of skin aging.”
Online reviews from beauty bloggers and industry experts are mixed. Many gushed endlessly about how amazing the effects of this product were. Others maintained that the formulation was greasy, oily, and all but slid off their faces. After trying out this product for myself, I have found my new favorite face makeup.
The formulation of the Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector is light and smooth, as if you are merely swiping on some moisturizer. This B.B. cream provides a sheer coverage but can be built up simply by using more in problem areas. It seamlessly matched to my skin tone despite initially seeming a little too dark for my extremely pale face. My only complaint lies in the fact that the makeup leaves a dewy, almost glowing finish to the skin. That might not sound negative to many people, but I usually like a more even or matte finish. I merely set the makeup with a pressed powder to minimize the shine and also increase longevity.
I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in trying the latest face makeup trend. I especially recommend it to people with dry or combination skin, like myself, mostly because of the moisturizing properties. I caution those who have very oily skin, however. The sunscreen ingredients found in this B.B. cream might worsen or combine poorly with that skin type. Lastly, I advise you to apply the product and let it dry before proceeding. Personally, I sit in front of a fan for a few minutes just to make sure the B.B. cream has set in. Visit Target and CVS to purchase Garnier’s Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector B.B. Cream.

Max Brenner: Chocolate by the Bald Man is a unique restaurant with a variety of foods for both dinner and dessert. Max Brenner is known for its famous chocolate desserts and is truly heaven for all chocolate lovers. It is almost like a dream or fantasy in pure chocolate. Its 10 page chocolate dessert menu is unlike any I have ever since before.
Max Brenner’s mouthwatering desserts include its champion favorite chocolate chunks pizza, which is an out of this world experience, featuring several types of scrumptious chocolate fondues, soothing chocolate soup, delightful chocolate waffles, delectable chocolate crepes, luscious, melting chocolate truffle heart cakes, delicious classics with a chocolate twist, tasty ice cream sundaes and popsicles and yummy cookies and brownies. It has the baked dough of a real pizza pie with melted liquid milk, dark and white chocolate sauce, with fluffy, gooey marshmallows on top. It is so pleasurable that it’s orgasmic! You will feel like you died and went to heaven. Additional toppings include peanut butter, bananas, and crushed hazel nuts.
There is a separate Sweet Drinks Menu, which includes classic chocolate drinks, such as cappuccinos, mochas, espressos, hot chocolate, lattes with new unique twists, frozen chocolate frappes, ice cream milkshakes, chocolate cocktails, fruit smoothies, and Brenner’s famous suckao, a concentrated hot chocolate shot , and kangaroo cup, mocha from Yemen which has a unique chocolate aroma.
Max Brenner has actual “proper” food as well, which includes eclectic and international foods. It serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, sporting European classics, such as Italian pastas, paninis, and pizzas, French crepes and quiches, Greek salads and pitas, Mexican tacos and quesadillas, Asian chicken salad, Thai chicken, and American classics such as burgers, Mac and cheese, potato skins, chicken wings, spinach, and artichoke dip. To my delight, Max Brenner is vegetarian-friendly. I ate Max’s Sunday Mood Pasta, which consists of fresh tomatoes, spinach, and ricotta cheese with a tomato pesto sauce on Rotelle pasta.
Max Brenner only takes reservations online. The wait is 10 to 15 minutes long during the day. However, the line can be painfully long on Friday and Saturday nights, so I suggest you make a reservation. They take your name and tell you to wait inside their restaurant in their gift shop area. The attire is casual and dressy casual. It is not very handicap accessible since there are tables taking up almost the entire space, making it difficult for a wheel chair to even get into the restaurant. The restrooms are not the best. There are only two or three stalls, which always results in a long wait and crowd inside.
The staff is very friendly and accommodating towards any special requests, such as food allergies and certain diets. I always receive exactly what I order and am very pleased with the results. The food is served relatively fast. The atmosphere makes you feel like you’re in a European café with its dim lighting and various European meals, drinks, and desserts. The location is a large space, filled with numerous tables, amusing displays and decorations of sweets and treats. It is like Willy Wonka with an upscale European twist, as Max Brenner, himself, created his wonderful world of chocolate. The two floors let everyone get into the popular restaurant fairly quickly.
Max Brenner’s menus include a regular food menu, a brunch menu, a kids menu, a famous dessert menu, a drinks menu, and even a takeout menu. The pricing is fair, depending on what and how much you order. However, it can get expensive since there are so many things to offer. There is a never-ending selection of various foods.
Max Brenner has locations in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, and abroad. The main New York City location, two floors and a gift shop, is in Union Square on 841 Broadway Ave between 13th and 14th streets.  The other Manhattan location, a smaller and more bar/café-style eatery, is in the East Village at 141 2nd Ave. Max Brenner’s hours of operations are 9 a.m. until midnight Mondays through Thursdays, 9 a.m. until 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and 9 a.m. until 11 p.m. on Sundays. To make a reservation, visit the website at www.maxbrenner.com.

In the exhibition “Dialog in the Dark,” located at the South Street Seaport, you get to experience Manhattan in a new perspective– as a blind person. For 20 dollars (student discount), you can take a trip through New York City in complete darkness with only a cane and a blind guide to lead the way.
The light dims, and, suddenly, everything around you is black. With a cane in one hand and surrounded by known and unknown voices, you can´t see a thing. All electronic equipment is switched off or checked in outside, so there is not even a hint of light anywhere in the room. You get to smell, listen to, and feel the variety of the city. With the guide´s comforting voice and clear instructions, you stumble your way through some of Manhattan´s most popular areas.
The overwhelming sense of no control kicks in as soon as your sight disappears. You might feel dizzy or claustrophobic. My immediate thought was “I need to get out of here.”
Walking through the exhibition, you recognize the sounds, the smells, the changing ground, and all kinds of details that make Manhattan what it is. The charming guide talks you through whatever obstacles there are and gives good instructions in a light and funny tone.
The experience is intense and unique, even though the whole set-up is simple. It´s engaging; it’s fun, and it´s different. It gives you a newfound perspective on how much we depend on our sight to lead us through a day. At the end of the tour, the guide joins the visitors around a table, and as the lights gradually are turned on, he answers questions about his life as a blind person in a visual world.
“I now have a better understanding on how blind people experience their surroundings and how important it is that society do what it can so that it is easier for them to get by in their everyday life,” said Public Relations major Helene Pedersen, who experienced the exhibition. Along with five friends, she enjoyed the one-hour show. She found it to be scary, fun, and educating. She added, “I would really recommend others to do it; it was a really great experience.”
Nutrition major Aurora Kronberg also appreciated the tour. “I was scared at first; usually, you can see a hint of your surroundings when it´s really dark, but in there, I was completely blind,” she said, adding, “It was a great experience, and I can´t believe how the blind can navigate their way through the city; it is incredible.”
The New York Dialog in the Dark is one of many similar exhibitions. More than six million people have seen versions of the show presented in 35 countries throughout the world, with five permanent exhibitions in Brazil, Israel, Italy, and two in Germany. Organized by Premier Exhibitions, the New York version opened in 2008 and will run until the end of 2012.
“Dialog in the Dark” is found at the South Street Seaport Exhibition Center, 11 Fulton Street at Front Street, in Lower Manhattan. Visit www.dialognyc.com for directions and a complete schedule.

LIU Post’s Baseball Team has won three consecutive games and currently has a record of 19-14. The Pioneers defeated Dowling College 4-3 on Friday, April 13th, and took both games of the doubleheader the following day on the road against the University of Bridgeport, with scores of 2-1 and 3-1.
In the win against Dowling (21-13), the Pioneers got some revenge after having lost to the Golden Lions three days earlier by a score of 5-3. The Golden Lions took the early lead, as they tacked on a run in both the second and third innings. However, the Pioneers answered back with three runs in the bottom half of the sixth inning. Junior third baseman Kevin Chenicek drove in the first Pioneers run with an RBI single, knocking in sophomore right fielder Vincent Iacono. Junior catcher Anthony Corona followed Chenicek with a sacrifice fly, tying the game at two. The Pioneers weren’t finished yet, as freshman designated hitter Anthony Brunetti gave LIU Post a 3-2 lead with an RBI single.
Pioneers’ junior pitcher Rafael Martinez kept the Pioneers in the game with a strong six innings of work, allowing two runs (one earned) on nine hits. But in the seventh inning, sophomore pitcher Brandon Kruel gave up a run to the Golden Lions and made it a tie game at three. The game remained tied until the bottom of the ninth, when Chenicek came to bat for the Pioneers,and once again drove in Iacono on a single for the walk-off win. Sophomore pitcher Connor McCarthy recorded his first win of the season for the Pioneers.
In both games against the Bridgeport Purple Knights (8-14), the pitching of the Pioneers stepped up. In the opening game of the doubleheader, senior pitcher James Stone and junior pitcher Anthony Zapulla held the Purple Knights to only one run on four hits. The Pioneers had a difficult time stringing together good at-bats but found a way to scratch out a run in the fifth inning when junior second baseman Angel Pimentel had a sacrifice fly. The other Pioneers’ run came via an error in the seventh inning.
The second contest against Bridgeport was similar to the first, as the Pioneers’ pitching once again was dominant. LIU won 3-1. Junior pitcher Bo Budkevics threw a complete game, striking out three batters and allowing one run. The Pioneers had runs driven in by Brunetti, Chenicek, and junior shortstop Keith Herring.
The Pioneers’ next game is on Thursday, April 19th, at 3:00 p.m. at Concordia College (8-28).

On Saturday, April 14th, the LIU Post Women’s Softball Team played against Dowling College. The team came through with a win of 5-2 in the first game of the doubleheader and lost the final 6-4. The team improved its record to 31-15 overall and 19-3 in East Coast Conference play.
The Pioneers came out swinging in the first game, quickly taking the lead 4-0 in the top of the first inning. The Golden Lions responded with one run scored in the bottom of the first. After a run-less inning from the Pioneers in the second, Dowling added another run in the bottom of the second to come within two runs of Post’s lead. But in the sixth inning, the Pioneers extended their lead to 5-2 when sophomore Liz Weber hit an RBI single to score sophomore Nicole Hagenah. Senior Hayley Bettles pitched the final four innings for the Pioneers, spreading two hits, two walks, no runs, and three strikeouts over four innings.
In game two against the Golden Lions, Post took the lead in the second inning when freshman Alyson Dzierzynski scored a lead-off homerun. The score remained at 1-0 until the bottom of the fifth, when the Golden Lions scored on a two-run homerun followed by an RBI double, an RBI single, and an infield error that allowed the Golden Lions another two runs. All of the runs were scored in with two outs remaining in the inning to pull Dowling ahead 6-1.
The Pioneers’ offense showed a final spark in the top of the seventh with three more runs. Senior Kerry Fisher started the scoring off for the Pioneers with a two-run double. Fisher reached third base on an error in the same play and went on to record the final run of the day for the Pioneers.
The LIU Post Women’s Softball Team will take the field again on Wednesday, April 18th, when the Pioneers travel to Caldwell, NJ, to face Caldwell College in a doubleheader.

The New York Yankees cruised past the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday, April 15th,  with the help of game-changers Derek Jeter and Raul Ibanez. The 11-5 win was extra special due to the fact that the game celebrated the 65th anniversary of the breaking of baseball’s color barrier.  All players wore the number 42 in honor of Jackie Robinson, the first African American baseball player in Major League Baseball. The team also had a pre-game ceremony that included Jackie Robinson’s widow.
The Yankees solidified their lead when they had a four-run inning in the third, which caused pitcher Jerome Williams to exit the game early. The Angels’ pitching staff’s struggle to control the Yankees’ bats was made apparent after Derek Jeter’s line drive in the fourth to bring in three runs and Ibanez’s home run in the eighth.
The Angels made it a three run game in the seventh when Albert Pujols knocked in a run with a single off an ineffective Rafael Soriano, but David Robertson bailed the Yankees out of a bases-loaded jam to escape the inning. Mark Trumbo hit a solo homer for the Angels, his second, into the Angels’ bullpen in the second inning. Chris Iannetta added his second two-run homer of the series in the fourth, a line drive that just cleared the right-field wall. So far, the Yankees are 5-4 this season, and their next game is home vs. the twins on Thursday, April 19th.

The Pioneers gave up a goal just over a minute later to allow the Lions to tie the game up but rebounded with three more goals before allowing Molloy its second of the day at thee 17:14 mark.
From this point, the Pioneers took off. Post scored seven straight goals before the half ended to pull ahead an insurmountable 11-2.
