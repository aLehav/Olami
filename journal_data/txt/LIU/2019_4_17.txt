April is National Autism Awareness Month and there’s no better time to learn more about this disability. According to austismspeaks.org, autism is defined as a “broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication.” There is often a stigma associated with autism that shines a negative light on the autistic community. 
While it’s true that autistic individuals often require additional services such as speech therapy, academic tutoring, and additional experience in visual and performing arts to improve self expression and social skills, autism shouldn’t be seen as a handicap. Some autistic individuals require constant assistance and help while others live completely independently. This proves that the disability presents itself across a spectrum. 
Autism often decreases a person’s ability to follow directions, pay attention for long amounts of time, and express emotions, thoughts and ideas. Because of this, many are misdiagnosed as being mentally disabled, which is why autism awareness is so important. Often, individuals in the spectrum have issues comprehending body language, understanding sarcasm, and catching on to social cues. Because of this, making friends proves extra challenging and potentially leads to emotional and social outbursts. 
Imagine not being able to read someone’s body language to conclude what they’re thinking or feeling. On top of that, imagine not being able to express that confusion because your brain is overwhelmed with countless thoughts and emotions at once. This can be extremely frustrating for anyone, leading to anxiousness and anxiety. This is why it’s important to speak literally, calmly and concisely when interacting with someone on the autistic spectrum and to try different communication techniques to see what works best. This simple adjustment could make a night and day difference in the ability to effectively interact with an individual with autism. 
Research has shown that autism is a disorder of the senses in which individuals can either be hypersensitive or desensitized to sensory impulses such as sounds, colors, and textures. This is why some may walk on their toes to decrease the impact of the ground on their feet or may enjoy spinning on a swing as a calming, or “stimming” technique. 
There’s a wonderful film titled “Temple Grandin” that tells the real-life story of one woman’s journey living with autism. If you’re interested in learning more about autism through the eyes of someone with the disability, this movie is not only informative, but extremely instrumental in truly understanding it. The film helps shine light on the fact that individuals with autism are “different but not less” and deserve to be heard and understood.

Cary Epstein, professor of health and physical education, is the coordinator of the teacher preparation program within the departmentof teaching and learning. An adjunct professor when he first came to Post in 2011, in fall 2018 Epstein was hired as the only full-time faculty in the department of health, physical education, and movement science, which has since been combined with several other departments within the college of education under the new title department of teaching and learning. 
“I love teaching at LIU. I have had nothing but great experiences with all of the students in my classes. It is my hope to motivate and inspire them to be the best versions of themselves,” he said. 
Epstein spent his freshman year as an undergraduate student at Post in 1998 before transferring to the University of Albany to complete his bachelor’s degree. “I loved my time as a student at LIU and even though it was short lived, when I walk around campus, I have fond memories of my first year in college. I even still have my CW Post ID card.” 
Epstein’s job as a professor allows him to follow his life-long passion for health and fitness. “I always thought being a college professor would be a really amazing job, but it wasn’t necessarily on my radar,” he said. After obtaining his master’s degree in health education K-12 from Hofstra University, Epstein taught health for seven years at both Hewlett High School and John Adams High School. During that time, he taught his first college level course on substance abuse at LIU at night. “When it was all over, I knew this was the perfect career for me. It took awhile to get here, but I finally landed that full-time job in the fall of 2018.” 
Epstein was inspired by his late grandfather Dan Lurie. “He was a famous fitness pioneer and founding father of bodybuilding. His entire life was focused on health and physical fitness,” Epstein said. “He held world records in push-ups, pull ups and parallel dips to name just a few. He trained some of the world’s most famous bodybuilders and coined the slogan ‘Health Is Your Greatest Wealth.’” Epstein seeks to continue Lurie’s legacy of completing seven full distance marathons and beinga four time Ironman Triathlon finisher. “This September [8] I [will be] racing an eight-stage triathlon called the SOS [Survival of the Shawangunks] Triathlon and in October 13 I will be running the Chicago Marathon,” he said. 
Epstein advises students to focus on their health. “Everything you do now will 100 percent affect you in the future. It’s a hard concept to grasp when you’re young and you have no health issues. Look at what you eat, who you hang out with and how you feel about yourself. What kind of lifestyle do you live? All of these things will make and shape your adult lives, who are you now and who you will become in the future,” he said. 
Epstein teaches a course on human sexuality. “It’s so much more than just sex or being straight versus gay. I have had students come to this class thinking they know it all and have left 14 weeks later, thanking me for opening up their eyes to understanding human sexuality,” he said. 
Epstein, who teaches a course on substance abuse, sees the vital problem in drug and substance abuse. “Unfortunately, even with the use of the internet at our fingers and learning about the dangers of drugs and drinking early on in public school, the amount of young people
finding themselves addicted to various drugs is
alarming. 1400 college kids across the U.S. die
a year from alcohol poisoning alone,” he said.

Outside of campus, Epstein is an emergency
medical technician in the NYC 911 system. He
works for Lennox Hill Hospital, and he works
eight-hour, 12-hour, and 16-hour shifts on the
Upper East Side. He is also the EMS Lieutenant
at the Hewlett Fire Department. “It’s a juggling
act and I can always use some more sleep,” he
said.

Epstein is one of the co-founders of the nonprofit organization M.A.C.H.O. (My Actions Can Help Others), in honor of his late father Scott Epstein. “The M.A.C.H.O. Foundation aims to inspire people to think with their hearts. We believe empathy and compassion are core values that should be at the forefront of our society, and it is our contention that every one of us possesses what we call ‘M.A.C.H.O. Power,’” Epstein said. M.A.C.H.O. promotes its vision of ordinary superheroism through advocacy work, school assemblies, designated projects, camperships, and awards recognition programs. The Pioneer covered one of M.A.C.H.O’s events in a report titled “Volleyball for a Cause,” published March 7, 2017. 
Epstein is also a lifeguard at Jones Beach
during the summer, as well as the owner of the
“Epi-Center Rescue” business, which provides
professional open water aquatic consultation
and lifeguard staffing for large swimming and
multi-sport events. “As an avid triathlete for
many, many years, combined [with] my love
and experience as an ocean lifeguard, I saw
the need the for better safety measures on the
water,” he said. He is currently the lifeguard
director for the NYC Triathlon, Swim Across
America, Ironman and many other events.

In addition, he has worked as a background actor in movies and television shows such as “Mobbed,” “Deal or No Deal,” “Baywatch,” “The Good Cop,” “Mr. Robot” and “Billions.” He is the lifeguard consultant of the upcoming third season of “Stranger Things” and EMT consultant of ABC’s “Quantico.”

The Be the Change Club hosted its third annual You are Noticed Day speak out on April 9 in the End Zone. You are Noticed Day is an event to raise awareness for those experiencing feelings of alienation or loneliness. 
Adam Silverstein, junior social work major, is the president and founder of the Be the Change Club, and he started You are Noticed Day. He originally had the idea for the event when he was a senior in high school, and he finally made it a reality when he came to college. “I had the idea in high school but I didn’t really do it because I was about to graduate, but when I brought Be the Change Club here to LIU Post I did it, and we have been doing it ever since,” Silverstein said. 
You are Noticed Day is important to Silverstein because it raises awareness for a topic that’s not usually discussed. “I feel like it’s not really a topic that’s talked about enough; when you feel isolated, and lonely, and left out, and I think it’s something so many people struggle with,” he said. “We need to raise awareness for people who feel that way and open up those conversations about how we could all feel more connected with each other and work to help people who feel that way.” 
The main event of You are Noticed Day was a speak out in the End Zone at which students told their stories about feeling isolated. If students were not comfortable speaking out, they were still able to attend, have food, and hang out in a safe, supportive environment. 
The Be the Change officers want to make You are Noticed Day a nationally-recognized event and spread it to schools around the world. They plan to continue to host You are Noticed Day, as well as other events, on campus.

Tickets are on sale at the Campus Concierge in Hillwood Commons for the senior events for 2019. From attending a Yankees game to a senior formal, there is much in store to send off the class of 2019.

Seniors attended the senior grad fair from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Tuesday, April 16 and Wednesday, April 17 in Hillwood Commons. Seniors picked up their caps and gowns, took senior photos, ordered class rings from Balfour Rings, learned about alumni giving through the Employer and Alumni Engagement office, and met with members of LIU Promise and the bookstore.
Students who did not order their cap and gown before the March 15 deadline can still purchase them during the fair on Wednesday until 3 p.m. Undergraduate caps & gowns are $64.83, master’s are $99.35, and doctoral are $120.88. Students must be in good financial standing to pick up their cap & gown, and can pay by cash, credit card, or checks made payable to Barnes & Noble.
A senior formal will be held on Thursday, April 18 at Jericho Terrace from 7 p.m. to midnight. Seniors can dress their best for a night of dancing and glamour. Tickets include a cocktail hour, a dinner, and an open bar. Tickets are $60 for LIU students and $75 for non-LIU students and can be purchased at the Campus Concierge desk in Hillwood Commons. Campus shuttle transportation to the formal will leave from Hillwood Commons at 6 p.m.
For seniors seeking jobs, the Promise office will hold a resume review night on Tuesday, April 23 in Hillwood Commons room 270. Promise coaches will work with students to fine-tune their resumes so they can stand out in the job market. “The best tip we can give is to keep it [the resume] to a page,” Matthew Blanar, associate director of LIU Promise, said. “Employers don’t need to see everything you’ve done, instead think of this document as a tool to market yourself and put your best information forward to help you get the job.”
Seniors can visit the Blue Point Brewery in Patchogue, NY, on April 27. There are no tasting packages for Blue Point Brewery, but free transportation is available from Hillwood Commons and departs at 4:30 p.m. On May 4, seniors can enjoy live music and six wine tastings at the Baiting Hollows Winery in Calverton at 1 p.m. Tickets are $15 and transportation is available for students from Hillwood Commons at 12:30 p.m.

The photographers will be available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Hillwood Commons lobby. Headshots will be taken on a white background, so students are recommended to avoid wearing white tops.
The Promise office is collaborating with the Employer and Alumni Engagement office to co- host a career readiness fair for seniors hunting for jobs. Seniors are advised to bring copies of their resume and cover letter for a review with Promise coaches. Members of employee and alumni engagement will help seniors navigate the job search process through handshake. Free LinkedIn headshots will also be offered. The fair is on April 30 during common hour in Hillwood Commons. Graduating seniors can decorate their grad caps to symbolize their years at Post.

There will be a special movie night hosted by Promise in the Gold Coast Cinema in Hillwood Commons on May 2. They will be showing the movie “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.”
Seniors can spend a night of fun and games at Dave & Buster’s in Westbury on May 3 starting at 6 p.m. Tickets are $40 and include food, two drink tickets, and one game card per ticket.
To end the senior week events, graduating seniors can gather for a senior toast lead by members of the Promise office in the Winnick Mansion at 8 p.m. on May 9.
Seniors wishing to make the Green & Gold Graduation Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility can do so at any senior event. The pledge, according to the liu.edu website, invites seniors to make a promise to evaluate the broader consequences of any job they take. This is the ninth year that students can volunteer to take the Green and Gold Pledge.

 Caitlin Johnstone, senior health sci-ence major, traded her sea legs to run on land when she joined the women’s rugby team during the spring 2019 semester. She has been a member of the swim team since spring 2016 and plans to continue on the rugby team during fall 2019, the semester she graduates. 
Since the swimming season came to an end, Johnstone chose to make the most of her time by revisiting the sport she played in high school. “It’s nice to be a part of a team sport, swimming is more individual,” Johnstone said. She enjoys the learning opportunity that comes along with team sports. Playing on the rugby team allows her to get advice from her teammates and correct mistakes during gameplay. “A mistake might be drop-ping the ball, not catching it or tackling incorrectly,” Johnstone said.
Johnstone finished her swimming season and joined the rugby team with an ankle injury and a fractured foot. “With my injury, I thought I wasn’t even going to get to play,” Johnstone said. She took two months to heal and go through physical therapy before playing on the field in March. Johnstone officially joined the team in January. Despite having to overcome an injury, the main thing Johnstone adjusted to was the amount of running. “I found a lot of my skills from high school were still there, and I didn’t find tackling too bad,” she said. 
Since she joined the team late, John-stone was glad the other members were open and welcoming. “Walking onto a team that’s been together already for a couple of years, adding a new person could be messy, but I fit in well,” she said. Having a will to learn the sport again as well as teammates willing to help have been vital for Johnstone as she adjusted to playing rugby.
“I knew I wanted to play rugby after I was done with swimming,” Johnstone said. In fall 2018 she spoke with the previous coach, John Royal about joining the team. When Colleen Doherty became head coach, she allowed Johnstone to join. “It’s a relatively new team, so the team’s still kind of small and getting on its feet,” Johnstone said. Women’s rugby, which began on campus in 2016-17, cur-rently has 12 members. 
When she played rugby in high school, Johnstone enjoyed playing with 15 players on each side of the field. So far, the Pioneers have played games with seven team members on each side. Johnstone anticipates playing longer games with more players in the fall season.
Johnstone scored her first two collegiate tries for the Pioneers on Saturday, April 13 against Colby Sawyer College. “An achievement for me was being able to overcome my injury and step on the field and play,” she said. Rugby will become a Division I sport under the One-LIU merger.

 The women’s tennis team closed up its 2018-2019 season with a 7-0 loss to Adelphi University on Friday, April 12. “Some players were hurt and some haven’t had the chance to practice much during the off season, but we still did what we could,” Shanice Arthur, a senior psychology and forensic science major, said.
Rain and heavy winds didn’t stop the Pioneers from stepping on the court at 3 p.m. The game started with intense doubles. The Pioneers kept up with only one game behind Adelphi. 
This was the team’s last match before summer break. To commemorate the seniors, Arthur and senior Katie Kumpas, adolescent education major, were given flowers as a thanks for their years as players on the team. The two seniors were ready to face their last collegiate match, but with mixed emotions. “Honestly, I don’t know where my tennis career is going to go from here. College tennis has helped me make new friends and teach me how to balance my time,” Arthur said.
Sophomore nursing major Veronika Koudelkova and Arthur had a close game in their double match. The two kept up with Adel-phi for most of the game, but fell short by the end of the match losing 6-5. 
While the Pioneers were sunk in the singles, a noteworthy game between Arthur and Adelphi’s Samantha Perri gave the Panthers a challenge. Keeping up with the fast-paced game, Arthur managed to keep a tie between her and Perri for up for six matches. After that, Perri took over the game and the close game ended in a loss 10-7 for Arthur.

 Even though football season ended in December, Pioneer football players have been preparing to get drafted by an NFL football team. Running back Malik Pierre, wide receiver Mike Richardson, wide receiver Deon Mash, linebacker Jake Carlock and defensive end Kevin Petit-Frere have been working hard during the offseason to prepare for the NFL draft. These players earned invites to Columbia University’s Pro Day on March 14, where NFL coaches and scouts evaluated players as they performed different drills to show off their skills in the 40-yard dash, bench press, and much more..
“I had to get two NFL scouts to recommend me to the Columbia University coach, so I could get into their pro day,” Richardson said. He ended the season with 778 yards, 10 touchdowns, and was named to the All Northeast-10 Conference first team. 
“My pro day went really well. A lot of coaches and scouts liked the way I performed and everything,” Petit-Frere said. He ended the season with 11.5 sacks, 53 tackles, and was named to the All-American second team. “Kevin was a monster on the field this season. It always felt like he was making a big play,” said Jason Glickman, a sophomore broadcasting major and the WCWP Sports play-by-play commentator for the football team.
The players’ performances earned them invites to workout with the New York Giants. “After performing all the drills and tests, a Giants scout approached me and invited me to their local pro day on April 5,” Carlock said. Carlock ended the season with 67 tackles and 4 sacks. He made two huge plays to help his team win the NE-10 championship and was named NE-10 defensive player of the year. 
During their workout with the Giants, each player practiced drills with their position coach. 
“We went on the field and did positional work, ran routes with quarterbacks, and then stayed after to catch punts,” Richardson said. He also returned punts for the Pioneers during his three years on the team. Considering Richardson, Mash, and Pierre are offensive players, they went with the offensive coaches from the professional team, while Carlock and Petit-Frere went with the defensive coaches. 
“It went well. They had me do different line-backer drills to get a good look at me,” Carlock said. Carlock was also able to work out as a long snapper. “I felt good out there. I felt confident about the drills and my performance.” 
 Petit-Frere was a dominant defensive end for the Pioneers during his four-year career in green and gold, but the Giants’ coaches had Petit-Frere work out as a outside linebacker. “With my size, length, and everything, outside linebacker fits me well in a 3-4 defense,” Petit-Frere said. 
“I’d be like a stand-up defensive linebacker, but could also drop back into coverage against tight ends, running backs, and wide receivers.”  
Carlock and Petit-Frere both grew up as New York Giants fans and it was a surreal moment to be working out with their favorite team. “I’ve been a Giants fan my whole life. Seeing the facilities and everything was just amazing. It will be something I’ll never forget,” Carlock said. 
For Petit-Frere, growing up, his favorite player on the Giants was former All-Pro and former Super Bowl Champion, defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul. “Getting to actually be where he once was and hopefully get a chance to play for them, it’s just mind blowing,” Petit-Frere said. 
The Post players have also received contact from several other NFL teams. The Indianapolis Colts and the Atlanta Falcons also contacted Petit-Frere. “My agent did speak to the Lions, Colts, 49ers and Redskins about me after my pro day,” Richardson said.
“I was able to watch these guys week in and week out. These guys are game changers,” Glickman said. “I would not be surprised if an NFL [team] picks up one of these guys.” The football players will have to wait and hope until the NFL draft from April 27-April 29 to hear if their names are called to be drafted in the NFL.
