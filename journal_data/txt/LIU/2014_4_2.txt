In Fall 2014, LIU Post will add five new sports to its Athletic department — an expansion to move the Pioneers Athletic program forward. Currently, the Pioneer sports program consists of 15 teams, which have enjoyed success in both the East Coast Conference Championships and the National Collegiate Athletic Association Championships every season, with the Women’s Lacrosse team winning the NCAA Championship back-to-back.

With the support of University President Dr. Kimberly Cline, Bryan Collins, athletic director, is at the helm of this development. “President Cline had a view to move forward with the Athletic Department, so I began lots of research into finding out how we can make our athletic program excel if we add new sports,” Collins said.
Programs don’t want to add new sports if it comes at the expense of current sports, and with Post’s already successful program, there have been obvious murmurs around campus of slight concerns that the current sports may be affected. These rumors are not unjust as there were financial cuts of 30 percent last year. “We didn’t let those [budget cuts] affect our teams, but we tried to cut that 30 percent administratively. We are not touching any money from our present teams,” Collins said.
“I believe they will attract more people to look at us in a different way. Our regular programs and sports programs are getting more robust, and that will make our education more valuable as we go forward,” Cline said.
Cline is a big advocate of sports teams. She believes they are a key ingredient for a vigorous campus life, and that adding five new sports will improve LIU Post’s reputation as a forwardly-thinking, capable learning institution.
Bringing in new sports into the same facility does bring challenges, but Collins and his staff hope to build the correct infrastructure to accompany the introduction of approximately 75 to 85 student athletes, including 18 to 25 students for Men’s Wrestling, eight to 12 students for Women’s Golf, nine to 12 students for Women’s Fencing, and 35 to 45 men and women for Indoor and Outdoor Track & Field (including cross country athletes who can double up).
“We do have concerns about locker room allocation,” Collins said, as he began to unfold the various solutions to the challenges presented by new sports teams and new student athletes on campus, such as limited space, funds, and accessibility of trainers.
The new Men’s Wrestling team involves the most planning, and Collins’ solution incorporates an old weight room, currently used for storage in Riggs Hall, a campus dormitory. “In the basement, there used to be a workout room; we think with a bit of work, we can clean it up. It will cost a little bit of money, but we have funds available from our alumni for that renovation, so they can practice and have a locker room area there,” Collins said.
According to Collins, Women’s Fencing, “really doesn’t need a locker room.” Instead, he suggested they, “change in the general locker room area within Pratt, and practice in the multi-purpose room in the evening.”
Men’s and Women’s Cross Country are currently situated in large locker rooms capable of fitting 30 athletes in each. Since there are small rosters for Track & Field, they can share that locker room with the Cross Country teams. Collins described this as a “good fit” since many of the Cross Country athletes are set to be dual-sport athletes, competing in both Cross Country as well as Track & Field, in many of the long distance events that cross over.
Collins has a simple solution for the new golf team. “They will be golfing off campus, so they do not require a locker room on campus.” The golf courses, which the Pioneer Golfers will be using, are the Glen Cove Golf Course and the Town of Oyster Bay Golf Course.
Athletic trainer care is vital for student athletes who push their bodies to the limit every day. The LIU Post Pioneers currently have access to four full-time trainers and one graduate assistant. Most teams travel with a trainer to almost every match, meet, or game, ensuring that care is available before, during, and after contests.
“Health and safety is paramount for us,” Collins said, as he delved into the athletic trainer portion of the infrastructure required to support the new sports. “We are hiring one other full-time trainer to assist in the winter, and trying to keep the graduate assistant position filled. We have already observed a candidate to replace Tara [Humphreys, the current graduate assistant].”
Although there will be 75 to 85 new athletes and only one new, full-time trainer, Collins is positive that it will work out. “Some of these sports don’t have the injury types as some of the other sports, such as soccer or football, where the big injuries occur, so although the athletes will still be serviced on campus, we feel that the Golf team doesn’t have to travel with a trainer,” he said. “Depending how the enrollment is for the new sports, and if it is increasing, then the President ensured we can hire another athletic trainer in January.”
Adding new sports is one of the requirements when making a transition from a Division II, to a Division I athletics program. However, “The conversation may be on the table down the road, but I think right now we have a strong Division II program, and there are no immediate plans to do that, but I would never say never,” Cline said.
Collins stated that becoming a Division I program is, “A university vision, a strategic plan, which is easier said than done. There has to be a vision, as there are different dynamics necessary: full time coaches, facilities, and basic infrastructure to support it.”
LIU Brooklyn is already a Division I program, which Collins talked about as a possible obstacle on the hypothetical road to becoming a Division I program. “There are challenges of being LIU and having two D1 programs, one in Brooklyn and one in Brookville. I’m not sure we can have two different D1 programs competing against each other in this area, so I think some decisions would have to be made.”
For now, Collins and Cline share a view on developing as both an athletic program and a learning institution. “We are going to be the very best D2-school we can be so that if the administration decides to move in that direction we can have a smooth transition to that level.”

It is now official who will represent the class of 2014 at the commencement ceremony on May 9. Film major Petter Holmsen was awarded this year’s Valedictorian, and Maria Simone Emdal Otterlei became this year’s Salutatorian. Holmsen and Otterlei are both International students from Norway and also represent the School of Visual and Performing Arts.
Beth Wilkow, associate dean of Enrollment Services and University registrar, who was on the Valedictorian interviewing committee, explained how two candidates with similar backgrounds were chosen: “The process doesn’t look at the similarities or differences amongst candidates; the high GPA is the criteria that identifies the students,” she said. “Additionally, the jury looks at personal essays, letters of recommendation from faculty members, and campus involvement and community service.”
Among the six candidates that were nominated for this year’s honor, all of which were Scandinavians, one student stood out from
the rest. Petter Holmsen, a 22-year-old from Oslo, Norway, became a Film major and Honors student at LIU Post during the Fall 2011 semester. At that point, he already ran his own film production company together with two friends, and had participated in several international film festivals. In 2012, he won the Scandinavian short film contest VideoMarathon, receiving a $20,000 prize.
Susan Zeig, LIU Post professor and director of Film, believes that the university made a “superb selection” for this year’s valedictorian. “Speaking on behalf of our whole Film faculty, it has been a special pleasure to have Petter in our program,” she said. “He has pushed himself and his fellow students to always strive for high quality work,” she added. “Although only 22, you often feel him to be a more mature person. The quality of his imagination, intellect, and humor has enriched my classes and my teaching.”
It surprised Holmsen to be selected for the honor, after doing what he calls a “very unconventional” valedictorian interview.
“I was running really late and came straight from Ceramics class, in clay-stained pants,” Holmsen said. He was also exhausted from little sleep during the pre-production of a feature film. “I probably hadn’t slept more than two hours a night for a week, and started making a lot of jokes during the interview,” he added. “I felt like ‘they won’t pick me anyway’ so I might as well try to have a good conversation.”
But the jury, which consists of one faculty member from each of Post’s colleges/schools, along with the Dean of Students and the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services, chose Holmsen. On Tuesday, March 25, the film student received an email saying he would be this year’s commencement speaker.
Holmsen is currently working on his speech, but struggles after having made a bet. “I told some friends that I was nominated
for Valedictorian and we made a joke that if I won, I would recite the speech from ‘Braveheart,’” he said. “I never thought that I would become Valedictorian, so we shook hands on it, too,” he added with a laugh. “I’m not sure I’ll entirely keep the promise, but I want to do something different.”
When asked why he believes he represents the Class of 2014, Holmsen referred to how he has already experienced many setbacks that students will face when leaving school and starting their careers. One setback occurred when the VideoMarathon short film contest required him to use the prize-money for a new short film, and he was assigned a Danish producer, who turned out to be a fraud. “Part of the prize-money enabled me to shoot my dream project, which is also my thesis at Post, about two brothers who meet for the first time in Iceland, confronting their relationship over their father’s death,” Holmsen said. “But the producer was a hoax, and I still haven’t seen any of that money. It was one of the worst things that has happened to me.”
The past fall was tough for Holmsen, who started preparing to face the faux-producer in court while keeping up with schoolwork and other film productions. But the 22-year-old says that he grew from the experience, and bouncing back is something he hopes can inspire in his fellow graduates.
Commitment is also important. “I watched ‘Braveheart’ at age 12 and since then I’ve known that I wanted to do film,” he said. “I’ve had my mind set on going to school in the U.S. since then, and realized early that if you want to make it, you have got to give it your all.”
Even though his time in America has had its ups and downs, he is grateful that he chose LIU Post. “I’ve had great professors and have been able to expand my knowledge by taking Ceramics and Theater classes, two skills that I can definitely incorporate into my filmmaking,” he said.
This summer, he will expand his skillset further, having accepted a position at a funeral home in Norway. “The job is partly about earning some money, but mostly about doing research on a fascinating profession for upcoming projects,” he said. “But I’ll hopefully be back in the U.S. this fall, most likely in Los Angeles, to continue making film.”
This year’s Salutatorian, Maria Simone Emdal Otterlei, on the contrary to Holmsen, grew up in Alesund, a Norwegian city with just 45,000 citizens. She always had big dreams, and moved to New York to pursue a career in broadcasting. In LIU Post’s Broadcasting program, she has been involved with Post’s television station (PTV) and the school’s radio station (WCWP). She is the graphic designer of the Vikings Club, and an intern at NBC Universal.
The Broadcasting faculty is very satisfied with Otterlei’s contributions to the program. “The qualities that make Maria a good salutatorian are hard work, a good attitude, and the ability to focus on what is most important in her education,” said Jean Carlomusto, Media Arts professor and director of LIU Post’s Television Center. “She has maintained an excellent GPA while creating a successful internship in the professional world,” she added.
Barbara Fowles, chair of the Media Arts department and Professor in Electronic Media, explained that it is something of a triumph when a student majoring in the arts receives honors. “It shows that the university community recognizes that accomplishment in the arts has equal value to accomplishment in the Liberal Arts, Science, Business, and the like,” she said.
Maria was surprised to find out she had been selected as the spring’s Salutatorian. “I’m not in the Honors program, and it’s easy to feel invisible sometimes when just working and working in the editing lab, so I am really glad that they’ve recognized my potential,” she said.
During the committee interview, Otterlei brought up social injustice issues, and shared personal experiences that might inspire her fellow graduates. “My first time in the U.S. was filled with taking in all the new impressions, and I got too influenced by what new friends, the media, and school told me,” she said. “I felt an incredible pressure to work harder, eat less, and exercise more and it got to the point where I was on the brink of developing an eating disorder,” she added. “But with friends, school, and my internship, I got more confident and brought myself out of the vicious circle, and today I feel like I really know myself.”
Dedication is another strength that Otterlei hopes can inspire fellow graduates. “I have not just prioritized school work, but have also been involved in a club, worked for the school’s TV and radio stations, and had my internship at NBC,” she said. “It takes more than just doing one thing.”
Her final internship date is approaching but she hopes to get a job in the U.S., and would prefer working for a big network. “My future dream is to become a foreign correspondent, but I know there is a long road to get there so I’ll just try to get as much experience as possible on my way.”

The B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is busy during common hour on March 27, but in a small, concrete room on the second floor – far away from deadlines, stress, and obligations – David J. Steinberg is peacefully enjoying his lunch. Dressed casually in a jumpsuit, and surrounded by old archive drawers, it is hard to recognize the former LIU President. It will soon be one year since he checked out after 28 years of presidency at the University. So what is life like for a retired University President? 
“Less hectic, less chaotic, less pressured,” Steinberg said between bites of his sandwich. He said it is difficult to understand how he managed to be the president of three LIU campuses – Post, Brooklyn, and Southampton – for so long, constantly travelling back and forth between them. “But I loved every minute of it. I miss that.”
Although Steinberg is enjoying retirement, the last year has been far from a bed of roses. He has suffered from a chronic disease, lymphedema, for many years, and has had four surgeries since his retirement last spring. “So, retirement has not been a quick trip around the world, or a slow trip on a boat over to Asia. It’s been more in hospital rooms than I would want to remember,” he said. He is doing much better now, and explained that he is keeping himself busy.
Steinberg is currently doing research for a book on LIU from 1962 to 1972, describing the years as, “a critical decade in the life of the nation and certainly of our university,” and “one of the most dynamic, explosive eras of American growth.”
Passionately, he talked about the fundamental change in society during that time, which was directly related to issues of social justice; including racial equality, women’s rights, and universal education. “The Vietnam War sucked the air of civil rights in particular, and changed America,” he said.
He explained the rules, then, including separation of men and women, drinking obligations, and a notion of respect. “There was an explosive, generational divide of American students against the Vietnam War, against the ‘Establishment,’ against the notion that the adult community knows better. Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Brandeis, Berkeley, Free Speech, Foul Speech… All of these movements were changing American society in the most profound way.”
Steinberg explained that LIU students also participated in the revolution through different activities, such as demonstrations. During the early 1960s, Four-star Admiral and then LIU President Richard L. Conolly tragically died in a plane crash on his way to spring vacation. “The university was pitched into a kind of chaos, which it took decades to recover from,” Steinberg said. For the next decade, LIU had multiple presidents – some only staying for a few months – and there was an apparent disruption in whether to accept the new, modern student moves.
These years also included an LIU student tuition strike, and a historical faculty unionization, which made LIU the first private university in America to have faculty unions.
“It was all of this stuff going on. And what you have here,” Steinberg said and pounded one of the old looking archive drawers next to him, “are the ancient files of those people.” Steinberg explained that his illness and operations have delayed his work on the book, but he is hoping to start writing in a month.
Steinberg looks back at his presidency with satisfaction. He believes that his greatest achievement was developing the capacity to save the Brooklyn campus from closure. “There were 3,400 students [at the Brooklyn campus] when I arrived, and 12,000 now.” They rebuilt the Brooklyn Campus, spending over a quarter of a billion dollars, “refreshing it, renewing it, reconstructing it and repositioning it.” He explained that many other factors contributed to the success of the campus, especially new social and cultural efforts which were made in the Brooklyn area at the time.
However, Steinberg’s time at the university was not always successful. In 2006, the Southampton campus was sold to the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stonybrook, when LIU no longer could keep it financially viable, and Steinberg believes that to be his biggest failure. The problem was a lack of students, and, as a result of that, not enough donor support.
Three times during his presidency at LIU, Steinberg was offered to leave his occupation in higher education, and go onto the diplomatic corps. However, it was the unique optimism, youth, and energy, which students contribute to the institution that kept him from jumping into other opportunities. “If you ask me the question ‘are you happy that you had a career in higher education?’ –beyond the status of the job– the answer is ‘yes,’” Steinberg said.
Steinberg still has contact with some students, and said that watching a former student become a professional, a success, and a fulfilled human being, is one of the greatest rewards of his job.
Steinberg thinks that the greatest challenge for LIU in the future – as for all universities– is to withstand the assault of those in society who claim that college is a rip-off, that it doesn’t teach people enough, charges too much and puts people in debt. He said that education is more than getting prepared for a career; it is a chance to get prepared for life, and learn how to express feelings and formulate opinions. As society is changing, fast and radically, Steinberg realizes that education has to follow suit. “The challenge for all institutions is to know what to keep, and what to throw out,” he said.
Despite not being directly involved with LIU anymore, Steinberg and his wife still have many friends at the university. As a result of being active in the work with the Tilles Center, a concert was organized in their honor in May 2013. In addition, the Steinberg Museum of Art, located in Hillwood Commons, has been named after them; so has the imposing gymnasium, Steinberg Wellness Center, in Brooklyn.
With 28 years of presidency behind him, Steinberg is now only committed to his life as a husband, father, grandfather, and soon-to-be- author.

The School of Health Professions and Nursing at LIU Post is currently seeking qualified candidates who “can contribute to the diversity and excellence of our academic community,” to serve as the school’s new dean. As reported in the March 5 issue of The Pioneer, Dr. MaryAnn Clark, the former dean, who held the position since September 1, 2010, left the university in February.
Dr. Lori Knapp, the deputy vice president for Academic Affairs, who has been serving as the interim dean since Clark left, commented about the search for her replacement. “A dean should have a vision of where the school should be going. This particular school is placed in an environment where there are many medical centers and there is a tremendous health care delivery system.” Knapp continued, “So it’s important for this dean to have a vision about relationships with the community, the needs of the students, and making sure that students progress successfully.”
The most notable relationships that the school maintains with medical institutions include: North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and New York University Medical Center. Knapp stressed that the dean should have good interpersonal skills, since she or he will have to meet closely with department chairs and the ability to manage multiple projects.
The School of Health Professions and Nursing offers LIU students a wide range of academic health programs. According to
its website, undergraduate and graduate degrees include Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Cytotechnology, Forensic Science, Health Information Management, Medical biology, Nursing (for registered nurses only,) Nutrition, Pre-pharmacy, Pre-respiratory Care, Radiologic Technology, and Social Work.
Clark had previously been an associate provost for academic administration at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey, and acting dean and professor at Seton Hall’s School of Graduate Medical Education.
“Her departure coincided with a promising inaugural position in Boston which better aligned with her career goals. We are very thankful for the changes brought to the School of Health Professions and Nursing and wish MaryAnn Clark success in her future ventures,” said Paul Dominguez, the assistant dean of the School Health Professions and Nursing, in regards to Clark’s resignation. Clark is currently a professor and the executive dean of Health Sciences at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.
Due to Clark’s mid-semester departure, Knapp was appointed acting dean. Knapp explained that all the dean’s duties and responsibilities will be taken up by her. In addition, she will still do her day-to-day operations as Deputy Vice President of Academic Affairs. “As the acting dean, my job is to make sure that all of the academic programs proceed as they should, that students get all that they need from their academic programs, and that the faculty are properly provided with any kind of supervision or oversight that is needed,” she stated.
“Just getting underway,” Knapp responded when asked about the status of the application process. “But again, we already have a number of applicants and once the process starts, it marches along.” A search committee made of administration and faculty members receives the applications. The committee screens all the applicants, and its members make recommendations. Knapp says the university hopes to have a new dean in place by the Fall 2014 semester.
Dominguez stated that the School of Health Professions and Nursing is in the midst of changes. It has submitted revisions and
a proposal for a new program for approval by the New York State Education Department (NYSED). “While these proposals are under consideration at NYSED, we are not permitted to discuss the potential degrees. It is permissible to say that growth in existing departments within the school have been recognized by our President,” Dominguez said. “Dr. Cline is a great supporter of our students encouraging further development in our programs to benefit LIU for years to come.”

On Thursday, April 10, from 12:00 PM to 2:30 PM, the LIU Post Office of Career Services is hosting its 2014 Career Fair in the Tilles Center Atrium. This fair is an opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students of all majors to check out different career opportunities that are available in a variety of different fields, spanning from psychology to business.
Fifty-three different employers will attend, looking for students who are interested in internships as well as full-time jobs. Recruiters from organizations ranging from Geico, to the New York Police Department, to more hometown businesses such as the Glen Cove Youth Bureau, will be present at the fair.
Jason Cascone, director of Career Development, explained the premise of the fair. “The goal is to bring employers to campus in order to help our students not only find jobs, but also understand what companies are out there and what they do, and try to understand and learn about [the different] types of industries and jobs that might be available later on.”
The Career Services office stresses that this fair is for everyone, even if you are unsure of exactly what you want to do after finishing your degree. Career Services is even offering to review your resume at the Student Registration Table that will be at the fair. Someone will personally look over your resume and try to make it look as extensive and professional as possible in order to catch the eye of a future employer. Seniors at the Career Fair can enter to win a raffle for a $50 AMEX gift card by visiting the Senior Survey table in the Atrium.
Isabel Braga, a junior Psychology major, is anxious to go to the career fair. “I can’t wait to go and see what jobs I can look into that pertain to my major. Finally all my hard work will pay off. One of my fellow classmates went to the fair last year and said it was a great experience.”
For those who can’t attend the career fair, students can visit LIU Post Career Services for more information on the second floor of Kumble Hall, contact the offices at (516)299-2251, or check out the website. The office of Career Services offers a large variety of services to students that make finding a job after college very easy to do, such as perfecting your resume or giving you tips on how to present yourself professionally AT a job interview.
Cascone stated that many students have received appointments for follow-up interviews on the spot at previous career fairs, “We usually have people leave with interviews and we encourage everyone to come.”
Students should come dressed to impress in professional attire. Some interviews may be held on the spot as well as interviews being scheduled for a future date. This event is held every year; companies attending the April 10 event include, AT&T, Make a Wish Foundation, Suffolk County Police Department, and the Peace Corps.
