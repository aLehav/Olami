This year marked a historic moment within the NASCAR Cup Championships. Chase Elliot took home first place earlier this month in his eleventh victory of the series.
Elliot captivated his fans, following in his father’s footsteps, Billy Elliot, another Cup series champion.
Freshman adolescent education major Ryan Kaim was enthusiastic about Elliot’s championship win. “Overall, Phoenix put up an unexpected champion and a fan favorite when it seemed somewhat unlikely through 2020,” he said. 
The unexpected victory comes as a surprise to fans and other drivers who seemed to have a greater chance of winning. 
Denny Hamlin and Kevin Harvick initially dominated in this year’s series. Those racers were eliminated from the playoffs after compounding weaker results than the other drivers, making  them unable to qualify. 
This year, Phoenix Raceway in Phoenix, Arizona, hosted Championship Weekend. This marked the first time the city has ever hosted a championship race. 
The final race was not looking great for Elliot in the first half. However, Kaim thought he did a fantastic job playing out the remainder of the race. “Chase Elliot started from the rear after his car failed inspection twice, but he clawed through the field and led near the halfway point, dominating through the remainder of the race, taking the checkered flag,” Kaim said.

The NBA has announced its schedule for the 2020-2021 season. There is  a return date much sooner than anticipated for some players. The announcement comes on the heels of the Los Angeles Lakers championship to cap off a COVID-19 shortened season on Oct. 11. 
The following season’s games will kick off on Dec. 22, leaving teams like the Lakers and Miami Heat with just seven weeks of an offseason. A typical NBA offseason consists of more than three months of rest for Finals teams, leaving this as one of the many concession’s players have had to make to adapt to the challenges COVID-19 has presented the sport. 
The proposed turnaround would be the shortest offseason any of the four major sports have faced in their respective histories. 
Lebron James seemed to be displeased by this, posting a disappointed emoji to his Instagram when news of the schedule broke. However, National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) President Chris Paul urged players to remain level headed. 
“Nothing is perfect, we’re learning everything on the fly. The only thing that’s in control right now is that virus. We’re working hard to try to make sure that not only our players are happy but our fans are happy,” Pauk said. “None of the things that everyone is dealing with right now is ideal. I think about us and we get an opportunity to play this game. I also think about my kids who are doing online school day in and day out. We’re blessed to be in the situation that we’re in. Like I said, things aren’t ideal, but we’re trying to make them work.”
Senior film major Kyle Smith agreed with Paul’s sentiment. “Given the challenges Covid has presented the world, I’m just happy to see them playing at all. Everyone has had to adapt during these times, so I applaud the league and players for doing so as well,” Smith said. 
The NBA draft will kick off the offseason activities on Nov. 18.

Two of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play in the NFL face off for the all-time NFL touchdown passes record. Tom Brady and Drew Brees are neck and neck in the competition for touchdown passes. Currently, Drew Brees has the upper hand with having thrown 564 touchdown passes. Tom Brady is only a short track behind him and has 561 touchdown passes. While each quarterback is not getting any younger, they both continue to defy father time at 41 years old for Brees and 43 years old for Brady. After years of being in separate conferences, Tom Brady left the Patriots this offseason to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the same division as Drew Brees and the Saints. Tom Brady’s switch made this competition even more interesting. The next closest on the all-time touchdown passes list is retired quarterback Peyton Manning at 539 passing touchdowns showing that this competition is just between Brady and Brees. 
While both Brady and Brees are considered two of the best, their careers haven’t gone the same way. Tom Brady has won six of nine Super Bowls he’s been in, and Drew Brees has won the one super bowl he played in. Tom Brady has three NFL MVPs, while Brees has none, though Brees does have a Super Bowl MVP to Brady’s four Super Bowl MVPs. Both Brady and Brees have led the league in passing touchdowns in different seasons four times each. In their careers, Brees has led the NFLin passing yards seven times with 79,536 total yards, and Brady has led the league in passing yards twice with 76,969 total yards. Despite Drew Brees leading over Brady in some categories, Brady will take the career 225 wins over Brees 169 wins any day. 
While most regard Tom Brady as the best quarterback to ever play, the debate of Tom Brady vs. Drew Brees is more relevant than ever before. Jaden AlfanoStJohn, a freshman sports management major, thinks Brees will hold the record when all is said and done.“I think Drew Brees is eventually going to win in the touchdown race because he is 41, and Tom is 43, so I’m assuming Drew Brees will have more years left in him,” he said. 
 Ricky Conway, a Junior, thinks Brady will take the crown. “I think Tom Brady because he has better receivers with Antonio Brown coming back. Plus, for the most part, the Buccaneers schedule should be pretty easy besides the chiefs,” he said. 
Thomas Liantonio, a graduate  student, is unsure of who the touchdown king will be.“I didn’t watch the game between them. However, since Tom Brady has left the Patriots, he has been hit or miss in games. Brees, on the other hand, has been very consistent,” he said. “ Depending on when either of them retires will ultimately decide who will have the most touchdown passes, but at this rate, brees will be the victor.” Madoka Suzuki, a freshman,  also commented on this debate. “I think Tom Brady because he is the goat,” he said. 
From the looks of it, everyone has mixed opinions but are all excited for the season to continue and see who takes the win in most touchdown passes.

The 2020 general election brought new leadership and legislation for Americans. Florida made history by approving the Second Amendment, a $15 minimum wage initiative. The current Florida minimum wage is $8.56. The Second Amendment allows the wage to increase by roughly $1 every year until 2026 when the wage will reach $15 an hour. The Second Amendment passed with 60.8% approval, narrowly reaching the 60% supermajority that Florida amendments need to be enacted. The passing of the Second Amendment was a surprise to many as Joe Biden – a supporter of the $15 minimum wage – lost the state while the Second Amendment passed with a supermajority. 
Floridians who attend Post were excited about the Second Amendment.
“I do agree with raising the minimum wage to $15,” sophomore musical theatre major Lucas Vazquez said. 
“I totally agree with [Amendment 2],” sophomore musical theatre major Alexis Cid said. “The cost of living in Florida is so high, [the minimum wage] was $8.56 before and that was just unrealistic.” 
Florida is only the eighth state in the nation to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, joining California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. While the Second Amendment was passed, it’s unclear if the amendment will be enacted as it was stated on the ballot or if legislation will be introduced that undermines the amendment. In 2018, Floridians passed the Fourth Amendment, which garnered 64% support to restore voting rights to all ex-felons who had completed their sentences. The following year, Republican legislators passed a bill that excluded felons who owed fines or fees – disenfranchising 775,000 former felons from voting. While the question remains of whether the Second Amendment will follow its stated provisions, the first raise from the Second Amendment will be seen in Sept. 2021 when the minimum wage raises from $8.56 to $10.
Amendment 2 was strongly supported by the Florida Fight for $15 – a campaign to raise the minimum wage to $15.

Mississippi’s state flag will soon be changing after voters selected a new design for the state’s new flag on Tuesday, Nov. 3. The conversation on whether or not to change the flag began in June due to the flag’s inclusion of the confederate battle symbol in the design. 
Mississippi’s Gov. Tate Reeves approved the disposal of the original design from 1894 and began a new process that enabled commission work from residents. There were two rules for the flag submissions: the words “In God We Trust” had to be on it, and the Confederate battle emblem would not. After receiving over 3,000 submissions, flags were then voted on by residents. On Wed. Nov. 4, following election day, the results showed that 72% of voters approved of the new design. The new design is blue, red, and gold and features the state flower, a magnolia. 
Sue Anna Joe, one of the flag’s designers, told the New York Times that “The whole goal of this was to help the people find a flag they can be proud of and a flag that they can look at and say, “Yes, that represents me.”” 
Sophomore arts management major Evelin Figueroa supports the change from the old Mississippi flag.
“It’s really important for this country to acknowledge its role in colonial violence against marginalized groups,” she said. “While I don’t necessarily think that removing the confederate flag does much to make up for past mistakes or stop the violence that targets marginalized groups everyday, I think that it is a necessary step to call out and change racism on the legislative level and in the social spheres in America.”
Although the new design of the flag has been voted into the legislature, it is important that the law is followed by action. The design will be formally enacted during the 2021 legislative session, starting this upcoming January. It is during this time that the new flag will begin flying at public buildings statewide.

Montana, New Jersey, Arizona and South Dakota all voted to legalize the use and possession of recreational marjiauna on Nov. 3. Montana also legalized both medicinal and recreational marijuana in one sweeping legislative move. All of these states have different requirements and legislation at the state level on how marijuana purchasing and possession will be treated, but they now add themselves to the list of 11 states that already have legalized marijuana.
New York has not legalized marijuana at the state level, and many were surprised to see New Jersey be the first of the tri-state area to legalize recreational use of cannabis.
“I think that the legalization of marijuana is definitely a good stimulant to the economy that has no negative consequences,” sophomore psychology major Jessica Day said. “The drug is not addictive and is less detrimental to your health than many of the substances currently legal in the country.”
The debate about cannabis legalization does not only revolve around the drug and its personal effects, but is also involved with the economy.
In addition to legalizing marijuana, Oregon voted to decriminalize possession of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. The new punishment for possession is nearly the equivalent of a traffic ticket, rather than time in jail or prison. This initiative is looking to help provide more access to addiction assistance and rehabilitation services. 
Day also sees Oregon’s new law as progressive.
“Oregon’s drug decriminalization law that just passed is definitely shocking at face value however once you learn about it, it definitely poses some very constructive solutions to drug addiction,” she said. “Addicts will no longer go to prison for their addiction and instead will be put into rehabilitation centers where they can heal.”

In these trying times of the pandemic, with the rise in unemployment, students are doing anything they can to earn a bit of extra money.
The pandemic and lockdowns have led several creative students to start their own online businesses. Students are making many different artistic valuables, such as jewelry, and even custom designer items.
“My business Who Needs Canvas is based on wearable art,” said sophomore musical theatre major Jordan Coene.
Coene paints individualized accessories such as wallets, wristlets, fanny packs, cross bodies, satchels, totes, backpacks, belts, shoes, and leather jackets.
“I mostly paint characters, but I can do realism as well.” said Coene. She became very interested in art in eighth grade, kickstarting her success in this field of business.
“I loved painting and would practice everyday. Our teacher taught us to paint using canvases, so almost every week I’d go to the store to buy more canvases to paint on.”
Seeing all of her artwork made her want other people to appreciate it as well.“I wanted people to be able to see my work, and they couldn’t see it if all of my canvases were tucked away in boxes under my bed.”
This is when she came up with the name of her business “Who Needs Canvas”.“I thought, to hell with canvases and started my own business painting accessories.” Said Coene.
Coene’s business is growing quickly, after two more sales, she will have sold 50 pieces in total since starting her company almost a year ago.  “Who Needs Canvas” is not just a local business either. Jordan has shipped her artwork worldwide. 
“I am very excited to say that I have had some international orders as well, including the UK and Australia.”
With the holidays coming up, Coene knows she will be working on tons of orders at a time. 
“I suggest sending over a message soon, as I am already starting to get some holiday orders lined up” she said.
Coene’s business can be found on multiple social media platforms such as instagram and facebook at @who.needs.cavas. For more information students can reach Coene at whoneedscanvas@gmail.com
Another student who has created their own business is junior musical theatre major Angelina Umbrica. “I started my business this Summer around the time everyone picked up a hobby during quarantine,” Umbrica said.
Umbrica makes earrings out of polymer clay, her favorite style to create is funky 2-D geometric shapes. “Geometric shapes for earrings make such a statement,” they remarked.
Umbrica’s business has been growing since the summer. “Off the top of my head I would say I’ve made about 30 sales, mostly from friends and family,” they said.
Even though Umbrica mostly sells their items to friends and family, anyone is welcome to place an order.
“I’m always down to make some personalized earrings based on style. Anyone can send me pictures of their favorite outfit, Pinterest boards, colors, and I can make earrings to match,” they said. 
Students interested in purchasing a pair of homemade earrings from Umbrica can find her on Instagram at @claytimewithang.

Alex Trebek, famous tv show quiz host of “Jeopardy!” passed away at the age of 80. 
Trebek passed away in his Los Angeles home on Nov. 8, surrounded by family after battling pancreatic cancer since March 2019. The one year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is only 18 percent. 
Despite this diagnosis, Trebek continued to host the show up until Oct. 29. Throughout his career, he has hosted more than 8,200 episodes of “Jeopardy!” 
“He was iconic,” senior education major Olivia Ali said. “Jeopardy was a staple in my grandmother’s home, we watched Jeopardy together every time I would sleep over her house.” 
The game show host also battled depression as his cancer worsened. Back in Sept., Trebek had said in a video posted to the Jeopardy twitter account “[there were] some good days but a lot of not so good days.”  
Senior journalism major James Bonner said the passing of Alex Trebek was sad. “When you’ve grown up with someone in your culture, it’s strange to lose them,” Bonner said. “He was a cultural mainstay, it’s sad he had to suffer in the end.” 
Celebrities have turned to Twitter to express their condolences to Trebek’s family and remember the amazing man and actor he was. 
John Legend tweeted “I was obsessed with Jeopardy as a nerdy kid growing up in Ohio. I’ve loved and revered Alex Trebek since I can remember. What an iconic career. RIP Alex Trebek.” 
Brian Selter from CNN reported “Jeopardy!” is “not announcing plans for a new host at this time.” But some fans of the show would like to see Ken Jennings continue on in Trebek’s place. Jennings, a computer programmer, scored 74 straight victories in 2004, creating a record that has yet to be beaten.  
Jennings himself mourned Trebek on Twitter saying “Alex wasn’t just the best ever at what he did. He was also a lovely and deeply decent man, and I’m grateful for every minute I got to spend with him.”

Beginning Dec. 2, Post Theatre Company (PTC) is set to stream “One More Thing Not To Think About.” This show will consist of songs from musicals written by the famous composer Stephen Sondheim. The show is being directed by Benita de Wit, a New York based Australian director. Their credits include numerous off-Broadway shows as well as directing at many universities. They are joined by Debbie Tjong. Tjong is the music director of “One More Thing Not To Think About.” According to Kira Avarett, a junior musical theatre major, Tjong is working on both this show and the upcoming “Tick, Tick… Boom!” movie directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda. 
“Benita and Debbie are fabulous to work with. Benita has a truly unmatched energy and this would have been a much more difficult process had we not had someone who is so understanding and so incredible to work with,” Kevin DiCarlo, a sophomore musical theatre major, said. “Their positive spirit was so necessary during this time. Debbie is the most professional and enjoyable music director and makes learning music online feel like we’re in person together again. PTC really pulled out all the stops with this production team and I am truly privileged to be able to work with them.”
Avarett is excited to be working with a director who is new to PTC. 
“The amazing thing about bringing in outside professionals is that it gives us the opportunity to apply the Post-taught acting process to a show led by someone who may not know that process. It’s a learning experience with independence, communication and adaptability. Specifically with this show, it’s been incredible to work with Benita,” Avarett said. “As a director, they bring both amazing, collaborative ideas, and great energy to a working space, even if that space is a Zoom call. They have done so much work to make something conceptually large and looming as Sondheim accessible to us as college students who are just figuring our lives out.” 
The show itself will follow the theatre students’ lives during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
“The show is simply about us. We are using music & lyrics written by Stephen Sondheim, but we are decontextualizing them to fit our personal narratives, and following the structure of our collegiate lives,” Avarett said. “It’s about us as college students, us as part of social groups, us as artists and just us as humans.” 
Due to the ongoing pandemic, this show has been rehearsed and mostly filmed in a remote setting, with only one weekend of in-person filming. Working on a musical production through this process has been very different according to members of the cast. 
“Rather than rehearsing in the studio spaces, I spend most of my time recording video and audio for the video editor in my room,” Dicarlo said. “Our director is doing an incredible job of making this rehearsal process feel as similar to a regular rehearsal process as possible and our music director has developed a really fun way to still conduct music rehearsals over Zoom.”
As this was Avarett’s first time in an online production, it has become clear how in-person and online shows are different from one another. 
“In a live rehearsal process, you’re very aware of exactly what a show is going to look like. You get to view and experience the structural elements as they’re built in-person,” Avarett said. “With a show based on filming and recording, none of us know exactly what our performances will look like post-production.” Students who are interested in watching the upcoming production of “One More Thing Not To Think About” should follow the PTC Instagram, @liuposttheatrecompany for more information.

On Nov. 15, the cast and crew of Post Theatre Company’s (PTC’s) “Polaroid Stories” had their final day of filming. The show began rehearsing in Oct., and filming began on Nov. 6.  Over the past few weeks, the cast of the show has been engrossed in rehearsals and filming, and they’re now excitedly awaiting the screening of their show. The show’s virtual premier will be on Friday, Nov. 20.
““Polaroid Stories” tells the tragic and loving tales of classical Greek mythology through the lens of homeless street youth,” said senior musical theatre major, Jack Mannion, “we cannot wait to share it with everyone.” 
Actors in the show have been enjoying their work on “Polaroid Stories” since their process began in October: “The first table read we had was just shocking.” said sophomore acting major, Dylan Zak,   “I couldn’t believe how much fun it was, and it only got better.”
Out of precaution for COVID-19 however, “Polaroid Stories” had to alter their rehearsal process from what is typical for a PTC Show. 
“We ended up moving our rehearsal process to Zoom for a few weeks when cases spiked,” said Mannion, “as creatives, it is our job to innovate new ways for our art to come alive.”
In fact, the cast and creative team were able to take advantage of their remote work. 
“We found beauty in the struggle, and many beautiful ideas came out of the online process that we are now implementing into the production,” said Zak.
Filming a show was also a new challenge many cast members hadn’t encountered before: “It is a different beast entirely,” said Mannion. “The beauty of filming is you can take as many takes as you need to get it right, but there is also a double edged sword there,” they said, “sometimes it might take a ton of takes to get the scene right, and there is only so much time in a day to film.”
“It has been a true struggle to give it everything you have in these circumstances,” said Zak, “but that obstacle only made it that much better.”
With the show’s opening in only a few days, the cast of “Polaroid Stories” is excited to finally share their character’s stories with an audience. 
“I play D, short for Dionysus,  the God of Wine, Fertility, Pleasure, Ritual Madness, and Theatre,” said Mannion, “It has been a wonderful challenge to step into the role of an all-knowing God and to exude the mighty confidence a God should carry.” 
Many of the character’s stories are based in Greek mythology. “the audience can expect to see some familiar tales like Orpheus/Eurydice and Narcissus/Echo play out with unexpected twists and turns,” said Mannion, “all these characters stumble through a labyrinth fraught with peril in search of their deepest needs.”
Other characters live outside of Greek mythology, but intertwine the mythological stories together in the play: “I play SKINHEADboy, this character is the glue that holds the story together,” said Zak. “It truly has been a great experience working on a character that I find so much beauty and darkness in.” 
With their process now behind them, the show’s cast is grateful to have had the opportunity to work alongside each other and their creative team on this piece.
“Every artist involved with the show was so understanding, it’s been quite refreshing to be able to come in with a ton of my own choices and see which ones stick and which ones need a little bit of redirecting” said Mannion. 
“My fellow actors are fabulous and fantastic artists filled with marvelous ideas and NJ, our director, has been forming an image that I don’t think anybody could even imagine,” said Zak, “It has been an honor to work with such an imaginative and raw team.”
