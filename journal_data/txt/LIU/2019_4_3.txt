Singer-songwriter, Kelsey Hunter from northern New Jersey lit up the Tilles Center March 21. The former student graced the stage as opening act for American rock band, Foreigner. 
“It was surreal to be honest with you, I can’t wrap my head around it,” Hunter said. “It’s always been a dream of mine, I’ve always loved rock and roll,” she said, comparing her experience on stage to the video game Guitar Hero. Hunter completed the first two years of her audio design degree at Post before transferring to Montclair University and graduating in 2016. 
Music has been a passion of Hunter’s since she was young; in middle school she was the star of an all girl band, the Rhetorical Questions. “I was always a little more serious than the other girls, I knew how hard it was at that age to all be on the same page, that [was] when I started writing on my own,” Hunter said. 
For Hunter, music was a form of release, and although the time and effort is challenging, she is incredibly thankful. “At the time [when she began her career] I was a very shy and private person, so I started writing songs about myself and then it just blossomed from there,” she said. 
Hunter often turned to music during tough times in her life. Music was her main outlet, although it wasn’t easy. “When you start writing you’re a little shy about it, giving somebody your work is so vulnerable,” Hunter said. “I’ve learned throughout the years that the more you share, and the more vulnerable you are yourself, the better you become at your craft.” 
Having worked as a performer for two
years, Hunter realized that people want to help
and see an artist succeed. “People aren’t that
harsh, music is something that connects us all,
so everyone wants to be a part of it, they want
us as musicians to do well for ourselves,” she
said.

It’s thanks to her family and long term girlfriend Sage who pushes her to achieve more. “She keeps me grounded, she’s always there by my side, telling me you should change this lyric, she’s helped me with instrumentals,” Hunter said, adding “she’s not just my girlfriend but she’s a person who gives me honest feedback.” 
Hunter plans on growing her fanbase and creating more music. At the end of May Hunter is heading to Dreamland Studios, an old reconstructed church, to spend time working on her latest single “Let Me Burn.” 
“I find this song super important because
its really a pivotal song in anything that I’ve
ever written, I think my songwriting has come
into fruition,” Hunter said. “I starting to see
parts of it that I’ve always been a little scared
to show people, this ones a rock and roll, gritty
song and I’m just so excited to get it recorded.”

In the next five years, she wants to incorporate more of a band in her music. “I just have so much fun on stage with other people, and just rocking out. I want to have a concrete band that comes and travels with me, and have a full album, not just an EP, with pictures and everything.”

Ceramic sculpting is a popular art form on
campus where some students feel a sense of
connection to their work and to the material.
Frank Olt is a professor of ceramics and runs
the ceramics studio located in the Craft Center.

“People really like to work with their head and their hands, ceramics is a very accessible medium it is resilient, and you can learn from it. It is absorbing and therapeutic,” Olt said. He is passionate about introducing students to ceramics and making sure they have a great time. 
“It is not a classroom, it is a studio. It is a
different environment, and that environment is
a comfort zone,” Olt said. This allows there to
be a sense of community between students that
makes the ceramics studio a popular spot for
students.

“Students come here and get so involved that this place is hopping at night when the rest of campus is closed,” Dan Christoffel, adjunct professor of art, said. “They [students] get wrapped up in something about clay that is really compelling. Once you come here, you become part of a family,” he added.
Maria Salazar is a senior art therapy major who frequents the ceramic studio and creates many pieces. “Ceramics is my therapy. It is a meditative space for me, and I get to forget about everything,” she said. “The possibilities are endless. It is so versatile: you can paint you can build [and] do so many techniques.” 
Salazar showed a piece titled “Peaceful Warrior” that represents her Peruvian culture. “She is in the balance of listing to her heart and brain, and sometimes you have to decide what is going to move you,” Salazar said. She was previously a Marine, so there are stripes of war paint on the sculpture to represent camouflage. “She is peacefully ready to take on life,” Salazar said. Salazar will exhibit more of her art in the Sculpture Gallery on April 17 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m
Diana Roldan (‘19) is currently a student assistant at the studio. She has enjoyed creating art with clay since she was young. “I took a ceramics course at Nassau Community College, and I was able to experiment with coiling and make more functional work,” Roldan said. “Ceramics is my life; it is the way I can fully express the things that are in my head.” 
Jeffrey Gomez is a senior art major with a concentration in ceramics. “It gave me a feeling of purpose, it is teaching a physical skill,” he said. “You are forced to give whatever is in front of you your full attention as it could fall apart at any moment.” 
Emily Halper is a senior art education major. “To create [from] nothing and make something so realistic that it almost feels human is a really cool feeling,” Halper said. “Not everyone has access to a facility like this, so ceramics creates a whole other excitement, and it is different,” she added. “The material feels natural and you’re connected with the art more.” 
The ceramics studio is open for students to
visit every day, and people are ready to help.
“There’s always a coffee pot here, and tea,” Olt
said.
