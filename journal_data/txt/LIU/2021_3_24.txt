Drew Brees, former quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, has announced that he is retiring. 
The announcement came via an Instagram post, which included a video of Brees’ four children sitting on a couch with Saints jerseys. 
“After 20 years as a player in the NFL and 15 years as a Saint, it is time I retire from the game of football. Each day, I poured my heart & soul into being your Quarterback,” Brees wrote. “Til the very end, I exhausted myself to give everything I had to the Saints organization, my team, and the great city of New Orleans.”
Brees was born in Dallas, Texas, on January 15, 1979. He attended Purdue University, where he graduated with a bachelor’s in industrial management in 2001.
In 2003, Brees married his college sweetheart Brittany Dudchenko. Together, they have three sons and a daughter.
From 2001 until 2006, Brees played for the San Diego Chargers. From 2006 until 2020, Brees played for the New Orleans Saints. Standing at 6 feet tall and weighing in at 213 pounds, Brees was known for his athleticism and his “work hard, play hard” mentality on the field. 
Throughout his career, Brees offered sports analysis across a variety of networks. Most recently, he served as a commentator for NBC Sunday Night Football. 
Brees touts an impressive record, with 13 trips to the Pro Bowl, two AP Offensive Player of the Year accolades, a 2006 Walter Payton Man of The Year honor, an NFL-record 80,358 yards passing, 571 touchdown passes, a 67.7 completion percentage, and most importantly, the first and only Super Bowl appearance and Super Bowl Victory for the New Orleans Saints. 
Many colleagues and fans of Brees spoke very highly of him, admiring Brees’ dedication, generous nature, honesty and leadership abilities. 
“When I was hired by the Saints as head coach in 2006, the very first goal was to establish a functional and winning culture,” Saints head coach Sean Payton said in a statement to NFL.com. “In doing so, it was vital to know what we were looking for in a player, talent, work ethic, makeup, intelligence and leadership are all qualities we found in Drew Brees. We also found a player with a burning desire to win. Within a year, he helped lead our team to the club’s first NFC Championship appearance.”
“Drew is so much more valuable than all the records, awards and accolades that he amassed through a 15-year career with the New Orleans Saints and 20-year NFL playing career, one of the greatest in our league’s history,” Saints owner Gayle Benson said in a statement to NFL.com. “When Drew first joined the Saints in 2006, my late husband Tom was determined to deliver a team to New Orleans that would win a championship on the field and become a leader in the community following the setbacks that Hurricane Katrina dealt our region. Over and above his outstanding performance, Drew came to represent the resolve, passion and drive that resonates not only with Saints fans and football fans, but our entire community.” 
             Sophomore finance major Jake Wayne has been a huge fan of Drew Brees on and off the field.
“I love the guy, but he’s worked hard for all he has, and it’s time for him to enjoy it,” Wayne said. “I just wish I was lucky enough to live that kind of life.” 
             Junior economics major Sarah Ferarra is happy to see Brees enjoy himself post his legendary career.
“He’s always seemed like a good guy, and I think it’s great that he’ll get to spend the rest of his days focusing on his friends and family,” Ferarra said. “That picture he released on Instagram with all of his kids was just adorable.” 
Though retiring from football, Brees has stated that he will not remain absent from the public eye and plans to be involved in New Orleans to help the community. 
“I am only retiring from playing football, I am not retiring from New Orleans,” Brees said on his Instagram page. “This is not goodbye, rather a new beginning. Now my real life’s work begins.” 
             Drew Brees has since extended his contract with NBC Sports as an analyst on their NFL broadcasts and other sporting events.

The Writing Center, Humanities NY, the Black Student Union and the Bottom Line magazine will host “Womxn are Lit” a read-in event to celebrate Women’s History Month on Thursday, March 25 from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Zoom.
Any femme-identifying students are welcome to join and celebrate the writings and achievements of either writers who are or writings that revolve around women.
Mary Pigliacelli, director of the writing center on campus, first organized the event four years ago to celebrate prominent writers who are women and highlight any up and coming writers on campus. 
Every year, Pigliacelli collaborates with the Black Student Union to help achieve a space that amplifies the voices of authors that are women. Alongside Pigliacelli, Amanda McCollum of the Black Student Union helped create a space where people can celebrate their favorite women authors. 
Students come to share their own writing by their favorite authors who are women, or writings about women in their lives. While the first few iterations of the events were in-person, due to campus social distancing policies, Pigliacelli is looking forward to coming together on Zoom for this year’s event. When people attend the event, Pigliacelli says that she wants everyone to “feel the joy of each other and leave feeling good.” Pigliacelli also highlights the more intimate nature of the event due to it only being exclusive to students and faculty. By doing this, she says that we as a campus can “fully experience and celebrate the joys of writing.” 
McCollum says that this annual event is an opportunity to “uplift the voices of women authors and share writings between women.” 
Events like this, according to McCollum, can “uplift the voices of female writers on campus so that they have a chance to share their work.”
Students who are interested in attending the event can email LIUPostWC@gmail.com for more information. Students can also follow the writing center on Instagram @postwc.

The nursing program on campus has been recognized as one of the top 25 of it’s kind in New York. 
RNcareers.org surveyed over 1,700 nursing programs before putting out their sixth annual report that ranks the top nursing programs in the U.S. This list helps prospective nursing students find the right school for them, and LIU was recognized on the list.
The nursing program at Post is described as a rigorous one, and they offer students medical technology that is not often available at other schools.
There is a simulation lab on campus that mirrors a real hospital. Students can get experience practicing their medical skills before entering into the real world.
“We have so much to offer here, and I feel very proud,” Nursing Chairperson Dr. Margaret Stroehlein said.
This is the first year Stroehlein has been chairperson for the program, having been a professor in the years before. 
With hospitals still short-staffed and overworked due to COVID-19, Stroehlein has been proud to see her students step up.
“Our students have not missed a beat,” she said.
Students have been provided with safety gear so that they are able to continue their studies during this time. They have had fit tests for their own N-95 masks to ensure a correct and safe fit.
“We don’t want our students to miss anything despite the times we’re in, and it’s only made the students stronger, I think,” Stroehlein said.
Nursing students are still going to hospitals and labs to complete their training, and nothing in the curriculum has changed since the  COVID-19 pandemic began. Stroehlein is very proud to say that the quality of education has not dropped since the pandemic started. 
Sophomore nursing major Greta Burke is among the students on campus still studying in-person despite the changing times.
“I think it’s awesome [that] our school is being recognized for this amazing program,” Burke said.
Burke fell in love with the program and school when she attended the summer honors institute for health professionals on campus. 
Burke recalls the difficult adjustment from in-person courses to virtual meetings last spring.
“Last semester, I had to set up an IV over Zoom and [it] ended up spilling fake celine all over my desk. The professors were great at helping us adjust to a different way of learning,” Burke said.
As a sophomore, Burke is able to practice in the simulation lab this year. Her class says that they are glad to be back in-person getting hands-on experience in their program.

One in every four adults has a disability, according to the CDC. Still, we are not always accommodating to those with disabilities despite how common disabilities are among Americans. The Covid-19 pandemic uncovered a lot of these biases towards those with disabilities. 
Pre- Covid people who wanted or needed workplace accommodation were often told these needs couldn’t be met. An example being a flexible work environment or the ability to work from home. When employees would ask for this adjustment they were told it would be too hard to accommodate. Yet, when they can’t make it to work, they are chastised for missing too many days and eventually lose their jobs for that reason.  
 When covid hit, the jobs that could be work from home, almost instantly transitioned or made the strides to be able to transition. Leaving the disabled community questioning why something that could have been done pre-pandemic, wasn’t done till it affected everyone.  
According to the Washington Post, more than one million employment discrimination complaints have been filed with the government since 2010. However, these are just the issues that are reported. There are so many micro-aggressions against disabled people that go unreported.   
 Among these people who have been affected by disability discrimination is deaf author and activist Avril Hertneky. Hertneky has gained over 3 thousand followers on Tik Tok by detailing her issues with discrimination in the Deaf community. Her story mirrors a lot of similar experiences shared by others in the Deaf community.
Hertneky is an effervescent 28-year-old, mother who enjoys reading, writing, and spending time with her family. When she moved from Canada to the US, she made the decision in the hopes of better opportunities for her family. She describes herself as deaf, not disabled drawing a big distinction between the two.
“I am deaf, I am not disabled,” Hertneky said.“I would say it is normal for the political system to call us, to label us as disabled because there are no job opportunities. But with friends and family, we don’t label ourselves as disabled.” 
   When Hertneky has faced many issues in her life that others don’t often think or worry about. 
“In Canada, I was in the hospital. I requested an interpreter, and I kept being denied an interpreter. A counselor came in and I said I still want an interpreter, they forced me to speak, They said you can speak. And I said n-n-n- no. They were saying that I didn’t need an interpreter because I could voice.” Said Hertneky; voicing is a term used in the Deaf community for a deaf person that can speak. 
 “But that’s where missing information and misunderstanding happen without an interpreter. They took my voice at that moment,” explained Hertneky. 
Canada and the U.S. both have Anti-discrimination and disabled person accommodation laws. However, unlike the US, Canada doesn’t have many accommodations for disabled people, the protections only extend to the workplace, not beyond it. Businesses and other government organizations do not have to accommodate disabled persons.  The ADA (The Americans with Disabilities Act), which is a law,  also acts as a government organization that aids in the enforcement of accommodations for disabled people that reach all aspects of life.  The ADA doesn’t only extend to just the workplace, it extends to places such as schools, businesses, and more providing as well as enforcing proper accommodations everywhere.
Although the US government has more protection for the disabled community Hertneky feels discrimination, on an interpersonal level,  has a long way to go. In a Tik Tok on her account @avrilhertneky,  published Feb. 12, 2021, Hertneky tells viewers about a traumatic experience in a peer group.
”I moved to Frisco Texas, two years ago from Canada. I have two kids. I decided to join the Frisco mom group on Facebook. The admin approved me [and] I was excited to learn about Frisco and its events. I remember I made a post, I warned Frisco moms that I was sorry for my English grammar, and bear with me,” Hertneky said. “I was asking a question about my kids, the members attacked me. The admin removed me as a member, I was confused. I was asked to inbox the admin. I asked why she removed me as a member.  The admin attacked me. She told me to ‘shut the f— up and don’t bother her. Deaf is gross’.”
From her traumatic experiences, she gained the urge to fight against these types of attacks on the Deaf community, 
“The Deaf community here [ in the U.S.], is fully accessible.  And I really learned from them and you know and we were really able to get into the politics and get involved in those types of discussions. The deaf community here in Texas was so much stronger than the one in Canada. I was really able to really get immersed in that culture.”
Hearing her peers’ stories about their own battles of discrimination became the impetus for her to start writing. 
 “ It was kind of like a wake-up call,” Hertneky said, “ If I wrote this book they [ the Deaf community] would see, and maybe they would feel like they would want to share their experience.”  
Since becoming a writer, Hertneky also became an advocate for the Deaf community.  She has set up a blog about how to fight for your rights and what are the steps you need to take to defend yourself as a deaf person.
 “I would make vlogs.” Of political events such as town halls, “ showing them [the Deaf community] in their language, showing them what to do and how to take those next steps,” in becoming a part of the political process.
 One day she hopes to meet the president and introduce new legislation that helps give deaf people equal language access to important television programs, such as the  Presidential debates and local government events, with the same ease that hearing people have access to them. In addition, Hertneky hopes to start new legislation to offer ASL classes as a second language to improve accessibility and language barrier issues. 
If you want to aid the deaf community in their fight Hertneky recommends that you support deaf organizations, support deaf businesses and take an ASL class and a Deaf culture class.  Deaf culture classes are classes that explore the ways the deaf community expresses itself, deaf history, as well as the struggles the community faces. Deaf, hearing, or part of the disabled community we can all do better to make this world a more accessible place.
