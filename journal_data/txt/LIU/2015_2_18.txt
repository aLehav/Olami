The Haven Course, a new online course in understanding sexual assault, is being required for both undergraduate and graduate students to complete for the spring 2015 semester. LIU Post has partnered with EverFi, the company that produces the Haven Course, to give students a comprehensive education on the controversial topic. An email was sent to students via their MyLIU email accounts in early February with instructions on how to complete the required course.
The Haven Course is an online assessment, which includes two parts. The course informs students about a number of important issues, such as the ethics of relationships, alcohol and its effect on relationships, consent, as well as both facts and myths related to sexual assault. The first part takes about 45-minutes, and then is required to be retaken a month later for 15-minutes.
Although the university has stated that the training is required, it is unclear what steps are being taken to enforce full compliance. LIU Post implemented this course in hopes of raising awareness about sexual assault on campus. It is more of a precaution than an issue that needs to be addressed, according to Jean Smith, the Associate Dean of Students. “The Haven course is a thoughtful educational program for adults committed to thinking about their life choices, and is an important part of our continued fight against sexual assault,” Smith said.
While the goal of completing this course is to help students make well-informed decisions about serious issues, some feel differently. “I took it and it was common sense. There are some things that are in the course that we should have known since day one at Post,” said Nathalie Souffrant, a senior Sociology major. “This course should have been added to the College 101 Class.” The administration has implemented this course in order to educate people to make smart decisions, as well as raise awareness.
LIU’s main goal is to create a healthy and safe environment for everyone. Katherine Ahern, an Assistant Professor of English, felt positively about the new program. “I do think that increasing awareness and taking safety concerns seriously should always be important to any campus,” Ahern said.
For more information about the course, students can contact Jean Anne Smith, the associate dean of students, at 516-299-2480/ jeananne.smith@liu.edu, or visit www.everfi.com.

Irving Gerber, 87, a former adjunct professor of Education in the College of Education, Information and Technology, who taught Curriculum & Instruction for 13 years at LIU Post, filed a complaint with the New York Division of Human Rights on Nov. 10, 2014. Gerber claims that he was not assigned to any new sections for the Spring 2014 semester because of his age.
The university vehemently denies this claim of discrimination. “It is an unfounded/ unsubstantiated allegation that the university would make any personnel decision based on age or any other discriminatory factor,” said Gale Haynes, Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, and Legal Counsel for LIU.
A contract for an adjunct professor is usually semester-to-semester on a work available basis, but Gerber is one of three adjunct professors who taught in the CEIT who believe they were discriminated against based on age. Gerber said that he, along with two other men, Brian Persky, 75, and Norman Goodman, 72, both former adjunct professors of Curriculum & Instruction, were the only three supervisors in the department that were fired.
“Why did [they] select the three of us, who are the oldest people [to terminate]?” Gerber asked. “The college did a disservice to the students because when they fired the oldest [in the department], they fired the three most experienced. They didn’t fire me based on merit because I’ve always gotten exemplary student reviews,” he said. Gerber added that he has always been a respected and recommended supervisor in the department of Curriculum & Instruction at Post. “I did more than just what was required of me,” he said. “It’s illegal and it’s immoral.”
“I have worked with Mr. Gerber for over the last several years at Long Island University/C.W. Post Campus, where he serves as a university supervisor,” said Dr. Karleen Goubeaud, former Assistant Professor and Coordinator of Student Teaching in the department of Curriculum & Instruction, in a 2005 letter recommending Gerber to be a candidate in the doctoral program. “I have known Mr. Gerber to be a conscientious professional who has a passion to help students develop into competent teachers. He is always professional in his responsibilities, and demonstrates an enthusiasm for teaching and learning.”
Gerber said that he was not assigned a section for the Spring 2014 semester based upon allegations that were misconstrued and “dishonest.” Gerber claims he was not assigned any classes because of an incident that occurred at a school in the Three Village Central School District where he once observed LIU Post’s student teachers. According to Robert Hannafin, the former dean of the College of Education, Information and Technology in a response to a grievance letter filed by Gerber’s union on March 4, 2014, Gerber walked through an unauthorized door at the school before the initial filing of the current complaint.

Gerber was also accused of calling the principal of Three Village Central School District an “idiot,” according to a Nov. 22, 2013 email sent to Gerber by Goubeaud. However, Gerber said that he has never met the principal of the school, and mentioned to the security guard of the school that it was “idiotic to have a parking lot at the entrance to the school and have nobody at the door to allow visitors, parents, etc. to get in.”
“Mr. Gerber has been a good colleague over the years, but this transgression compromised our relationship with the school and is unacceptable,” Hannafain said in the university’s response to the grievance. Ultimately Hannafin did not “find merit in Professor Gerber’s grievance,” according to the 2014 letter.
After Gerber’s grievance was declined, Gerber said that he filed a complaint with the Human Rights Division. Gerber said that, in denying him classes this semester, the school cited budget cuts, low enrollment, the fact that he was “banned” from the Three Village Central School District for allegedly calling the principal an idiot, and walking through an unauthorized door at the school in their response last month. Gerber denies these claims.
In support of his position, Gerber states that he has a letter from the superintendent of Three Village School District. “It was determined that you were not banned from the building,” said Cheryl Pedisich, the superintendent of Three Village School District schools, in the Oct. 6, 2014 letter to Gerber.
“When they get a complaint, [the administration doesn’t] even investigate it. They fired me without ever really investigating it or asking me. That’s very far from democracy. They just wanted some reason to get rid of me,” Gerber added.
Persky, like Gerber, feels as though he was unfairly terminated from his job at Post because of his age. “I was never given a reason [for being let go]. We found out by the secretary,” Persky said. “My experience teaching at LIU Post was very pleasurable. It was one of the best jobs that I’ve had,” he continued. “I was never questioned, I was promoted while I was at [LIU Post], and I was up for senior full professorship level for adjunct professors at the time I was let go. I didn’t realize that it was age discrimination until I found out who else they had let go.” Persky decided not to file any grievances with the local union, but said that he is in support of Gerber if he goes through the motions of filing a lawsuit.
Robert Bennett, 66, an associate professor of Criminal Justice in the College of Liberal Arts, has a similar claim to Gerber and Persky. “I managed a budget for 20 of my 30-year career [before teaching at LIU Post],” said Bennett “It isn’t rocket science. There have been times where I had to wait to promote someone or budgets were cut. But these two men weren’t even told. They showed up one day and asked what class they were assigned to. They were told ‘we have nothing for you.’” Gerber, Persky, as well as himself, were treated as if they were disposable and without respect, according to Bennett.
Bennett taught 15 different course offerings on the graduate and undergraduate level during his 17 years at LIU. “I really loved the students,” said Bennett of the experience. He also mentioned he was three years from retiring when he was let go from his position, after he applied for a raise. Bennett filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that he was also discriminated due to his age, and is awaiting the outcome of the complaint.
The university has denied that age discrimination played a factor in any of these employment decisions. “LIU is committed to extending equal opportunity in employment to all qualified candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of our academic community,” according to Haynes. “The university prides itself on the many forms
of diversity embraced and respected by our students, staff, faculty, and community; including multiple perspectives on age, culture, ethnicity, geographic origin, and professional experience. LIU has a long history and ample evidence of treating all of its community members fairly. As it is against University policy to discuss personnel issues, we cannot comment on this specific case. Our [number one] priority is cultivating a productive, equal, and fair workplace environment that draws upon the talents and expertise of our dedicated faculty and staff.”
Students have expressed mixed feelings about hearing that the university is being accused of discriminating against professors because of their age. “I suppose [LIU Post] would only fire people for the greater good,” said Danielle Sposato, a junior English major. “However, I think that it should be up to the professor to decide as to whether or not they can continue teaching in their career, unless several students come forward to explain that they themselves feel the professor is inadequate.”
The Pioneer has reviewed copies of documents pertaining to Gerber’s complaint.

Thirty-five classrooms will be reconfigured as “smart classrooms” on campus, according to George Baroudi, LIU’s Chief Information Officer. Currently, The J.M. Ladge Speech and Hearing Center contains a “Learning Center,” a classroom that contains a projector that enables an enhanced learning experience, in room 125, which was installed last semester.
“[The school is] engaged in an initiative to keep LIU Post at the forefront of instructional technology by installing ‘smart projectors.’ These projectors interpret hand gestures through an advanced sensor near the lens that allows a user to manipulate images on the screen; in essence turning the projected area into a smart board display,” Baroudi said. “Additional enhancements include new furniture, as well as wireless access points for each classroom.”
This new technology differs from a smart board in that a smart board is an interactive white board, one that has become a staple in modern classrooms. A smart classroom will host numerous instructional technologies and online components.
“At LIU, we are introducing our own version of smart classrooms called ‘Learning Spaces’, which are designed to maximize the classroom experience by enhancing content delivery and fostering collaborative experiences,” Baroudi added. “Our Learning Spaces will consist of touch-enabled Epson Ultra projectors that connect via wired or wireless connections to any mobile or desktop device.” The new system includes a “smart source selector” with audio capabilities for the entire room. Powering all of this is a world-class datacenter that is monitored by LIU’s IT team.
This initiative was brought to life after student and faculty feedback indicated that a revitalization of Post’s classrooms was well overdue. “The classrooms feel dated,” said Kaitlin Veygel, a junior Broadcasting major. “I feel like [the smart classrooms] take teaching to a new level.”
“We are focusing on the most requested and most needed areas, so the priority is for the most heavily used classrooms. However, the goal is to upgrade every classroom over the next few years,” Baroudi said.
Kim Mullins, an Assistant Professor and Instructional Design Librarian, feels the new classroom gadgets will be helpful if used correctly. “I embrace the use of educational technology, and am excited to have the ability to incorporate it in my teaching.
As a librarian who teaches research skills, a smart classroom allows me to model effective database searching and information access while students closely follow along on their computers,” Mullins said. “The use of an interactive white board enhances student learning because I can zoom and highlight important information, and annotate the screen with class notes and comments.”
The Learning Spaces are planned for Humanities, Pell Hall, Lorber Hall, the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, and several other locations, according to Baroudi. Staff and faculty are expected to participate in training sessions before the smart classrooms are expected to be fully operational. The project is expected to be finished in three academic years.

Professor Veronika Dolar of the Economics department is currently accepting applications for a two-week summer course titled, “The Transition Economies of Central Europe,” and, “The Former Soviet Union,” which will take place in Slovenia from July 1 through the 15.
Dolar, who is of Slovenian descent, said that she wants her students to grasp the concept of economic transition in a setting unknown to them. Studying abroad gives students the opportunity to get an education far beyond the classroom, according to Dolar. The cost of the trip is estimated to be $5,530, which includes tuition ($1,010 per credit), round trip airfare, and travel expenses.
Registration for the course, which has begun, will end on March 1. Students who participate in this course will see first hand how different government systems shape a country. “The course is about countries in transition, so when going to Slovenia, we’re going to focus on the changes that have occurred over the years,” Dolar said. “Its transition from a totalitarian regime to a free market economy is something that didn’t happen overnight, and something that is still being worked on [to] this day, which will be interesting to witness, especially doing in a very new and beautiful setting.”
For most of the trip, students will be staying in Velenje, Dolar’s hometown, which she said had a booming economy during the time that Slovenia belonged to Yugoslavia. During their stay, students will cover that topic, along with how the fall of Yugoslavia affected their booming economy. “We had a huge coal mining station, which was so important during the country’s development, but extremely bad for the environment. When we switched to the free market economy, we started to pay a lot more attention to the environment, so students will also see what kind of improvements have been done,” she said.
Students will witness the rebuilding of a power station right in Velenje, which, according to Dolar, is the biggest in the world and carries the most modern technology.
The description of the course (ECO 44), states that Economics prerequisites are not required, but Dolar recommends taking Microeconomics (ECO 10), or Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECO 11), if interested in the subject. “The course is really open to anyone. You don’t need a vast knowledge of economics because while being there, we will cover the many aspects of economics,” Dolar added. She wants students to participate in this program despite their majors or backgrounds, and believes the course will appeal to History, Political Science, Business Administration, International Relations, or Environmental Studies majors, since those are some of the other subjects that will also be covered in Slovenia.
As someone who was once an international student herself, Dolar said that she believes the course will be beneficial specifically for American students. “One of the reasons the university invests in international courses is to provide students the opportunity to gain a knowledge beyond their own culture. Slovenia in particular is a great country to experience this opportunity because it offers a mixture of backgrounds, and it’s also a safe country. When you go abroad, you analyze the improvements your own country can make, or the good things that your country offers that aren’t available elsewhere. Simply by going to another country, students will witness how they can evolve,” Dolar said.
There are many benefits for students who study abroad, according to Patricia Seaman, Director of Study Abroad at LIU Post. “It would be a long list to name them all,” she said. “But the general consensus is study abroad positively and unequivocally influences the career path, worldview, and self-confidence of students.”
Ileana Lado, a junior Psychology major, just returned from a semester abroad in London, which she says helped her become much more confident. “Studying abroad enabled me to learn so much more of myself that I wouldn’t have figured out if I didn’t participate in this program at this point of my life,” Lado said. “I believe that for any student, studying abroad [helps] to strengthen their values, beliefs, and embrace new concepts.”
If you have concerns about the long duration of a study abroad program for an entire semester, Lado supports joining a summer course as a good alternative, but with some caution. “Before doing my semester abroad, I contemplated on doing a summer course instead, but I discovered that financial aid [would] not cover my expenses if I did so, which I advise other student who want to sign up to keep in mind,” Lado said. However, because every student has a different case, it is important to contact Seaman to find out if you are eligible for financial assistance abroad.
A student who signs up for a full semester of Study Abroad will take 12-15 credits and will spend 15 weeks away from home in a different institution with different faculty. Students who register for the Slovenia course will gain three credits in just two weeks.
“In the case of the Slovenia course, it is one of the faculty-led Study Abroad courses. These courses are developed and led by LIU faculty,” Seaman said. “Because it’s faculty-led, I can guide students on learning or experiencing certain things that they probably won’t be able to do on their own,” Dolar added. “Although it only last 14 days, it’s a very intense course because you experience so many things in such a short time. This program is special because in a regular eco course, you can’t cover the things that students can witness and experience first hand as they are learning it.”
The course will also include a day trip to Venice in a ferry from Piran, Slovenia.
The program is limited to 25 students, and is offered on a first- come, first-served basis. Some assignments will be handed out before the course begins, which Dolar recommends getting done before departing, that way it will not pile up, and students will get the opportunity to enjoy their time abroad. There will also be a project assigned that students will have a month to complete after returning.
For more information on the course, students can visit its site at http://liuslovenia.weebly.com/, or contact Veronika Dolar directly in the Economics department of Hoxie Hall. Students can also attend any of the Study Abroad Office information sessions, or reach Patricia Seaman in the Winnick House at 516-299-2508.

A new student-run magazine called WAVES will debut in Fall 2015. The magazine, which is being launched by Phillip Aievoli, a freshman English major, is already accepting student submissions. Aievoli, in conjunction with Dr. John Lutz, chairperson of the English Department, as the club’s faculty advisor, decided to reintroduce a student-run literary magazine on campus after the previous magazine, Loomings, lost popularity and disappeared from the campus’s creative world in 2012.
The magazine will be for students and by students, but faculty, graduate students, and alumni may contribute. WAVES will join The Bottom Line, the monthly LIU Post student magazine, as a second student magazine on campus. The Bottom Line focuses on bringing stories about world news and current issues of interest to students, while WAVES will focus on exhibiting the creative talents of students.
“Loomings was originally a student literary magazine with a faculty advisor in the English Department. It became an art and literary magazine and then migrated to Student Life, where it was overseen by various people in Student Life roles,” Lutz said. “It never really ended, but has had an intermittent life. As students graduate, it hasn’t always had continuity in student leadership. Particularly after it left the English Department, it hasn’t had a continuous existence because there hasn’t been anyone to recruit new populations of students to work on it.”
Much like Loomings, WAVES will be student-run, and will focus on campus art. This means that all writers, artists, and creative minds on campus will have another place to submit their creations, such as poetry, poems, nonfiction, fiction, narrative essays, comics, and anything else of that nature.
WAVES will also utilize an online journal, as well as social media, to keep students engaged, all of which will be launched on the first day of the Fall 2015 semester. The website will feature pieces as collected, allowing for a steady stream of new content that will constantly be accessible.
“Anything you do that you want people to see, submit it. The only thing I don’t want [are things that are overdone]. It has to be creative and something from you, not replications of other artists,” Aiveoli said.
The magazine will function as a club with a faculty advisor, and funding has still yet to be determined. “I’m not trying to make money,” Aievoli said. “I’m trying to show off the campus talent that hides because they don’t play sports or participate in Greek Life or other clubs.” The actual cost of the magazine has not yet been decided, but it will most likely be sold for five to ten dollars as a way to fund printing and other costs. The Bottom Line, in contrast, is provided free for students.
In addition to the website, the decision to work with the English department will help the magazine to gain more material, and maintain the magazine as students graduate and move on. “The English department will communicate with students in English classes and encourage them to become involved and submit poetry, short fiction, and art. A return to the faculty advising model will provide continuity from one year to the next and ensure that the magazine publishes issues regularly,” Lutz said.
With a steady stream of students in the English department increasingly taking creative writing courses that are offered, the hope is that students will continue the magazine while providing new content.
Because the magazine is in the early stages of development, it is unsure yet how many issues will be published per semester, particularly due to the strong focus on online journal access. Students are already excited about the prospect of a literary magazine coming to campus.
“I think a literary magazine is exactly what Post needs. It’s a great idea because students will be able to express themselves while also showing their talents,” said Ivette Mendoza, a freshman Criminal Justice major.
“I’m hoping to see student writing and art. We have many new creative writing courses in English, which could provide the source of many submissions. I’d also like to encourage students in any discipline to submit work or become involved with the magazine,” Lutz said.
Students can begin submitting essays now, with the early submission deadline set for April 27, and the final submission date set for Aug. 11. For more information, students can contact either Phillip Aievoli at waves@gmail.com or Dr. Lutz at john.lutz@liu.edu, or just stop by the English office, room 210 of Winnick House.

Isn’t it fun to purchase items on a credit card? Well, shopping on a credit card is a lot of fun, until you get the bill. As a college student, one must be aware of the consequences of debt. Credit is an arrangement to receive cash, goods, or services today, and pay for them in the future. But not being able to pay back even one payment can affect your credit score.
“Debt is a trap, especially student debt, which is enormous, far larger than credit card debt. It’s a trap for the rest of your life because the laws are designed so that you can’t get out of it,” said Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political commentator, on how to avoid the economic pitfall.
We don’t realize that every time we purchase on credit, we discount our future income. This is because credit is like using tomorrow’s money today.
“Banks have this strange and irresponsible option you can fill out when getting your student debit card,” said Johan Rundquist, a senior Economics major. “It basically says that the bank will let you exceed your exsisting funds on your debit card. But what is not mention at all during this process is what happens after you’ve exceeded your limits.”
There are two types of debt: good debt and bad debt. Good debt can be loans for college education, or a mortgage to finance your home. It is an investment for the future. Whereas bad debt can be buying a brand new car, buying a $400 bag, or charging that expensive dinner at a fancy restaurant to your plastic. These are expenses you can’t usually afford.
Bad debt ties you into a situation where you must pay back the money you owe. For example, if you borrow $100 with an annual interest of 18 percent and decide to pay a minimum payment of $5 each month, it would take you 24 months to pay back just that $100, money that you might have spent getting a new haircut! Or, if you decided to pay a minimum of $10 each month, it would still take you 11 months to get your balance back to zero.
It might not seem that bad, but did you know that having credit affects your credit score? A credit score is a scoring method ranging from 300-900 that forms the basic foundation of your credit report. Lenders look at these to determine the likelihood that the loan will be repaid to that person. It also predicts how one will repay a loan and if they’ll make those payments on time.
Your credit report identifies personal information such as name, social security number, spouse, and employer. Credit history and public history are also mentioned in credit reports, and include detailed balance and payment information of credit accounts, bankruptcies, judgments, and tax liens. The information also includes a list of people who have received a copy of your credit report. This report is available for everyone, including creditors, landlords, employers, and the government.
Buying items on credit has become a trend, but not many people foresee the consequences. It’s like buying things for which you don’t have cash. As demonstrated in the example about borrowing $100, even a small loan can take a good amount of time to be paid back.
One should be able to differentiate between what debt is good and what is not. Stay away from spending when you cannot afford the expense, because it is costly to escape the debt trap.

While most students were taking a break from their schoolwork, the LIU Post Dance team took a trip to Nationals, which is the highest form of dance competition for Division II programs.
The Championships only features the top dance programs from across the country. In fact, only 27 schools earn the right to compete.
Perhaps the most grueling part of a rebuild is the time it takes to return to relevancy. Hours turn to weeks, weeks turn to months, and in the case of Post’s dance program, months turned to years. What made this trip so special? It was a journey the team hadn’t taken in almost five years. However, this January the final stage of the rebuild had been complete.
Five years ago, coaches Chris Klein and Angela Stanilewicz were brought to Post with a clear cut prerogative: revive and restore the dance program, and ultimately achieve the talent level to compete for a National Championship.
Klein and Stanilewicz are no strangers to success. Prior to taking their jobs at Post, they were members of the St. John’s University dance program. During that time, the St. John’s team had made themselves known as perennial attendees at the Division I Dance Nationals. To replicate that success within the Pioneers, Klein and Stanilewicz immediately changed the culture of the dance team, claiming the message of the group would be “all about growth and commitment.”
“Every year, we have a main goal to achieve and we have put together a great track record so far,” Klein said. The goal set for last year’s team was to place within the top three at the Regional Championships in Massachusetts. Having proven themselves at regionals, the desire to compete on the national stage had quickly set in. Thus, with fire in their bellies, the team gathered last summer to set their sights on qualifying for this year’s competition.
In order to qualify for Nationals, a dance team must receive a “superior trophy” at the LIU Post summer dance camp. This is no easy feat. However, Klein made qualifying for Nationals the team goal for the summer camp group, and, given the team’s track record, one could only assume the team would do just that.
When asked if they received a trophy that summer, Klein simply replied, “We did,” but this was only the beginning of the grueling journey to Nationals. The team met religiously three times a week, and performed at seasonal men’s and women’s sporting events for Pioneer home games, just to gain more repetitions.
With all this time together, unbreakable bonds and chemistry were formed on the team. Klein recalls specifically a two-week period in which the team practiced every day in a private studio located off campus in Syosset.
“This really helped bring our team closer together, and allowed us to become more dedicated,” Klein said.
After countless hours of practice, the team had their routine down pat. Galvanized together, the Pioneers advanced to the semifinals, and finished 16th out of the 27 teams that made qualified for Nationals — just a mere two places short from advancing to the finals!
However, their valiant effort would not go unrecognized; the team rewarded itself with a trip to Walt Disney World, which ended a five-year national drought.
“Now we have a better idea of what to expect next year,” said Brooke Eversman, a sophomore Psychology major. “And we can prepare much better.”

Tyler Stettler is a sophomore Music Theatre major from Sunbury, Pennsylvania. He always loved performing, including doing magic tricks, singing, and dancing, and knew he wanted to pursue it in his future. Tyler says LIU Post is the best choice for him because it gives him the most opportunities to pursue his dreams. Aside from performing, Tyler has been working to accomplish the “Walking Pull-ups,” after discovering them on social media. The Walking Pull-ups require all upper body and core strength, and look as if the person is walking through air.
What advice do you have for others who wish to accomplish the Walking Pull-Ups?
Any kind of advice I can give is practice and dedication. Without dedication, I don’t think anything is possible.
How long did it take you to learn the Walking Pull-up and what did you do to learn it?
I have been working out a lot more diligently for the next production I am in at school, Metamorphoses, and it was just another exercise to add to my workout. I would just practice over and over again until I could get it. The same way I learned my other hobbies: ukulele and magic.
When did you start learning magic tricks and the ukulele?
I have always been very interested in magic and it has been a while since I tried to pick up some tricks again, but I’ve gotten back into it. As for the ukulele, I started playing at the beginning of my freshman year of college. I always loved the way a ukulele sounds and was always curious about playing one. I perform with it in school productions, such as Big Love.
What type of magic tricks do you perform?
I very much enjoy sleight-of-hand tricks, things that deal with coins, cards, or something random around the house.
Who inspired you to learn magic?
As a child, my grandma introduced me to Harry Houdini and he always amazed me with how perfect his tricks would be executed and how thought-provoking they were.
What is your favorite trick to do?
I have yet to use magic in a show. However, in my last production at school I was able to play the ukulele. It was really fun to be able to combine one of my fun hobbies with, I guess you could say, my serious hobby: performing in productions and shows.
If you woke up tomorrow and couldn’t use your hands anymore, what would you do?

If I couldn’t use my hands, I would still act. Some of the best performances in acting were characters that had no control over their bodies. Take “The Theory of Everything,” a movie released in 2014, for example. In the movie, Cambridge University student Stephen Hawking falls in love with fellow student Jane Wilde, despite his motor neuron disease. Actor Eddie Redmayne’s portrayal of Stephen Hawking is magnificent, especially since, for half the movie, Eddie couldn’t talk or move.
What are your plans for the future?
I plan to graduate from LIU Post and continue my career as an actor, wherever that may take me. As long as I’m doing what I love to do, I’m really open for whatever the future may hold for me.
