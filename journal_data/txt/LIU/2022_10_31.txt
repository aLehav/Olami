Many storylines were going into the MLB playoffs this year. The Dodgers were going into the playoffs with an incredible 111-win regular season. The Mets and Yankees returned as the NY baseball powerhouses. The Seattle Mariners broke the 21-year streak of no playoff appearances, and it was the last ride for the St. Louis Cardinals’ big three in Albert Pujols, Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina.
For the Wild Card Round, The Mets came into the last week of the season as world series threats and locks for the NL East title, but that all changed in their final three-game series against Atlanta. The Mets had their best three pitchers for that series and could control their division title destiny and avoid the wildcard round as a two-seed in the National League (NL). However, this was not the case, and they had to host a three-game win-or-go-home series against a struggling San Diego Padres team. The Padres were hit hard this season with their star Fernando Tatis Jr being suspended for performance-enhancing drugs (PED’s). So going into the playoffs, all the Padres had was Manny Machado and newly acquired Juan Soto as major bats and a deep starting rotation and bullpen. This Wildcard series was the first of many upsets, with the Padres winning in Queens due to a pivotal game three performance by Padres’ starting pitcher Joe Musgrove. He put up 5 K’s and only one hit in his seven innings of work, which set up the 6-0 shutout victory. 
The Padres had a bunch of people step up in this series, with Trent Grisham hitting homers in back-to-back games and Josh Bell adding a bunch of clutch hits.
The Mariners finally broke the 21-year playoff drought and were faced to play the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays hitting was evident throughout the series, with multiple home runs from Teoscar Hernandez in game two, but the underdog Mariners wouldn’t go down for the count, winning the first game in a 4-0 shutout, then sealing the deal with 10-9 victory in game two. The Mariners were down as much as six runs, but still prevailed. Seattle was guaranteed a home playoff game for the first time in over two decades.
The Philadelphia Phillies closed the book on the last ride for the St Louis Cardinals’ legends in a 2-1 series victory. The red birds took game one in demanding fashion with a 6-1 win on the backs of Mike Mikolas’ five strikeouts and Corey Dickerson’s three RBI’s. However, the power bats of the Phillies overwhelmed St.Louis in the next two games.
The youthful Cleveland Guardians swept the Tampa Bay Rays thanks to pitching performances by Shane Bieber and Triston Mckenzie. Beiber and Mckenzie both fanned eight batters in their starts. Game two was an outright pitching duel going 15 innings with a combined total of 39 strikeouts, the most ever in a postseason game, capitalized by a 15th-inning walk-off by Oscar Gonzales. The Guardians were able to complete the sweep and head to the division series.
The Division Series was filled with upsets and close games. The best team in the league, the 111-win L.A. Dodgers were upset by in-state foe San Diego Padres in four games due to big performances like Yu Darvish’s seven strikeout outing in game two, homerun from Trent Grisham in game three and an eight strikeouts performance from Joe Musgrove in game four. 
The Yankees prevailed in a five-game series win over the Cleveland Guardians. The Bronx Bombers were down 2-1 in this series and had fans on the edge of their seats as they had to win two straight to stay alive in the playoffs. Harrison Bader was up for the challenge by hitting three home runs in the series and Gerrit Cole’s eight strikeouts in game four. 
The Atlanta Braves were out-slugged by the Phillies in four games. Philadelphia bats were on fire, hitting nearly double (24) the amount of RBI’s that Atlanta hit (13). 
Sophomore undeclared major–and longtime Braves fan–Eric O’Neil was stunned by the Phillies’ upset.
“There was no answer for the Phillies’ offense. Every ball hit off the bat was either a home run or a base hit,” he said.
Bryce Harper showed up big time for Philadelphia with two homers and five RBI’s in the series.
The Houston Astros swept the Seattle Mariners. The Astros re-established their dominance over their AL West rival. The Astros came back down three runs with a walk-off homer by Yordan Alvarez in game one, setting the tone for the rest of the series.
The stage was set for the Yankees vs. Astros in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), but the outcome was disappointing for Yankees’ fans. Instead of a back-and-forth series, with a win-or-go-home game seven like in 2017, The Yankees were on the receiving end of a disappointing four-game sweep.
Freshman sports management major Daniel Frankenberry was upset with the lack of competitiveness displayed by the Yankees.
 “We couldn’t hit with runners in scoring position. Our bullpen was hurt at the worst time possible, and Gerrit Cole gave up five runs. We got owned,” he said.
The Yankees were silenced by the Astros’ pitching by striking out 50 times throughout the series. Jeremy Pena won the ALCS MVP, which was well deserved due to his two home runs and four RBI performance during the series.
The long ball was prevalent in this seven-game National League Championship Series (NLCS) between the San Diego Padres and Philadelphia Phillies. These two wildcard teams had to take down the best of the best to get to this point, and the way they did that was by hitting a lot of home runs, with 16 home runs combined. The Phillies were able to get past San Diego in five games due to Bryce Harper’s two home runs and five RBI’s, Rhys Hoskins’ four home runs and seven RBI’s. Bryce Harper won the NLCS MVP for his efforts.
The Phillies and Astros will compete for the World Series title in a best-of-seven series starting on Friday, Oct. 28.

Former Heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder made short work of Robert Helenius on Saturday, Oct. 15, knocking him out at the end of the first round at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.
This was Wilder’s first win since Nov. 23, 2019, when he knocked out (KO) Luis Ortiz in the seventh round in their fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
In his last two fights, the 36-year-old former WBC title-holder was KO’d by Tyson Fury, who defeated him in the second and third fights of their high-profile trilogy after they fought to a draw in December 2018.
On Saturday, Helenius backed Wilder into a corner in the final 15 seconds of the opening round. However, Wilder floored the 38-year-old Finnish Heavyweight with a powerful right hand, and Helenius was counted out at 2:57 of the first round.
With the victory, Wilder improved to 43-2-1 with 42 knockouts. 
Helenius falls to 31-4. He had a nearly 40-pound weight advantage on Wilder, but could not match the former champion’s power.
“When he knocked him out within a few seconds into the first round my jaw dropped completely,” senior film & cinematography major Derrick Idafe said. “It just sucks because I was waiting all night for at least a good fight to happen. But it was a good win for Wilder to get a win with him losing to Fury back to back.”
Deontay Wilder was emotional and cried at the post-fight presser after his KO of Robert Helenius, as he discussed the dangers of boxing, and Prichard Colón, who suffered a life-altering brain injury when fighting.
“We’ve seen what can happen, look at Prichard Colon,” Wilder said. “Y’all don’t understand what we go through man. I’ve always been an advocate for us. This man won’t know what it’ll be like to be somebody’s father, that’s one of the most beautiful things in the world.”
Freshman sports management major Dimere Smith shares Wilder’s enthusiasm about his return, and is excited to see the former champion back in action. 
“I’m glad he’s back again,” Smith said, “The old Wilder was an animal and was possibly the face of boxing. He needs to get back in that mentality again and earn his title back. I can say for everyone we all want that again.”
It’s not known who Wilder will fight next. Among the possibilities are Ukrainian champion Oleksandr Usyk, who holds the IBF, WBO and IBO belts, or former title-holders Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr.
“I’m down for whatever. Whether it’s Andy Ruiz, or Usyk, or whoever. Let’s bring it on,” Wilder said. “Deontay Wilder is back. The excitement in the heavyweight division is back. There’s no heavyweight division without Deontay Wilder. That’s a fact.”

The NBA season kicked off on Oct. 18, 2022. Last year’s championship winner, the Golden State Warriors, defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 123-109 on opening night. Could this win be a preview for another prosperous season for the Warriors, or a season with new developments?
Students on campus shared their predictions for the season for teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences. Students see different team and player developments as factors that could affect the outcome of the season. 
Freshman film major Sebastian Ochoa sees different dynamics playing out throughout the season. Ochoa sees a lot of positive developments for teams in the NBA Western Conference.
“A healthy Nuggets team is scary for the west, like that’s a crazy difference. A healthy Clippers team too, the Nuggets and Clippers are both super underdogs, but fully healthy. Another healthy good development is going to be the Timberwolves with Rudy Gobert. They’re going to be really good,” he said.
Junior Adelphi University history major Michael Serrao sees issues with the Los Angeles Lakers.
“I think everyone should be paying attention to the Lakers. They are an absolute circus of a basketball team. LeBron came to town and decimated their young core in exchange for a championship which came in the NBA bubble during covid. That championship will forever have an asterisk next to it,” Serrao said. “They have not even come close to another championship since. The Lakers have no picks, a thin roster, a brittle Anthony Davis, an aging LeBron James, and Westbrook’s albatross of a contract. Terrible situation in my opinion.”
Ochoa also expects the Philadelphia 76ers to have success this season, with the performance by James Harding so far this year.
“If James Harding keeps playing the way he started the season off, Philly’s gonna go deep as well,” he said.
New York has two NBA teams, the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Knicks. So far this season, the Knicks have had three wins and one loss, and the Nets have had one win and two losses.
Ochoa sees the Knicks’ addition of Jalen Brunson as a positive for the team, as well as other players being beneficial this season.
“Brunson was a good pickup, and Julius Randle played good as well, so if he comes back to how he was playing in his most improved season, then they definitely have potential. If RJ Barrett takes the next step then they definitely have potential, but the East is going to be tough this year,” Ochoa said.
Students also see the Nets as a team that has potential, but also some shortcomings in their lineup.
“The Nets have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, arguably two of the best players of all time, but they really have nothing else besides them and Ben Simmons, so it’s really just up to them three, and Ben Simmons has been lackluster. It’s a big revenge season for him as well, but besides those three, they really have nothing to work with,” Ochoa said.
Serrao also shared his predictions for the New York teams.
“I think the Knicks and the Nets are going to have successful seasons. The Nets will go far just because they have Durant and Irving, but they are not a well constructed team and their organization is lacking what it takes to truly be a winning franchise,” he said. “I think the Knicks have themselves a young, fun, and deep roster. They don’t have the star power that Brooklyn has. But, they have guys from 1 to 5 and a second unit that can put up points in a hurry. In the end, Brooklyn will end up making it farther, but I think both Knicks and Nets fans are in for a fun season.”
The Golden State Warriors walked away victoriously last season, but students see potential changes in the team’s lineup as a threat for them moving forward. After a physical altercation in which Draymond Green punched his teammate Jordan Poole made headlines, some feel that Green might make a departure from the team.
“I think they are handling the situation well with Draymond Green and Jordan Poole, but eventually it’s going to get to a point where I think Draymond is gonna leave the team,” Ochoa said.
Ochoa also said that he thinks this potential loss could negatively affect the team’s performance this season.
“Obviously it’s a better decision for them to keep their younger core, and to just keep the same team and build around the younger core for the future, but Draymond is just such an important piece that I don’t think they’re ever going to win a championship again without him,” he added.
Serrao sees the team doing well this season, but agrees that the Green-Poole altercation could negatively affect the team.
“The Warriors are totally going to do good again this season. I honestly would not be surprised if they managed to go back to back and win the championship again. That team is a well oiled machine. Steph is unstoppable and when Steve Kerr gets the rest of the team to play Warriors basketball, they are going to be hard to stop,” Serrao said. “The only thing that can hold the Warriors back this year are injuries or issues over guys getting the contracts they want, or if Draymond Green does something stupid.”

Halloween is quickly approaching, and many students are letting their creative sides show and constructing their own costumes. A little cardboard and paint can go a long way, and DIY costumes also prove to be a cost effective option.
Junior digital art and design major Kelly Bruce is one of many students making her own costume this year. She plans to dress as the famous Monday-hating orange cat: Garfield.
Bruce views Halloween as a way to bond with friends through fun costumes. 
“I usually do costumes that match my friends or significant others. This year, I decided to dress as Garfield to recreate a funny picture my friend and I saw with Garfield and Shadow The Hedgehog,” Bruce said.  
Additionally, Bruce’s boyfriend will be dressing as Jon Arbuckle and his dog will be Odie. 
Bruce is making her costume herself as a chance to save some money and also show off her artistic side. 
“Truthfully, I’m too broke to buy a proper Garfield costume,” Bruce said. “When I was little, my mom would make our costumes to save money, so it felt right to go the cheaper way. I also knew it would be a fun and fulfilling activity.” 
Bruce purchased her clothes from savers and used fabric paint to design it.
“I got an orange hoodie, an orange shirt, and orange leggings. I’m painting on his black stripes and I plan to make ears to sew onto the hood of the hoodie and a tail to match,” Bruce said.
Costume or not, Bruce wants others to focus on the fun of Halloween however they see fit. 
Junior digital art and design major, Jenna Fisk, acknowledges how difficult dressing for Halloween can be.
“It can be kinda hard to have something ready in time, especially if you’re making your own costume,” Fisk said.  
Fisk used to dress up with friends but with her busy schedule, her Halloween celebrations fell to the wayside. 
This year will be different. Fisk is taking time to construct her own costume of the Fortnite character Meowskull. 
Fisk noted that she always loves doing hands-on crafts rather than buying a pre-made costume. 
“I haven’t really committed to a project like that in a while. This is definitely more effort than I’ve probably put into any costume that I’ve done before,” Fisk said. 
One of her favorite parts of the costume are the little sardine cans she made entirely out of cardboard tape and paint.
Senior art education major Roselie Bongiovi is another student using Halloween to showcase her artistic abilities.
“Halloween is the time of year where I can just go crazy with face paint,” Bongiovi said.
Bongiovi rocks a skeleton look every year, and it has become somewhat of a Halloween tradition for her. She loves to paint skulls on her face. Every year, she does a new skull-based look showcasing her progress with makeup. Her Halloween face paint takes her 2-3 hours depending on the coverage and specific look.
Bongiovi did her first skull look in high school. Her low-quality face paint combined with her limited experience left Bongiovi unsatisfied with the finished look. 
“It made me go, ‘hey, I’m gonna do this again better next year.’ Then that turned into ‘hey, what if I can paint more on my face?’” Bongiovi said. 
 For other students wanting to try a face paint look this Halloween, Bongiovi recommends investing in the proper products. 
“Water based face paint is the way to go, don’t get the grease paint at costume shops. That’s where I went wrong my first year,” Bongiovi remarked.

It is rare that an artist on the mainstage is able to reinvent themselves and continue to promote new album releases as though it is their debut album. However, this is the case with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift’s tenth studio album titled Midnights, released on Oct. 21. 
Swift described Midnights as “the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.” 
Through these 13 tracks, Swift takes the listener on an emotional journey discussing topics such as anxiety, insecurities, falling in love, and plotting revenge. The track “Anti-Hero” dives into Swift’s thoughts about feeling like she is constantly the problem in her life. While tracks such as the standout collaboration with artist Lana Del Rey titled “Snow on the Beach,” discusses the concept of falling in love with someone in a magical yet mysterious way. 
Fans of Swift on campus shared their thoughts on the album.
“Midnights blew away my expectations in every way possible,” Junior business administration major Rebecca Margolin said.
Swift did not stop with just the 13 tracks she released at midnight. At 3 a.m. on October 21st, Swift took to her social media to announce that she is surprising her fans with 7 additional tracks that were now out at the time of her post. 
On her Instagram she wrote “Lately I’ve been loving the feeling of sharing more of our creative process with you, like we do with “From The Vault” tracks. So it’s 3am and I’m giving them to you now.” 
The album itself has been received with both critical acclaim, with Metacritic currently sitting at a rating of 87 out of 100, and praise from fans. Swift has already broken multiple records with this album including most vinyl sales of 2022 and is currently pushing for a 1 million sales debut at the end of the first week of tracking. However, most notably the album broke the record for most Spotify streams for an album in a single day at an overwhelming 184.695 million streams according to the platform. 
Listeners of the album highlighted Swift’s work ethic as the key to her success.
“I am not the biggest Taylor Swift fan, however, she constantly gives her fans what they want and that is why she is currently on top. So far, I have enjoyed Midnights. Her work ethic is unmatched and I have to respect her,” junior fashion merchandising major Grace Catanese said. 
The lead single titled “Anti-Hero” describes Swift’s journey through self-pity and insecurity. This is prevalent in the music video that she released in tandem with the album.
In the chorus of the song, she sings “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem it’s me.” These lines ring true to the public view of Swift. She has consistently been scrutinized by the media for ruining her reputation and even being branded as a “serial dater.” 
She feels the impact of these words the media has said and it is obvious that they have impacted her life throughout her career. She changed her image from country girl to pop star with her 2014 album 1989, and even disappeared from the public eye for a year before releasing her 2017 album reputation. 
It is now that she is finally getting on the other side of these intense emotions and pain that she has felt, and has now turned them into art that the average listener could find a way to relate to. 
It is for this reason that Swift continues to raise the bar for all of her peers. She is able to grow with her audience, and has grown up with her fans, thus allowing them to have a deep connection, not only with her, but amongst themselves. Midnights is set to break even more records by the end of the week and is available to stream and purchase everywhere.

In today’s social media age, it has become commonplace for trends, filters, and even content creators to gain massive popularity quickly. Commonly referred to as “blowing up” on social media, this occurrence often comes as a result of a platform’s algorithm, which is in control of providing people with the content that best suits their interests. While gaining notoriety on social media has become a feat achieved by many, it isn’t often that a polarizing figure captures the attention of the masses; and then came Andrew Tate. 
Andrew Tate exploded onto the social media scene during the summer of 2022 after numerous videos gained popularity due to their divisive nature. The 35-year-old Luton native grew immensely on multiple platforms as a result, obtaining over 4 million Twitter followers, 4.7 million Instagram followers, and 768,000 YouTube subscribers at his peak. 
Although his social media presence was immense, it didn’t come without an abundance of criticism for the messages of misogyny and toxic masculinity that his videos entailed. Junior science major Vincent Randazzo is one of those critics.
“Andrew Tate’s a moron in unequivocal terms. The stuff he says is just the dumb toxic grind culture and the toxic masculinity of it all is just stupid,” he said. “You listen to him talk and you’re like ‘How does this guy have a platform?’ [and] then you remember that there are middle schoolers out there.”
While most are critical of the things Tate has said, some individuals like junior acting major Logan Bolhouse feel that Tate’s outlandish statements serve primarily to attract as many eyeballs as possible. 
“I feel the way that he talks about it and the language he uses is very flagrant language and it’s meant to incite emotion out of people in one way or another, which is why some of what he says becomes entertainment because that’s used to get people to watch his content and then he makes more money,” he explained. “It may not even necessarily be what he truly thinks, it is just what he thinks is the most inflammatory to say.”
While the influencer has received a lot of backlash for his views, Andrew Tate is no stranger to controversy. 
After retiring from professional kickboxing as a four-time champion in 2016, the British-American got his first taste of fame, gaining popularity after his appearance as a contestant on the 17th season of Big Brother UK. This appearance was short-lived, however, as he was removed from the show after offensive tweets and an explicit video showing him abusing a woman were publicized. 
Following the appearance on Big Brother UK, Tate remained docile for a few years, moving to Romania where he started his first successful business in webcam sites. These sites, which he admits are a “total scam,” required individuals to pay to have access to video chats with models. Tate ran these sites for a few years with his brother, Tristan, and self-reportedly made millions of dollars as a result. 
With the success of his webcam sites bringing him immense wealth, Tate expanded further, starting a subscription-based financial advice company, Hustler’s University. The service, which was founded in 2021, is $49.99 a month and promises a “money-focused” education on skills such as copywriting, freelancing, e-commerce, etc. 
Tate claims that the community has over 100,000 students, which he refers to as “Top G’s”. As a student of Hustler’s University, one of the obligations is to create a social media account using Tate’s likeness, spreading his videos and content further. It was through these accounts that Tate would spread his more controversial content, bringing in over a billion views across all platforms. 
Sophomore biology major Nakira James believes that Tate’s message is dangerous, especially to the youth.
“[Tate] has affected a younger generation of boys who have adopted a misogynistic view on women and sees them as sexual objects.”
Senior nursing major Greta Burke agrees with James, claiming that she completely disagrees with Tate’s views.
“I am a feminist and I think people who believe in those things are horrible people,” Burke said, adding if Tate had a daughter, she would ask him how he would feel if someone spoke about his daughter this way. 
Tate’s reign on social media came to an abrupt end in late August when he was effectively banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. This ban, which came as a result of his “violation of companies’ policies,” has drawn some concern, as those opposed argue that it was a violation of his first amendment rights to freedom of speech. 
Even those who oppose his message such as Sara [Last name], a [year] business major, believe it was wrong for him to be barred from social media. 
“Everyone is entitled to have their own opinions on their platforms,” she said.
While some are sympathetic to Tate being banned, as Vincent Randazzo explains, it is not a matter of freedom of speech, but a matter of following the social media guidelines. 
“Free speech protects you from the government, not from Instagram, not from Facebook, not from Twitter, not from Youtube, it protects you from the government,” Randazzo said. “The government can’t stop you from saying these things, but if you want to put this stuff on private companies’ platforms you have to abide by the rules. You click when you make your account and you will abide by the rules so the companies are completely within their rights to do this.”
With Tate essentially banned across all social media platforms, it is unlikely that his influence will go much further. However, although his time on top of the social media world was short-lived, Bolhouse believes Tate’s message has had a lasting impact. 
“Andrew Tate offers his opinion on what it is to be a man and how to be a good man, or in his terms a high-value man. So, I think a lot of young boys are searching for an answer to that, and they see that he is someone who has used this mindset to achieve a lot of things in his life so people are drawn to him and start following what he says in order to become that ideal of the ‘Top G’, or the ‘Alpha Male,” he said. “I think he’s affected a lot of young men. And then as far as women go, I think he’s had the opposite effect where he’s polarized the sexes to inherently be against each other almost. So, is that a good thing or a bad thing? That’s up for you to decide.”

Post’s fashion merchandising club has returned this fall semester with the goal of creating a space for students that love fashion to share their insight on upcoming trends, as well as run and attend fashion-related events. 
There are no requirements for joining the club, and the meetings are on Thursdays during common hour in the basement of the library.
“The fashion merchandising club is always welcoming new members,” senior fashion merchandising major and co-president of the club, Ashley Modaferri, said. “The goal of our club is to really put out that fashion is for everyone and not just for those who are in the fashion merchandising major. Overall, the club is all about bringing together people who love fashion in one space, to really share our love through the work we do.” 
The club has been on campus for almost a decade, and prides itself on promoting individuality and self-expression for students on campus.
“Our club and its meetings are all about sharing our passion for fashion with other students, our campus, and its community,” senior fashion merchandising major and co-president, Ashley Forestal, said. “We want the student body at LIU to see not only how but to actually have the opportunity to express their creativity through their fashion. Fashion is so much more than what clothes you are wearing. It’s a form of self expression.” 
Forestal also talked about the upcoming spring fashion show that the club runs. 
“We have huge plans for our Annual Fashion Show coming up this Spring 2023,” she said. “This is going to be a campus wide event that you do not want to miss. An amazing representation of clothing, an after party with raffles, shopping, refreshments and a DJ.” 
Forestal also noted that there is a sneak peak of the fashion show theme on the club Instagram. 
Junior fashion merchandising major Alyssa Dacosta recommends any student that is interested in participating in the fashion show to join the club now. 
“If you love fashion, marketing or production, I highly recommend joining our club. A lot of work goes into putting on our show, and it is always a good time and such a rewarding experience to put together a big annual fashion show like we do.” 
Follow the fashion merchandising club on Instagram @liufashionmerchandisingclub for more information about the fashion show and other club events.
