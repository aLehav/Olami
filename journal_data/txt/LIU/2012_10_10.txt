Conversations Helping and Teaching Stu¬dents, C.H.A.T.S., a program created in 2009, is in the process of becoming an official club at LIU Post. In C.H.A.T.S., an American student and an international student are paired as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English. 
The offices of International Student Services and Religious Life created C.H.A.T.S. in 2009 and act as co-sponsors for the organization. This semester, C.H.A.T.S. has begun the process of becoming an official club by creating an executive board and attending three Student Government Association meetings. The new executive board consists of five students: Alize Margulis, Rika Tatsukawa, Arti Jain, Terry Chang and Serena Oditt, who will attend the Student Government Association meetings to represent C.H.A.T.S. Father Ted, who is in charge of the Newman Catholic Club, and Jeanette Murray, who works at International Students Services, advise the students. Three coordinators oversee the organization Murray, as well as Trica Figuero and Dr. Leslie Bai. 
“Make another friend; you always need a friend,” said Figuero. C.H.A.T.S. was created to try to build up the connection between international and Americans students. It also serves to improve international students’ command of the English language, allow international students to learn more about American culture, and permit American students to learn about different cultures. This may lead to inviting their partner home for Thanksgiving, and even visiting their partner’s country, said Bai. “International students feel intimidated and lonely. If they find someone who knows American life, they can meet through C.H.A.T.S. first and then become friends later on their own,” said Bai. 
All the C.H.A.T.S. partners are the same gender and are partners for one year. The partners usually meet once a week for about an hour. When, where, what you do and for how long you meet are entirely up to you and your partner. There are also monthly group events for everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. One of the first events this semester was International Friendship Night, which was held on September 20 in the Chapel. The event consisted of games, dancing, food and international trivia. The next event is a presentation on exploring New York on October 11 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. There is an Inter¬national Education Week Dinner planned for November 12 at 7 in the Tilles Center and a farewell party on December 6 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. “The events are open to everyone. We are always encouraging and welcoming visitors and new members, if interested,” said Bai. 
There is an application form which helps with the pairing process. Students fill out their major, hobbies and if they have a preference of what type partner they would like, said Bai. She said last fall there were 50 pairs, last spring there were 39 pairs, and there are currently 27 pairs. However, students join throughout the semester. Students, faculty and staff are all members of C.H.A.T.S. The staff members who are involved in C.H.A.T.S. are Trica Figuero, Dr. Leslie Bai, Jeanette Murray and Nadia Hernandez, who all work at International Students Services. 
“The biggest headache now is there are always more international students then American students,” said Bai. Many international students are waiting for a partner. Bai said new international students are their first priority but returning international students are also waiting. There is a lack of male American students. Many American students are needed and males are needed the most right now, said Figuero. “We have included staff members, and some domestic students take two partners,” said Figuero, to try to solve the problem of not having enough American members. “We try to recruit students at (club) fairs, but it is always hard to get them to commit,” said Bai. 
Bai said many show interest in C.H.A.T.S. while they are recruiting but then they say they are too busy. “Some people are afraid of the commitment; time is an issue,” said Figuero. The coordinators say the group meeting and weekly partner meetings are not mandatory. The events are held so that everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. can get together and do some sort of activity. As long as you are spending individual time with your partner, you do not have to attend the events. C.H.A.T.S. is extremely flexible. “It’s not something to be fearful of or stress out about; just try it” said Figuero. They said they want more American students to learn from this experience. “You don’t have to do something extra; you can bring your partner to something you go to already,” said Bai. 
Being a member of C.H.A.T.S., and acquiring knowledge about another culture, will enhance your resume and work experience as well, said Figuero. Clubs can also pick up partners. Every club on campus has to do a certain amount of hours of community service and earn points for it. If you are on another club on campus and need to earn community service points, you can earn them by joining C.H.A.T.S. If there are a few partners per club, they will give you about half of the points needed. “Internationalization, we want more students to open up, even make our campus a little different,” said Figuero. 
Rika Tatsukawa, a senior Public Relations major from Japan, has been a member of C.H.A.T.S. since September 2011. Tatsukawa was partners with Arti Jain, a junior English Education major, last year. The partners are continuing to work together through C.H.A.T.S. this year as well. “At first, I didn’t expect her to be such a good friend and now I can’t image campus life without her,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she meets, texts and messages her partner often. “I meet Arti at her house a lot, her mother makes Indian food which I love,” said Tatsukawa. She said she went to her C.H.A.T.S. partner’s house for Thanksgiving, her birthday and Christmas. She also said she has met most of her family. “Now I don’t think of her as a partner; I just think of her as one of my friends,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she and Arti have similar feelings to be kind to others and common sense. 
Taksukawa said that C.H.A.T.S. has made her more compassionate to others, especially foreigners. “If I go back to Japan and see foreigners, I want to take care of them and help them because now I know how they feel. Taksukawa thinks that American and inter¬national students can learn a lot from each other. “I wish American students can learn from International students. In the future, it can help them with their work if they know that culture,” said Taksukawa. She said she taught her partner how to say hello in Japanese, “Konnichiwa,” and thank you, “Arigato.” 
Alize Margulis, a junior International Studies major has been part of C.H.A.T.S. since she was a freshman. “I joined C.H.A.T.S. because I thought it was the best way to learn about other cultures and customs,” said Margulis. Her first C.H.A.T.S. partner was Winny Wang, a graduate student from China studying Science Research. She said she found similarities between Wang’s culture and her own. “Winny almost always boils water and drinks the water as such; whereas I would boil water but I would drink it only if I had diffused a tea bag,” said Marguilis.
Last year, Marguilis and her former partner, Kotona Uzumaki, a Business major from Japan, were C.H.A.T.S ambassadors. “We spoke at various C.H.A.T.S. events and were nominated and received certification for Outstanding C.H.A.T.S. Partners of the Year 2012,” said Marguilis. She said her past two partners have become her really close friends. “Kotona, who was studying abroad in the U.S. for one year was in two of my classes , and once we became C.H.A.T.S. partners, we went to various club events on campus and explored off campus too,” said Marguilis. She said she feels she taught her partner how to be comfortable in her home when inviting her over for holidays and dinner. Marguilis said her two past partners taught her many phrases in Chinese and Japanese. She said she and Uzumaki would see shows in the city and at the Tilles Center as well as spend time in her neighborhood. Marguilis still keeps in contact both of her C.H.A.T.S. partners through Skype and e-mail. “I’m hoping to travel to Asia one day, so I know I will be able to explore their countries with them too!” she said.
This year Marguilis is partnered with a student from China named Shuai Shuai, but she has not met her yet. She said she wishes more American students joined C.H.A.T.S. “LIU Post provides this opportunity through the C.H.A.T.S. program, but I feel not enough domestic students are committed or interested in becoming a partner. I understand many students have busy agendas, but how complicated is it to take one hour per week out of your time to meet with some one?” said Marguilis.
She said she has truly enjoyed her experience as a member of C.H.A.T.S. “Inter¬national friends have certain values that we as Americans don’t. I am not bashing Americans, but we should embrace other cultures and be open to learning about them, especially in this globalized business world that we live in today,” said Marguilis.

With the election less than 30 days away, there have been many attempts on campus to make students aware of the importance of voting. From flash mobs in Hillwood to the voter registration table posted in front of Subway, the Office of Student Life is relentless. On Tuesday, October 2, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Club also had its say by dedicating one of its meetings to discuss the importance of voting in the upcoming election.
The NAACP is not only a club on campus, but it is a chapter of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights organization and it is renowned nationwide for its efforts to promote social justice for all Americans, according to NAACP.org. On campus, the club focuses on controversial topics and depends on its members to express their views and opinions by creating a non-judgmental environment, according to Ashley Abney, vice president of the LIU Post chapter of NAACP.
The executive board of the NAACP has seven executive board members: President Ara McPherson, Vice President Ashley Abney, Parliamentarian Adwoa Boateng, Treasurer Malcolm Daniel, Public Relations Coordinator Kylia Pierre, Membership Chair Javon Best, and Secretary Lionel Hurst.
McPherson began the club meeting with a seemingly simple question. “What does it mean to vote?” The members were silent. When asked by the e-board who was not voting, two hands were raised. “I am not prepared to vote yet,” said a young lady in the crowd. The other student said “It [voting] don’t mean nothing to me.”
To make students aware of the different policies of each Presidential candidate, Boateng introduced topics such as abortion, war, immigration, college, guns, debt, and taxes, and where both candidates stand on these issues.
They then introduced Dan Caccavale, a 2011 LIU Post graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science who is working towards his Master’s in Political Science, to answer questions provided by the NAACP. He began with telling the crowd that only 63 percent of the American population voted in 2008, and in the election before that, 56.7 percent of the American population voted. Caccavale also added that it is important to vote for the President based on his political beliefs and not how he looks. “For example, Jimmy Carter was liked because he was a small town farmer,” said Caccavale. And, in Caccavale’s opinion, “it turned out that he was one of the worst presidents in the United States.”
Caccavale also shared why he is going to vote in the election of 2012, “Personally I like to think you have an opinion, and I’d like to think every American has an opinion,” he said. “If you want to have any say in what goes on, you need to vote. By voting, you’re not only picking a President, you’re having your views expressed, which is a huge deal, and one that we take for granted.”
Another member of the crowd, who is voting, said, “I am voting because I feel it is my right to vote. As a citizen of America, we have the right to choose who we want to be President. It’s a right that comes with being an American.” 
“The reason I’m going to vote,” said President of NAACP McPherson, “is because I have two younger siblings…voting for me is not just for me and my generation, but it is for the generations coming up behind me, so they could have a better way of living.” She also added that she would vote out of respect for her forefathers, who risked their lives for us to be able to vote. “Your vote does count,” McPherson explained.
To Parliamentarian Boateng, voting is really important be¬cause, she said, if you choose not to have your voice heard and things don’t go your way, how can you blame the government? Boateng stated that everyone knows there are flaws in the political system, but one cannot complain if he or she does not attempt to change it. “Also as a person of color, we were finally able to obtain this right so you better use it,” said Boateng.
“For those not voting,” said Best, “you may just want to register anyway, you never know if you can change your mind, you don’t want to wait until it’s too late to decide you want to vote and you can’t.”
After the meeting, Bismark Oppong, who is a junior, and one of the members who stated that he would not vote in the beginning of the meeting, stated that he no longer feels so adamant about not voting. He admitted that he has reconsidered it a lot, and even though he has not made up his mind yet if he is going to vote, he is no longer a definite no.
NAACP members also stressed that in order to be registered to vote, you must have your voter registration forms postmarked by October 12. The NAACP’s next meeting, cosponsored by SGA, is on Tuesday, October 16, at 9 p.m. in the Hill¬wood Cinema, where food will be provided, during which students are welcome to eat and watch the second Presidential debate taking place at Hofstra University. Afterwards, there will be an open discussion about the debate and the candidates led by the NAACP e-board. To learn more about the NAACP club, contact postnaacp@gmail.com.

Ever walk around campus and see students wearing bright yellow vests that say “Student Escort Services” and wonder what they are doing? Or maybe you’ve seen the flyers around campus and asked yourself what Student Escorts are. Well, Student Escorts are a free service, provided by the Public Safety Department, that walks you to anywhere you want to be on campus. Student Escorts will even walk with you through Chipmunk Trail at night because you don’t want a run into the raccoon family living there or if you just want someone to have a casual conversation with.
One of the three Student Escort supervisors, Hector Nieves, a senior Physical Education major, has been working for the Student Escort Service for 5 years. “It’s been a good experience working here because I get to meet new students all the time. People are always interested in our job when they see me with the walkie talkie checking up on the employees.” Some student escorts like Kevin Fung, junior business major, find the late hours to be a disadvantage, but feel that “it’s a rewarding job to know I help others have a peace of mind walking to their car or dorm.” 
The Student Escort Service available to students, faculty and visitors to LIU Post. The service is available every Monday to Thursday night from 6 to 11 p.m. with the exception of holidays. You can make arrangements for student escorts by calling 516-299-2200 right before you leave or stop by the Hillwood Information Desk in Hillwood Commons. Students interested in becoming a part of the Student Escort Service can contact Lieutenant James Contarino in Public Safety Department or call 516-299-2216.

On September 17, The Pioneer had an opportunity to interview the new Dean of the College of Management, Dr. Andrew J. Rosman. He spoke about his new position and goals. 
The Pioneer: You became a Dean of the College of Management on July 1. It has now been two months. What do you think of LIU Post so far? 
Dr. Andrew J. Rosman: I’m very excited about being here. I’m very impressed with what I’ve seen so far. I already had some opportunities to visit classrooms. I visited two under¬graduate classes and one graduate class and I’m very impressed by the quality of the faculty and students. 
TP: How did you decide to come to LIU Post?
AR: I looked at a number of different universities and for a lot of reasons I chose to apply for the position here at LIU Post. One, I am originally from Long Island, and my family is still here. But, I also thought there are a lot of things I can do here. 
TP: What do you think of the state of the College of Management? Are there any problems to address? 
AR: First, I think there are many very good faculty members in the College of Management. There are a lot of good young faculty who are energetic and very talented. The quality of the students here is very good too. I’m very pleased with what I’ve seen in the classroom. I don’t see problems with the College of Management. However, I see opportunities in a few areas – developing new programs, cutting edge programs, and new delivery methods among others.
TP: What will you change and what will you keep the same as the former Dean? 
AR: I’m an academic as well as an administrator. I think I understand and empathize more with faculty about what they need, both from a teaching prospective, and a research prospective. I under¬stand the importance of quality research. I’m in a better position to be able to identify what is needed for the faculty to be able to do their jobs very well. 
TP: So many international students are business management majors here. Do you have some advice for them? 
AR: I don’t distinguish between international and domestic students because they take the same courses. International students will have more challenges in finding employment. We are going to be hiring a Placement Director for the College of Management to start in January. 
TP: What do you think are the strong points of LIU Post? 
AR: I think LIU Post is going through a period of reorganization with the new President coming on. With the exception of one Dean, all of the other Deans have been here for less than two years. So the school is going through period of reinventing itself, and in a very positive way. I’m very excited to be taking part of this reinventing period. 
TP: Could you give a message to the business students? 
AR: I think the most important message for them is to try and get the best college experience they possibly can, which means they have to be more than just students. They have to be involved. The university provides so many opportunities for them. They should join student organizations. I think it’s very important for them to do more than just go to class.

Time can be your worst enemy when you know you are supposed to be productive. Instead of being a good student, you end up wasting your time in as many ways as possible. It is ridiculous how uninteresting things can become temptations, impossible to resist, once there is something important on your agenda, especially when it is time restricted. Your free time becomes the time you are the most bored, and restricted time becomes the time you want to do everything but your actual assignments. However, wasting time can be very humoring, and if you are looking for time wasting suggestions, read on. 
1. Facebook is the number one time-waster. You catch yourself creeping on people’s wall, instead of doing anything that benefits you academically. It is called social networking, but considering the many times you are not interacting with your friends, it is a very passive way of networking. 
2. Go on YouTube and browse for funny videos. If you are in the mood for it, you will end up watching several videos for longer than you expected. 
3. Staring at people and things – ever done it? Yes, it happens almost every time you are supposed to write an essay that is due the next day. You end up staring at a specific person, picture or a magazine, and before you know it, five minutes of what was supposed to be productive time have elapsed. 
4. Take a very long nap. The hours will run away before you open your eyes again. Have you ever noticed that it is easier to fall asleep during the day when you are busy than at night when you are actually allowed to sleep? 
5. You cram intensively for a test you want to do well on. You sit down, you line up your pencils and books, you turn on your computer, and then you take a sip of your coffee. All of a sudden you notice how dirty your room is. You try to concentrate, but the dirt shouts at you, letting you know it is there. You give up, and you find your cleaning supplies. This takes about thirty minutes, and the next thing you know, your laundry pile is in your way. You cannot leave it alone, so you might as well do that, too. 
6. Re-decorate your room after you have cleaned it and did your laundry. If you live in a dorm, you know the white walls are not as nice as they could be with a couple of pictures on them. Find pictures online, and make sure you find the right ones for your walls. Print them out, and arrange them in the best looking way as possible on your wall. 
7. Take a shower, and give yourself spa treatments. This is a great time-waster; no one is going to notice that you have done any¬thing. However, you are going to feel better. You cannot do anything well if you do not feel well, so why not waste your time for a good cause? 
“I’m a pro at watching TV shows, and that is how I’ll waste my time,” said Elin Orre, a junior International Studies major. “My roommate and I have had a Friends marathon for the past weeks.”
“When I have an essay I’m supposed to write, I do everything other than that, especially go on Facebook,” said Cato Benjamin¬sen, a finance major. 
As mentioned earlier, wasting time can be humoring, and in most situations it is good for you to take frequent breaks while studying. However, it is still important to have some discipline and get those A’s.

The LIU Post Pioneers men’s soccer team had a bit of a scare, but managed to defeat Mercy College and the University of Bridgeport to maintain their undefeated season. The Pioneers have a perfect 11-0 on the season and 5-0 in East Coast conference play. Earlier in the week the Pioneers moved up to the number one ranking in Division II soccer. 
On Wednesday, October 3, the Pioneers beat the Mercy College Mavericks 3-1. However, it was the Mavericks that struck first in the match. At the 15:15 mark, sophomore midfielder Danny Leon, Jr. put the ball into the lower right corner of the net to give Mercy College the early lead. The Pioneers would answer back in the thirty-first minute when graduate midfielder Bas Beverwijk scored to tie the game at one. 
The score would remain that way until the sixty-forth minute in the contest. LIU Post notched two goals in the span of a minute to jump ahead 3-1. First freshman back Johan Wallin scored an unassisted goal in the sixty-forth minute and then graduate midfielder Kieran Mercer scored at 64:12. 
With those two goals in hand the Pioneers held on for the 3-1 win, with junior goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen making four saves in the win. LIU Post also held the advantage in shots with a 17-10 margin.
On Saturday, October 6, the Pioneers hosted the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights and defeated them by a score of 3-1. 
In similar fashion to the game prior, the Pioneers fell behind early in the game. In the seventh minute sophomore forward Matt Garcia beat Jorgensen to give the Purple Knights a 1-0 lead. However, LIU Post would knot the game back up at one late in the first half. Freshman midfielder Alex Billington headed in a corner kick from junior captain Eirik Bjorno. 
The Pioneers captured the lead in the second half when Wallin was on the receiving end of a cross from Mercer to make it 2-1. Junior forward Cemil Turan scored in the seventy-third minute to put the game away, with the Pioneers winning 3-1. Jorgensen made just two saves in the victory and the Pioneers had the advantage in shots, 17-4. 
The Pioneers next matchup is at home against sixth-ranked UMass-Lowell on Wednesday, October 10, at 3 p.m.

The LIU Post women’s soccer team finished the week with two strong wins against Mercy College and the University of Bridge¬port. The perfect week gives the Pioneers six consecutive wins and an overall record of 9-1-1. 
On Wednesday, October 3, the women’s soccer team traveled to Dobbs Ferry, New York, to take on Mercy College. The Pioneers started the game strong, creating some huge opportunities, but failed to put the ball in the back of the net. The Pioneers held a 16-10 shot advantage and a 7-3 edge in corner kicks. Nevertheless, the two halves of regulation ended scoreless. 
Neither team was able to put the game away in the first overtime, but freshman mid¬fielder Hanna Westerling won the game for the Pioneers after a cross from junior forward Alexa Niciforo in the second overtime. Westerling stayed composed on the cross, and chipped the ball over the Mercy goalkeeper to solidify the win. 
“It was one of the best feelings I have had in college to see Hanna (Westerling) score that goal and give us the win in double overtime,” sophomore midfielder Heidi Eikeland said after the game.
The Pioneers continued on their road towards a perfect week as the team hosted the University of Bridgeport on Saturday, October 6. The Pioneers started the game strong, as Westerling found top scorer and freshman forward Susanne Vistnes in front of the goal to give the Pioneers the lead early on. Vistnes then returned the favor, by finding Niciforo in front of the goal for the Pioneers’ second of the evening. Vistnes scored the final Pioneer goal, yet again off a great ball from senior captain Prudence Rydstrom, giving the Pioneers a three-goal edge going into halftime. 
Bridgeport would go on to score a goal in the second half, but it was not enough as the Pioneers won by a score of 3-1.
The game against Bridgeport was also a game between the top two teams in the conference. Sophomore midfielder Lina Harle was ecstatic after the Pioneers put themselves in the driver seat in the conference. 
“It was a great win for us, and so important, as it puts us ahead of Bridgeport in the conference,” Harle said after the game. The Pioneers improved to 5-0 in the conference, while Bridgeport dropped to 4-1 in the number two spot. The Pioneers have earlier said that winning the conference is one of the team’s goals for this season. “We want to play the conference championship game, and after today’s performance, I feel we have a good chance of getting there,” she said.
The Pioneers have three conference games left in regular season play, but will host Wilmington University on Wednesday, October 11, for a non-conference game. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m.

The LIU Post football team lost its third consecutive game on Saturday, October 6, against the sixteenth-ranked Shippensburg University Red Raiders by a final score of 36-20. With the defeat the Pioneers fell below the .500 mark, and now have a 2-3 record for the season. 
The Pioneers had a tall task in front of them on both sides of the ball on Saturday as the Red Raiders have the number one total offense in the nation, as well as the ninth-ranked total defense. Just to give you an idea of how good the Red Raiders offense really is, coming into the game against LIU Post, the Red Raiders averaged over 560 yards per game, 53.2 points per game, and defeated opponents by 34 points per game. 
The Pioneers were neck and neck with the explosive Red Raiders for the first half of play, as LIU Post was only down 17-14 after 30 minutes. However, the Red Raiders showed why they are considered one of the most complete teams in the country as the Pioneers were shut out in the third quarter. The Red Raiders allowed a meaningless touchdown late in the fourth quarter, as time was about to expire. During the second half, the Red Raiders managed to put 19 points on the board to put the game away and improve to a perfect 6-0 record. 
The Pioneers were able to keep the game close through the first half because of defense and special teams. The Pioneers scored their first touchdown when junior outside linebacker Tommy Williams re¬covered a 16-yard fumble for a touchdown which put LIU Post ahead early 7-3. 
Late in the second quarter, the Pioneers flexed their muscles on special teams as the unit blocked a punt, which put the offense in excellent field position. From Shippensburg’s two-yard line, the Pioneers needed one play to retake the lead 14-10. Junior quarterback Steven Laurino connected with fresh¬man tight end Sean Binckes for an easy score. 
Unfortunately, that touchdown was one of the last positives for the Pioneers. Red Raiders junior quarterback Zach Zulli continued his excellent start to the season as he was 21-31, passing for 276 yards and two touchdowns, without throwing an interception. In addition, Zulli added a touchdown on the ground, displaying why he is so hard to defend as a dynamic quarterback who can run and pass. 
On the other hand, the Pioneers offense has been struggling to move the ball during the recent losing streak. After scoring 46 points week one against Clarion University, the Pioneers have decreased their scoring output in each of the last four games. 
There was not much intrigue to the Pioneers offense as Laurino was 30-49, throwing for 176 yards and one touchdown. The Pioneers did not open up the offense and rarely threw the ball down the field like had been done in wins earlier this season. In addition, the running game yet again struggled. Although up against a stout Red Raiders defense, the Pioneers leading rusher was once again Laurino as he had 14 attempts for 53 yards and one touchdown. Junior running backs Jeff Mack and Anthony Brunetti combined for only 31 yards on 13 carries during the game. 
Heading into the game, the Pioneers had won the last three meetings against the Red Raiders. However, the Red Raiders were on another level last week, and played with some extra energy as it was Shippensburg’s Homecoming game. 
The Pioneers will look to snap their losing streak on Saturday, October 13, on the road against the West Chester University of Pennsylvania Golden Rams (4-2). Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org to hear all the game coverage. Pregame is at 12:30 p.m. and kickoff is scheduled for 1:00 p.m.

The LIU Post women’s volleyball team now has a record of 11-10 after splitting games this past week against Queens College and the University of New Haven. The Pioneers defeated ECC rival, Queens College, on Thursday, October 4, 3-1 (17-25, 25-12, 25-17, 25-21). The following day, the Pioneers came up short against New Haven by a final of 3-1 (25-17, 25-22, 13-25, 25-16). 
In the first contest, Pioneers’ sophomore middle blocker Heath¬er Adams had the game-high in kills with 16. The Pioneers also featured three players with double-figure digs: freshman libero Rachel Ringor (18), freshman outside hitter Harlee Meyers (14), and junior middle blocker Makamae Namahoe (12). In this game, the Pioneers lost the first set 25-17, but rebounded to win the final three. 
The Pioneers would try to win their second consecutive game against the New Haven Chargers but would be denied. Namahoe led the team in kills with 11, and was the only Pioneers with at least ten in that category. Once again, Ringor, Meyers and Namahoe all had double-digit kills, but in the loss Adams also joined the trio with 19 digs herself. 
Something to take away from this split after these past two games is the disparity in wins for the Pioneers at home compared to on the road. The Pioneers are 5-2 at home, and 2-5 on the road (also 4-3 at neutral locations). The Pioneers currently sit in fifth place in the East Coast Conference.
The Pioneers next game is on the road on Thursday, October 11 against the University of the District of Columbia (7-9).

Known as Italy’s most financially important city, Milan is a thriving cosmopolitan business capital. Having been greatly destroyed by World War II bomb raids, Milan has managed to rebuild itself into fashion paradise. Armani, Versace, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Pucci, Gucci, and many more took off on Milan’s run¬ways. Fashionistas make a pilgrimage here to shop at the designers’ flagship stores in the Quadrilatero d’Oro (Golden Quad). For a tourist, what makes Milan interesting is that the city is about the lifestyle of enjoying worldly pleasures.
Airlines: Milan’s international airport is Malpensa Airport which entertains airlines like Alitalia, Italy’s national carrier, American Airlines, Delta, and Air France. The smaller Linate airport to the east serves flights from Europe and within Italy and is connected to Milan by bus service.
Hotels/Lodging: Milan boasts a wide range of hotels. For those who wish to book luxury hotels, the choice can only be in the central area, among Brera, Via Monte di Pietà, Via Broletto, Via Manzoni, but also in the old town area. Milan offers a wide variety of hotels for business travelers that are close to the exhibition centers Fieramilanocity and Fieramilano and next to the airports of Linate and Malpensa. The areas of the Central Station and Corso Buenos Aires offer 2 or 3 star hotels in a good standard. To find low cost solutions you must move in the suburbs or towards the neighbor¬hoods of Lambrate and San Siro. The areas around Città Studi, Piazza Piola, or near the Polytechnic of Milan, also offer a wide choice of cheap hotels.
Attractions/Sightseeing: Shopping in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II or the Quadrilatero d’Oro are some of Milan’s favorite pastimes, but visitors tend to enjoy the magnificent Duomo and Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper even more. The Duomo of Milan is an amazing sight, stretching up high above the piazza del Duomo. It’s the third largest church in Christendom. A staggering 3,500 statues and 135 spires adorn the marble structure which has a Baroque and neo-Gothic façade and five carved bronze doors. To appreciate this beautiful cathedral in all its glory, take the lift to the roof where you get a breathtaking view of the Alps on a clear day. Make sure that you reserve a timed, 15-minute slot in which to visit the master¬piece, The Last Supper. It may not be Venice, but Milan is still a city of canals and a quiet cruise on its still waters throws light on historic gems. Navigli Lombardi (www.naviglilombardi.it) organizes a tour that takes in the ancient washhouses of vicolo dei Lavandai and San Cristoforo, the Scodellino Bridge, and the old Darsena Port. Built in 1603, this port sits at the confluence of two canals linking Milan with the Ticino and Po Rivers, and now hosts a sedate trade of riverside shopping, dining, and drinking. As the canal stretches across the city, you’ll find boutiques, antique restorers, bookstores, and night¬spots lining the banks and side streets. Fashion and finance aside, Milan’s other religion is calcio (football). The city is home to both AC Milan and Inter, two of Italy’s top teams. Passionate crowds pack San Siro stadium on Sunday in season.
Cuisine: Milanese restaurants serve the most varied of all Italy’s regional cuisines. Here you’ll find creamy pasta and dairy and meat products alongside international foods such as maki and curry. Two famous traditional Milanese dishes are risotto alla milanese (a rice dish made with saffron) and cotoletta alla milanese (breaded veal). Other dishes include Salame di Milano, which is made from finely minced pork and beef meat and many types of cheese. Grana Padano is a famous cheese overseas which comes from the Pò valley that includes the Lombardia, Piedmont, Veneto, and Emilia Romagna regions. Mascarpone is also a typical Milanese cheese that is an essential ingredient for desserts and creams often mixed with other cheeses, salami, or fish. However, the most famous Milanese cheese is without a doubt Gorgonzola. That rich, strongly flavored cheese reigns supreme at the Milan dinner table. This creamy cheese that has blue veins running through it is used to dress tasty first courses (in this case mixed with mascarpone) and to flavor Polenta. It can be eaten alone.

In hopes of providing a better life for his wife, Debbie (Jami Gertz) and three kids, Marty Weaver (Lenny Venito) bought a home in Hidden Hills, a gated community where a house hasn’t come on the market, ever. 
The Weavers soon learn that the entire community is comprised of aliens from the planet Zabvron, where the men bear children and everyone cries green goo from their ears. The Zabvronians have been stationed on Earth disguised as humans, awaiting instructions from home, and the Weavers are the first humans they’ve encountered. Pressures of marriage and parenthood are not exclusive to planet Earth. Two worlds collide as Jackie Joyner-Kersee (Toks Olagundoye) and Larry Bird (Simon Templeman) discover they can relate and learn from the aliens next door. 
The Neighbors is certainly out of this world and not like other shows that are on network TV. It’s different and entertaining to watch two different beings come together and learn about each other in a fantasy style set up. Is it laugh out loud funny? Well, no, but the strangeness emitted from its other worldly characters will surely have an eyebrow up in the air. “The Neighbors” was written by Dan Fogelman (“Cars,” “Tangled,” and “Crazy, Stupid, Love”) who is also an executive producer with Aaron Kaplan, Jeff Morton (“Modern Family”) and Chris Koch (“Workaholics,” “Modern Family”) so it’s got a great pedigree behind it. 
The Neighbors airs Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. on ABC.

In the giant world of video games, there are large corporate developers like EA and Capcom who have vast amounts of money to promote and develop games. Then you have small development teams who work for months on a limited budget to create a game that people will enjoy playing. FTL is one of those games and I absolutely love it! 
FTL was developed by Subset Games and released on September 14. The game is essentially an intergalactic themed survival adventure game that also acts like a space ship simulation. The game’s style reminds me of those old games on the original Nintendo system; it’s pixilated and simple, but it looks perfect. The player is from the federation that is on a special mission to save the galaxy. You are given a few crew members to control and a ship to command. You fly to different sectors of the universe while battling ships from the rebellion, avoiding hazards like sun flares and asteroids, and upgrading your ship to be stronger. 
What really makes this game great is that it is an honest challenge. Even if you’re on easy mode, the game randomly generates what happens. You could suddenly find yourself being attacked by a pirate space ship or find some extra loot that you can use to power-up your ship. Not only that, you have to maintain your ship carefully. The oxygen systems, the engine, the weaponry systems, and the shields can be knocked out by enemies which your crew has to repair in the middle of battle. Your crew can also die. If suddenly, a missile takes out part of the ship, you’ll have to get your crew member out of harm’s way or you lose them for good. You can find more crew members by rescuing them or buying them at stores. This is not an easy game. 
What’s really good about this game is the layout. You can see in¬side your ship and properly control your crew and fire your weapons. This is not a complicated game; it’s very easy to pick up. After only playing this game for an hour or so, I got the hang of the controls right away. This makes this a great game for people who don’t have time for long, story driven games. The soundtrack is wonderful as it is soft but nails the space-theme. What really made me enjoy this game as well was the weapon variety. You have missiles, drones, lasers, and much more. As you continue playing, you get access to different space ship models to use in more adventures and each time you start a new game the layout is always different. You never know what’s next. 
I really couldn’t find many things wrong with this game, but there could have been a better animation for traveling to different parts of the galaxy. There could have been more in the background rather than just random pictures of space. It was kind of let down that you can’t really design or customize your ship with things like colors or patterns. The ships are all presets. 
This game is a great value and relatively cheap. It’s currently on Steam for $9.99 and they also sell their soundtrack for $3.99. FTL is fun, charming, and simple. My final verdict for FTL: Faster Than Light is an 8.3/10.

There’s comes a point in a relationship where both people must let their guards down and be able to take a joke from their other half. Anytime I see a girl getting overly offended by a small joke cracked by her boyfriend, I almost get annoyed. I usually end up thinking to myself, “Jeez, lighten up girl! Or, damn I feel sorry for that guy.”
Now ladies, don’t go getting your panties up in a bunch just yet. You have to admit, even if it’s just to yourselves, that there are plenty of times when your boyfriend cracks a joke at you and you blatantly throw a hissy fit. We all know you’re not truly offended by what he said; you’re just making a fuss for no reason other than you feel like it.
Of course there’s a line to be drawn. Sometimes guys can take it too far and be down right mean. A great one they always seem to come out with is to make a joke about a girl’s appearance or her weight; the weight being the really big no-no here. Usually, when this type of joking ensues, the female initially offended will take a hit below to belt towards her guy. This will go back and forth until both parties leave the conversation furious at one another.
My boyfriend and I have been together on and off for the last six years and we poke fun at each other constantly. We laugh more at each other’s expense than anything else. We know the other one is always kidding and instead of getting irritated we just laugh with each other. Every couple should be able to laugh at one another and themselves every now and then; so lighten up people!

Shows like Awkward on MTV and popular web series like Awkward Black Girl proves that everybody goes through humiliating, blush-worthy moments. It’s especially worse when something embarrassing happens to you in college, the place where you try to reinvent yourself. 
I’m the type who loves to doodle in class. One semester one of my teachers, who loved to walk up and down the aisles while he lectured, glanced down at what I was scribbling. “Unfortunately there will not be a drawing portion on the test, Victoria,” he announced. For the rest of the semester he would always shoot me looks to make sure I was actually writing notes in my book. It was embarrassing because doodling in class is such a silly thing to do, especially when the teacher is going over what will be on a future test. 
Everybody has a mortifying story to share, and the students of LIU Post campus are no different. Here are the stories of a few brave souls willing to share. 
“One of my most embarrassing moments in college was just the other week,” said a sophomore English major, who doesn’t wish to be named. “It was in a class that I didn’t do any of the readings for and the teacher mentioned that next class there was to be a quiz. I started freaking out, asking what was going to be on the test and she kept giving me brief answers. So I got super frustrated and called her mom… I said something like, ‘Mom, are the handouts going to be on the test too?’ I know she and other people in the class noticed but didn’t say anything, which makes it that much more embarrassing.” 
“I’ve had plenty of embarrassing moments,” said Mia DeFranco, a senior Dance major. “One of my more clean stories that I can say is falling down the steps with my laundry basket freshman year. What made it worse was it was in front of everybody in Nassau[Hall].” 
These uncomfortable in¬stances rear their ugly heads every now and then to serve us some humble pie. It is awesome if you can look back and laugh at them, but the most important thing to remember is that they happen to everyone. If you have any other funny stories that you want to share, email us at cwpstpnr@gmail.com!

Smiling girls in pink t-shirts, with styled hair and flawless make-up gathered in the Hillwood Commons Pioneer Room on Tuesday, October 2nd. Three Cactus Salon hairdressers offered hair-extensions for $10, while another welcomed visitors at the door promoting special offers from the salon, which has several locations across Long Island. All of this was done at a pink table outside the Hillwood Cafe. No, it wasn’t a Barbie convention. It was a Think Pink event hosted by Alpha Epsilon Phi supporting the non-for-profit organization Sharsheret in their Breast Cancer Awareness program.
“This is a fun thing to do, for a good cause. I’m really excited,” said Ashley Ioveno, a sophomore graphic design major and sorority member. For the second consecutive year, Alpha Epsilon Phi along with Cactus Salon raised money for Sharsheret, which since 2001 has worked to support all young women and families of Jewish back¬ground facing breast cancer. 
With raffles and discounted Cactus Salon gift-cards, students were encouraged to support the cause. In 2011, the turn-out was $978, and this year $600 was raised. “I am definitely happy with the out¬come. No matter the amount, it is money going towards a wonderful cause, and any little bit helps,” said Dolores Yovino, a senior biology major, and sorority member.
Hair-dressers Francelina Fenton and Taylor Goldhammer appreciated the opportunity to help. The salon joined the effort last year, after a request from a sorority member, and was not hesitant to do it again. With special gift cards offering discounted hair-cuts, consultation, and styling, the salon helped Alpha Epsilon Phi with the Think Pink event. On October 2nd they brought equipment, colorful hair-extensions, and their expertise to LIU Post. 
Alpha Epsilon Phi hopes to make the Think Pink fundraiser a yearly event to spotlight the important cause, and create awareness around campus. “As a chapter we continuously raise money for Sharsheret,” said Yovino, explaining that the sorority will do the breast cancer walk on October 21 in New York City. But this isn’t the only charity the sorority supports. Next semester, Alpha Epsilon Phi will also raise money for Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS. 
The Cactus Salon has locations all over Long Island. For more information visit www.CactusSalon.com. To find out more about Sharsheret, visit www.sharsheret.org. For information about the sorority, Alpha Epsilon Phi, go to http://liuaephi.wix.com/epsilonmu.

Last September, LIU Post’s Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) Director, William Clyde, announced to the program that all new, incoming fresh¬men would not be covered for their housing expenses. Due to governmental bud¬get cuts, Clyde stated, new HEOP students will no longer have the option to apply for room and board as they did in the past.
HEOP is a program that accepts underprivileged students who would not have otherwise been accepted through LIU Post admissions. The program works with New York State and provides financial and supportive aid for students who may need the extra help and would benefit academically from it. “The assistance of the program helps all the students and it continues to show well,” stated Clyde. 
“HEOP has given me the opportunity to get a great education without worrying how am I going to afford this,” explains senior Health Care Administration major Christine Pena. “HEOP has also given me the opportunity to study abroad last fall, something that I never thought would be a possibility.”
Statistically, the HEOP program is one of the most successful programs in the nation, according to HEOP.org. HEOP students have a 6.5% graduation rate higher then the national average. Statistics also show that LIU Post’s HEOP students exceed beyond just grades but the program also has one of the highest graduation rates in the school.
HEOP students prior to 2011 received a financial package where most college expenses were covered, including housing by the means of applying for financial aid, grants and loans. “The program isn’t in jeopardy,” said Clyde, who has been the program director for 27 years. “It’ll force us to do things differently.” New HEOP students are now faced with making the decision of commuting to school or applying for a Parent Loan to cover the extra expenses for housing. Sophomore marketing major Victor Ramirez pays out of pocket to cover his extra expenses. “Cutbacks have affected me a lot. It was a struggle to even move in for the Fall 2012 semester since I did not have the money to start my payment plan,” he said.
Many funding programs support HEOP, but one of the programs that suffered a budget cut last year was Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). On the HEOP website, it states: “TAP generally provides up to $4000 in scholarship for students. Depending on what the tuition is for the institution, this could be a huge chunk of funding that a student can get.” Not only are future HEOP students affected, the budget cuts are affecting non-HEOP students also since TAP is accessible to any student who meets the requirements. Budget cuts affect any student who depends on financial assistance.
To prevent further budget cuts, the Director of HEOP at LIU Post organizes an annual trip to Albany every spring for HEOP students and students who depend on financial assistance for school, during which they meet with New York State legislators. Students meet and talk to legislators about how they benefit from having the program at LIU Post, and how they can profit from the program as they continue their education. Students are there to remind legislators that they need to support the funding for higher education. The students also talk to the legislators about TAP, Pell Grants, and financial aid. This year’s meeting will take place on February 5, 2013. All students are welcome to sign up for the trip at the HEOP office located in the lower level of Post Hall. For more information on the Higher Education Opportunity Program, please visit www.liu.edu/CWPost/Academics/Programs/Special/HEOP.aspx or call (516) 299-2397.

“Steady hours are very rare in the media business,” said Meredith Daniels, a freelance writer and news producer at Newsday. Daniels was the guest speaker on October 4 at the Media Arts Department’s Food for Thought lecture. Daniels was there to share her insight into the world of media. “It is 24 hour news industry…you may have to work every shift there is and be ok with that.” The lecture was held in Humanities Hall room 027 during Common Hour.
A graduate from Boston University, Daniels always loved writing, but she also dabbled in radio. When she got laid off from a radio job she had, she fell back into freelancing. When that was not ‘paying the bills’, her friend told her about an opening at Newsday for its website. “This is when multimedia started to evolve. They said ‘okay Meredith, why don’t you join the market’?” said Daniels. “But I didn’t know how to edit or shoot video.” 
She was then able to start doing “man-on-the-street” pieces where she was able to really use her personality. After a few years she was promoted to her current position and she has been with Newsday for the past 10 years. 
As one of the news producers for news¬day.com, her job entails coming up with original ideas and prepping reporters for live shots. “If there is something that is not being covered nationally… we get it up on the web¬site,” said Daniels. “[It is] like seeing a story itself and seeing smaller stories and different angles.” A news producer takes all the elements of a newscast and compiles them into a cohesive show. 
During the question and answer portion of the lecture, students were able to ask about certain topics she touched upon. 
One student asked Daniels where she finds her inspiration. 
“A paycheck and a hungry child,” she jokingly answered. “No, but seriously, I like my work. I truly do…I like being behind the news before it breaks.” 
Daniels ended the lecture with some words of advice for the media students that attended: “If you truly believe you want to do this for a living, you have to show what makes you better than the next person…you can’t be lazy, because you should be busy setting yourself apart from the next person.” 
Daniels was the first guest speaker in the Food for Thought series this semester. The pro-gram was launched in 2010 and has included Pulitzer Prize winner and LIU graduate Josh Margolin, Stephanie Schilling of Lifetime Television, Tina Susman from the L.A. Times, Alan Clary from MTV, and Rukelt Dalberis of Fox News.The next Food for Thought lecture will be held on November 8 at 12:30 p.m. in Humanities Room 027, and will feature guest speaker Bill Eichenberger, a longtime sports reporter for Newsday and the Wall Street Journal.
