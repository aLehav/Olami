Nicole Curcio (’17), the Pioneer’s spring 2017 News Editor and before that a Pioneer staff reporter, is enjoying “post-grad” life after achieving her BFA in Dance Studies and minor in journalism in May 2017. Nicole is currently working as a Performing Member of Peconic Ballet Theatre in Riverhead, NY, and is also a member of the Westchester Knicks Dancers, the official dance team of the NBA G League’s Westchester Knicks. Nicole reports that she loves having the opportunity to pursue her dream in dancing and is hoping to write again once her season slows down. “Reporting for the Pioneer was a great experience to prepare me for the ‘real world’. I was able to learn from other great writers on the staff and it made me gain respect for the importance of strong, honest reporting as well as self timeliness in general.” Nicole was the recipient of the Macaleer Kourday Award in the Study of Journalism at the award ceremony for the College of Arts, Communication and Design in May 2017.
