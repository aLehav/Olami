Have you ever considered where graduate students were living this semester? How about the number of graduate students actually dorming? Jennifer Fuoco, the director of residence life, has informed the Pioneer that there are currently 92 graduate students living on campus and that the total number of graduate students living on campus has changed over the years. Fuoco added that, “This number has changed from year to year and is currently up by six from last year at this time.”
Various factors can determine why most graduate students choose to live off-campus.  Sean Manning, a graduate student studying medical microbiology said that “since [he] lives near the school, he doesn’t see the point in living on campus.” Jessica Blumenthal, a graduate student studying social work, agreed with Manning. Blumenthal said that she doesn’t live on campus because she “lives 30 minutes from the school, so for me, it is not worth paying for housing on campus when I can live at home for free.” Although their reasons seem plausible, living on campus can also have its advantages.
Blumenthal went on to say,  “During my undergrad., I was in Maryland and paid for housing, both in dorms and in an apartment, so I already had the experience of living somewhere else.”
The director of residence life also provided a tentative explanation as to why graduate students choose to live on campus. Fuoco said, “living on campus seems to appeal most to graduate students who are enrolling in graduate coursework immediately after finishing their Bachelor’s degrees.  For students who have been out of the residence halls and away from campus life for a year or more, the idea of living in a residence hall, having a roommate, and sharing a community bathroom may no longer be something that works with their lifestyles or schedules.  Some graduate students are also completing their coursework while working full-time and may choose to live closer to their workplace.”
Though living off-campus may be suitable for someone seeking a different experience of being in another environment that is more private and confined, few graduate students agree that living on campus can be an advantage. A graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that when “you live on campus, [you] meet a lot of people and don’t have to deal with all the traffic of commuting, and you get more involved with school related activities. And, living on campus also allows you to work.”
As you can see, there are many things that can influence a person’s choice in deciding whether to dorm or not.  One can agree that graduate students, although one may  think there are none on campus, do make up a significant percentage of the student population on campus. If you still unsure about whom the graduate students are, try networking through the residence halls; you bound to come across a graduate student more quickly than you would think.

Almost every week during the course of the semester, the halls of C.W. Post are open to students looking to enroll.  Students take campus tours, attend information sessions hosted by the Admissions Office, and try out classes.  Last week, on October 10th, a Post Preview Day was held in Humanities Hall, attracting high school juniors and seniors, transfer students and parents looking to get a glimpse of everything Post has to offer. Students from all over New York and as far as Virginia gathered together on campus.
Director of Freshman Admissions Dave Follick presented the program.
It began with a slide show presentation that included an overview of Post, academic programs and schools, honors programs, academic counseling, internships, student life, living and dining on campus, sports, admission requirements, and financial aid, including a special slideshow about “financing your post-secondary education”.
Follick answered questions about club sports, S.C.A.L.E scholarships, early decisions and housing opportunities for late applicants. Faculty and staff members were available after the presentation to answer further questions from prospective students and family members.
High school senior Tori Gonzalez, who will be applying to Post in the fall as a Forensic Science major, took courses at Post this summer and liked the campus. Gonzalez thought the presentation was “very informative, especially the information about the S.C.A.L.E scholarships.” High school senior Celia Quintero said she is considering the campus. Quintero visited four other campuses as well, stating she liked “the scholarships available for different areas.”
Another, high school senior Miranda Higgins said she “loves the vibe of the campus.” She said she will apply to Post for the fall 2012 semester as an English major.
The recent Post Preview Day concluded with a walking tour of the campus, which included visiting resident halls. A second program was held on the same day in the Tilles Center.

“I think the School of Visual and Performing Arts at C.W. Post is one of the best kept secrets in New York,” Dr. Noel Zahler, the new dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, said during a recent interview with the Pioneer.
On October 3, 2011, Dr. Zahler began the next chapter of his academic career as the new Dean. He was formerly affiliated with Connecticut College, the University of Minnesota and Carnegie Mellon University, where he founded interdisciplinary programs.
Dr. Zahler said he took the job as Dean because it was an opportunity to become a dean in a school that embraces a large number of his interests. He is honored, humbled and excited about the “opportunities and possibilities that the school has in front of it,” he said.
Dr. Zahler said he is looking forward to creating a greater awareness of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, giving it more regional, national and international visibility. “I came here because I believe in this faculty and because, Dr. Jeffrey Kane, the vice president for academic affairs, assured me that the arts are central to the educational mission of this campus. His vision of a stronger, more competitive and better-known college is something that I’m eager to help make a reality,” he said.
Dr. Zahler thinks one of the greatest assets C.W. Post has is the Tilles Center. “We need to work more closely with the Tilles Arts Center and create programs that include the world-class performers and ensembles that come through that Center,” he said. He added, “The Tilles Center is one of the largest performing arts centers outside of Manhattan. It is similar to the relationship the Julliard School has with Lincoln Center. I want to make sure students and the community are aware of this opportunity. It’s an important component of our program and one that distinguishes our school and our campus.”
Dr. Zahler looks forward to working with faculty and students to create stronger programs, new areas of study and a new visibility for what they do, adding, “We need to think about the future and figure out where we want to be in five years and in ten years and fill in the steps to get there; it has to be a shared vision.”  The School of Visual and Performing Arts includes the Department of Art, the Department of Media Arts, the Department of Music, and the Department of Theatre, Film, Dance & Arts Management.
Dr. Zahler’s biggest challenge as new dean will be finances and resources. “We are on the heels of a major economic crisis where the economy has dried up and the arts are the first to feel it. Being able to find resources will be one of the most difficult challenges,” he said.
The School of Visual and Performing Arts has a lot of opportunities in front of it in the hands of Dr. Zahler; “I am extremely excited to be appointed Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts. I’m very interested in getting to know the students and faculty and lending my help in whatever manner is most appropriate to move the school forward.”

The Script is an Ireland-based band that has become an American sensation over the past year. The alternative rock band is compromised of three members: Danny O’Donoghue, Mark Sheehan and Glen Power, whose talents merge together beautifully. The band emulates how powerful music can be with just the simple use of an electric guitar, drums and voice. It makes those of us with very limited musical abilities listen in awe and smile just because.
Science & Faith is their second album and consists of songs that convey a message of heartbreak but hope. Sounds typical? Well, yes it does, but their R&B twist and the lead singers’ incredible voice guarantee that you will keep listening. The members tell their fans, especially those of us in America, that Irish music may seem to be giving off a depressing tone, but the underlying message is always a positive one. Their radio hit is “For the First Time,” and the song is catchy and fun to listen to. However, other songs on their album are much better; I recommend “If You Ever Come Back” and “This = Love”.
The band just finished their tour across America, and the turnout was quite impressive. I truly expect them to gain a much bigger following now. I was fortunate enough to see them play at Roseland Ballroom last weekend, and they sound amazing live. Lead singer, O’Donoghue, has a voice that sounds just as good live, if not better, as it does on the soundtrack.  He tells fans that just like Amy Winehouse’s voice resembled a saxophone, he likes to compare his to the violin.
They had me the very first time I listened to their CD, but after hearing them live, I am a true fan. I definitely recommend listening to the album, and if you get the chance, see them live. You won’t regret it!  Check them out at www.thescriptmusic.com, and follow them on twitter @TheScript.

School’s back in session and some of us are wondering how we’re going to get through this semester financially. Many take advantage of Financial Aid, student loans, government loans, our parents, part-time jobs, and so on, but aside from all of that, C.W. Post offers, for those who qualify, a program known as Work Study. Basically, Work Study is a resource that allows you to make a set amount of money for the year from an on-campus job.  You are paid bi-weekly by check and this is considered as a form of financial assistance. Job locations vary from the Library, the Pratt, Hillwood, to campus academic departments, among many other options.
In order to find out if you are eligible for Work Study, you can go to the Financial Aid Office and then from there, staff in Career Services (both offices are located in Kumble Hall) can guide you towards a job of interest to you. After this process, you meet with the manager of the department where you would like to work, and hopefully get the job! It all sounds very promising, that is until pay comes into effect, which is minimum wage for most positions.
Marissa Poggio, Junior International Studies major, thought that getting a job on campus would be convenient and easy. Once she found out that she would only be making a meager $7.25 an hour, she reconsidered her decision. “I live an hour away, so it would basically only pay for my gas, and I would have to come here on Fridays too, even though I don’t have class,” said Poggio. The positives did not outweigh the negatives for her.
On the other hand, Junior Nicole Pitone, an Electronic Media major, was offered a Work Study position and decided to stick with it. In her case she was offered $1,500 for the year, which means she can only work enough hours to get to that sum, and no more after that.  However, Pitone found a loophole. Most students think that you have to split that money between two semesters, but Nicole found out that you could make it all in one, and choose not to do Work Study the next semester. “I wouldn’t really recommend it to anyone else.You are limited on how much you can make, and how many hours a week you can work,” said Pitone. Nonetheless, it does help pay for gas, and that’s something that can’t be turned down so quickly.
So although Work Study may not be for everyone, it is a resource that students should know about. Junior Public Relations major Liza Gumelski, wishes that she was in fact an eligible candidate for Work Study. “I live right off campus and it would be so convenient, plus the hours are good,” said Gumelski. Every situation is different and if you feel like you’re short on cash these days, check out Work Study.  Who knows, it just might work for you.

The administration of Long Island University and the SGA have been trying for some time to strengthen the ties between C.W. Post and its sister campus in Brooklyn. Among other things, there have been bi-campus retreats and guest speakers as well as athletic events.  However, it still has done little to unify or at least bring the campuses closer.
Some members of administration have also considered making each campus’ newspaper available on both campuses. The Brooklyn campus has a student newspaper called the Seawanhaka (Sea-wah-naka). The new Editor-in-Chief is Mabel Martinez.  Like all student papers, including the Pioneer, there is a struggle between being campus-oriented and showing outside of campus events that the student body might not be aware of. Martinez said, “I really wanted to change the paper beginning from the content and layout. I want the paper to be the voice of the students and more campus- oriented, which it has been so far. As for layout, I wanted it to be more appealing to the eye, so students are more willing to pick it up. This year, the Seawanhaka has an entire new staff, and we all have been working really hard to make this paper better than what it has been in the past.”
So, the question remains: Should the Pioneer be brought to Brooklyn, and should we bring the Seawanhaka here?
Ashley Staib, a music major in her junior year here at Post, says, “It could be beneficial because the perception of the Brooklyn campus isn’t that it is a train or bus away. They seem further; it is almost as if they aren’t real.  Bringing the paper there and vice versa would get rid of that barrier, and it could help with the bi- campus relationship because students at C.W. Post can take advantage of  events the Brooklyn campus has in the paper.  Brooklyn students will also be able to take advantage of events at C.W. Post, such as events at the Tilles Center.”
Dan Caccavale, a senior political science major, concurs with Ashley, saying, “I think it’s a great idea. It would give Post students an idea of LIU life outside of this campus. By using both papers, we can improve bi campus relations between students.”
Some people agree and think it is a good idea, but there is also the potential problem that students won’t bother reading the other paper because they feel matters in the paper do not concern them.  “Having both newspapers at both campuses is a good idea, but I don’t think it would work out because having the Pioneer paper at Brooklyn would confuse students.  Some students won’t know which newspaper is for which campus, or they might think otherwise.  Also, the Pioneer newspaper has campus news and events that most likely won’t relate to the Brooklyn Campus students, so a lot of students might not read the paper because it has nothing to do with them or the Brooklyn Campus.” said Martinez.
However things that happen within our campuses affect all of us more than we think.  It is just hard to see it on an individual basis. The Brooklyn Campus helps support this campus.  If they take a major blow, it will affect us.  One may see a large spike in tuition or cuts in certain departments. One of our editors-in-chief, Jackie Favaloro, says, “I think it is worth trying. It might be interesting for students to see what the other campus is doing. It may create a sense of unity between the campuses. A potential issue may be some students are too busy and consumed by their own lives that they won’t pick up the paper or connect.”
There are pros and cons for this idea, but, ultimately, no one will ever know unless they try. This would mean that the discounts students get for events through the school will have to extend to the students on the other campuses should people choose to try and take advantage of the opportunities at the other campus. Having both papers available seems like it could be a success and give each campus better ideas of what to do to bring the campuses together by using each paper’s opinion section. Students may want to bring programs they hear are going on here at Post to the Brooklyn campus.  Maybe, Post should keep an eye out for the colorful red banner of the Seawanhaka Press.

By Jacqueline Favaloro and Anne Winberry
The President sat in a green leather chair, on Monday, September 26, as the afternoon sun poured through the damask curtains illuminating his office at University Center. Asian artifacts littered the room, along with pictures of his family. Yoda, and three monkey statues sat on a bookshelf: hear no evil, speak no evil, and see no evil. He invited us to sit down and gestured towards a cozy-looking couch with several pillows containing images of cocker spaniels. This would be his first interview with the Pioneer in several years.  He graciously agreed to sit down with Jacqueline Favaloro and Anne Winberry, the Co-Editors-in-Chief of the student newspaper.
Dr. Steinberg: “So are these questions about the strike?”
The Pioneer: “They’re more of a mix.”
The Pioneer: “Tell us a little about yourself.”
Dr. Steinberg: “I have been president of Long Island University since 1985. I kept the position so long because this is a wonderful place. There are very exciting things here.”
Editor’s Note: Before Dr. Steinberg became President of Long Island University, he taught in the Department of History at the University of Michigan. In 1973, he joined the administration of Brandeis University as executive assistant to the president, becoming vice president and university secretary in 1977.
The Pioneer: “What do you enjoy most about the position?”
Dr. Steinberg: “Watching students graduate. It is miraculous to see the transformation from high school to college seniors.”
The Pioneer: “What is your biggest accomplishment?”
Dr. Steinberg: “Keeping the Brooklyn campus from closing and making sure it fulfills it’s own destiny.”
The Pioneer: “And biggest failure?”
Dr. Steinberg: “Making South Hampton a success. If we didn’t close it, the university would have gone into bankruptcy.”
The Pioneer: “Do you think the strike could have been avoided?”
Dr. Steinberg: “I can’t speak about the faculty, but yes. If we threw money we didn’t have at them, it could have been avoided. If we raised their salary, however, it would have meant an increase in tuition for students. To avoid tuition increases in the past, I’ve cut my own salary 15%, and the secretaries haven’t had an increase in salary in several years.”
Editor’s Note: Since Dr. Steinberg’s presidency, there have been 13 strikes, seven at C.W. Post, and six at the Brooklyn campus.
The Pioneer: “Where do you see the university in the future?”
Dr. Steinberg: “Students come first. Our first priority is to educate students, and help them find themselves, and become mature thinking adults. We want to get out of the ill will that gets in the way. We would like to bring in new faculty that will provide new energy and direction. We want to show that our budget follows our priorities and our mission statement. We want to deliver education in the ways you and other generations are going to take it in. Lastly, we want to improve and cement our relationship with the communities around us.”

You can tell a lot about a person by the shoes that they wear. Shoes are a further expression of your personality, or maybe just how you’re feeling that day.  Put on a pair of sneakers and you seem active, adventurous, and all about comfort. On the other hand, wear thigh-high pleather boots and you may seem like you are auditioning for a part in Pretty Woman 2. Either way, shoes are not just about functionality.
The first shoe trend cropping up on campus this fall is leopard-print ballet flats. Leopard print has become an everyday occurrence for many of us. Now I’m not telling you to dress in head to toe leopard print like Snooki from the “Jersey Shore,” but introducing a little animal print into your wardrobe is a fun alternative way to add a dash of excitement to any outfit. “I think leopard-print flats make a statement. They {are one of those shoes that} announce your arrival and show off how fierce you are,” says Public Relations major Gina Fernandez. Keep an outfit simple with a cardigan, a plain blouse, and jeans to compliment your leopard-print footwear.
Nude pumps are the perfect option for a night on the town. Pumps alone do wonders for the appearance of your legs, but nude pumps help even more. This timeless alternative elongates your legs, making you look taller and thinner. And who among us doesn’t want that? The best thing about this trend is that nude pumps match virtually everything.
To demonstrate the edgier side of your personality, try introducing a motorcycle boot into your wardrobe, especially one with warm lining. “I adore boots because they are fashionable, warm, and comfortable for the winter,” Junior Nicole Nussbaum believes. “It is a great dose of effortless glamour.” These boots will not only keep your feet warm, but will add an instant level of cool to an otherwise dull or plain outfit.
Another shoe trend is oxfords. Oxford shoes have been a mainstay in Europe but this trend is making its way to the States this fall. These shoes are not only comfortable, but classy as well. They provide any outfit with a much-needed boost of elegance. Oxford shoes are widely available in two-toned, animal print, good old black, and more.
All of these shoes can be found in shoe stores from Jimmy Choo to Payless, depending on your budget. My advice would be to check out Steve Madden for affordable shoes that will last for the next three seasons. Famous Footwear and Love My Shoes offers great varieties for a discounted price. Whatever your shoe type may be, rock it out and maybe even consider switching it up!

The C.W. Post Pioneers women’s soccer team has made the most of a four game home stand, winning its last three games. The Pioneers defeated NYIT, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and Mercy College respectively.
There had been a game scheduled on Wednesday, October 12, against Holy Family in Philadelphia, but due to inclement weather, the matchup was canceled.
The three wins helped improve the Pioneers record to 7-4 overall and 3-2 in East Coast Conference (ECC) play. They currently sit at fifth in the ECC, behind Bridgeport, Molloy, Dowling, and Queens College.
On Wednesday, October 5, the Pioneers defeated the NYIT Bears 2-1 off a game-winning goal scored by freshman forward Morgan Kitton. To date, Kitton has totaled three goals, one assist and seven points in 11 games. She had previously scored two goals against Wilmington University back on September 29.
Pioneers leading scorer, sophomore forward Alexa Niciforo, scored early in the contest to give her team the 1-0 advantage. However, the Bears would respond just minutes into the second half, as junior midfielder Arana Natall put a rebound shot past Pioneers goalkeeper Allie Weiser to tie the game at one. Eight minutes later, Kitton would score the game winner, as her shot bounced off the left post and found its way into the net.
On Saturday, October 8, the Pioneers rolled over the Saint Thomas Aquinas Spartans 5-0.  Freshman forward Lina Harle scored two goals and Niciforo added her team-leading eighth goal of the season. Niciforo also leads the team in points at 19.
Harle scored the first two goals of the game, coming at the fourth and 17th minutes.
In the second half, sophomore midfielder Jeanine Ambrogi scored her first goal of the season to give the Pioneers a comfortable 3-0 lead. Niciforo and freshman midfielder Jasmine White each added a goal in the 83rd and 84th minute respectively to guarantee a Pioneer win. White’s goal was the first of her collegiate career.
The Pioneers winning streak continued against the Mercy Mavericks. They defeated their ECC foe 2-0. Ambrogi deflected a shot into the lower right corner to give the Pioneer the early lead, which would hold up through the first half.
In the second half, freshman midfielder Elsa Klarin gave the Pioneers an insurance goal during the 52nd minute, making it 2-0 in favor of C.W. Post.
The Pioneers play again on Wednesday, October 19, at 3:30 p.m. against Philadelphia University.

After four games over the last two weeks, the third-ranked men’s soccer team is still undefeated with a record of 12-0-1. The team won three games during the stretch and tied 2-2 against NYIT on October 12th.
The first game against Millersville University on October 5th, ended 2-1 in favor of C.W. Post, making it 10 straight wins for the Pioneers. The two forwards, freshman Eivind Austboe and sophomore Cemil Turan, each scored one goal, securing the victory.
The next matchup for the Pioneers, their third East Coast Conference game of the season, was on October 8th, against 17th-ranked Saint Thomas Aquinas University. The Pioneers went out with an offensive tactic by playing physically with the Spartans, who put up a good defense and fought back with their offensive line. In the 83rd minute, the Pioneers got on the scoreboard after Turan put the ball in the net with a shot in the upper right corner, giving the Pioneers a 1-0 advantage. The Pioneers secured their lead in the last seven minutes, improving their record with yet another win.
Following their two wins, the third-ranked Pioneers were ready to take on their next challenge, but their winning streak was put to an end after facing NYIT on October 12th. In the fourth Conference game of the season, NYIT shocked the Pioneers with a 1-0 lead into the second half. With team effort from graduate student and midfielder Kieran Mercer and sophomore captain Eirik Bjornoe, Turan was served with a pass and scored with a header, evening out the score at one goal apiece.
With a quick response, NYIT scored its second goal only one minute after the Pioneers did, regaining the lead. Junior forward Andreas Olsen responded on the Pioneers behalf, putting a rebound after a shot from Turan into the net, tying the score at two. The final score would remain 2-2, making it the first draw of the season.
Saturday, October 12th, the Pioneers were eager to get back from the draw against NYIT, facing Mercy College in another East Conference battle. The Pioneers started this game off extremely well, as six minutes into the game, Olsen received the ball from sophomore midfielder Jonathon Watkin,and scored his fourth goal of the season, giving C.W. Post a 1-0 lead.
The Pioneers continued their pressure in the first half, putting shots on goal; however, they did not find the back of the net again. The Pioneers had a difficult time scoring and putting good possessions together.  They lacked drive and motivation to score goals and to make good plays, disappointing the spectators who showed up to see the match. Closest to adjusting the lead was Austboe, with a shot hitting the crossbar at the end of the second half.  Still, the Pioneers could celebrate another win, making their record 4-0-1 in the ECC and 12-0-1 overall.
“The quality in our play has fallen in the last couple of matches,” Olsen says, partly blaming the quality of the field. He prefers playing on artificial turf, like the team did in the 5-1 win against Dowling on October 1st. “We’re winning because we have lots of talent within our team not because we are playing well,” mentioned Olsen. “We will get back to the same quality of play that we had at the beginning of the season.”
The Pioneers next game is away against Nyack University on October 18th, followed by another East Conference game away against Queens University on October 22nd.

It looked as if the Pioneers winning streak would stay at three games when they were trailing the East Stroudsburg Warriors 23-7 in the second quarter of their game on Saturday, October 15th, but the Pioneers found a way to overcome those odds. After trailing by 16, the Pioneers found a way to score 24 unanswered points to give them a lead, and the team never looked back, holding on to win 34-30.
A good deal of the credit for the comeback has to go to Steven Laurino; the redshirt freshman quarterback had his best game to date, throwing for 332 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed for an additional 131 yards. Those numbers earned him PSAC Offensive Player of the Week.
The Warriors won the toss and quickly got on the board first, kicking a 43-yard field goal. The Pioneers sputtered on offense, giving the ball back to the dangerous Warriors offense.  Wagner tossed his first of five interceptions of the day when sophomore linebacker Rob Bright picked him off to give the Pioneers back the ball.  Steven Laurino and the offense took advantage of the interception, driving 30 yards on seven plays to find the end zone, when Laurino found Kyle Hardy to take a 7-3 lead.
The Warriors took the lead back quickly when Wagner found Jordan Hallman for a 73-yard pass. The point after was good to give the lead back to East Stroudsburg 10-7. On the Pioneers’ next possession, they drove down the field and found themselves just one yard away from the end zone, but the Warriors successfully stopped them from scoring, even though the Pioneers had three chances. In what looked to be a big moment of the game, the Warriors had gained the momentum. It was tough for the Pioneers to bounce back from the failed attempts at the time, especially after the Warriors were able to quickly get another touchdown. It took Wagner and the Warriors’ offense just 1:25 to go 99 yards, the big play being a 61 yard pass to Robert Bleiler, who found the end zone.
But, the Warriors weren’t done yet, getting another touchdown from Hallman to increase their lead to 23-7.
Redshirt sophomore Joe Botti was a large part of the Pioneer offense in 2010, but he was limited to just a few plays in the first few games of the 2011 season. But, Botti had a career day against East Stroudsburg, catching 7 passes for 173 yards and two touchdowns.  His first touchdown catch of the day cut the Warriors lead to just 23-14. Jeff Mack made it a one-possession game a moment later, when he rushed it into the end zone to make it a 23-21 game, still in favor of the Warriors.
If Botti’s touchdown catch started to mount momentum on the Pioneers’ side, then when Lou Scala intercepted Wagner with just less than two minutes in the first half, it was fully on their side.  Moments later, Joe Botti made one of the greatest plays of the season, leaping up and catching a 44-yard Hail Mary pass from Laurino. The catch gave the Pioneers a 28-23 lead going into the half, and they never let go.
In the second half, the offences cooled off, and it became a defensive game. The Pioneers managed to add three points to their lead on a Marc Montana field goal, but the Warriors came back to make it a one-point game when Thomas Tippert rushed one yard to find the end zone and bring the score to 31-30.
Montana added another field goal, but before he did, Ciwan McCoy and Lou Scala intercepted Wagner, giving the Warriors’ quarterback five interceptions on the day and wrapping up the 34-30 victory for the Pioneers; their fourth straight after three consecutive losses to start the season.
The Pioneers look to win their fifth straight game on Saturday, when they take on Kutztown for Homecoming at Hickox Field. Coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwp.org will begin at 12:30 p.m., followed by a special alumni broadcast at 1 p.m.

How long have you been playing for the C.W. Post football team?
I have been playing football here at C.W. Post for three years.
What made you choose to come to Post?
I chose to come to Post after I transferred from Pace University after one year because I wanted to be close to home and wanted to play for a winning tradition.
How do you feel about Post now?
I feel Post is the place that I was always meant to be, not only because of the football program but also because of the people who go to school here.
How is campus life here at Post?
Campus life is great here. All [of] the people I interact with every day make the day better, and I could not ask for more.
What lesson(s) will you take from Post?
The biggest lesson I learned from Post is that the obstacles you face during your college years will only make you a better person.
What is the best memory you have with the team?
The best memory I have with the team is the point that we are at now. We are 4-0 right now and looking to win a conference championship and more. The feeling of winning with a team of guys you love outweighs everything.
What do you want to do after you graduate from Post?
When I graduate from Post, I want to eventually teach physical education and coach football at the high school level or, hopefully, even at a college level.
What will you miss the most from Post?
The things that I will miss from Post are the friends that I have made over the years here. They have helped me through the good and bad. I consider these friends I made family, and family lasts forever.
After being named to the Concensus Draft Services Preseason All-American team in August, C.W. Post outside linebacker Ronnie Modik is having a standout season for the Pioneers’ football team.  Leading the team in total tackles, with 66, and forced fumbles, with two, he was named both ECAC and PSAC East Defensive Player of the Week in September. He is third on the team in tackles for loss and had one interception for 60 yards against California University of Pennsylvania. The Pioneers are back in action this Saturday, October 22nd, for their annual Homecoming game against Kutztown University at 1 p.m.

The biggest ones are time management and public speaking.
What is the best memory you have with the team?

Last weekend on Sunday, October 16th, veteran television cameraman, Jan Kasoff spoke at C.W. Post’s Hillwood Cinema about his 26-year career at Saturday Night Live. Presented on behalf of the Long Island Radio & TV Historical Society, and WCWP Radio, the two-hour presentation was a special insight into the life of a man who was behind the scenes on one of television’s most popular shows. Next to the stage where he spoke, was a display table filled with photographs of Jan’s long career, and an actual Emmy Award that Jan won for his camera work.
The presentation started with an anecdote about the inception of Saturday Night Live, in which the show’s creator Lorne Michaels pleaded with network executives at NBC to give his live show a chance. When NBC finally agreed to air the show, their studios in L.A. were unavailable, so it was decided that the show would be done in Studio 8H at New York City’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
Jan showed two video clips, in which the screen was separated into seven sections showing the various perspectives of each cameraman, and of the directors in the control room. Also shown was a view of what was appearing on live television. Throughout
the duration of the clips, audio cues given by directors coordinate cuts from camera to camera, essentially editing the program in real time as the events unfold. One clip in particular highlighted Christopher Walken, in a skit known as the Continental, where the actor interacts directly with the camera. Known as a subjective camera, this filming technique makes the camera appear as if it was another actor.
Jan also reminisced about how the camera crew and the cast of SNL all socialized together in the commissary in 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and being fed by NBC at all hours to keep the show’s employees close by incase they were needed. One time he even taped
an impromptu performance by Paul McCartney and the cast as they performed Beatles songs for two hours.
Jan has also done work covering the Olympic games, the Watergate Hearings; Meet the Press, NBC Nightly News, Major League Baseball, the Nation Football League, MSNBC, soap operas, game shows, and TV specials. (Online Source) (www.towson. edu/emf/docs/kasoffBio.pdf)
Jan is the recipient of six Primetime Emmy Awards for Saturday Night Live as well as two Emmy’s for his camera work at the Olympics.

On October 3rd, at 12:30, in Room 119 of Humanities Hall, C.W. Post was graced with the presence of a man with a very unique calling in life. The honors program and merit fellowship hosted a special lecture with John Hare, a British explorer and the founder of The Wild Camel Protection Foundation, who has spent the better part of the last two decades traveling deserts in Mongolia and China in order to study the wild camel.
 
These camels are extremely endangered creatures, and, accordingly, find themselves under continued threat because illegal miners invade their sanctuary in pursuit of gold.
Though the sanctuary has rangers that can, theoretically, fend off these miners, there are only about 30 rangers employed to cover an area around the size of Texas. The miners left 74 empty and seven full drums of potassium cyanide at their mining site, which is the only site in the entire desert with fresh water.  It poisoned the water, killing off many of the wild camels.  The miners also shot the wild camels for food.
 
Wild camels differ from regular camels in that they have two humps, which remain small, even after the camels drink, and they have a different, flat skull structure. In his lecture, John Hare explained that this rare species of camels survives on salt water with a higher salt concentration than seawater and live in an area that has been used for dozens of nuclear tests, yet they have still managed to survive.
 
When asked what he would like to share with the C.W. Post community, John Hare said, “The camel is a remarkable survivor and is under threat. Although it isn’t cute and cuddly, it is remarkable.” And, although John Hare speaks to over 130 schools in England alone, he felt that the C.W. Post audience was a very good and interested audience in comparison to other student bodies.
 
At the event, John Hare was selling books and camelhair products, like scarves and socks, for the benefit of the camel population. If anyone in the C.W. Post community is interested in contributing to the efforts to protect the wild camel species or in buying the aforementioned products, he or she may go to www.wildcamels.com for more information or to become a donating member of The Wild Camel Protection Foundation.

To the Editor:
 
Due to some particularily boorish behavior by her former “boyfriend” and the opinions of several “guy friends” Alex Parker has concluded that men in general it would seem, desire a wife who is a “perfect housewife and mother.” To Parker, this means that men want a stay at home wife who cook, cleans, and takes care of the children. She thinks such an idea is “primitive…and quite unrealistic.” However, one wonders how many children who grew up with a stay at home instead of being shipped off to daycare every morning found the experience either archaic or barbaric. It is also unclear how such an undertaking is, in any way, “unrealistic.”
 
Does Parker mean to say there has never been a ‘real’ stay at home mom? Or, perhaps she is saying that for a woman to stay at home to raise children is so difficult as to be impossible to achieve in reality?
The thought that men assist with childrearing in any way is inconcievable to Parker. Indeed, men are slothful, presumptuous creatures who expect “to come home from work and [find] dinner ready, kick their shoes off, open a beer, and watch t.v.”
 
Apparently, for Parker, applying the June Cleaver stereotype of a “perfect housewife and mother” to women is unrealistic while applying the Homer Simpson one to men is fair game.

Can the Tennis team play without a court, can the swimmers compete without a pool? The elimination of the track demonstrates yet again that we are not supported or acknowledged for the strides we make throughout our competitive seasons.
According to the September 28th issue of the Pioneer, Dr.Forestell states that “With more than 400 student-athletes, who excel not only on the field but in the classroom, we recognized the need to upgrade some of our athletic facilities.” In response to Dr. Forestell, you are not only upgrading, but in fact eliminating the track in your plans. It is evident that in your “recognition” for modernizing the facility, you are demonstrating that you not only have a lack of respect towards the elite running program at C.W. Post which makes up a portion of the 400 student-athletes that you have mentioned, but a great imbalance of support demonstrated in comparison to other varsity teams.
As a member of the Cross-country team from 2007 through 2010, I have greatly benefited from the track which surrounds Hickox Field. I value the facilities, staff, and services of C.W. Post which has made me so proud to say that I represented the Pioneers. Removing the field is like taking away a piece of history which has once graced Post with its presence. I do not support the new stadium plans. As ?Post-Pioneers? we represent a school of innovators and pacesetters. Before moving forward, we must recall our history. My past includes four years representing the Cross-Country and Track programs which benefit from the track that is expected to be eliminated. I am truly disappointed and contest the proposed stadium.
Thank you!
Erin Lusenskas, ’10

Dear Editors,
 
My name is Philip Degaltini Jr. I am a fifth year senior here at C.W. Post and there is something about the pioneer that I have noticed over my five years here that I wanted to address. The Pioneer is supposed to be the voice of the students, and I think that you are both doing a very thorough job this year of making this paper an outlet for students to share their opinions. Unfortunately, I don’t see myself and my community represented much within the paper. The relationship column, for example, is very heavily set on gender roles and very seldom, if ever, does it talk about homosexual relationships. I believe there should be a balance. Yes, a relationship article about heterosexual relationships will reach a wide audience, but those of us in the C.W. Post community who do not identify as heterosexual are left out, in a sense. The Pioneer is not reaching out to the people of different sexual orientations or gender identities as much as it could be. I’m no trying to say that anyone is being excluded purposefully, but people are being excluded none the less. When I talk to other students about the tendency of this campus to exclude those who identify as Third Gender, Transgender, Genderqueer, etc, they tell me that they were unaware that there are students who identify as such. Gender identity is not something everyone wheres on their sleeve. You may know a Genderqueer student or a Transgender student and not even know it. You may be sitting next to someone in your Poli Sci class who identifies as Third Gender. You might see an extremely masculine guy or a very feminine girl and not know that they are homosexual. I speak for the Queer Community here at post when I say, I think that with your help we can make Post a much more Gender-neutral environment as well as a place for people of all sexuality to feel welcome. The world is not right or left or black and white, and just because you don’t see someone it doesn’t mean they’re no there.
Always.
Philip F. Degaltini Jr.

Dear Editors,
 
I want to take this opportunity to address the Letter to the Editor in the October 5th issue of The Pioneer. As I agree that there may be times student journalists must face the difficulties of getting answers, I feel that it is wrong to generalize and make it seem like this is an all-around problem with the entire administration.
 
Are there times that administrators will refuse to answer a question? Yes. Are there times that the school will demand something to be banned from being published? Yes.
 
However, let it not be forgotten that there are a plethora of administrators on this campus that are more than willing to cooperate with staff members of The Pioneer. I have very limited experience writing for The Pioneer, but every time I have approached a staff member or administrator, they have ALWAYS been more than happy to help. So, the campus administration does indeed realize the importance of our First Amendment rights. I think it is completely unfair to categorize the entire “campus administration” as being insensitive to the student newspaper’s right to free speech. If they all felt the need to hide under the rule that says they are not authorized to speak with us, then nobody would ever get quotes for their articles. If anything, the rule is just a cop-out excuse because the majority of the time the administrator WILL comment on whatever questions the reporter may have.
 
Additionally, it should be looked at how the reporter goes about approaching the situation. Are they polite and appreciative to receive cooperation from somebody who holds an important title within our institution? Or do they act disgruntled and annoyed if they don’t get the answer that they want? Are they unbiased in their approach, attempting to get all sides of the story? Or are they disrespectful by attempting to ridicule the person in charge of something that they don’t like?
 
Anybody who has studied Political Science understands the importance of the First Amendment, but if you are well-educated on the subject matter, you will understand that “the people” are limited to this freedom. If we had full range of the First Amendment, then the FCC wouldn’t fine a radio disc jockey for cursing over the airwaves. Porno would be on cable television. And there would be no witch hunt for the founder of WikiLeaks.
 
We must all come to the realization that every institution is a bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy is going to hold the power and do what it pleases. If an administrator is told by a higher administrator that they shouldn’t have said something, then it is going to happen. If there is information that is deemed questionable, as in “Do we really want this published in the school newspaper?”, then of course they are going to have it pulled.
 
This is just the way it is. You can complain about it and hope it may change. But in my opinion, our campus administration has been more than helpful in answering questions and responding to the concerns of the student body and I think its wrong to generalize the entire campus administration into a category of people that don’t like to cooperate.
 
I will also add two more thing. The conclusion of “Racial Survey” was generalized.  I do not think the opinion of the writer should constitute the overall opinion of the student body. There were only a few quotes from Rita Langdon and one quote from a student who identifies themselves as Hispanic or Latino. Nowhere were there any quotes that could depict the overall feeling of the student body about the racial survey. To conclude by saying “Still, others didn’t take it because the answers were unacceptable to them.” I am curious to know whether this staff writer conducted her own survey to see what students found it unacceptable, what students don’t ever use their MyLIU due to the “many times there are problems” , and what students felt it was just too long. I’d be interested in hearing about the sample size of her survey.
 
Now, to the relationship column. Unacceptable. No quotes from men or other women on the subject matter. We have a pattern of generalization here. Apparently, our entire campus administration doesn’t want to cooperate with student journalists. Our entire student body hates using their MyLIU accounts because there’s always problems with it. And now all men want to have a 1950s housewife and drink beer when they come home from work.
 
This is not me and I don’t appreciate being put in this category.

Attention all you Pretty Little Liars fans, it’s Wednesday, October 19 and if you’re anything like me, you’ve been awaiting this day since August 30, when the first half of season two came to an end. For the past year, the ABC Family show has kept us on the edge of our seats as we’re dying to know who the heck A is! Well tonight, we may come one step closer to the mystery.
The Halloween special of PLL is sure to leave is with more burning questions by time it ends and the fact that we have to wait until January 13 to see the second half of the season doesn’t help the case. What makes waiting for the special so nerve racking? This prequel shows us what happened before Alison Diluents went missing. That’s right, we actually get an episode where Ally’s alive for the whole episode and doesn’t just appear in flashbacks.
What about Emily, Aria, Spencer and Hanna you might be wondering? We see them as they were before the mysterious disappeared of miss DiLaurentis! Spoiler, get ready to see ‘Hefty Hanna’ back in action, Aria pre Mr. Fitz with her pink hair, Spencer being Spencer, and Emily, when she actually liked boys. Rumor even has it that Ally will be telling a twisted “scary story” about twins to a bunch of little kids and if this doesn’t make sense, then you must not have researched the books where the plot of what really happened to Ally involves an evil twin and a sinister plan, but shhhh, I’ll let you read the novels for those juicy details!
With Halloween just weeks away, it was nice that ABC would torture us err reward us with the holiday themed special if I do say so myself. My only problem is after watching the episode, I’m going to want more and waiting two months just isn’t going to cut it! What am I going to do in the mean time? I guess I’ll just have to ready the books to get my fix of my favorite Rosewood miscreants! But what am I going to do without my hot men of Rosewood each week on my television screen? There’s always season one on DVD!
So my fellow PLL fans, will you be watching the Halloween special tonight? I know I will and with much glee. But remember, someone’s watching you, and they know what you’re doing, so you better behave…A.
Watch the Halloween special of Pretty Little Liars tonight at 8pm on ABC Family.

Anniversaries can be spent a multitude of ways with your spouse. If you’re more of a low-key couple it might just be a movie-on-demand kind of night where you sit on the couch and cuddle up together. If you’re feeling a little more lavish, perhaps you go to a nice dinner. But how often are couples celebrating these anniversaries?
In my experience, my boyfriend and I only celebrated our yearly anniversaries. We would usually just go out to eat and maybe see a movie, nothing over the top. What I just can’t wrap my head around are the couples who seem to be celebrating their anniversary once a week. I can even hear it in my head, “Oh my God babe, we’ve been together for three weeks! Where’s my present?”
Seriously? I know those are the couples that are in the honeymoon phase and are still spewing sunshine and rainbows about each other. But realistically speaking, that’s just plain silly. Maybe I can understand celebrating your six-month anniversary because let’s face it, if you’re with a person for six months, chances are you’re going to be together to see the one-year mark. Just like we’ve become serial tweeters and facebookers, members of our generation seem to have become serial daters as well.
If you’re so surprised that you’ve made it two, three, or four months as a couple, chances are you shouldn’t be together. Then of course there are the gifts; it’s your anniversary so of course you exchange gifts, right? Well, what in the world do you buy for someone who you’ve only been together with for a few weeks? I used to have trouble with the yearly anniversary gifts, let almost buying something once a month.  (A small aside note on that, doesn’t that get awfully expensive?)
Anniversaries should be that one special day a year that you and your significant other get to do whatever it is that you want. I find it a little superfluous to have twelve or more anniversaries per year. I know all you new couples are bursting at the seams with love but, take it down a notch; you may find yourselves broke at the end of the first year.

What makes a high school student truly prepared for college?  In fact, what does it mean to be “prepared” for college? Is it being equipped to write papers, or take tests?  Maybe it is being ready to manage your time appropriately; perhaps it is a combination of all of these ideas.  Regardless, students have expressed a variety of different opinions when asked the question of whether high school prepared them enough for college.  In a poll of 57 students at C.W. Post, 27 students said they felt academically prepared while the remaining 30 students said they were not.  Surprisingly, the results were almost even, but why?
There may be numerous reasons as to why students do, or don’t feel prepared for college.  For students like Junior Childhood Education major, Vivian Espinosa, her school fulfilled its duties.  “High school prepared me for college with all the drama and workload” said Espinosa.  Similarly, senior Adolescence Education major, Jessica Pawloski, said, “Yes, I believe high school truly prepared me for college. I believe high school prepares the students who take advanced or college level classes, because it prepares them for the academic challenges they will encounter in their college years.  Some students who do not take accelerated courses simply have a difficult time adjusting in college.”
Pawloski raises a valid point; many students who do not take advanced placement classes may be at a disadvantage compared with those who do.  It is possible that non-AP courses do not challenge students enough to their reach their full potential.  Many students take AP courses in their junior and senior years.  However, while there are those who take advantage of their final high school years, there are those who do the minimum amount of work and end up with a severe case of senioritis.   Freshman Radiology major, Kristine Soto, said “I can say that high school partially prepared me for college.  The levels of work are practically the same but when it comes down to projects, it’s different not being constantly reminded of due dates.”  Soto expresses a common challenge that students face when making the transition from high school to college which is being guided by a syllabus rather than having the teacher making continuual reminders of when your assignments are to be completed..   This may be one of several issues that high schools could improve on in order to prepare their future college students.
In addition, it is no secret that teachers across the nation are being forced to prepare students for standardized tests.  Although proven ineffective, teachers spew out facts and information and expect students to memorize and regurgitate the material for the purpose of passing the mandated tests.  This issue could be one of the many reasons why some students feel a lack of readiness for college.  Instead of encouraging students to become life-long learners, teachers may be discouraging academic growth by emphasizing the wrong practices.  If a student spends their entire academic career repeating the same pattern of simply memorizing information and then erasing it from their minds the second they hand in their test, how is that preparing them for college?  There is no doubt that there are more than just a few reasons why students may not feel prepared for college.  It is certainly an issue that must be looked into deeply in order for the incoming freshman to have an easier transition.  A little over half of the students that were surveyed claimed that they did not feel academically prepared for college; this is an unsatisfying statistic that cannot be blamed on one sole person or reason.

I find it hard sometimes to concentrate on the road when something else needs to be done. Take, for example, my hair and make-up, which I always do before I leave the house, but there are those times when I run out and say to myself, “I’ll just do it in the car.”  Sound familiar?
And by that I mean putting on make-up while I drive, which surprisingly, I’m pretty good at.  One day my mother saw me driving while I was not paying attention to the road, and she showed me an article about a woman who plowed into a tree while putting on her make-up. She died as a result of putting on some mascara before work. This got me a little scared at first, but the fear does not end there.
A few months ago my friend, we’ll name her “Ashley,” and her boyfriend “Dave,” were spending time at Ashley’s house until the time was 4:00 am. Dave was ready to drive home, which was a good half-hour away.  Ashley asked him to stay and sleep over because he was tired; yet Dave declined and drove. That night, Dave drove into a tree because he fell asleep at the wheel. Dave was lucky and walked away with a few bruises, a busted car, and an educational story.
But it’s not only putting on makeup that can lead to stories like these.  The other honorable mention I’ll make is texting while driving. Not only is this illegal, but ridiculously dangerous.  Hundreds {[I’d think thousands, is that an estimate?]} of accidents have been reported, that were caused by texting while driving, because in order to text, you need to stop watching the road and look at your phone. The funny thing that I found while researching texting while driving is that although most states have made it illegal, in some states, such as Missouri and Vermont,  people can text and drive, but they have to be over the age of 18.  On the other hand, some states have even made GPS usage illegal. {[Explain that.  Why? What states?]}
Driving can be a scary thing, when you really think about it.  Therefore, it’s vital for us, the next generation, to make a statement against these pesky – and potentially deadly – disturbances. It’s important that if you are intoxicated or tired, you should make the decision to get a ride home from somebody else you can trust. Texting can wait until you are not driving,  or if it’s really important, pull over. Reading maps, the same thing, pull over if there is any confusion. I should have woken up earlier to do my make-up or found a bathroom to do it in once I arrived at school. But is our generation in such a rush that we need to be constantly doing something? Maybe, but think about it and I’ll let you decide for yourselves. Safe driving to all and I’ll see you next week.

With two games remaining in regular season play, the C.W. Post women’s field hockey team will compete in its last home game of the season against Millersville University at Hickox Field on Wednesday, October 19th, before heading to first-ranked Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania just two days later. Both games will be a challenge for the team, as Bloomsburg University remains undefeated for the season, and Millersville University handed the Pioneers a momentum-crushing upset loss earlier in the season by a score of one to nothing.  In this week’s National Field Hockey Coaches Association poll, the women’s field hockey team was ranked seventh, with a record of eight wins and four losses, but it is expected to drop down a spot or two as a result of two consecutive losses to West Chester University of Pennsylvania on October 11th, and Kutztown University of Pennsylvania on senior day, October 15th.
In 14 games, sophomore forward Carlee Dragon leads the team, and all of Division II, in scoring with 18 goals in addition to a team-high six assists on the season. Senior forward Helene Bruckner and graduate student midfielder Bethany Semlear combine for another 17 goals and 11 assists on the season.  In goal, senior Devon Trenkle is a driving force behind the team, with 71 saves on the season and boasting a save percentage of .724.
The Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Tournament begins on October 25th, and with a record of three wins and five losses in conference play, the team will need to do well in the next two games if they have any hope to advance to postseason.
