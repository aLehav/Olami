Senior criminal justice major Mia Vetri said that she was served undercooked steak at Winnick Dining Hall on Wednesday, Jan. 31.
Vetri did not immediately contact a supervisor or staff on duty, but went to the Aramark office in Hillwood Commons the next morning with a photo she had taken of the undercooked meat. Vetri is still waiting for Aramark to get back to her regarding the incident.
Vetri posted a photo of the raw meat she was served at Winnick on her own personal Facebook page. Under the post Vetri wrote, “So this is the shit my school tries to feed us. Over $50,000 a year for THIS? We should be getting gourmet meals! First there’s mold in the drink machine now raw bloodied meat?! LIU Post do better! We are forced to pay for Winnick, forced to pay to basically play the guessing game on whether we will get sick or not. This is unacceptable!”
Students and alumni responded to Vetri’s Facebook post. “It’s not the first time I’ve heard stories about the food at Winnick, but how long can they continue serving food like that? Totally unacceptable and I hope LIU Post does better considering how much dormers pay,” Charlie Moerler, alumnus, class of 2016, wrote.
Vetri threw the under cooked steak in the garbage and does not plan to eat meat at Winnick for the remainder of her last semester at Post. “I probably won’t eat anything at Winnick besides the salads. For actual food, I’ll probably stick to Hillwood or off campus foods,” Vetri said.
Student complaints about Winnick are not new. As the Pioneer reported in “Cleanliness of Winnick Dining Hall,” a student found mold in the bottom of her cup. Promptly after the publication of the article on Nov. 29, Aramark made changes at the Winnick dining hall.
On Oct. 17, 2017, Isabelle Ruten, a junior musical theatre major, sent an email to Edward Taraskewich, Aramark’s Resident District Manager, regarding undercooked chicken at Winnick Dining Hall, along with photos of her raw chicken. Justin Poly, Aramark’s food service director, replied to Rutens. “After further review it was Chicken Teriyaki thighs. This protein appears different than chicken breast when it’s cooked – so I can see the appearance might throw people off,” he wrote. Poly attached the daily temperature log that Aramark uses to ensure that food is cooked properly to his response to Rutens. “As you can see from Ed and myself’s reaction – serving undercooked food is a big wrong in the kitchen and we work to rectify it immediately…” Poly added.
Poly did not respond to the Pioneer’s email. Instead, the Pioneer received a reply from an Aramark district manager regarding the matter.
According to an email sent by Simone Harper-Register, district manager for Aramark, “We take all customer concerns about food quality very seriously, and investigate every concern that is brought to our attention. We learned about this concern through social media posts but the product was not brought to a manager or staff member so we cannot validate it.”
Harper-Register wrote that Aramark had served over 185 portions of meat on the evening of Jan. 31, and did not receive any concerns. She further stated that Aramark had checked the daily menu logs that are kept for every item cooked and served, and found that the meat was cooked to proper temperature specifications.
“We did use [Vetri’s complaint] as a teaching moment with our staff to reinforce our food safety processes and procedures which are industry leading,” she wrote. “We maintain rigid standard operating procedures for the entire flow of food production. This includes providing an environment that protects the safety and integrity of food from its delivery, throughout its storage, preparation, transport, and ultimately, to the point of service to the customer,” Harper-Register said.
Students are encouraged to speak to Aramark staff on duty in Winnick if they have questions, concerns or comments about undercooked food.

Students from multiple colleges across New York traveled to Albany on Feb. 13 to advocate on behalf of the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) and other financial aid programs. The students met with state legislators and shared the significant impacts of state funded programs such as Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and HEOP in their educational and personal journeys. Students represent their colleges every year at HEOP Advocacy Day, with an estimated 700 students attending this year. Although LIU Post students did not attend this year, LIU Post has participated in the HEOP advocacy day in the past.
William Clyde, director of the LIU Post HEOP program, sent an email on Feb. 12 telling students that their voices “can still be heard to add to the reasons why programs like HEOP and TAP require continued legislative support” and urging students to use “the power of social media” to send messages to their legislators “on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.”
EOP provides financial and academic support to those who show promise in excelling in academia but were not offered admission through regular standards for New York universities. HEOP is a support program for New York State residents who are not prepared academically and financially to attend college, but who have a passion and potential to succeed in academia in New York State private colleges and universities. The programs are administered by the New York State Education Department (NYSED), and are valuable for students from low socioeconomic communities. Although programs like these can potentially be removed when the state budget is made, students want to remind lawmakers how grateful they are for the programs.
Stephanie Guardado, a sophomore speech and hearing science major at the University of Buffalo, is an EOP student. Guardado, whose parents are from El Salvador, was born and raised in Hempstead.
Guardado appreciates her experience as an EOP student. “I’m really glad to be a member of the EOP family here at UB. Everyone is united within the organization,” she said. “Because of EOP, I was able to come to Buffalo. Being here a summer before my freshman year was a requirement for students in EOP and I am grateful to have had that experience, it prepared me for the years to come and I learned most of my study skills over the summer,” Guardado said.
Guardado supports those students who advocate for the programs.“It’s an important part of our education journey; many people I know wouldn’t be in college at all without EOP or HEOP,” Guardado said. “I would be really sad if they would to remove an amazing program like this; they would be taking chances for other students to have a chance in the academic journey away,” she said.
Guardado has a message for those in EOP and EOP programs. “Because of EOP and HEOP, we can prove them [the statistics] wrong and we’re lucky to be a part of this amazing program that gives me and many others like this to make our family, friends, and community proud of what we’re doing and who we’ll become in the future,” she said.
Edwin Uben Solis, a junior applied mathematics major at SUNY Stony Brook University, is half Salvadorian and half Guatemalan. Solis, who was also born and raised in Hempstead, graduated at the top of his class from Hempstead High School in 2015. Solis appreciates the support that was given to him as an EOP student.
At Stony Brook, students received a $450 stipend for books and iPads as entering freshmen, which assisted them with their academics. “EOP has helped me academically because of numerous tutors at my disposal. [The iPad] enabled me to do my work anytime and place, which is a blessing because some students are underprivileged enough that they don’t have the luxury to afford technology,” Solis said.
“I would be devastated if EOP were to be removed for others since I know a lot of people who aren’t able to attend college,” he said.
Adam Hornbuckle, a senior political science major at LIU Post, values the support HEOP has given him.
“I cannot say enough about the Higher Education Opportunity Program at LIU Post. HEOP has been my key to the door of opportunity and education. Since arriving at Post in the summer of 2014, much in my life has changed; but one of the few constants has been the support and guidance that the program gives and its director, William Clyde Jr.,” Hornbuckle said.
Clyde, has overseen the HEOP program at Post since 1981 and became director in 1986. He ensures that students are prepared for academic success during the four years of college and provides a strong foundation for many students. “No matter where you are, or where you come from – where you landed in school, if you are EOP or HEOP, you all represent what our program is about,” he said. “LIU made its commitment to the program to continue to advocate for its continuance and funding at current levels,” he said.
Hornbuckle stressed the importance of maintaining the program. “As per its longevity, what I can say is that the program cannot be measured in dollars and cents; rather only in success and accomplishment, in which it is bountiful. If LIU removed the program, it would be more than just a fiscal cut. It would be the revocation of the ever-important bridge between potential and attainment,” he said.
Hornbuckle said HEOP has given him lifelong friends and “unwavering confidence in myself and a hunger for knowledge.”
Jeremiah Aviles, a 2012 Post and HEOP graduate who works as an educator, attended the HEOP Lobby Day when he was a student at Post.
Aviles’s experience in Albany was memorable, seeing a variety of students from different universities coming together, walking into state government offices and advocating for the continuance of the programs.
Being a HEOP student was a blessing for Aviles, since he is the first male son, cousin, and nephew to graduate from college in his family.
“HEOP has opened many doors for me and I would hate to see the program removed from an institution that supposedly cares for our black and brown folks who are labeled as unsuccessful, jobless, poor and so on; it would be devastating, and I would be the first to tell William Clyde Jr. to allow me to be his advocator for such an amazing program,” he said.

Anne Marie Caradonna, who has been Post’s director of admissions operations and career employer relations since Oct. 1, 2014, has relocated to LIU Brooklyn as senior dean at university admissions starting Feb. 1.
Caradonna has been a practicing attorney since she left law school in 1993; in addition, she has worked as an associate for a law firm and then started her own law practice on Aug. 1, 1997. According to William Martinov, chief of admissions and enrollment strategy, she has also been chief operating officer, senior vice president of business affairs, and general counsel for Enright Court Reporting and Enright Sten-Tel Transcription Services from 2007 to 2012. She has been with LIU Post since 2014.
“While working solely at the Post campus, I oversaw the operations of Admissions, engaged in data analysis, strategized, and worked to improve processes. I think that it’s been through the efforts of the entire Admissions team, along with all who work with Admissions—LIU Promise, academic affairs and the deans, IT, marketing, enrollment services, everyone—that we’ve seen positive results in the process that begins with finding prospective students who will be a good fit with LIU and working with them to have them apply, become admitted, and ultimately enroll in classes,” Caradonna said.
“She has university wide responsibilities,” Martinov said. “She’s going to do probably more at Brooklyn than here,” he added.
“I began spending a portion of my physical time in Brooklyn in September, and it has been wonderful, with additional opportunities to work more closely and collaborate with the many talented people who are at the Brooklyn campus,” Caradonna said.
Caradonna’s expertise, according to Martinov, will still be important for LIU Post. “Her expertise is going to expand what we’re doing at Brooklyn, and at the same time, she’ll be part of our admissions team across the university,” Martinov said.
Nothing much has changed, according to Martinov. “She worked since about three years ago in admissions, and there’s no quitting. She’s taking a leadership role and she’s going to keep doing what she’s doing while at Brooklyn,” he said.
“I will be emphasizing data analysis, strategy, and working with the Admissions team and others, making processes more efficient and effective,” Caradonna said.
Martinov emphasized the importance of Caradonna’s work for the admissions team. “Our job is to analyze, strategize and maximize the entire [admissions] team effort, so we have recruiters that are visiting high schools, guidance counsellors, etc., and Anne Marie does a fantastic job, helping those who need resources, communications, processing, and software. If we don’t analyze and strategize, we will never be as good as we will be,” Martinov said.
