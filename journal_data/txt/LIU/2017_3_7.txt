The 2017 Academy Awards, which aired Feb. 26 on ABC, had 32.9 million viewers. Hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, the Oscars awarded actors, actresses, writers, producers and directors for their extraordinary work creating films for audiences of all ages. However; having only 32.9 million viewers signifies a continuing decline in viewership. The decline in Oscar viewership is also visible among the students who had not watched the Oscars and were unable to comment. But for those who did watch the broadcast, they had comments on this year’s show.
For some, the increase of Oscar nominees for black actors and African-American cinema was noteworthy. Gabriella Salvaggi, a sophomore education major, said, “because they got a lot of heat last year for seeming racist, they almost tried to overcompensate, even though many of the actors and movies were more than deserving of the nominations.”
For others, a significant event was the mix-up on the Best Picture honor that was erroneously awarded first “La La Land,” instead of the actual winner, “Moonlight.” “It was interesting,” Rokib Morad, a junior math major, said. “When they were going to announce Best Picture. It was a bit of a shock that they made a mistake like Miss America and Steve Harvey.”
And still others, like Tyler McGarvey, a senior biology major, found Jimmy Kimmel to be a commendable host. “I thought that Jimmy Kimmel was a very funny host,” he said. Note-able also to McGarvey was that “‘La La Land’ got so many nominations.”
The sparsity of comments from LIU Post students supports evidence of the lack of a wider audience among younger viewers and Americans in general. In addition, the absence of familiarity with many of the nominated films seems to be part of why the Oscars aren’t seen as imperative to view. While Jimmy Kimmel and
the Best Picture mix-up are unforgettable, it seems that many young students have started to lose interest in the Oscars.

Being a student requires time to attend class, do homework, and study. Additionally, some students need to find time, not only for themselves, but for a significant other. Finding the balance between school and a relationship is something couples learn to work around.
Sophomore business administration major Samantha Mullins balances her schedule with that of her boyfriend, Chris McBride, a senior football player with a major in finance, who will stay for a fith year to complete his master’s. “I definitely have full days,” Mullins said. “I work two jobs, am currently taking 19 credits, and I’m heavily involved on campus.” Mullins is a sister in the Delta Zeta sorority, works for the student run businesses and with the College of Management, recruiting potential business students and mentoring high school students.
McBride’s schedule is also full. “His football schedule is something else. Football does wear the guys out. I try to be as understanding as possible about all that,” Mullins said. Though they are both busy, each of them live on campus, allowing them to make time to see one another during the weekends or nights when they each have less to do. The two are able to help each other academically, providing benefits to spending time together. However, living on campus challenges the relationship due to, “everyone knowing everything about our lives,” according to Mullins. Also, once breaks from school come, the two live 1800 miles apart. After having the opportunity to see one another every day, an adjustment has to be made when Mullins returns to Texas and McBride to New Jersey. “The distance is hard but we make it work. I’m able to fly up to Jersey and he’s been able to come to Texas with me in the past.”
Some students balance long- distance relationships during the school year with heavy workloads and demanding majors. Mary Cate Bottenus, a sophomore dance major, met her significant other, Sean Dillon, on campus in fall 2015. Dillon, who graduated in spring 2016, lives in Staten Island, while Bottenus resides on campus. “My major requires my schedule to be open seven days a week for class and rehearsals,” Bottenus said. Last year, before Dillon graduated, the couple was able to see each other after late-night rehearsals and on weekends. The distance makes it difficult for weekend trips because Bottenus needs to stay on campus Friday through Sunday for rehearsals.
Though the couple is unable to spend time together as often as they’d like, they keep in contact as much as possible through texting and FaceTime calls. “Having class during the day and rehearsals at night makes afternoons the only available time I have to talk to him. Unfortunately, that’s the same time he works.” The two work through it by scheduling weekends in advance that they can visit each other.
Relationships are beneficial factor” to life, Bottenus said, which is why she and Dillon work through the distance. For Mullins and McBride, residing in the same place still requires time apart. “As much as Chris is a priority in my life, he also realizes that by doing all the things [I do], I keep building up my resume which would allow for a better future,” Mullins said.
Life as a student can be difficult to balance, and having a relationship is an added task that needs to be worked into scheduling. If the relationship includes mutual understanding of each other’s academic priorities, then it will likely not jeopardized by the time apart.

General Colin Powell, a retired four-star general, former national security advisor to the former president George W. Bush and a New York Native, spoke to a crowded audience at the Tilles Center Thursday evening, March 2. Powell started by expressing how lucky he was to be in his position of speaking to today’s youth, and that things can change very quickly. “Just imagine that you are the number one diplomat in the world the Secretary of State of the United States of America; and the next day, you ain’t,” Powell said.
Powell admitted that once he was no longer Secretary of State, he was a bit depressed and needed to fill a void in his life. His advice for older men and women who are going through a depressive period in life? “Buy a corvette,” he joked. Even though Powell is no longer Secretary of State, or National Security Advisor to the president, he still maintains his interest in world politics. Most of all, he focuses on his passion for inspiring and teaching younger people. The Harlem native spoke about his difficulties in getting into a military school because of the color of his skin. He told the crowd of a few hundred people about how important immigrants are to the success of America. Powell had two immigrant parents who were poor but despite their economic troubles, made the best of their life here in America.
Powell understood the concerns of today’s teenagers, worried about the economic and political climate that they live in. Powell’s response to these concerns brought the crowd to cheers and applause: “Don’t ever under estimate America. We have resiliency in our DNA,” he said. Powell did not hold any punches when it came to criticizing the current members of Congress. “Congress can’t do what the founding fathers did in less than three months,” Powell said.
Senior psychology major Abi Sawyer was impressed by the former General. “I was honestly unsure of what to expect,” she said. “He is a very relatable and knowledgeable man, managing to recount his successes and failures in a humble and humorous fashion,” Sawyer said. Sawyer is an international student from England, and has “similar views as Powell”. “He shows passion and optimism for the future, which is encouraging for people,” Sawyer said.
In addition to his career in politics, the retired general enjoys his free time at home with his wife, and is interested in businesses located in Silicon Valley.
This lecture was the introduction of Congressman Steve Israel’s Global LIU Initiative at LIU Post.

The Macho Foundation is sponsoring a Volley for M.A.C.HO or Volleyball For a Cause on Wednesday, March 22 at the Pratt Recreation Gymnasium from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
The entry fee is $10 per person, with five to seven players per team. There will be free t-shirts for the first 50 players, along with dinner for everyone. This will be the second annual Volley for a Cause for the foundation, and the money raised will be used for MACHO scholarships and MACHO rewards.
The Macho Foundation is a non-for profit organization that was founded by Cary Epstein, a professor at LIU post that has taught in substance abuse, human sexuality and nutrition classes in the department of health and physical education. Epstein’s brother, sister and mother created this foundation after Scott Epstein, his father, died in a tragic car accident in 2013. Macho means My Actions Can Affect Others, created due to Epstein’s stage wrestling name, Macho.
Scott was a counselor at Coleman Country Day Camp in Merrick, NY. As a huge WWE fan, he would dress up and engage in jello fights for the kids. The kids grew to love him so much that the camp kept inviting him back; this lasted around 20 years. “It became this fun thing, and the kids looked forward to it, and my father took this macho character that he created and eventually made it so much more,” Epstein said.
Eventually his father and the kids grew to love Macho Man so much, he would dress up the whole summer as Macho Man. “It took on its own life, the camp changed his name tag, and instead of saying Scoot it said Macho,” Epstein said.
The word macho eventually turned into a new meaning. When a child at camp asked Scott what it meant, he responded, “It means my actions can help others and that is how I live my life and that is how you should live yours.”
Cary Epstein described his father as a man who put other people before himself; he was the epitome of kindness. So Scott began to not only be Macho and a camp counselor, but a man who inspired kids to be the best person that they could possibly be. “My father started to be a hero to thousands of kids and parents at camp. So much that when he passed away in 2013, there were around 900 people at his funeral service, with a recurring message that your father changed my life.”
“The foundation has been going on for years way before 2013, but there wasn’t a name to it, it was just my dad being himself and spreading kindness. But now it is our goal and mission as a family to leave behind the legacy that he left for us,” Epstein said.
The Macho Man logo is Scott Epstein as a cartoon, so he travels with the foundation as much as the family does. The foundation travels to schools mostly on Long Island. They put together assemblies that aim to teach kids kindness and not just to think with the brain, but to think with the heart as well.
Cary does all the motivational speaking. Cary, the oldest of the siblings, is the face of the foundation.
“This isn’t an anti-bully thing. It has nothing to do with bullying. It is all the things that you can do and things you should do. Not all the things you shouldn’t do. Kids are taught in school ‘don’t do that, don’t do this,’ which is important, but the Macho Foundation focuses on what you should be doing,” Epstein said.
As a non-profit organization, they are not allowed to collect money, so the money that comes in goes right back out to the community. The foundation receives money from the schools they speak at, and with that money, provide for the kids who can’t afford to go to day camp. They also have created Macho scholarships and the Macho rewards program.
The rewards program is for kids who aren’t the most athletic and best scholars in the school, but are just good overall kids. Through the program, any school can recognize any student, teacher, staff and faculty with a Macho reward for being a good person. The winners of the rewards program most importantly get recognition, and they also receive a plaque from the foundation.
Cary Epstein wants the foundation to be nationally recognized in the future. He compared his dream for this foundation with the Make a Wish foundation and Polar Bear Plunge, and he hopes that this foundation turns into his full time job.
For more information about The M.A.C.H.O Foundation, visit themachofoundation.org or search for theMACHOfoundation on Facebook and Instagram, and on Twitter at @wearemacho.
If you would you like to recognize someone for being MACHO you can email the foundation at themachofoundation@gmail.com

The nineteenth ranked Pioneer men’s lacrosse team defeated twentieth ranked Molloy 11-4 during their first conference match-up of the season on March 4 in Brookville.
The Lions started off strong, immediately scoring the first point of the game within the first two minutes of the game, but a goal by sophomore attack man/mid fielder Frank Ranfone near the end of the first quarter tied the game. The Pioneers were able to prevent the Lions from scoring during the second quarter while also adding two more points on board to give them a two-point lead going into the half. They continued to dominate the entire second half, scoring eight more points to give them a seven-point win over Molloy.
A young Pioneer offense started to click during Saturday’s frigid game, outscoring the Lions in three of the four quarters, scoring five of their 11 points in the final quarter of the game. Ranfone continued to score for the Pioneers, tallying three goals and one assist to bring his season point total to 17 points. Junior attack man Chris Trasacco recorded a game-high five points with two goals and three assists. Junior mid fielder Dylan Harned contributed two goals with one assist to bring his season point total to 18. Sophomore mid fielder Steven Frank made both of his attempts at the goal to add two points for the home team.
The veteran Pioneer defense held strong against a quick Molloy offense. Senior defenseman Ryan Stern led the Pioneers, picking up four ground balls and causing three turnovers. Junior mid fielder Kris Alvarado and Senior defense man both collected two ground balls while senior goalie Matthew Liantonio recorded a game high 11 saves for the Pioneers. Sophomore mid fielder Connor Farrell collected five ground balls and won 11 of 17 face-offs.
The Pioneers now hold an overall record of 3-3 this season and are 1-0 in the East Coast Conference. They will return to action March 11 when they host Chestnut College at 11 am.

Junior track and field and cross country runner Talya Williams may be one of the busiest student-athletes on campus. She just capped off her indoor track season with a personal record in the mile at the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championships with a time of 4:59.47, just two-hundredths of a second away from breaking LIU Post’s record. To qualify for this meet, which is a Division I meet, Williams won the mile at the East Coast Conference Championships with a time of 5:02.81, her personal best until she improved again a week later at the ECAC Championships.
Williams never really stops running. She spends her summers preparing for the cross country season that starts in the fall, and then spends the fall competing. After cross country ends, she dives right into the indoor track season, which runs right into the outdoor track season. On top of all of this, she has to balance school, in which she is enrolled in 24 credit hours this semester, and an internship at Nassau Task: an alternative to incarceration for people struggling with substance abuse.
She starts her day, every day, around 6 a.m. with practice and training, and then heads straight to Nassau Task where she works 21 hours per week. From there, she heads straight back to campus for class at five. Oh, and during her free time she also works at the Pratt Recreation Center.
“I start everything early because I do have a lot,” Williams said. “When I get an assignment, and this doesn’t happen every time, but I do try to start it early. Just do a little bit at a time.”
Williams is enrolled in the dual degree program for criminal justice, which she thought was going to take five years to complete, but it turns out that she’ll be able to complete it in four. This means after this year, she will only have one more year left at Post.
“I feel like I just got here,” Williams said. “I still don’t know what I want to do, and that’s kind of crazy because I only have one more year.”
Growing up in Schenectady, NY, Williams fell in love with competitive running at an early age. Both of her parents ran track when they were in high school, and Williams wanted to follow in her mother’s footsteps. “I always used to watch the track team and the cross country team practice,” Williams explained. “That’s what my mom did, so in 7th grade I tried it and I’ve been doing it ever since.”
When Williams first came to LIU Post in the fall of 2014, she had no idea that she would become the runner she is today. With her parents separated at an early age, she split her time between her mother who lives in upstate New York, and her father who lives in Georgia. Williams felt she could not perform to the best of her ability in high school because her personal life made it difficult to put in the time and focus. “I wasn’t that fast coming out of high school, “ Williams said. “When I got to college, I felt like anything I could do in college would be better than high school.”
During her three-year athletic career at Post, Williams has pushed past her own expectations in all three sports. She has competed in the mile at the ECAC Championships twice, and she won the 5,000 and 1,500 meter run at multiple track meets for outdoor track. In cross country, her favorite sport of the three, she qualified for the NCAA Championships her very first year at Post. She has been able to significantly improve her times in every event that she runs in. For example, it took her more than 19 minutes to run the 5k for cross country when she was in high school, but now she is consistently running the same event in 18 minutes, something she says she never thought she would be able to do.
“The way my coach coaches us, it feels easy to run that fast now,” Williams said, referring to current head coach of all three running teams, Kevin Buckley.
Coach Buckley told the Pioneer earlier in the season that his runners train hard throughout the season, but it’s important to give them a small break before big meets, especially since many of them, including Williams, run multiple events.
Indoor and outdoor track were re-introduced to Post in 2014, and since then, the program has seen three different head coaches. Robert Morris, the first head coach who recruited Williams, left the program after her first cross country season in 2014, leaving the men’s and women’s running teams without a head coach as they prepared for the indoor track and field season. “Everyone was just all over the place doing their own thing, so I wasn’t really happy with the program when it first started,” Williams explained.
In Feb. 2015, Pat Slevin was appointed as the new head coach, but also left Post after the 2015 cross country season. This year, Kevin Buckley took over for all of the running programs, and it seems that the program is finally starting to come together. Williams is impressed by the time and effort Buckley has been putting into building the program at Post.
Williams and the rest of the outdoor track and field team will start their season March 25 at the St. Joseph’s Spring Opener in Patchogue, NY.
