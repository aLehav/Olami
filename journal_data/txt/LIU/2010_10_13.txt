This fall season the Student Health and Counseling Center is offering flu shots for all C.W. Post students 18 and over. The vaccinations have been available since October 1st and will continue for as long as supplies last. Students must fill out a release and proof of age to receive the 12 dollar shot.
“We’re charging what we pay. We don’t make any money,” explained Bill Milford, the Director of Student Health and Counseling. “Our objective is to make sure the students who want it can get it.”
The true flu season spans from November to February, but the Health Center is getting a jump on the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with health risks get the flu vaccine in October. All healthy citizens are urged to get it in November.
The Health Center will conduct a traveling flu shot clinic in early November. The clinic will visit the Winnick Student Center and Hillwood Commons during Common Hour to give the injections.
Students who are squeamish around needles are in luck. There is a variation of the syringe that pushes the vaccination through the skin using carbon dioxide. “It’s not like a booster shot where it hurts afterwards” said Nurse Sylvia Barton. She went on to add, “You’re going to feel something or there’s something wrong with your neurological system.” According to the waiver, the side effects to the flu shot are “tenderness at the site of injection, fever, chills, headaches or muscular aches.”
The Center will begin Flu Prevention week on October 25th. Later this month, the Center will have a depression screening on October 7th, Alcohol Awareness Day on the 12th and Domestic Violence Prevention Day on the 19th.
Along with the flu shot, the Health Center provides the C.W. Post community with primary medical care, a gynecologist, free counseling sessions, nutritional guidance and much more. Also offered is blood testing for all sexually transmitted diseases. “If you’re sexually active, you should know where you stand,” Barton said.
The Student Health and Counseling Center is located in room 154 of the Life Science Building and is open from 8am to 8pm during the semester.

It was the day before school started and Riggs lawn had a sea of students in attendance bopping and swaying to the sounds of popular hits like “California Girls” and “Teach me how to Dougie,” as it does every year. The familiar aroma of barbequed hotdogs, hamburgers, and chicken filled the air. There were games, and the turntables were under complete control, but not by the face many returning students were so use to seeing at their annual Welcome Back barbeque. Instead of a swagged-out broadcasting major who was known for her sneaker collection, there was a guy now best known for his outspoken personality and for never going without one of his 100 baseball caps. He made jokes with the crowd, gave shout outs and kept the campus event alive with his commentary and quick thinking. He wasn’t a broadcasting major, either – but instead was pursuing a degree in pre-medicine and computer science as well as maintaining a full-ride cross-country scholarship. This sophomore DJ trying to make a name for himself at C.W. Post was David Johnson (initials DJ), and his birth name perfectly reflected his spinning name: DJRUNNA. It was almost like he was born to do this.
“He’s very talented and a sight to see on the turntables,” said sophomore Jasmine Williams, who has heard DJ at clubs off-campus where he originally started to get noticed. Eighteen-year-old DJ, Brooklyn native and now Queens inhabitant is the new talk on the street in terms of the DJ world at Post. Before attending Post, he’d been DJing for five years and said he found his love for mixing music in a surprising way. Although he had a DJing cousin, he was never sure how to take the next step until the opportunity presented itself. Across the street from his high school he practically moved into the DJ Store iDJNow, where they sold professional sound and lighting equipment, microphones, and turntables. “I literally spent all day in there from once school ended, until they closed around nine, just experimenting with mixes and talking to the employees,” DJ reminisces about the store where he still works part time. Eventually, his growing dedication was noticed and he was given a job at 13. He didn’t think that from this hobby he would have invested over $10,000 in his own equipment, but over the course of his time there he did.
Since DJing was something he believed was more of a pastime for him, he started practicing by volunteering to spin for free at Sweet 16’s and weddings before he realized that he needed more excitement in his work. “I needed a more hype crowd. I felt like I could control the pulse of the party,” he said. His go-getter personality and appetite for action brought him to DJing more in city clubs after playing in smaller locations. “Promoters heard me play and gave me the opportunity to go to bigger venues,” DJ said. He has this personality on the microphone that makes people want to come back to the club or event to see him DJ again. Now along with DJing for Post, you might find him at clubs like Webster Hall, Promenade, Mink, Taboo, Tobago, and Amazura. “I’ve DJ’d at pretty much every club in Queens and a good amount of Manhattan clubs,” DJ said.
He was first attracted to the DJing position at Post last year because of the then already known campus DJ, Simone Clark-Robinson or DJSWhit. “Simone would see me walking around with my DJ headphones, and saw that I DJ’d. I wanted to know what I could do to be a DJ for Post,” explained DJ.
Still virtually unknown being the ambitious person he was and inquiring more about it, he was given the opportunity to open up for her at the Retro Rave, a campus party in 2009. “Persistence is everything, and I respect people who don’t take no for an answer. I was the same way,” Simone said. “I think everybody deserves a chance.”
The Retro Rave was just the beginning, and soon he was DJing at a few parties here and there, gradually honing scratching skills that he’s now well-known for. Between that and receiving compliments for DJing at off-campus clubs, he was finally given the job because of word of mouth.
From his experience at clubs he’s developed his own DJing style that the Post community can look forward to hearing. “I listen to everything and I play everything. I’ll try anything once to see what the crowd moves to,” he says adamantly, “the downfall of any DJ is playing only what’s on the radio.” After searching his music collection of about two terabytes (250,000 songs) he’ll play whatever the crowd seems to be “vibing” to that day, whether it be Oldies, Techno, or Pop. “You can get the same crowd on two different weekends and they want to hear to completely different things. I feel my crowd out as best as I can,” he says.
DJ’s willingness to experiment to please his party and strong personal marketing skills also helps his recommendations grow. He is a Twitter enthusiast, with around 1,800 followers and an email blast of over 10,000. “I try my best to market myself to everyone. I never want to stick to just one type of music,” he says. In addition to his DJ career, he promotes not only for himself but also for Ontop and Goodfellaz Entertainment with flyers – known prominently throughout the boroughs for renting and selling out clubs wherever they throw parties.
This young DJ may keep himself busy between promoting, DJing, school, work, and track, but he keeps a level head on his shoulders by maintaining a 3.6 GPA. As much as his skills and fan base have grown since he started DJing, he still insists that he’s here for school and that being a DJ is a part of him that he shows from time to time. “I just want to have fun and give the people a good time. It’s not a life-long thing…more like where it takes me,” he said. “If I happen to get on the radio, I’m going to run with it.”
For now all he’d like is to become respected through his music and eventually become the number one DJ on campus with improvement, welcomed competition, and requests, like his predecessor. “You have to show them something better than me if the people are so use to me,” said Simone, who started off with a simple radio show on WCWP and said she never expected to become the campus DJ. “At the end of the day, it’s up to the students to choose what DJ they want to provide music for their events.”

Social Network opened in theaters worldwide this past Friday, bringing in $23 million at the box office. The movie stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, the inventor of Facebook. The history of Facebook and how it all began is brilliantly played out in Social Network. Depicting the addictiveness of the website, it makes one question how Facebook affects college students on this very campus.
“I use it to keep in touch with family and friends,” said Britta Naro, junior Criminal Justice major. Like Britta, some students simply use the network to stay close with relatives, while others use Facebook just to do something and stay awake during class. “If you go to class and fall asleep, the teacher would know,” stated Kimberly Matos, a freshmen Psychology major. “So instead, I just go on my blackberry and use Facebook.”
There are over five million college students who have a Facebook page. On average, a person will check their page at least six times a day. So what is it that makes this social network so addictive? Why does everyone have their own profile and why do people feel the need to be on it?
One possible answer is our generation. Nowadays, people need to be in contact with someone at all times; whether it’s on the phone, texting, talking or emailing someone. We live in a very fast-paced world where people are constantly on the go. It’s easy to get bored after 10 seconds of staring into space, so we often resort to technology to bridge that gap of nothingness.
You get home from having class all day, you turn on your computer, what’s the first website (if it’s not already your homepage) you type into that search box? Guarantee you it is Facebook.com. You’re sitting in class and the professor starts lecturing again about something uninteresting and you get bored, so you go on your blackberry or iphone and click on that little white and blue application: Facebook.
But let’s stop and think about what life was like before Facebook was even invented. About six years ago, there was no such thing as a “status,” you couldn’t “friend someone,” and you couldn’t “tag your friends” in pictures you put online. What did people do?
It’s hard to think about. It makes you consider your friends and whom you know now. If you hadn’t “friended” that guy in your western civilization class, would you still be friends with him today? Or, if you hadn’t posted the picture of your friend funneling a beer, would she still be on the volleyball team?
Looking back on it, Facebook has affected our lives in more ways than we may think. Sometimes they’re positive affects and other times they’re rather negative. Either way, Facebook will still be there, whether it’s your friend or not.
The Facebook Craze
Facebook Challenge
How addicted are you? Try staying off Facebook for a week, we dare you! Email us about your experience and get published in the Pioneer. Stay tuned for next issue to see a follow-up article.

Issue Three of The Pioneer is not only an accomplishment for our new and improved staff, but a huge achievement for those continuing to follow our new nutritional guide to a healthier life style. By now, we should have figured out how to pick and choose what is and isn’t healthy and how to fit a workout routine into our hectic schedules.
Unfortunately, now that the Fall season has finally settled in, the cold weather seems to damper our ambition to work out and eat healthy. We are all undeniably tempted by the luxury of cozy comfort food, and the warmth of our beds (which is only properly appreciated with a bag of chocolate and movies!) We lose the desire to get up and work out, and the thought of a cold plate of fruit and vegetables no longer seems refreshing. Especially now that tank tops and short shorts are no longer part of our daily attire, we layer up in oversized sweaters and sweatpants that not only keep us warm, but encourage us to indulge in unhealthy food and avoid the gym, right?
What this week’s guide will inform you is that there are ways to fight the temptation of lazy days, and encourage you to stay moving and motivated.
Music is motivation: It is known that workout routines at the gym can become a bit monotonous; the same environment, the same machines, the same 20-30 minutes on that boring treadmill –the thought of just running in the same spot for that amount of time seems more dreadful than exciting. However, the motivation of a good playlist is essential to an exceptional work out. Each time you go work out, try to put together a different mix of fast and upbeat songs that keep you motivated. Also, for those of you going for a long period of time, choose songs that set and change your pace –alternating fast and slow tempos, matching songs to the type of workout you want to engage in.
Jackie Warner, celebrity trainer and star of Bravo’s Thintervention, agrees that the number-one way to get motivated is through the music you choose on your playlist. In an interview on Shape.com, Warner shares one of her favorite and most current playlist that she suggests we all try:
• California Girls, Katy Perry
• Bulletproof, La Roux
• Acapella, Kelis and David Guetta
• Rock that Body, Black Eyed Peas
• Te Amo, Rihanna
• Not Afraid, Eminem
• Empire State of Mind, Jay-Z and
Alicia Keys
• Sex on Fire, Kings of Leon
• Womanizer, Britney Spears
If you have a different taste of music, Shape.com conveniently put together a selection of playlists to suite every type of regime. “From running and walking to biking and boxing, we have the best beats to take your routine to the next level. Get ready to rock your workout!”

For those of you who still can’t figure out how to eat healthy, here are some easy rules that will lay the groundwork for a lifetime of healthy eating.
– Don’t get crazy with calorie counting, just aim for fat free and low fat foods.
– Make sure to be eating three meals a day, plus two small snacks to stay full.
– Craving sweets? Have a cup of herbal tea and a piece of fruit first, then reassess.
– Cut out distractions while you eat! Pay attention to the food you’re consuming, and enjoy each bite. Those who watch TV, go on the internet, or do work while eating, are more likely to over-eat.
– Protein, protein, protein! The best thing to put in your body (besides water) is lean protein: fish, eggs, chicken and beans. Having one serving per meal will lower your appetite and keep you fuller longer.
– Whatever you do, cut out sugar and carbs past 8 PM! As the day comes to an end, we become less active and our metabolism starts slowing down. If you aregoing to have carbs, have them earlier in the day, allowing your body to have time to break them down and store them properly.
– Avoid wasted calories; forgo the unnecessary. Cut out what has no nutritional value such as ketchup, alcohol, soda, etc.
– Go ahead, treat yourself to a cheat day! Nobody is perfect and we are all going to have those lazy chocolate days. Try to aim for six days of healthy eating, and allow yourself ONE day where you eat what you deprived yourself of all week. Splurge and feel good about it, then just get back on track the next day.
Snack Right! Sally Sampson, the author of 100-Calories Snack Cookbook, shares some appealing low calorie snacks that satisfy both salty and sugary cravings that do NO harm to your healthy regime.
So before you go and spend your last dollar on a quick fix Snickers Bar, try out one of these recommended snacks that are both easy and delicious:
– 3/4 cup mango tossed with lime juice and red pepper flakes (86 calories)
– 1 sheet of graham crackers spread with jam (80 calories)
– 1/2 cup of strawberries dipped in microwaved sugar free chocolate chips (100 calories)
– 1/2 large pink grapefruit sprinkled with 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar (70 calories)
– 1 large hard boiled egg, sliced and sprinkled with salt or nutmeg (80 calories)
– 3 ounces deli turkey spread with 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard and rolled in 2 Romaine lettuce leaves (90 calories)
– 1 cup of Campbell’s Select Harvest Light Soup Roasted Chicken (80 calories)

3. Now for 20-seconds, sprint at 7.5 MPH.
4. For the next minute go back to your jogging.
5. Do steps 3 and 4 two more times and you will notice that you are at the 14 minute mark.
6. For 3 minutes jog at 5 MPH.

Most college students have consumed alcohol before the age of 21, which is the legal age to order and/or purchase alcohol in the United States. However, adolescents under the age of 21 have sought to object to this law since it began in 1984. Today, students and administrators have even formed a group to challenge itfurther.
In 2008, 135 college presidents joined together to create the Amethyst Initiative to discuss the U.S. drinking laws. Institutions such as Syracuse University, Duke University, Dartmouth College and SUNY College at Purchase are taking part in the cause. The signers of the initiative agree that the legal drinking age is not working. Some say it may even be the reason binge drinking has spread across campuses and has become a part of collegiate culture. Binge drinking is when a person drinks a heavy amount of alcohol with the intention of becoming intoxicated. Unfortunately, in the long run binge drinking can cause multiple health problems for a person.
The initiative also states that alcohol education isn’t working either. Telling students to stay away from alcohol until they are 21 will only tempt them to want to drink before turning the legal age. The initiative calls upon the government to introduce new ways to encourage a person to make smart decisions when drinking alcohol.
Over the years college students have protested the law and have sought to lower the legal age. One of the standard questions in the debate has been: “If an 18 year old can carry a gun and drive a car, why aren’t they considered responsible enough to have a drink?”
Students throughout the country have called on their college presidents and even federal officials to re-think the drinking age. They feel as if we, as mature young adults, can promise not to abuse our drinking privileges. Try lowering the age and if we mess up, then triple the fine. We will learn our lesson.
Lowering the drinking age will make us feel like the adults we really are. If we can promise to be responsible and make smart decisions while consuming alcohol, then lowering the drinking age shouldn’t be a problem.
To be among the first to take a stand in a controversial issue takes courage.
Perhaps it is time for the President of Long Island University to prove that has the courage to represent his students.

In the midst of the 2008 election, the nation was bombarded with so many different kinds of media it was difficult to find simple and clear information on the candidates, and the voting process in general. Those who were well versed in politics were sometimes unwilling to help or in some cases dismissive to those who did not know any better. So this year to avoid confusion, here is an overview of some information on the upcoming election.
This election is known as the midterm election, because it occurs two years into the president’s four-year term. November 2nd, citizens in every state will vote for the senators and representatives of their choice. Most states, 34 out 50, will also vote for their governor.
Here in New York, we will vote a new governor into office, as well as elect senators and representatives. Democrat and New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo will run for governor; Republican Carl Paladino is running against him.
Republican and market research consultant Jay Townsend challenges New York State’s current senator, Chuck Schumer. In the House of Representatives race, 37 seats are available. The House of Representatives is based on state population meaning each state is broken down into sections, and within each section there is a choice of a representative to vote for.
One of the major talking points of this election has been the Tea Party Movement. This group organizes national protests against what it perceives to be wasteful government spending, excessive taxes, and the use of big government.
The Tea Party Movement (TPM) was started by conservative republicans, who promote Christian family values, religious morals, and aim to make government less centralized. This movement also stands in opposition of controversial issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.
This is only a sample of the pre-election political playing field. To understand the political world you have to break it down in a way that makes it more clear to you. Look at a few different sources of media outlets to get the whole picture. The New York Times politics section may be hard to digest if you have little knowledge of politics, but it does not hurt to try. Search the Internet and find some legitimate news sources, then use your newfound knowledge to understand some of the issues of the election.
It will not take a few minutes to grasp this subject. But if you spend an hour reading about it, you will find that politics are not quite as alien as they once seemed.

So, some of you may be noticing the lack of entertainment section in the paper. Well, Loomings is taking a bit of a hiatus. With the merging of the creative arts magazine and Review in addition to the initiative being taken to bring this paper up to a new standard of quality, we here at Loomings have our work cut out for us. We are currently lacking the amount of staff members required to do the work we need done here, and we have decided to take some time off in order to regroup and get things together. We are in serious need to writers and layout people, so any journalism majors, graphic design majors, or hell, just
anyone looking to write reviews, not only of mainstream media but of student art and music, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
We hope to return to the newspaper soon, and better than ever before, as well as release the latest issue of the Loomings magazine, compiling the highlights of student art and literature last year. We here at Loomings appreciate your patience, and hope prospective writers will get in touch with us at:

Dear Editor of the Pioneer:
I would like to take this oppurtunity to express my staunch objection to an MTA fare increases. As a college student, you are trying to do more with less. Now your commute to campus or to your internship is increased? It’s outrageous.
The MTA’s plan includes an average increase of more than 8 percent in ticket and toll prices. Given the ways the MTA has already managed to tax the paychecks of New Yorkers, I find this measure to be completely unacceptable.
Additionally, the MTA will be considering several options regarding the pricing of bus and subway fares. The MTA says that the base fare will remain $2.25. The price of a monthly, unlimited-ride MetroCard is currently $89; the MTA will be looking at various pricing scenarios, including offering a new, limited ride monthly MetroCard at $99 or $104, as well as a more costly unlimited pass. A 7-day MetroCard (unlimited) is now $27, and it could go as high as $38.
When I voted against the $2.2 billion MTA bailout plan and the eregious MTA Payroll Tax in May of 200, I said repeatedly it was an unjust attempt to drive up costs for commuters while doing nothing to reform the wasteful spending of the MTA that has led us to the fare increases now being proposed.
Adding insult to injury, New York State comptroller Thomas DiNapoli reported that MTA overtime costs soared 26 percent between 2005 and 2009. MTA overtime pay rose $468 million to $590 million, during which, 3,200 workers rceived overtime pay equivalent to half their yearly salary. More than 140 workers doubled their salary with overtime work. Overall MTA spending has grown at an average annual rate of 7 percent during the past five years, more than twice the rate of inflation. The MTA’s outstanding debt totals about $27.5 billion, 54 percent higher than it was five years earlier.
It’s clear that the MTA won’t be able to fix these deep-seated problems by throwing more money at them. We must reform the MTA before another dollar is taken from commuters traveling to and from Long Island.
Election Day is just weeks away. Stay informed and cast your vote. College students have the power to make a difference.
Sincerely,
Kemp Hannon
Senator, 6th District – New York

The C.W. Post men’s soccer team has hit stride, winning three in a row including two within their conference.
In their first game last week, the Pioneers beat St. Anselm 1-0 in a tightly contested game the entire way. The only scoring came from freshman back Joakim Ohlson in the 83rd minute. The defense was stellar and freshman goalie Marco Jorgenson recorded a shutout in the win.
On Saturday, the Post had an extremely important in-conference game versus the University of Bridgeport. The Pioneers got off to a fast start when forward William Lindberg struck the back of the net in only the third minute of play. However a few minutes later Bridgeport answered back with a goal by forward Patric Brundin.
After defense dominated the end of the first half, early in the second Lindberg notched his second goal of the game, and his third for the season. Post allowed Bridgeport back in the game when Brundin scored via penalty kick with just over 30 minutes to play and the game tied at two.
The Pioneers would take the lead for good with a goal by ECC Rookie of the Week, Joakim Ohlson, who has scored goals in each of his last four games helping propel the Pioneers during their winning streak.
Bridgeport threatened in the closing seconds but the defense and goal keeper Ed Shone stepped up by not allowing a goal to tie.
This was a big win for the Pioneers whose record now stands at 4-4-1, and 2-0 in the East Coast Conference. The Pioneers next game is Saturday at home versus in-conference rival Dowling College, 5-1-2 (3-0).

The C.W. Post University Men’s and Women’s Cross Country squad were in action this past weekend at the Paul Short Run at Lehigh University in Bethlehem PA.
Graduate student and team captain Vincent Giambanco was the first to finish with a time of 26.43 in the five mile race. Giambanco placed 75th overall in the race of 357 runners. Shortly following Giambanco was sophomore Thomas Speicher who ran a personal best 26.57. Also running a personal best was the Pioneer’s third man was freshman newcomer Joe Lasher who clocked in at 27 minutes even. Closely behind him was sophomore Christian Altarmura with a time of 27.05. Ray Coyle would be the Pioneer’s 5th man crossing the line in 27.31.
Overall the men placed 21st out of 40 teams in the Brown race. “I think it was a good experience to be able to compete in such a competitive meet away from some of the courses we are use to running on,” said Giambanco. “These types of mid season races are a great way for us to get out there and see what we can do against teams we normally wouldn’t compete against.”
The lady Pioneer’s competed in a 6K race (3.75 miles). Crossing the line first was sophomore Caitlin Smith with a personal best time of 25.03, placing her 85th out of 278. Smith’s time also put her just shy of making the C.W. Post Women’s All Time 6K list. Freshman Jenn McLaughlin ran a time of 25.21 with graduate student and team captain Erin Lusenskas right on her heels finishing 10 seconds later. Freshman Karissa Chiantella finished in 25.43 and rounding out the top five for the women was Angelica Price who crossed the line at 26.14.
The women finished 22nd out of 36 teams in the White race. “Overall we had some very solid performances today on what could have been a washout day with the weather” said Coach Rob Morris. “In addition, this is also the time of year where their training is at its toughest point and some of them may feel a little beaten up. But from this point on we typically see a lot of breakout performances.” The Pioneer’s are back in action this up coming weekend when they travel to Orlando, Fl for the Disney Classic Invitational which will be held on October 9th.

In a game that could have gone either way, the Pioneers pulled off a dramatic 39-37 victory against the West Chester Golden Rams of Pennsylvania that ended in triple-overtime.
Ironically the difference in the game would happen to be its first score when Post defensive lineman Lou Scala jumped on a fumble in the end zone recording a safety, good for two points.
The small lead wouldn’t last long before West Chester responded with a touchdown. Golden Rams running back D’Andre Webb found the end zone on a five yard dash to change the score in the Golden Rams favor 7-2 at the end of the first quarter.
The Pioneers marched back down the field and would regain the lead on a 16-yard touchdown pass by quarterback Erik Anderwkavich to junior tight end Andre Davis to put the Pioneers up by the score of 9-7. The Golden Rams responded with a 15 play 72-yard drive down the field that resulted in a touchdown to close out the half.
Post came out strong in the second half driving 76 yards down field. After being halted just four yards from the end zone, Pioneers coach called on kicker Paul Stoltz to kick a 21-yard field goal, that was good, but a personal foul penalty against West Chester would give the Pioneers a second chance at a touchdown, and they took advantage. Freshman running back Anthony Brunetti rushed into the end zone to put Pioneers on top 16-14. West Chester would take a one point lead on a field goal but lost it when Anderwkvaich found Joe Botti for the 14-yard touchdown reception with roughly 10 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.
After an interception by Post line backer Ronnie Modik, the Pioneers attempted to draw out the clock as long as they could until they were forced to punt. The Golden Rams returned the kick to the Post 28 yard line with 55 seconds remaining in the game. The Rams needed just two plays to tie the score when Mike Mattei found Dan Depalma in the end zone before the end of regulation.
The Post Pioneers headed into their first overtime game since 2007 and started it with a drive down field, scoring on a Brunetti run, his second of the game. But unlike the NFL overtime rule of sudden death, college allows each team a possession to score. With that opportunity West Chester capitalized and scored a two-yard touchdown by running back Jackson Fagan to keep the game going.
Defense dominated the second overtime with each team going scoreless. Like the first OT Post scored on a Bruentti run. Coach Collins then decided to go for a two point conversion that connected to give the Pioneers a 39-31 lead.
The Post defense needing a stop allowed a scare when the Golden Rams would score on a pass from Mattei but failed to connect on the two point conversion allowing the Pioneers to walk away victorious
Quarterback Erik Anderwkavich, who has had struggles with turnovers, played flawlessly against the Golden Rams throwing for 250 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, also rushing for 45 yards. Darnel Williams continued to be a favorite target catching seven passes for 94 yards. The Pioneers defense may have let up 37 points, but junior linebacker Billy O’Connor continued to punish offenses recording a team high 15 tackles, Lou Scala and TuQwan Ashley each recorded a sack and Aaron Hall forced a fumble.
The Post Pioneers return home next Saturday when they take on the Millersville Marauders at Hickox Field. Coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com begins at 12:30pm with kickoff at 1pm.
