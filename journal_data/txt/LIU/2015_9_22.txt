Open the door for people! Say “thank you!” Say “hello!”
I believe that we can all implement basic politeness a lot more in our everyday lives. I would hope that many of our parents taught us how to be polite, how to show appreciation, and above all else, not to be rude.
LIU Post has a vast amount of different nationalities and cultures surrounding its grounds, which means there are endless amounts of cultural differences. However, I would go as far to say that there are many universal civilities that we all share, right?
“Please” and “Thank you” are huge for me. I can’t understand how someone could be so arrogant that they feel they don’t have to show appreciation to someone who has just done them a service.
If you are ordering a coffee, is it hard to say, “Please, may I have a coffee?” When the lovely barista serves you a beautifully, warm coffee with the green, infamous mermaid Starbucks logo, do you not say “Thank you?”
If I am waiting in a queue, or line which the Americans like to call it, it infuriates me when I don’t hear simple common courtesy. Not only are you just being polite, but it could make the people who are serving you feel good about themselves, and allow them to embrace the sensation of thankfulness. What else is better than making someone’s day?
Although there are many grumpy attendants, it doesn’t mean you should just be angry and impolite back. Be the “bigger man,” and be different from everyone else who isn’t “practicing,” as Drake would say, the courteous rules of society, which are the first things we learn as a child.
I guess it is different back in England. If I was rude, not appreciative, or bad-mannered, I would get a slap. Now, I am not saying my dad or my mum were versions of Adrian Peterson (the Minnesota Vikings Running Back who slapped a kid after a touchdown). Many kids in England would understand the huge emphasis that is put on the simple qualms of being “nice and polite.”
Opening doors for people or holding a door for someone is massive. It’s one of those things that should be an inherent action, performed on a day-to-day basis. I do it all the time, and it seems that the people that actually say thank you, use a completely surprised tone when saying “Thanks?” Although it looks great for me, I look like a wonderfully, mannered British boy, who has high quality chivalry, but shouldn’t all people do that?
I’m not saying hold the door open for someone when they are 100 yards away. However, waiting two seconds to be courteous enough to act in a gentlemanly manner isn’t hard. Of course, if you are the “open door-ree” then make sure you show the appreciation and say thank you.
If everyone tries just a tiny bit harder to be the difference, and show great and beautiful  kindness and politeness, then campus would be such a better place! Have a go!

A new school merchandise store opened on the lower level of Hillwood Commons on the first day of school. What was formally a student art gallery is now known as “Pioneer Nation.”
The store, which is directly across from Starbucks, has opened its doors for business and is one of five already existing student run businesses on campus.
The store sells mainly LIU Post clothing, but also certain convenience items and food, which are available in a part of the store called the “Pioneer Pantry.” Although there is clothing sold in the bookstore, it differs from the clothing sold at Pioneer Nation.
Tamir Dayya, the LIU Promise Special Projects Coordinator, explained the difference between the two outlets. “The clothing in Pioneer Nation is actually curated and chosen by the students, “ he said.
“It also offers different styles, which are meant to supplement the inventory that is carried in the bookstore. A student may purchase a hat in the bookstore and a complementing shirt at Pioneer Nation.”
Pioneer Nation and the bookstore are intended to serve as compliments to one another, not competitors, according to Davya.
The Barnes & Noble bookstore on campus and Pioneer Nation are not affiliated with each other besides the fact that they lie on the LIU Post grounds.
According to Dayya, Pioneer Nation serves as a student-run business with the profits from Pioneer Nation going back to scholarships and student business growth. The concept of the store, “was generated through the collaboration of students and administrators on the idea of what type of business students could benefit from while increasing school pride and spirit. The result was Pioneer Nation.”
Just by simply looking at the clothing and what is offered in the store, you can get a clear sense that school pride and school spirit is their M.O. The store bleeds green and gold and it’s clear with unique designs and shirts designated for specific sports teams on campus.
Justin Platania, a junior Criminal Justice major who is one of a handful of employees at Pioneer Nation, believes the store has a unique twist. “The designs on the clothing are much more personal and the price points are great,” he said. “It’s a cool way to express the pride you have in your school.”
The store, which is in its first couple weeks of operation, is still receiving inventory and will continue to build their inventory up during different parts of the semester.

When students were welcomed back to campus this semester, they may have noticed something different along the walkways. Numerous banners showcasing notable LIU Post alumni can be seen throughout the campus grounds.
Dubbed the “Alumni Walk,” these banners stretch from Hillwood Commons up to the Winnick House and the bookstore. Each of the 33 banners has the name of an alumnus, their graduating class year, and their current job.
Chief of Strategic Partnership and Vice President for University Advancement, Michael Glickman, said that this idea came about because “LIU is proud of the accomplishments of Post’s strong network of over 125,000 alumni.”
Junior Finance major, Din Djukanovic, was pleased with the school’s decision to display prestigious alumni around campus.
“I think it’s nice to see the school acknowledging alumni and their contribution to Post,” Djukanovic said. “I probably would like to see them put together similar projects like this. Maybe an alumni night? For example, alumni can meet up from different classes in Post to catch up with one another.”
Edward Micone and John Collins are two of the alumni featured on the Alumni Walk. Edward Micone is a producer on the Super Bowl Halftime Show and John Collins is the COO of the National Hockey League.
“Alumni Walk was established to celebrate a selection of notable alumni in a prominent location on campus and was designed to showcase our support for their outstanding achievements,” Glickman said.
The alumni who are currently a part of Alumni Walk are not permanent and will be changed periodically, according to Glickman. “We anticipate that the names displayed will rotate over time and that Alumi Walk will build a new tradition of recognition for some of our most successful graduates,” he said.
Ryan Attard Reilly, the head of the LIU Post alumni relations office, would not comment about the project, and referred inquiries to Kelly Walles, the Associate Director of Public Relations and Social Media.
“Our goal, working in partnership with the LIU Post Alumni Association was to introduce a dedicated place on campus that excludes a sense of pride for current students and serves as a topic of conversation for visitors and friends alike,” Glickman said.
Rita Langdon, head of Campus Operations, would not comment, and referred inquiries to Walles as well, who in turn received responses from Glickman.
As for the financial cost of the project, Glickman said, “Support for Alumni Walk has been generated through our active alumni program, and we will continue to support enhancements across campus.”
The alumni office would not comment about the Alumni Walk and referred inquiries to Walles.

It is going to be yet another busy year for the Tilles Center of Performing Arts. All season long, a different play, concert, or performance is slated to take place right here at LIU Post’s very own performance hall.
On Friday, October 2, the Tilles Center hosts the New York Philharmonic. The following night, EGOT Award-winning Whoopi Goldberg takes the stage. The week after, actress and singer Kπristin Chenoweth appears at the Center’s anniversary gala.
Sharon Maier-Kennelly, the Tilles Center’s new General Manager and Director of Programming Initiatives, described the exciting 2015-2016 season ahead. She was asked about the big events that were upcoming, and among those included the traveling Broadway Theater and the New York Philharmonic, who puts on an annual concert at the performance hall.
It has extremely good acoustics. It amplifies all sound and makes me sound so good” said Cosette Radowicz, who is currently attending LIU Post’s Summer Honors Institute, where she plays the French horn with the Chamber Orchestra.
The Tilles Center boasts a wide variety of shows for people young and old. Their School-Time performances are educational as well as entertaining for children in grades K-12. Stephanie Turner, the Director of Arts Education, is the coordinator of the program.
“She does a really amazing job with putting it together,” Maier-Kennelly said. Some of the programs include Sesame Street Live and The Cat in the Hat for those 8 years and younger, with Macbeth and TAO: Seventeen Samurai intended for those in middle and high school. The performances are viewed as family oriented – fun for the kids and their parents.
Maier-Kennelly also answered the question of which upcoming event she was personally looking forward to the most. “There are a few, but the public doesn’t know about it yet!” she said. “There’s a new film series we have, I’m very excited about that.”
She also mentioned her enthusiasm for the folk & rock oriented concerts that are happening later in the year. However, the event she is most excited for is the Gala with Kristin Chenoweth, happening on Saturday, October 10. “It’s a major fundraising event, but we are also honoring Elliott Sroka, who [retired in July],” she said. “It’s going to be a beautiful night all around.”
All tickets for upcoming shows at the Tilles Center can be purchased on ticketmaster.com and by visiting or calling the Box Office at 516.299.3100.

JobNet was the resource for LIU Post students to access information about on and off campus jobs for many years. This fall semester, LIU Career Connect has replaced JobNet to assist students in finding jobs.
“Student[s] can browse internship[s], as well as part-time and full-time on campus employment opportunities,” said Ali DiBona, Senior Associate Director of LIU Promise.
“This tool allows students and alumni to access job and internship opportunities posted directly by employers looking for LIU students. In addition, students can view and register for career events, build their resume, and access number of helpful and informative career resources.”
All current LIU undergraduate and graduate students automatically have an account on this website. In order to log on to the system, students must use their MyLIU email address and MyLIU password. All relevant information will be imported and can be updated by the student.
“Career connect is a greater expansion of JobNet and it includes many opportunities from various fields that JobNet didn’t include,” said Sharon Sextus, a junior marketing major.
“In my opinion, the user interface of LIU Career Connect is better than JobNet,” said Biomedical Science graduate Joshua Daniel.
“The options are easily accessible and do not need to be searched under categories and subcategories, which was the case in JobNet. The website also looks cooler in the way it is designed and I hope everyone finds the website more user friendly. And as students, we like easy access of content and LIU Career Connect fulfills our requirements at its best and I think my fellow peers would agree with me,” Daniel said.
“LIU decided to purchase a new more comprehensive system,” DiBona said. “Students can view positions, apply online, build and upload their resume, sign up for on campus recruiting, view and RSVP to various events, review career resources, and more. Students also have access to the NACElink Network which is an extended job search beyond LIU.”
Career Connect is very similar to JobNet as it provides students with jobs and internships. Many on campus jobs are already listed in the website for students.
The link for Career Connect is liu-csm.symplicity. com. Students can email post-careersuccess@liu.edu for more information or assistance.

Tuesday, Sept. 22, the radio station held a rooftop party on top of Hillwood Commons, from 12:30 to 2 p.m. WCWP began hosting this event last year, to showcase the campus radio station and its students.
Both Media Arts Department faculty and students helped to put together this party, which was the first event of the semester. “It was a great way to meetBroadcasting majors as well as other students,” said Destiny Diggs, sophomore Broadcasting major. Diggs also added that there was live entertainment.
The entertainment was provided by Nick Tangorra, a Public Relations freshman and his band, The Nick Tangorra Band. In addition to Tangorra’s band, the party had a DJ and food provided by Aramark. Last year, so many students came to the party that they ran out of food and had to order more this year.
Dan Cox, WCWP’s Director of Broadcasting, was primarily responsible for organizing the event. “This year’s event was a little different, because it was also the New Student Meeting for the Communications and Film Department, in order to have them all meet new and existing students,” Cox said.
“Combining the meeting with a social event was great”. The radio station plans to have a second rooftop party in October. “We do these for the entire campus community. We don’t care what your major is, we just want everyone to come together and have a good time at these events!” Cox said.

There are so many great things about going away to college. There’s the opportunity to make new friends, take unique classes, try new things and, of course, be independent. There are so many things to do near campus that there’s no reason to be bored. Students should never feel stuck just because they don’t have a car, because thankfully, there are two shuttles that run off campus.
1. Wheatley Plaza — The Greenvale Loop is the shuttle that picks up students from Hillwood and runs to Whealey, NYIT, and then stops at Moe’s/Wendy’s.
The plaza includes several stores that make it a convenient stop for students. Some of the stores include: Pathmark, Starbucks, Salon Pop, and Wheatley Nails & Beauty. The stop at NYIT makes it convenient for our students to go see a doctor, if necessary.
2. Broadway Mall — The Hicksville Loop is the shuttle that takes residents from campus to the Broadway Mall, and then to the Hicksville LIRR. The shuttle picks up students by Hillwood, as well as by Brookville Hall.
“The best places near campus would have to be in Broadway Mall,” said Francilla Saul, a junior Business Management major.
“You can always take the off-campus shuttle to get there. It has a Panera, my personal favorite, and a Buffalo Wild Wings. Whenever you need to get something quickly or need a break from school, it’s the best place to go for a not so crowded mall trip.”
The mall also includes Macy’s, IKEA, Target, Charlotte Rousse, Forever 21, Hollister, Footlocker, and many, many more!
3. More Eateries — Of course some students have cars or their friends have cars, so there are many places near campus that you can visit yourself.
“Bagel Boss or Kitchen Kabaret are my favorite places because I love food and Bagel Boss is open 24/7, which is awesome and Kitchen Kab has food for everyone,” said Kaycee Zelkovsky, a sophomore Speech Pathology major.
These two places are located roughly 10 minutes away. Bagel Boss is located on Oyster Bay Road in Hicksville and Kitchen Kabaret is on Glen Cove Road.
Grace Illias, a sophomore Health Science major, agrees with Zelkovsky, and said that, “Bagel Boss is an awesome place, because it’s open 24/7, and Shake a Paw is great for stress relief with exams or just random down days.” If you want to stop by and have a relaxing afternoon, Shake a Paw is located on S Broadway in Hicksville.
4. Games Galore — If you’re looking for a fun time out you can call a cab or carpool with your friends to nearby places to relax, eat and play some games.
“Dave & Busters is a great place to hang out and decompress after a long week,” said Giovanna Domingo, a sophomore Accounting major with a minor in Finance. “They have great food, and racing games, skee-ball, and my personal favorite, air hockey.” Dave & Busters is located on Old Country Road in Westbury.
Bounce! is a large trampoline center located on Michael Drive in Syosset, which makes you feel like a kid again. Both Dave & Busters and Bounce! are roughly 20-30 minutes away from campus.
Post is full of fun possibilities that span beyond just the campus itself, so don’t be afraid to venture out, try new foods, play some games, and have a good time!

The Post Foundations class has replaced the former College 101 class in the freshmen core curriculum this past year. The class has new features that differ from the former class.
Post Foundations’ specific learning goals are foundations and skills for lifetime learning, including information literacy, critical thinking, technological competency, and ethical reasoning. The course also includes: learning how to improve study habits, note taking, time management, and the common read.
Dr. John Lutz, Chair of the English Department and one of the coordinators for Post Foundations, explained how Post Foundations was formed.  “It’s a collaborative effort, with academic people in various roles on campus and student life,” Lutz said.
“I co-coordinate Post Foundations with Abagail Van Vlerah (Dean of Students/LIU Promise). We have a committee that works on the curriculum every year. [The curriculum] is launched with what we call the learning committee. It’s a combination of people in various roles as; full-time faculty, Promise coaches, and members of Student Life that teach the course.”
Lutz explained the change of the name from College 101 to Post Foundations, “Last year there was a committee to change the liberal arts curriculum,” he said. “The committee which is comprised of 50 people from various roles on campus discussed the name change. We came up with three possible names amongst us, and the committee voted on Post Foundations.”
The former class, College 101, was a pass/fail class. Now, Post Foundations is a one-credit class.
Andrew Ris, a sophomore Health Science major, is positive about the change from College 101 to Post Foundations. “The change to include the computer competency into the course is good. It kills two birds with one stone.”
“It was an inclusive process to change the course,” Lutz said. “We listened to our students’ feedback that weren’t happy about the [original] name as it had a condescending tone. The name Post Foundations is more suitable and specific to Post, as it’s proposing that these are the foundations at Post to do well. Post Foundations is an extended orientation with an academic focus.”
The new slogan, “Collaboration, experimentation, and innovation” is the one that best describes Post Foundations, according to Lutz.

Professor Willie Hiatt laid injured on Northern Boulevard in Queens, his Vespa-like Yamaha Vino a bit further down the road. It was pretty bad: a broken collarbone, and a fracture in his hand — enough to see the surgery table.
“I thought to myself, this is not worth it,” Hiatt said, thinking that his beloved niece didn’t need him killed in a motorbike accident. So he sold his scooter for $800, and with the money, he bought himself a DSLR camera. “The first really nice camera,” Hiatt pointed out, hinting at the Canon T3i casually placed on the table next to the door.
Hiatt flicked up his laptop, already prepared to show some of his work. ”I have always had an interest in street photography,” he said, describing the genre as taking candid, urban shots. “The spontaneous, unposed type, or street portraits where you interact with people and say: ‘hi, can I take your picture?’ ”
As an associate professor of Latin American History at LIU Post for the past five years, Hiatt doesn’t see himself as a traditional academic. “Actually, I wrote for a student newspaper,” he said. “Then right out of college, I worked as a sports writer.”
His interest in traveling came after studying abroad in France, Germany, and then Costa Rica. The feel for exploring and learning about other parts of the world continued, and soon enough he had found his paradise. “I made a trip to Cuzco, Peru in 2000 while I was still working as a journalist, and fell in love with it,” Hiatt said.
The Peru trip made his life take an unexpected turn. Hiatt left the field of journalism and seized the opportunity to get a Master’s degree in Latin American studies at Tulane University in New Orleans.
“I didn’t plan on being an academic, but once I was out of newspapers, it was just complete freedom,” Hiatt said. “I love the academic environment on campus: I like teaching, I like research, and so I decided to do a PhD,” which he did at the University of California, Davis in 2009.
“He is very alternative, and challenges your views on society,” said Jesper Malmstrom, a senior Finance major. “He preaches for travel and experiencing things to broaden students’ perspectives.”
Hiatt has visited San Miguel, a district in the capital Lima where the working class walks the streets. He explains that the socio-economic level isn’t high, but that’s also what attracts him to this area. “People are struggling financially, but there’s just a real… a real spirit there,” Hiatt said.
He tends to stay away from the touristy affluent district of Miraflores. “I like showing the gritty, poor areas of Lima, and capturing kind of a different side,” Hiatt added. But there are areas when it’s best to be cautious strolling around the streets.
“When I go into downtown Lima, I don’t take my good camera,” Hiatt said. Instead, he snaps discreet shots with his iPhone 6. He explains that even if it’s safe to bring it out, it is important to be wary of your surroundings. “A North American or European going into a neighborhood like that and actually taking pictures of people, it doesn’t feel quite right.”
Even though Hiatt would like for his photos to get published one day, his reasons are more personal than motivated by dollar bills. “For me, part of it is the interaction, getting to know someone,” Hiatt said. “But also just the spontaneity of taking pictures when they aren’t looking. Oddities, and just visually, things that I find interesting: the colors, the textures.”
Hiatt lives in Jackson Heights, Flushing — a diverse neighborhood in Queens with a heavily South Asian population. And then there’s the Sikhs. “They are always willing to pose for photos,” he said with a smile. To his great joy, Hiatt has found a multicultural home, and it seems to be something he likes to create inside the classroom walls, as well.
“He is creating a family feel since he puts effort into learning the students’ names and backgrounds,” said Sheko Gholamreza, a senior Business Management major. “He has a lot of cultural knowledge that he uses when conversing with the students. That makes you feel appreciated and acknowledged as a student.”
 
Peru Travel Course
Professor Hiatt is finalizing the details for his three-credit, study abroad course to Cuzco, Peru, this winter term. It will be the second time he takes students to learn about Andean history, culture and politics, with the main attraction being Machu Picchu — “the ‘lost’ city of the Incas and one of the seven New Wonders of the World (2007),” as Hiatt writes in his brochure.
In the summer of 2014, 24 students participated in the course, which is designed for students who want to experience a historical site and its people, clothing, architecture, streets, cafés, language, markets and food. The class will visit the Inca site as well as museums and archeological parks in the region.
The cost of the two-week trip is an estimated $4,670* — more expensive than last time due to the University decision to no longer swap the tuition part. Hiatt admits this makes the process of enrolling students a tricky one, but he is confident that the trip will be a worthwhile experience for those who decide to sign up.
“If a student was going to take a winter term or summer term course, they would have to spend essentially $3,100 for tuition, and so for another [$1,570] you get two weeks, all expenses paid in Peru,” he said. “That’s still a pretty good deal.”
All students from LIU Post, LIU Brooklyn, and LIU Global are eligible — the recruitment process even stretches itself nationwide. The course may count as HIS 189, HIS 360, HIS 599, or core credit. Enrollment is open until Oct. 10.
For more information about the course, email willie.hiatt@liu.edu.
*$2,522 tuition, $1,148 travel fee, $1,000 airfare

We live in a different world than we lived in 20 years ago.
We no longer have to check CNN to find out what’s going on in the world, we can just check our phone; we don’t even have to watch a baseball game on television anymore, you guessed it, we can check out our phone for that, too.
With that said, the further we advance into the digital age, the less dependent we are on cable television. The luxuries that television once offered us ca n now be harnessed in the palm of our hand. Television is facing a simple but horrifying question: is owning cable television even necessary anymore, and if not, is Netflix a factor in cable television’s demise?
It’s safe to say that we live in a microwave society. If we want to watch something, we watch it now, and that’s what makes Netflix so great. You and I no longer have to wait until every Tuesday to watch
our favorite show. We no longer have to sit through 17 minutes of commercials that we’ve seen a million times before. We can just come home after a long day at school, cuddle up in bed, and watch our favorite show. Heck, if we really want to, we can watch the whole season in about a day! Oh, and did I mention Netflix barely costs a thing?
Tanner Woodley, a senior Economics major, who now lives off campus with two of his friends, said he didn’t even bother buying cable. “If I want to watch my show, I can just Netflix it, no commercials, no hassle, no bills to pay,” Woodley said. “Why pay for hundreds of dollars for 1,974 channels when I only watch six for about five hours a week?”
Woodley said that owning Netflix isn’t the perfect alternative to owning cable television. For example, if you want to watch to football on Sunday, or a live television event, he has to go to his friend’s house back in Queens to watch the particular program. However, it’s a price Woodley is okay with paying.
Not all students feel the same as Woodley. Tamara Covati, a sophomore Education major, prefers television over Netflix largely because of the “live” factor.
“Call me an old lady, but I love just scrolling through the channels, watching live news, seeing what movies are on, I just like it,” Covati, who calls herself a “TV traditionalist,” Covati said. “Netflix is great, but limits you in terms of what you can watch.”
Covati brings up an excellent point. Yes, Netflix is great, but, if you want to watch a live event such as, one of the political debates, or a sporting event, Netflix is of no help to you. Instead, you need to use another medium, whether a streaming app on your computer, or a friend who has cable.
With all that said, if we’re looking at Netflix from the standpoint of living on a budget, and if you only watch television sparingly, then yes, Netflix is the app for you. However, if you’re into watching live programming such as sports, debates, the news, or if you simply enjoy having the luxury of scrolling through the channels, watching whatever grabs your interest, then television is the choice for you.
I think Netflix is a game changer. It enhances the “on demand” feature, and quite frankly, takes it to the next level. For example, I’m a huge fan of Ray Donovan, and if I’m bored on a day that I have no work with some time to spare, then I’ll, for sure, use Netflix.
There is no right opinion to be had in this debate, for it is relative to the desire of the individual, and what they want from an entertainment standpoint. If Netflix can obtain streaming rights for programming found on standard television for a more affordable cost, I have no doubt that Netflix can overtake traditional cable television as the primary medium in which we absorb media and entertainment.

When I was younger, I was given what seemed to be dozens of board games as birthday presents. While a good round of Monopoly was played here and there, I couldn’t keep up with the assembly, let alone make sure I didn’t lose any pieces with my child attention span.
Nearly every time I visited a convenience store with my brother, we’d make sure to swindle our parents into buying a pack or two of Pokemon cards, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and Magic cards. Did we actually play these games? No, very rarely. The appeal was the pretty pictures and just having something of worth to other kids (the one-upping tug-of-war). And you can only play so many games of Monopoly before flipping the board.
Flashforward 10 ten years, my attic and closet are cramped with dusty boxes filled with these damn pieces of cardboard. But right when I’m seriously considering using a flamethrower to clear some space, people have begun to take a new interest in these relics.
I realize how my friends have been wanting to play Pictionary over some beers. I go to a bar and see a whole selection of games to play rather than billiards; a giant Jenga set is one of the main attractions at a party of dozens of people. What’s going on?
My brother comes home from a friend’s house (friends who are in their late 20s) telling me about this little game called, “Settlers of Catan” that they played. It’s a hopelessly addicting one made by fine German engineering, where the focus is to build settlements and collect resources on a fictional island, and a winner is crowned when he/she accumulates ten victory points by various means. His girlfriend joins
in and becomes an unbeatable tyrant (I think she had a 17-win streak, given that each game takes well over an hour). We expand our network of players and soon host parties of over six people just to hang out, play, and have a couple of drinks.
It wasn’t just my personal circle latching on to Settlers, which has been around since 1995. Both Parks and Recreations and Big Bang Theory featured the game on network TV. Some Youtubers rolled out a hilarious parody called, “Settlers of Brooklyn,” a satire of gentrification and hipster-dom in the metropolitan area. And that had me wondering: are these rising trends are symptom of the American Hipster New Wave, the intentional faddy digression from digital back to analog? Cardboard may be the new vinyl of cool collector madness.
But why? These games aren’t just a campy family night choice, but a way for millennials (or anyone) to hang out over a few drinks. There is an undeniable social quality inherent in them, and this apparent resurgence in popularity may be filling the void that video games like Guitar Hero and Mario Party used to occupy. Board and card games are back with a vengeance.
So, I dig through my closet and find a bunch of Magic: the Gathering cards, poorly taken care of. I learn how to play again, on a whim, before finally approaching my brother with a measure of trepidation.
At first he is skeptical because there is certainly a geeky stigma attached to the game, but we’ve already gone down the Catan rabbit hole, why not a new game? We play a round.
Next thing we know, we’re at Target spending a ridiculous amount of money and back into the game, his girlfriend gets tangled in the web. We find a local game store and play a few tournaments.
Just a few weeks ago, we went to a BBQ with some friends and played with everyone there – people who are even more into than game than we are. And these people are normal, one girl studying anthropology, another guy a special education teacher, around eight of us total.
It feels good to go back to my roots, to play a new game that is, in actuality, an old one. These types of games are back, and this time I won’t lose the pieces. What’s in your attic?

Post Theater Company will be beginning its season with Suzan Lori-Parks’ play “Venus.” The play focuses on the true-life story of Saartjie Baartman, known as Venus, who was part of the Hottentot tribe in Africa, which scientists in the early 1800s thought was the missing link between humans and apes.
Being a part of this tribe meant that she had a really big bottom and because of this, she is bought and put on display in a freak show in London, leading her to fame, said Assistant Director of the play, Ben Brinton, a junior Musical Theater major. The play follows her experience from Africa to her death in Paris, in and out of chronological order.
This play has been in the works from as early as last semester. “We had auditions in the spring,” Brinton said. “The director and I have been preparing all summer and we started rehearsing on the third day of classes.”
Brinton said that rehearsals are going great and that working with director Melissa Crespo, who currently works as a director for ABC Television Networks, has been “amazing.” “She is a genius and uses a lot of stuff that is taught in the school to put the show together in a very unique way,” Brinton said.
Oya Bangura, a sophomore Acting and Musical Theater sophomore, will be playing the lead role of Venus. Bangura claims she is very excited to star in this show and she is hoping it will let her grow as an actress. Emily Banks, a junior Musical Theater major, will be playing one of the other lead roles in the play.
Not everything is perfect though; Brinton admits that it’s been hard, particularly for juniors, to get into the swing of rehearsing constantly.
“The junior year in the theater department is the hardest year,” he said. “We are rehearsing five days a week, four hours a day sometimes even eight hours, so trying to handle classes and jump directly into a show at the same time has been a little hard for some.”
When asked what Brinton liked most about working on this show as the assistant director, he stated that he enjoys the artistic freedom that directing gives him.
“I enjoy how you get to make your own parameters really and make the script yours,” he said.
With an extremely busy schedule, Crespo didn’t have much time to sit down and talk about the play but she claims to be extremely content wit directing this play and she can’t wait to see the final result.
Venus will be showing at the Little Theater on Oct. 9 to 11 and on Oct. 15 to 18. All shows will be at 8 p.m. except for Sunday, which will be at 3 p.m.

2015 marks the year of many big releases in the world of music. Some more popular than others, but the year is great for lovers of all sounds. Slayer, a colossus in music and metal, just released their first album since 2009. With Repentless, Slayer shows that they still got what it takes to stay atop the metal-ladder.
The album, running at 41 minutes and change, is classic Slayer.
Opening with a treble-y distorted guitar, plucking an eerie melody, before the intro song goes into a marching band mixed with war drums sound. The marching band-sound is soon dropped in favor of guitarists Kerry King and Gary Holt’s riffs, Paul Bostaph’s relentless drumming and Tom Araya’s iconic shouting. It’s Slayer all right. The title track and single has all the ingredients of the Bay Area. Fast and loud.
As the album progresses, it gets more varied. It pokes into several sounds of their back catalogue, Vices could fit on the heavier God Hates Us All (2001). Slower and tuned down, Vices makes you move some body part. Head bang or the good old rock-foot; it doesn’t matter.
Cast the First Stone has parts that fit around their impressive history. Piano Wire would not be the odd one out on South of Heaven (1988), cold and slow intro, and a blistering fast ending. The whole album has a natural feel to it as each track glides into each other.
Even though they range from fast to slow, Slayer has never been known for a wide range of sounds or variety. This is still the case for Repentless.
You have slow and heavy, fast and ripping, the wild guitar solos, double bass drums, shouting, and some melody. No surprises, nothing new, nothing different. All Slayer.
Their 11th release will please the old hardcore fans of the band, as well as fans of metal music in general. It’s an all over good album that has the best of the genre incorporated in a well sounding package. It’s a hidden “best of album of one of the biggest acts in the world.
Repentless is out now on Nuclear Blast label.

After back-to-back hard fought victories to open up the season, the field hockey team fell short against Pace University on Wednesday, Sept. 16, in a dramatic double-overtime game.
With the match even at one in the second half, freshman forward, Molly Cunha, found the back of the cage off a cross from fellow freshman forward, Emily Miller, to give the Pioneers the 2-1 advantage.
Less than four minutes later though, freshman midfielder, Jane Kasparian, tied the game at two off a redirection in front of the Pioneer goal.
In the 93rd minute, sophomore forward, Margaret Maclean, broke the tie and the hearts of the Pioneers with the walk-off goal. The loss was the first of the season for LIU.
The Green and Gold returned home on Saturday, Sept. 19, and welcomed Merrimack College to Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. The Pioneers got the scoring started in the 28th minute when sophomore defender, Grace Ilias, beat the keeper and broke the scoreless tie.
The Pioneers tacked on another late goal, which doubled their lead and gave them the 2-0 victory, and in the process, junior goal keeper Savanah Cummings recorded her first shutout of the season.
Head Coach Raenee Savin and her squad play their next game today in enemy territory against Assumption College at 4 p.m.

Jason Lampkin, a senior International Business major from Hawardon, North Wales, United Kingdom, serves as a winger for the LIU Post men’s soccer team. Lampkin sparked the Pioneers’ offense by scoring four goals in the first two games of the season. However, injuries have been an ongoing setback for him.
Q: Coming off an impressive run in the NCAA Tournament last year, what are your expectations for this season?
A: Our expectations are to just build on it. We went on to make history in last year’s tournament by making the quarterfinals, so having the freshmen gel with the existing group of players is key, since we lost our top goal scorer, Eivind Austboe, who graduated last year.
Q: How did it feel to earn East Coast Conference player of the week after scoring four goals in your first two games?
A: I really don’t read too much into it. For somebody who’s not really a goal-scorer, four goals was special for me.
Q: How has your injury affected you and your teammates?
A: I’m quite injury prone, so I’ve had my fair share of time dealing with injuries. We were all playing well together, but we have players who are capable of stepping up and filling in.
Q: Is there anything the team can improve on moving forward?
A: More confidence is needed. Sometimes we shy away from the ball and that can affect our confidence.
Q: What was it like growing up in Wales?
A: It’s the complete opposite of New York. There’s more green scenery and landscapes. A lot of things were different. Instead of saying third grade, we called it year three.
Q: What influenced your decision to come to LIU Post?
A: I had some friends from back home who went to school in the states recommend this school and Post ended up giving me the best offer.
Q: When did you first start playing soccer?
A: I started playing soccer when I was eight years old for a local team.
Q: Have you always been a forward?
A: I’m more of a winger. I like to play fast anywhere along the forward line because that’s where I like to be. I avoid playing defense.
Q: What is your favorite part about playing soccer?
A: The feeling you get when you know you played a great game. Nothing can replace that. Our comeback win against Southern New Hampshire University was incredible.
Q: Do you have any plans after graduating?
A: I would like to make the pros, but there are no guarantees with my injuries. My dream is to make my own business.
Q: Who is your favorite athlete?
A: I’d have to say Muhammad Ali for his mindset. Bruce Lee is another one of my favorites. When it comes to soccer, I have to go with Lionel Messi because I love the way he plays and how quick he is.
Q: What is one interesting thing that people might not know about you?
A: My teammates call me European instead of English because my parents are from different countries in Europe. I can speak a few languages.

The no. 18 ranked men’s soccer team played host to Wilmington University on Wednesday, Sept. 16. Even though the Pioneers had the support of their fans in this one, they fell behind on a goal in the 33rd minute. That score held until halftime.
After some physical play, which resulted in multiple yellow cards, the Pioneers got a corner kick and junior forward, Johann Kristjansson, headed a goal passed the keeper. The score held at 1-1 for the remainder of regular time and overtime would be needed.
In that overtime, the Pioneers kept up their physical play and got a free kick in the 98th minute. Senior midfielder, Matias Ruiz, who assisted on the first goal, found himself in a similar position here as he sent a cross to senior midfielder Per Forgaard who had the same result as Kristjansson; a goal off the noggin. The Pioneers took the match by a score of 2-1.
The men’s soccer team returned on Saturday, Sept. 19, to open up East Coast Conference play against NYIT. The offensive struggle between the two sides saw a combined one goal and, luckily for the Pioneers, that one goal came off the foot of freshman midfielder, Charlie Ledula.
Despite winning the game 1-0, the Pioneers were outshot by NYIT, but senior goalkeeper, Jesper Malmstrom, kept the opposition off the board. Andreas Lindberg and his team are back at it today against the University of the District of Columbia. Kickoff from the nation’s capital is set for 2 p.m.

Coming off a weekend where they went .500, the women’s volleyball team wanted to add numbers to the left side of the ledger as they welcomed teams to the Pratt Recreation Center. The Pioneers did exactly that, winning their pair of games easily, only dropping one set in two games.
In their first match against Franklin Pierce University, the Pioneers came out strong and challenged Franklin Pierce.
In the hard fought first set, the Pioneers were able to squeak out the victory 28-26 and take control of the match. They took the next set rather easily before dropping the third set by a score of 25-23.
Smelling the victory, the Pioneers got key kills from senior middle hitter, Melissa Hansen, and senior libero, Rachel Londot, to earn the 25-22 set win, and 3-1 match win.
En route to their win, freshman setter, Genna Giulia totaled 52 assists as well as 14 digs, while Hansen amassed 13 kills to lead the Green and Gold.
The team returned to the court a few hours later to face Holy Family University who was searching for the second win of the year.
The Pioneers, looking to build off their win earlier, completely outplayed Holy Family on all levels and coasted to the 3-0 victory, winning 25-20, 25-9, and 25-13 in their sets.
Junior middle hitter, Taryna McCulloch, totaled a match-high nine kills while sophomore outside hitter, Danielle Valenza, finished one shy of McCulloch with eight kills of her own. In addition to her eight kills, Valenza also had seven digs to add to her stat line. Senior libero, Rachel Ringor, added 11 digs while Londot one-upped her with 12.
The Pioneers and Head Coach Shellane Ogoshi return to the court on Thursday, Sept. 24, when they will be greeted by Molloy College. First serve is scheduled for 6 p.m. from Rockville Centre, N.Y.

For the first time since 2002, the Pioneers (3-0) won the first three games of the season with a 24-21 triumph over Saint Anselm College (1-2) on Saturday, Sept. 19, in a Northeast-10 conference showdown at Grappone Stadium in Manchester, N.H.
Junior quarterback Jeff Kidd had another solid outing in his third start for the Green and Gold. Down 7-3 in the third quarter, the Pioneers used their ground game nicely as they marched down into the red-zone. Kidd then dropped back and fired a 15-yard touchdown pass to red-shirt junior wide receiver Shane Hubbard, which put the visitors ahead 10-7 midway through the third period.
After red-shirt junior defensive back Kareem Folkes picked off Saint Anselm, the Pioneers went on to score again as Kidd staged an impressive 14- play, 76-yard drive to gain a 17-7 advantage heading into the fourth quarter. Red-shirt freshman Malik Pierre crossed the plane for the one-yard score.
As the fourth quarter began, Saint Anselm responded with two touchdowns to regain the lead, 21-17 with under 10 minutes remaining. However, Kidd and the Pioneers offense picked apart the Hawks defense once again. Kidd quickly found Hubbard for a 23-yard score, putting LIU ahead for good.
The Pioneers defense put it in the books as red-shirt senior linebacker Brandon Cheney stripped Saint Anselm’s senior running back Elad Covaliu off the football in the final moments of the contest. Covaliu had a monster day though, rushing for 259 yards and two touchdowns on just 20 carries.
Kidd had another nice showing, finishing 26-45 for 227 yards and two touchdowns. Hubbard had six receptions for 73 yards and caught both of Kidd’s touchdowns. Pierre led the rushing attack with 52 yards and a touchdown.
Red-shirt sophomore defensive back Freddrick McMillan stepped up nicely and led the squad with 13 tackles while Cheney stood out with 10 tackles and two forced fumbles. The Pioneers defense once again stood their ground and forced a late- game turnover to wrap up the victory.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and his LIU Post squad will return home to clash with Stonehill College in a Northeast-10 battle on Saturday, Sept. 26, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m.

Coming off a win against Stonehill College, the women’s soccer team was looking to make it two in a row against Caldwell University.
The Pioneers played incredible defense, allowing two shots, neither of which were on target.
The lone goal of the match came from senior forward, Susanne Vistnes, who scored her fifth goal of the season in the 20th minute of the game. The shutout was the first of the young season for LIU.
The ladies returned home to do battle with NYIT on Saturday, Sept. 19. The first half, which saw very little scoring chances, ended up being a good one for the Pioneers as Vistnes kept up her great play and notched her second goal in as many games, which gave the Pioneers the 1-0 lead.
Looking to increase their lead in the latter half, the Pioneers did so thanks to a pass from freshman forward, Angela Careddu, to sophomore forward, Alex Lynn, who beat the keeper to double the LIU lead.
Two more late goals gave the Pioneers the convincing 4-0 win. Mark Dawson and his team return today to face-off against Wilmington University. Kickoff from Delaware is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.
