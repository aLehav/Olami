Dani Naess Hellesund, the Pioneer’s Opinions Editor for 2014-2015, and before that a Staff Writer, is currently working for the Norwegian Red Cross in Bergen, Norway as a Fundraising Coordinator. “My job is to assist the Fundraising Manager in all of our fundraising activities in this part of Norway,” he writes. “I do miss LIU Post every day, and I still regard my degree in Journalism as one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Having Journalism as a background is very valuable, because you can apply it to almost any job. Good communication skills, reading and writing abilities, as well as a healthy appetite for what’s going on in the world, is very helpful when applying for a job.”  He adds, “Eventually, I might build onto my bachelors in journalism with a masters in political science so that I can work in the field with a big humanitarian organization like the Red Cross. It is not a necessity to have a master’s degree to work in the field, but it gives you an edge in the extremely competitive international aid worker environment.”
