Peter Barell (’16), was the Pioneer’s Arts & Entertainment Editor, and later Managing Editor. Pete has been able to develop and blend his talents and interests in a special way at LIU Post. As a film major, he collaborated and took the lead on many film projects. Writing soon became his main interest, but he was not content to work in the fiction area alone. He sought to develop his skills in both criticism and reporting.
During his junior year, his script was selected to be produced in the year long Production Lab, and in the same year he secured an internship at the prestigious Zeitgeist Films.
Pete has been an incredible asset to the Pioneer for several years. Pete joined the staff of the Pioneer during the fall semester of 2012 as a staff writer, was promoted to Arts and Entertainment Editor in fall 2013, and held that position for two academic years. Pete strengthened the Pioneer’s coverage of the arts on campus and expanded the breadth and quality of the Arts & Entertainment section.
He has subsequently held the position of Editor-at-Large during the fall 2015 semester and Managing Editor during the spring 2016 semester. Pete has been an integral and important part of the Pioneer staff.
