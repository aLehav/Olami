Lee to Phils: Did the Yankees try too hard?
Since the trade dead-line in August of 2010, the New York Yankees were rumored to be on the verge of landing pitcher Cliff Lee from the Seattle Mariners.  However, on a last minute bid the Texas Rangers swooped in and pried Lee away from the Yankees. Of course we all know the rest of the story, Yankees bow out of the ALCS to Cliff Lee and the Rangers. Cliff Lee put together a remarkable postseason, especially against the Yankees, allowing just 13 hits, one walk and two runs while accumulating an astounding 34 strikeouts over 24 innings. Inevitably Cliff Lee became the hottest commodity on the free agent market once the season was over, and everyone knew that the New York Yankees would be the biggest suitors for Lee’s services.
After Lee signed with the Phillies, like a domino effect, the Yankees began running out of options to make the team better. Carl Crawford signed with the Boston Red Sox, Jayson Werth signed with the Washington Nationals and Kerry Wood is back with his former team, the Chicago Cubs. The Yankees’ focus on Lee prevented them from landing one of these big name free agents. The Yankees off-season was not all bad though, they were able to sign closer Rafael Soriano to a 3 year, $35 million dollar deal. Soriano finished last season with a league leading 45 saves, a 1.73 ERA (Earned Run Average) and 57 strike-outs in 62.1 innings pitched. The Yankees are also pursuing some low risk/high reward pitchers on the scrap pile of the free agents list. The team has reportedly been linked to the likes of Freddy Garcia, Jeremy Bonderman, and Justin Duchscherer. All of these pitchers are capable of winning games in the big leagues, however pitching in the American League East will be a test for these pitchers. Garcia had his first healthy season in three years last year posting a 12-6 record with a 4.64 ERA with only 89 strikeouts. Bonderman had a dismal season, going 8-10 with a 5.53 ERA and Duchscherer had anxiety problems, along with two recent shoulder surgeries in Oakland. Garcia looks like the best option statistically, but inconsistency and injuries mar his chances of being a Yankee. Some internal solutions the Yankees could turn to is young righty Ivan Nova, and the veteran Sergio Mitre. Nova made a few spot starts for the Yankees in 2010 going 1-2 with a 4.50 ERA. Mitre, who pitched for the World Champion Florida Marlins in 2003, was predominantly a reliever for the Yankees in 2010 going 0-3 but had a very solid 3.33 ERA in 27 games last season.
If the Yankees want to compete with the Red Sox and the rest of the American League East, it’s all going to come down to how good the younger players can step up this year. It’s going to be difficult but not impossible. So I say to all the Yankee fans out there, have faith because the Yankees still have an All-Star at every position on the field and anything is still possible. The Yankees, however, need to expand their horizons a bit when it comes to free agents because as we all saw with Cliff Lee, money isn’t everything. Some guys may not be awed by Yankee money, and that’s why the Yankees need to resort to their plan B’s and C’s much quicker and not wait on the decision of one guy. Let’s see how the Yankees fare this season without Lee.

Cold weather, snow, potential blizzards; not the time for attending classes right? During the winter session, 44 courses were available at C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University. These courses provided students with the ability to get ahead, or get a jump-start into one’s college career at 1/3 off the tuition rate. These courses provided the opportunity to earn credits in 10 days.
This winter session had a significant increase in the number of students enrolled in the 44 courses available; this past winter session also attracted many visiting students studying at other colleges.
Along with traditional courses in basic drawing and figure painting, The School of Visual and Performing Arts readily accommodated students by providing courses in digital imaging, and Photoshop, as well as graduate digital design. Courses consisting of an introduction to sociology, social institutions, and American visions and critiques were also made available over the winter break. These courses systematically studied the social relationships and behavior occurring in human society. The department of Psychology also offered a variety of courses such as the psychology of humor and the psychology of wild dolphin social behavior in Costa Rica.
Throughout the course of the winter session, courses from the core curriculum were also made available in an effort to fulfill prerequisites in a degree program. These courses included Introduction To Macroeconomics, Economics for Investors, Composition: Argument/Analysis, Western Literature To Renaissance, Western Literature: Enlightenment To Modern, Substance Abuse, American Civilization Since 1877, Elementary Italian 1, Teaching Methodologies, Beginning Philosophy, and Introduction to Political Science.
“The break between the fall semester and the winter session can be viewed as a time to take classes in a short period of time,” Janice Jrasso, an alumnus of the class 1987 said. Although, the winter session included periods of decent weather compared to previous winter session that had to overcome, for example, heavy snow in the between 2009 to 2010. The course work was comparable. “Students have to work just as hard in both semesters,” Jrasso said.
Though signing up for winter courses can have its disadvantages, there is a benefit. Andrew Cordero, a Music Education major, agreed that the smaller and convenient classes offered five days a week allowed students to build close personal relations with their professors, which may enrich students’ ability to grasp the various concepts presented in the courses.
This winter session proved to be a success for various reasons. Statistics showed that 415 students, 28 of which were visiting students, sought to enrich their academic curriculum. These visiting students consisted of individuals from other colleges and universities who may have wanted to delve in other academic programs to satisfy degree program requirements in exchange for transfer credits at their university.
Michael Santoro from Non-Traditional Student Programs discovered that many visiting students were from the University of Delaware, Georgetown University, Syracuse University and Tulane University. The most popular courses were English 8- Western Literature, Criminal Justice 60- Terrorism, Health Education 205- Substance Abuse, Art 31- Ceramics.
In essence, the winter session provided the opportunity for students to fulfill degree requirements at 1/3 the tuition in 10 days. The classes during the winter break not only appealed to the C.W. Post community, but to other universities and colleges as well.

Approximately 86 C.W. Post residential and commuter students reported symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea as of last Thursday January 20. William Milford, Director of Student Health and Counseling informed the Pioneer that the virus is similar to other cases occurring in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and is not a food-borne illness. The incubation period for this illness is one to four days, and the symptoms last for about 24-48 hours.
Senior Marshall Rapson was one of the several students who were taken to the hospital last week. Rapson began feeling sick on Wednesday, January 19 at about 8:00 p.m. He was rushed to Glen Cove hospital at about 1:30 a.m. and was released at about 10:00 a.m.  While he was at the hospital, Rapson was hooked up to I.V. and given anti-nausea pills. Initially, Rapson thought he had eaten something bad at Winnick. When his roommate who ate the same thing showed no sign of illness, Rapson knew this was something more. The illness lasted from Wednesday through Saturday. “I could definitely think of other ways to spend my time,” said Rapson.
Senior Kristyn Horn also went to Glen Cove hospital last Wednesday night. “I was the fifteenth person, eight came after me,” said Horn. They provided a shuttle because there was so many of us that went to the hospital.” Her visit lasted from 5:30 a.m. to about 11:30 a.m. While there, Horn was given the same treatment as Rapson. “At first I thought it was the food,” Horn said. “But now I don’t even know, I guess it’s this virus.”
However, the fight to stay healthy on campus is not over.  Students on campus are still showing symptoms of the virus. Sophomore Ulrika Berg was rushed to the hospital this Friday night with the same sickness. “It sucks, said Berg. “It’s the worst sickness I’ve ever experienced.”
According to the New York State Department of Health and as reported by the Glen Cove Hospital, the illness is thought to be a possible Norwalk-like virus. It is spread by exposure to infected people or contaminated food and water. The virus is passed in stool and vomit. Outbreaks have been linked to sick food handlers, contaminated shellfish, and water contaminated with sewage.
It is generally spread from person to person contact, but some medical reports suggest that the virus can spread through the air during vomiting. The most common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Those infected generally recover in one to two days. No specific treatment is available. Persons who become dehydrated might need to be rehydrated by taking liquids by mouth. Occasionally patients may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous fluids.
Pat Urena, a parent of a student living at Post who has also been sick with similar symptoms is upset with the lack of information. “I think the fact that they’re not informing parents that the kids are getting sick and that there is an actual epidemic going on at the college is misleading,” said Urena. “Most of the information is coming from the media and not the school. A lot of these kids are commuter students and now their families’ health is being compromised because they’re coming home with the virus or whatever it is.”
According to Mary Ellen Laurain, Director of Communications for the Nassau County Department of Health, the NCDOH is doing a complete environmental investigation into the cause of these gastrointestinal symptoms. “We’ve been on campus conducting interviews,” said Laurain. “We’ve been working with both doctors and campus administrators.” The NCDOH will continue to contact various students and staff on campus to determine the source of the illness. The Nassau County Department of Health advises that it will take 10 to 14 days to complete their tests and identify the illness. The University will administer a confidential electronic survey to students, faculty and staff who reported having symptoms of the illness to assist the NCDOH in the determination of the possible cause of the illness. The Pioneer is unaware of any staff or faculty member who has gotten ill.
Since the onset of this illness, C.W. Post has expanded its student Health and Counseling Center hours during the weekend. The infirmary was open both Saturday, January 22 and Sunday, January 23 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The C.W. Post Emergency Medical Service was also available to transport students to nearby hospitals. The Facilities staff also continues to follow the Nassau Country Department of Health guidelines, which include the cleaning and disinfecting of classrooms, common areas, bathrooms, locker rooms, recreational equipment, and residence halls. For further updates, see the “Health Advisory” link on the C.W. Post Student Health and Counseling web site at www.liu.edu/CWPost/StudentLife/Services/SHCC.aspx.

More than a month in advance to the start to the spring sports season, the C.W. Post women’s lacrosse team has begun preparations for the road ahead.  Coming off their fifth consecutive Final Four appearance, the Pioneers are confident about 2011, and reasonably so.
Lacrosse Magazine released its 2010 NCAA Division II Women’s preseason poll last month, nabbing C.W. Post as 3rd in the nation behind last year’s champion, Adelphi, and Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania.  The Pioneers finished their 2010 season with a 16-2 record, falling only to Lock Haven in double-overtime midway through their regular season and Adelphi in the NCAA DII Semifinals.  C.W. Post women’s lacrosse will begin its season March 9th at home against Georgian Court University, and coach Meghan McNamara is already looking forward to an interesting season.
“I think last season was one of our best since ’07,” said McNamara.  The girls just kept coming together and rising to every occasion.  This year, she pointed out, the team is totally new.  With big shoes to fill, she is looking ahead to a great deal of growth and getting to know each other.  “We’re back at ground zero,” she said.  Despite all of the work ahead of them, McNamara is excited for what’s ahead.  “I’m always excited,” she said.  “We have lots of weapons and tools with such a big team.”  And with second-ranked Lock Haven just their 3rd game into the season, this confidence is sure to be tested.
Regardless of the rebuilding and the challenges in the future, the team has one goal that has not changed one bit since last year: make it to the final dance and come out on top.  In the end, no matter how many players were lost or many new players were gained, this may be the only thing necessary to guarantee a successful 2011 season.

Renovations – good or bad?
By East
At their final meeting last semester, the Student Government Association, in tandem with the C.W. Post administration, announced plans to renovate Hillwood Commons during the spring semester. After listening to student suggestions, SGA has promised to make many changes, such as the extension of shuttle bus hours, and it came as no surprise when it announced the big changes coming up next.
We can look forward to seeing a long-awaited Starbucks brought to campus. The Little Shop of Commons will be transformed into a Starbucks, and because there will then be no need for Java City, Subway will take over that area in its entirety. There will be additional seating for sub-lovers, and for some friendly competition, the Grill will also serve hot sandwiches like Chicken Parmesan and meatball heroes.
“These renovations symbolize that student voices are being heard,” said Student Government President Jared Ciborowoski. “I hope that after seeing these, students are encouraged to speak out more often.” Perhaps we might even see more supportive faces at town meetings and the people who have opinions on these renovations or future ones will make themselves known.
The changes don’t stop there, either. Along with the hot sandwiches in the Grill, more registers will be opened to control common hour traffic. In about a week, the TV room, which previously was rather unwelcoming, will be available for programming. It will be completed with a new big screen TV with surround sound, new tiling, retractable seating, and two huge built in windows overlooking the lobby of the building. It seems we can rest assured that the funding for such renovations are not coming from our student budgets either, according to what was said at the last SGA general meeting.
Students can expect to see these changes finalized by the end of this upcoming summer. Graduating seniors appreciate the efforts being made, but like anyone on his or her way out, they wonder why these changes couldn’t have happened sooner. It was almost as if, this year, there were more noticeable changes even though they’re about to leave. “I think the new renovations are great, but it really sucks for the seniors, who don’t get a chance to enjoy them,” says graduating business major, Chantelle James. “As long as they don’t cut the hours and keep things open past 8 pm, we should be fine.”
This school year, we have seen so much being done by our student government, and without having to worry about our tuition being raised, we can accept the changes and enjoy them. Well, those of us who will still be here can enjoy them.
In the long run, when something major is done, it’s done for the benefit of the whole community. Hopefully, future students can appreciate the changes that upperclassmen have worked on.

The Pioneer welcomes you back! Everyone new and old, sick and healthy.  If you haven’t been taken to the hospital yet, congratulations!  Living on campus is starting to feel like living in a bubble of germy madness and I’m finding myself happy to dodge anyone and everyone in the absolute fear of getting that “virus” – isn’t that what they’re saying it is?  I’m glad they’re sending us those emails though; it’s probably better use of their time as opposed to maybe Clorox-ing every square inch of the buildings.  Oh well.  As a senior, I have yet to see an epidemic this bad and truly feel for those who have had to start this bleak semester with it.  Luckily, our News Editor was able to get the full story if you aren’t sick of hearing about it already (pun intended).  Unluckily, hours after writing up the story she got the bug herself.  Sorry Jackie!
We have a large issue of the Pioneer this week.  One reporter has the scoop on the new winter courses that were offered during the break, and how the courses have been surprisingly useful to the student body over the years.  Our brand new Copy Editor discusses the pros and cons of Blackboard- are we really using it?  Our features section is stacked with juicy info on some clubs and organizations here on campus that wanted to reach out to potential new members.  This will be a new section of the paper that focuses on featuring a different club every week; so if any clubs and orgs out there want a shout out don’t hesitate to email us and we’ll get you in contact with a staff reporter!  We also have a New Year, New You collage of Post students and their New Year’s Resolution promises for 2011.
Our opinions section has a new addition as well.  We have a staff writer who will be writing a bi-weekly relationship column; turn to page 23 to see what it’s all about. Our new Opinions Editor covers what’s new with Student Government.  Hint, hint: the best coffee in the world (STARBUCKS!).   Loomings is also back with some movie and music entertainment for you to enjoy.  If you find yourself interested in writing reviews or anything of entertainment value, contact us and we will put you through to our Review Editor!  He is always looking for new ideas and faces.
As always we appreciate you picking up the Pioneer.  We love feedback and/or suggestions so feel free to email us anytime at cwpstpnr@gmail.com.  We are also always looking for people to join our team; you have something you’re interested in? We can try and incorporate you somehow.  It looks great on your resume and you have the opportunity to receive three credits as well! Well, that’s all for this week.  WASH YOUR HANDS!

Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Religion is to do right. It is to love, it is to serve, it is to think, and it is to be humble.” This is the attitude of the Office of Religious Life at C.W. Post. Instead of focusing on one specific religion, the Interfaith Center encourages students to foster deeper understandings of their own religions while gaining an appreciation and respect for other religions.
 
Jeanette Murray, the Community Service Coordinator at the Interfaith Center, discusses the presence of each religion on campus. While Catholicism and Judaism are the most prevalent religions on campus, due to the majority of students being Catholic and Jewish, a Protestant minister recently became involved in bringing Christian life to C.W. Post, due to the majority of students being Catholic and Jewish. There is a Muslim advisor providing to provide support to Muslim students, and a place for them to say their prayers. Although there is no specific Hindu group through the Interfaith Center, there is a Hindu-based club, which was started last semester.
 
Different religious services are offered weekly across the religions, and group activities are held as well. For instance, the Catholic faith group offers ski trips and barbecues, while the Jewish community host’s pizza parties. The Protestant group offers students a chance to do service/mission work. Students interested in Islam are encouraged to come to the Interfaith Center to learn more about the faith.
 
When asked about religion on campus, Zeshan Hamid, the Muslim advisor, said that it is important to the students. Still, Jeanette would love for the Interfaith Center to be used by members of every faith. She would like for more students to stop by the chapel to ask what goes on there and to check out the different faith groups.
 
The website for The Office of Religious Life provides information for meetings times and group events. If ever you feel the need to learn a little about a religious world different from yours, take the opportunity to broaden your horizons. Services like these are available to students for that reason.

Many students do not realize that tucked away at the back of the C.W. Post Campus is the North Shore Equestrian Center.
The Equestrian Center, one of the oldest on Long Island, has been operating for over 40 years. Thanks to the help of professional trainers, all Long Islanders, including C.W. Post students, can learn to horseback ride.
“Anyone can take lessons here,” said Francisca Martinez, an assistant at the center. “No prior training is necessary.”
For those Long Islanders who are lucky enough to own a horse, the Equestrian Center is a place where privately owned horses can live. The Center even has school horses that are kept in a separate barn. They are used for beginners as a way to help build their confidence in riding. All the horses are watched and cared for seven days a week.
The Equestrian Center is open all year round and offers lessons six days a week. Even now, as we battle frigid temperatures, students can take lessons in the indoor arena. However, in those spring months, be sure to enjoy the four outdoor arenas.
Thirty-minute and one hour lessons are offered from early in the morning to late afternoon. All level riders are welcome. For more information on lesson rates and more, contact the North Shore Equestrian Center at 516-626-9714.

After a rough start to their 2010-2011 basketball season, the C.W. Post men’s basketball team has caught fire, winning eight consecutive games to bring their record to 12-6. They are currently undefeated at home this season and have a record of 9-2 in East Coast Conference play.
In the Pioneers most recent game on January 22nd, the team faced the Molloy College Lions. The Pioneers controlled the game right from the onset, leading at the end of the first half 35-20. Post’s solid play then continued into the second half as the Pioneers displayed consistent shooting from everywhere on the floor and played outstanding defense to propel them to a seemingly effortless 75-53 win over the Lions.
C.W. Post junior guard Stefan Bonneau led the game in scoring with an efficient 22 points, as he was 8-12 from the floor, and 4-8 from beyond the arc. Sophomore guard Jonathan Kohler and senior guard Gil Montalvo balanced out the scoring attack for Post as they each had 13 points.
All game long C.W. Post played air-tight defense on Molloy, as the Pioneers forced 18 turnovers and caused the Lions to shoot under 40 percent from the field. Despite only scoring three points, senior forward Aaron Hall dominated the glass as he hauled in 11 rebounds, five of them coming on the offensive end.
On January 19th, C.W. Post went head-to-head with the Bears of NYIT. In this game, the Pioneers burst out of the gate and there was no chance of their offense being slowed down. They shot nearly 60 percent from the field in the first half, providing them with a comfortable 49-30 halftime lead. Post put up the exact same point total in the second half to cruise to an easy 98-72 win.
Stefan Bonneau had another spectacular performance dropping 27 points on 10-14 shooting, and was just as good from three-point range as he was 4-5 from downtown. Aaron Hall also played an excellent game as he put up 19 points on 8-12 shooting while grabbing 10 rebounds for a double-double.
The win versus NYIT was a great win as everybody played a pivotal role and contributed nicely. The Bears had no way to stop the hot shooting of the Pioneers, four of whom finished the game with double-figure points. To top it off, the Pioneers shot a terrific 12-24 from three-point range. When the offense is on like it was versus the Bears, no one can slow down these Pioneers.
C.W. Post’s next game is on Wednesday, January 26th at 7:00 pm against the Saint Thomas Aquinas Spartans. The Spartans are coming off a 72-60 win in their last game which came against Mercy College. The Pioneers will look to improve their winning streak to nine games and stay undefeated at home when they take on the Spartans who are 2-7 on the road this season.

Do you enjoy helping others?  Do you want to become more active in the community? Why not get involved and become a part of Circle K? The club was created in 2008, when Kristin Leverone, now a senior Earth Science Adolescent Education major, had the vision of uniting C.W. Post students with the community through fun and rewarding service activities. “ After being a part of the high school level of Circle K, Key Club, I knew that I had to start a Circle K at C.W. Post so that I could show others how much fun service is and the friendships that can be made,” explains Leverone.
Since its charter two years ago, Circle K has been successful in raising awareness and funds for various charities and organizations. Throughout the school year, students actively participate in raising money and awareness through walks and fundraisers for various causes such as Walk for Autism, Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the Light the Night Walk that supports the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. This past October, members volunteered at the Glen Cove          St. Christopher Ottilie, where they worked with children with special needs, decorating pumpkins and coloring Halloween cards.  Circle K participates in a yearly weekend service trip where students volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House in Pennsylvania.  Throughout the weekend, students cook breakfast and dinner for the families staying at the house.  Later in the day students volunteer at Paxton Ministries, a home for the mentally challenged, where they interact with residents by playing games and cooking lunch.  Some highlights of the weekend are visiting Hershey’s Chocolate World and theme park, while also eating out at Sonic and Dairy Queen.
“ I know that they do a lot off-campus, but I wish they did more on campus,” explains Marissa Santomaso, a junior Public Relations major.  Aside from Bowling For A Cause, done with the commuter Student Association there have not been many programs done on campus.
Being a part of Circle K gives students a unique experience, allowing them the opportunity to complete service projects with other Circle K members on Long Island as well as across the country. Through the Long Island Chapter of Circle K, students attend Gala Ball’s to raise money for Unicef, pediatric kits for ambulances and other foundations.
Circle K’s current president Veronica Mirenda, a senior Marketing major, has been involved with the club from its start in 2008, where she was responsible for the Public Relations. “Circle K has been a great opportunity for me to serve others, meet new people and really network,” explains Mirenda.
Circle K meets every Tuesday at 5 pm at the Interfaith Center. If interested in learning more or attending events contact the club at cwpostcki@gmail.com. New members are always welcome!

Life is ever changing. With that, sometimes we, as individuals, change as well. Most relationships, especially at this stage in our lives, have the same pattern: Things are rosy in the beginning, and along the way, you may encounter problems. Problems are a good thing, as far I’m concerned as long as there is a willingness to be humble and open to new possibilities. Many breakups take place if the same problems persist or if someone isn’t comfortable enough to admit that maybe he or she was in the wrong.
Regardless of the outcome, I think we all should aim to remain amicable and cordial to one another in the event that a separation takes place. This holds even truer if you happened to love someone; the last thing you’d want to do is be at complete odds with him or her. And, what if your counterpart sees things differently? You are now at that proverbial “vulnerable state.” What happens when you reach the realization that the sincere feelings or the genuine care you have for someone goes unnoticed? You see that you are continuing to invest emotions into someone who really couldn’t care less. This is very common when you encounter people who are stubborn.
I spoke to some people who had experienced this issue. Jasmine Williams, a sophomore criminal justice major said, “Once I realized I was the only person who really wanted to make things work, I decided I needed to no longer invest all of those emotions.” A visiting former C.W. Post student, who asked to remain anonymous, also felt that she’d experienced, firsthand, what it’s like to be unappreciated. “My ex ignored all the good things I did for him and constantly focused on the negative,” she admitted, before proudly stating that she had moved onto bigger and better things.  As you can see, there can be a variety of circumstances in which you could feel that “enough is enough,” and that realization can be a harsh one.
There comes a time when you have to let go, which is probably the hardest thing to do. Trying to convince yourself that “you don’t care” is useless. Chances are that if you’re saying that, you probably still do. You have to allow yourself to feel all of the emotions, even the undesirable ones. This process can be a painful one. Usually, there’s a disparity in how you both are feeling about each other. If you are the one feeling hurt by the whole ordeal, you’re probably the one who really wants the best for the other person. It’s confusing, and it’s emotional, but that’s the nature of this beast we call relationships. Understand that your heart is in the right place, and hope that in time, your former partner sees that.
A time comes when you can no longer be a victim of having your feelings hurt. Think of it this way: You don’t keep putting money into a car that continues to have the same problem. Sometimes, if loving someone is wrong, YOU need to do what’s right… what’s right for you. If you keep your intentions pure, the good will always come back to you.

In the new technological age, the ways in which students, and teachers interact is changing. The ipad has also changed how students are using technology on campus. One of the included apps is a Blackboard app. The site is now becoming more popular since the ipad was made available to all students.
Blackboard originally launched in 2004 and is used in over 3,000 colleges and universities all over the world. The site provides teachers with the ability to create a page for a course and upload course content onto that page. Students can then view a syllabus, print notes, or watch videos related to course material.
The site also allows for teachers to communicate with students in various ways. They can post messages to a class, or start a discussion board. Students can respond back to an individual classmate, or the class as a whole.
“I think Blackboard is really useful,” says Junior accounting major Annalisa Crecco “I can get all my class notes and PowerPoints in one place. I can also see if my teachers post any messages to the class, or make any changes.”
Many teachers on campus find Blackboard a useful classroom tool. English professor and WAC coordinator Wendy Ryden uses Blackboard often in her classes.
“Blackboard is a convenient way to make links and files available to students without the hassle of photocopying, but what I really like about the software is that it provides me with ready made tools to teach writing that is collaborative and dialogic,” says Ryden.
Ryden uses the site to start discussion in her classes. “Students interact with each other through the discussion board feature, sharing and responding to one another¹s writing,” says Ryden. “Their communication gains an authenticity often lacking in school writing assignments.”
English professor John Scheckter has chosen to create a site of his own instead of using Blackboard. Using Google sites he has created a website where he uploads content for his classes to use and download. “There are only a few things I want a website to do: posting syllabi and prompts, embedding pictures, and linking film or sound clips,” Scheckter said. Blackboard offers management functions that I haven’t needed yet.”
Using the site is the choice of the individual instructor. Blackboard can be a useful tool for students to access information and communicate with teachers and students. The site can also be useful in prompting discussions in the classroom.
Blackboard allows students to stay connected while they are in school, and at home. “At its best, we see this wonderful web of interaction–from teacher to students, students to teacher, student to student.  So we all become co-constructors of knowledge,” says Ryden.

On January 5th, 2011, the School of Visual and Performing Arts(SVPA) sponsored a special lecture by Kenneth Wayne, Ph.D., on one of the most renown artists in history; Amedeo Modigliani.
The lecture was held for a packed crowd in the Great Hall.  Professor of Art Frank Olt and SVPA Acting Dean Benjamin Moore introduced Dr. Wayne, the author of Modigliani and the Artists of Montparnasse. Wayne, one of the leading experts on Modigliani was educated at a multitude of prestigious universities including Stanford University where he received his Ph. D., the Courtauld Institute of Art, the University of London, and the University of California, Berkeley. His lecture spanned Modigliani’s life and achievements, from his early years in Italy to his work in Paris.  The lecture included a slideshow of Modigliani’s sculptures and paintings.
Modigliani was born into a Jewish family in Livorno, Italy in 1884. He traveled the world and created hundreds of works of art that thousands of people still admire today. He lived in Venice and ultimately settled down in France where he died in January, 1920 of tubercular meningitis. Recently, Modigliani’s work has broken records in sales. His sculpture titled “Head” from a French collection sold in June 2010 for 52 million dollars. In addition, Modigliani broke his own record when his painting “La Belle Roumain” sold for 69 million dollars in October 2010.
Following the lecture, Wayne joined the students, faculty and guests for light refreshments, and answered questions about Amedeo Modigliani.
