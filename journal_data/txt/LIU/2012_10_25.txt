The LIU Post football team ended its four-game losing streak by defeating the Millersville Marauders (2-6) on Homecoming by a final score of 20-15. Sophomore quarterback Tyler Heuer started in place of injured sophomore quarterback Steven Laurino, and helped lead the team to a much needed win in front of a packed house at Hickox Field on Saturday, October 20.
The Pioneers (3-4) had no trouble putting up points through the first 30 minutes of play as the team led 20-6 at the half. The highlight of the day took place early in the first quarter when Heuer jump-started the offense with an 82-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Kamron Palmer. Following an interception by senior defensive back D.J. Young, Heuer and the offense were put in great starting field position to do some damage at the Millersville 29 yard line. Senior running back Thomas Beverly capped off the drive with a one-yard touchdown run for his second rushing touchdown of the season.
The Pioneers finally got off to a solid start like Coach Bryan Collins has preached all season long. However, on the first play of Millersville’s ensuing drive, junior running back Ian Sadon busted out a 75-yard touchdown run make the score 13-6 in favor of the Pioneers early in the second quarter.
The Pioneers once again capitalized on Millersville turnovers. Junior outside linebacker Tommy Williams intercepted a pass and nearly ran it the distance for a touchdown. The offense of the Pioneers needed only one play to take a two score advantage as junior linebacker Rob Bright barreled his way into the end zone for a touchdown. With that score, the Pioneers had a comfortable 20-6 lead at the break.
In the second half, Heuer and the offense did not show up as the team did not even threaten to score once during the final 30 minutes. The Pioneers’ defense came up clutch on Homecoming as it forced four turnovers and limited the Marauders to only 15 points all game. Sophomore defensive lineman Joseph Thompson was a game-changer as he led the Pioneers with two sacks, while senior linebacker Anton Rukaj had a team-high 10 tackles.
With the defense playing so well, the offense had to hold onto the ball to avoid the Pioneers losing the fifth straight game. Late in the fourth quarter after throwing his second interception of the quarter and third of the game, Heuer was pulled in favor of Laurino. For the game, Heuer was 11-20 for 113 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions through the air. However, Heuer was efficient on the ground rushing the ball 19 times for 137 yards. With less than four minutes left to play, Laurino entered the game with a broken left hand and a broken right thumb ready to close out a Pioneers win. And he did just that. Despite not throwing the ball once, Laurino had three rushes for 11 yards, protected the ball, and moved the chains to seal a Pioneers win on Homecoming.
The Pioneers have the team’s final home game this week on Saturday, October 27, at 1 p.m. when they square off against the 3-4 East Stroudsburg Warriors.

On Friday, October 19, at 7 p.m., students came together to express their school spirit at a pep rally held in the Pratt Recreational Center. The pep rally kicked off the 2012 Homecoming weekend. Alerie Tirsch, director of the Student Life and Leadership Development, estimates that there were about 1,500 attendees at the pep rally. Students wearing a mixture of the old “C.W. Post” and new “LIU Post” gear united as one to show off their Post Pride.
Upon arrival, students were greeted with complimentary “Post Pride” pom-poms, cheer cones, glow sticks, and with music by the Pep Band. The LIU Post Pep Band is usually found at the football games to get the stadium crowd in the spirit to cheer on our football team. Free food and drinks were also provided to the pep rally attendees and shirts were thrown into the crowd. The master of ceremonies, MC, for this year’s pep rally was Class of 2010 alumna, print and electronic major, Simone Whitney, better known as DJ S.Whit. D.J. Lomo played music at the event to keep the students’ energy up. Senior education major Samantha McNamara enjoyed the music the most. “I love that they were mixing popular songs we grew up listening to with new songs. It was like a huge flashback from childhood,” she said.
The pep rally showcased multiple performances by students from different organizations. The Post Concert Dance Company performed a traditional African dance. The first, second and third place winners of the “Post Got Talent” show also performed. A dance performance by the Student Dance Association and the battle of the residence halls also occurred. Following the performances, the teams of LIU Post Athletic Department were introduced. Rebecca Kennedy, a transfer senior health and public administration major, said it was her first Post pep rally, “It was a great experience. I really liked Riggs Hall’s performance.”
The event was sponsored by The Association for Campus Planning (ACP).

Editors-in-Chief
The atmosphere of Hofstra’s campus on Tuesday, October 16, was that of pure exhilaration and anticipation. Governor Mitt Romney and incumbent President Barrack Obama would be going head to head in their second debate. Everywhere you went on campus there was something going on. MSNBC was doing a live broadcast outside the Sondra and David S. Mack Student Center all day. Sirius XM’s P.O.T.U.S. host and stand-up comedian , Pete Dominick, was also doing a live broadcast from inside the student center. LIU Post was fortunate enough to have Editors-in-Chief, Alex Parker and Olivia Wicik, attend the event.
This town hall style debate generated a lot of comments and opinions about the candidates and where they stand on social issues. Dominick shared his thoughts with The Pioneer on one big topic of the evenings, jobs.
“Young people are concerned about getting a job, it’s scary…Mitt Romney’s jobs plan just got four Pinocchio’s from The Washington Post. This guy says whatever anybody wants to hear to win. It’s sad, I try to be objective but this is ridiculous,” he said.
On the other side of the political spectrum, Mike Ventre, Chairman of the New York Federation of College Republicans also shared his opinion. “Four years ago we were promised hope and change and we weren’t given that. A lot of false promises were given and I think Governor Romney is really going to lead the way for our generation.”
Edward Isaac Dovere, the Deputy White House Editor for Politico, wasn’t too sure whether the Town Hall style debate would be in either candidate’s favor. “It’s a tricky format and they have not had as much experience doing that kind of debating as other kinds of debates,” he said.
The excitement at Hofstra grew during the hours leading up to the debate, and all those in attendance were ready to see Obama and Romney go head to head. Reporter from The Daily, Justin Silverman, said “I saw a funny tweet this morning from The Onion which said, “Obama getting ready for his first debate.” So, I think that people are just thinking that as long as Obama does something and isn’t just a sack of potatoes like he was last time, or perceived to be last time, then it will be a strong point for him. Mitt Romney also has a lot of pressure because he has to do as well as he did last time. It should be interesting.” As a reporter, Silverman did not care to divulge his political views to The Pioneer.
The debate began promptly at 9 p.m. and Republicans and Democrats alike watched in anticipation as both candidates debated, focusing on domestic policy. The first question of the night was from first-time voter, 20-year-old Jeremy Epstein, asking about, as most had predicted, jobs. The debate went on for about an hour and a half, ending with moderator Candy Crowley thanking both candidates for their time and reminding Americans to vote.
Just last night, the third and last presidential debate took place at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida. Unfortunately, Parker and Wicik were unable to attend. They were however, able to watch it in the Hillwood Commons Cinema at Post. The number of Americans that tuned in was much lower than the previous two debates, at 59.2 million. The focus of the night was foreign policy.
The back and forth banter between the two candidates created some pretty epic points during this debate as well. If “binders full of women” was the standout moment from the last presidential debate, then “horses and bayonets” was last night’s capital moment. When asked about his proposed $2.1 trillion military spending increase, Governor Romney answered with, “We need a stronger military, and the Navy needs more ships because it has fewer ships than it did in 1916.” Obama came back with “We also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed.” This was the last presidential debate before Election Day, which is merely two weeks away. Make sure to check out www.liupostpioneer.com to listen to the full news package, compiled from interviews that Parker and Wicik conducted at last week’s debate held at Hofstra University.

Television star Charlie Weber makes a splash in the new MTV series Underemployed. One year after graduation, a group of college friends face the harsh realities of the “real world.” This very relevant show chronicles the not-so-easy path to success in our world today. In the role of the advertising heavyweight Todd, Weber is a challenge for a new unpaid intern named Daphne (Sarah Habel).
Weber has had starring roles in shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Bones, CSI Miami, and CSI New York. The Pioneer had the chance to interview Weber and discuss his role, the “real world,” and the entertainment industry. Underemployed premiered on October 16th.
Follow Charlie on Twitter @TheCharlieWeber.
The Pioneer (TP): How did you become involved with Underemployed?
Charlie Weber (CW): I went to read for the role of Todd. If I’m not mistaken, they shot the pilot about a year before with a different actor in that role, and some piece or another didn’t seem to fit. I’m someone they looked at for the role and fortunately I got it, which was great, but then I had to fly to Chicago almost immediately. I think I got the role on a Thursday and production began on that Monday. So I didn’t have much time, I pretty much had to pack and go, but I didn’t mind. It was a great experience.
TP: What can you tell us about your role as Todd?
CW: It fit in nicely and timely. I’m in a part of my career where it is a very appropriate role age-wise. It is a fun experience. I am just now at the forefront of playing roles of grownups with real jobs. It was a real cool experience. I usually play, you know, I’ve been in a lot of sci-fi, or I’m a drifter, or a musician. And this is a guy who has a real job and a life and an apartment so it was kind of cool to delve into that. You play him for the entire season and let that arc unfold.
TP: How can you relate to this character?
CW: I think I relate to him more on a sentimental level. He’s a guy that cares about is job and is at the office a lot and it’s a huge part of his life. I can’t say the same of myself, as far as that, but I think I understood him more than anything on an emotional level and the way he felt about other people, and the way he handled himself emotionally and his availability emotionally.
TP: Every year, college students find themselves struggling to make it in the “real world” much like the characters on the show. What message does the show give to students who may be struggling in the “real world”?
CW: I think a real positive one in the sense that, yes, it’s a struggle, but these people all sort-of don’t lose sight of what matters to them, their friends, their lives, and their personal relationships. They all are just finding their way and that’s sort of an interesting, when you are young and just getting out into the real world, you want to just take it all on at once, but sometimes you have to just step back and let it unfold a bit. So I think it is a nice, cool, positive message. Not to say hope, but certainly not to stress about it and just let [life] come.
TP: Do you have a personal message to those who may be struggling, especially college students who are just coming out and trying to find jobs in any field?
CW: If anyone were to ask that, I would just say to hang in there. Like I said, it’s not all going to happen at once. You’re not going to be the head of a company on your first day and sometimes you’ve got to start at the bottom and sometimes you have to take a job that you don’t like in the meantime. I mean, we’ve all been there. Even in my line of work there are peaks and valleys and you have to just ride out the hard times and let the good ones come.
TP: Do you have any advice for aspiring actors or people looking to get into the entertainment industry?
CW: For any, and this is advice that I’ve heard from actors that I admired when I was younger, something that I heard a lot that I really think is true, is that you kinda need to stay true to yourself and bring yourself to a role when you audition for it or do it, because in the end of the day there are so many actors, and that’s the one unique thing that you will always have, yourself, and to just not try to conform to what others may want to see, but to do what you think is cool and interesting and see who responds to it.
TP: When acting, you have to build up chemistry with others, especially as a collaborator in order to be successful. Can you tell us about chemistry building?
CW: I think for me, I like to see what’s there naturally and try to build on that. See where you get along with people and similar ideas that you have. Sort of just get to know people. Like, over the course of this season of Underemployed, I worked a lot with the actress Sarah Habel, who plays Daphne, and we had a really nice chemistry. She’s a very cool person, and over the course of the season, it became almost effortless to do our scenes together. It was a nice automatic chemistry that we then had to build on. And then creatively working with [Executive Producer] Craig Wright was a real joy for me because he’s kind of a sentimental guy in the way that he writes and I really respond to that, and after a while he could just convey something with just a word because we’d worked together so closely for so long at that point.

	 Every time I’m sitting in class and the person next to me coughs or sneezes, I feel a sense of panic, hoping that I don’t catch those germs that are now traveling through the air in those tiny, congested classrooms. There are a few things that you can do to avoid catching a cold from someone else.  
  	To start, avoid those who are obviously sick. I’m not saying go around ignoring people but don’t be afraid to take a few extra precautions or speak up. If you’re going to take your seat in class, avoid sitting next to the person whose nose is running all over the desk. Also, be very vocal about what you’re uncomfortable with. If someone is too close and they clearly have a cold, don’t hesitate to politely ask them to separate themselves a bit. We all have that friend that always wants a sip of this or a bite of that. Make it clear that you’re not comfortable sharing food or beverages while they’re sick. Also, you should not let sick friends use your cell phone. This is something that is constantly by your hands and mouth, and is a good way to transport germs and get sick. If you feel weird bluntly saying no, make something up and say you have no service or you’re trying to reserve your battery.
	As a college student, life can be crazy and you may not have a daily routine as to how you go about things. Areas like eating and sleeping healthy get neglected. However, in order to avoid getting sick, you should make sure that you eat healthy and get plenty of sleep. Your body needs certain vitamins and nutrients to maintain a strong immune system. If you feel as though you’re not getting what your body needs, you can always consider taking a multivitamin. Also, be sure to drink water…tons of water! Your body works hard all day long, every day and needs its fair share of rest. A healthy sleep is equivalent to about eight hours. This may seem impossible to obtain by some, but maybe this is where you should work on your time management or organizational skills. Create a routine for yourself so you can get everything done in a day, and make your sleeping quota. 
	Dress appropriately for the weather! I think it’s safe to say that sandal and shorts season is over. If it’s cold outside, you should wear long sleeves, pants, coats, scarves, and closed toe shoes. Some people take longer saying goodbye to summer, but don’t let that be the reason you’re now sick and up late at night trying to study for a midterm with a stuffy nose and sore ribs from coughing.
	The most important thing to be conscientious of is washing your hands. Keep your hands clean, keep your hands away from your face, and wash your hands constantly with soap. Germs love your hands.
	Avoiding a cold that everyone seems to be getting can feel like a second job. You can’t put yourself in a plastic bubble and go to class, but you can take tiny steps to lower your chances of catching something. Rachel Ipsen-Riegger, a freshman political science and criminal justice major said, “I wear a scarf, eat healthy foods and I avoid people who are sick.” Riegger does these three things to lower her risk of getting sick.  
	Dana Goodman, a junior early childhood education major, named three things that she and other students should carry with them to prevent themselves from catching a cold: “Airborne, Purelle and tissues. You should get Puffs specifically. You have to get the lotion ones, they feel good on your nose.”

Fitzgerald is a tight end for the Pioneers who has five receptions for 32 yards and one touchdown receiving, as well as a fumble recovery for a touchdown Week 1 against Clarion this season. 
Q: What was your personal best moment (career highlight) as a member of the Pioneers?
A: My personal best moment could be two different occasions. Being selected as second team all PSAC East Tight End last year after my first season as a Pioneer or the home opener this season against Clarion when I had a fumble recovery for a 70-yard touchdown. I have scored a lot of touchdowns in my career but this one was special not only because it was such a long run but because it was my first TD as a Pioneer.
Q: What was the most memorable game you were a part of as a member of LIU?
A: I think that the most memorable game I have been a part of as a Pioneer so far had to be last season when we traveled to Bloomsburg. Not only were we getting ready to face the number two ranked team in the country in Division II, but we had an unexpected surprise when Mother Nature decided to spit out at least a foot and a half of snow during the course of the game. We adapted very well and ended up taking down Bloomsburg.
Q: What has being a Pioneer meant to you?
A: Being a Pioneer has meant everything to me. I have been to three other colleges and between NCAA clearinghouse issues and politics within other football programs, I really never got the opportunities to succeed in a game that the Athletic Department and the coaching staff have given me here. Being a Pioneer also means a lot to me off of the field. I have some great friends in my teammates, some of which I know will be in my life in 10 years. I have also had the opportunity to create relationships with people who make me feel special no matter what situation life throws at me just by being in my life, but more importantly have taught me how to be a better man.
Q: What are you going to miss most about LIU Post?
A: I will miss the good times hanging out with friends. I will miss going to other athletic events, cheering for my fellow athletes. I will miss the pep rallies. I will miss the smell of the fans tailgating as we warm up for a game. I will miss the war cries from the men that I have bled with, sweated with, celebrated with, and cried with. But most of all, I think I will miss looking across the field, seeing my teammates and knowing they have my back as I have theirs just because I see in their eyes the same intensity and love for game that I have.
Q: If you could be a part of any NFL team who would it be with and why?
A: Honestly I would be on any team that would allow me to continue to play the greatest game in the world, but if I could choose I would have to say the Carolina Panthers because I am from North Carolina and have always been a fan of the Panthers.
Q: What do you hope to do in the future after this season?
A: In the future after this season I hope to continue to play football whether that is for the CFL, AFL or NFL. That has always been my dream and goal. I will be earning my degree in Criminal Justice so if football does not work out, then I have that to fall back on. In due time, I would love to get married and have a family.
Q: Most memorable quote/best piece of advice you’ve heard while being a member of the Pioneers?
A: “Look at a stone cutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred-and-first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not the last blow that did it, but all that had gone before.” Jacob A. Riis (1849-1914)
I have heard Brian Hughes, the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, mention this quote several times over the course of my career at Post. This quote has a lot to do with football and life. To me, it shows the need to press on and push through the hard parts of life because when you get out of the hard place it won’t be because of that single action or decision that you just made. It will be because of all that led up to it.

Antonio Powell-Fields is the captain defensive back of the Pioneers’ defense. Last season, he recorded 75 tackles, one interception, seven pass deflections, two fumble recoveries, and one forced fumble. With his 2011 campaign, he earned a spot on the ECAC Football Division II All-Star Team. This year, he has 48 tackles, one interception, one fumble recovery, and one forced fumble. Earlier this season against Cheyney University, Powell-Fields was named PSAC East Defensive Player of the Week for his efforts in the 45-10 win.  
Q: What was your personal best moment (career highlight) as a member of the Pioneers?
A: My favorite moment and career highlight is catching the game winning interception and beating Bloomsburg last year in the snow. In a game where we were the underdogs and their style of play favored the conditioning, we beat them.
Q: What has being a Pioneer meant to you?
A: Being a Pioneer has been a great experience. I am honored to have been a part of something so great. I cherish each moment that I have spent as a Pioneer. I am very thankful and appreciative for the opportunity. 
4) What are you going to miss most about LIU Post?
I’m going to miss my teammates (brothers), the coaches, the games, the struggles, the fan support…everything. 
Q: What do you hope to do in the future after this season?
A: As of now I am in the process of thinking about if I still want to play or coach. If I do choose to continue playing, I wouldn’t want to play in the NFL, I would look into the CFL or the UFL. In the future, I can see myself coaching. I know that we can’t play forever and nothing will ever give that feeling of immortality of being on the field, but coaching is close. I can still share my passion with players.

After losing the first game of the 2012 season, the LIU Post Pioneers men’s soccer team found its winning ways again in two games last week, defeating both Philadelphia University and Queens College.
On Tuesday, October 16, the Pioneers traveled to Philadelphia to take on the Philadelphia University Rams. It was a tightly contested battle through the first half as neither team could find the back of the net. The Pioneers outshot the Rams 8-3 in the half and held a 3-0 advantage in corner kicks. The Pioneers threatened in the second half, but again were turned away by Rams goalkeeper Niel Kwiatkowski.
However, in the waning moments of the game, the Pioneers finally found the scoring touch. Sophomore midfielder Dusan Gargurevich was awarded a free kick after the Rams committed a foul. He was able to send the ball into the box, finding teammate junior forward Cemil Turan, who sent the ball into the upper right corner. 
That goal was the game winner for the Pioneers, who held on for the 1-0 victory. LIU Post held the advantage in shots, 20-10, and held the edge in corner kicks, 8-0. Junior goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen made six saves in the win and recorded his fourth shutout of the season. 
The Pioneers followed up the close win with an 8-2 drubbing of the Queens College Knights. Six different Pioneer players scored in the win, with Turan recording a hat trick and Andreas Olson scoring two goals of his own. 
However, it was the Knights that opened the scoring just 13 seconds into the game. Danny Stoker was the goal scorer for Queens College, but the Pioneers answered back 20 minutes later as Turan scored the first of his three goals. Six minutes later, he scored again to give the Pioneers a 2-1 lead and he later put a shot home in the 36th minute to make it 3-1. 
Five minutes into the second half, Olson scored his first goal of the game to make it 4-1. Queens scored another goal to cut the lead to two, but junior midfielder Jonathan Watkin put the Pioneers back ahead by three in the 61st minute. Olson scored his second of the game in the 67th minute and freshman forward Cameron Gamble and freshman midfielder Elias Johansson each added goals to round out the score to 8-2.
The Pioneers held an 18-7 shots advantage and Jorgensen had to make just two saves in the dominating win. LIU Post is now 14-1 on the season and 7-1 in East Coast Conference play.
LIU Post will host Post University on Wednesday, October 24, at 3 p.m.

The number three ranked women’s soccer team went 1-0-1 for the week, when it traveled to Rockville Center, N.Y., to roll past Molloy College 4-0 on Wednesday, October 17. At Homecoming on Saturday, October 20, the team tied Queens College to extend the Pioneers’ streak to 10 games without losing.
The Pioneers wasted no time in the East Coast Conference match up against Molloy College as it scored all of the goals within the first 30 minutes of the game. Junior forward Alexa Niciforo started off the scoring for the Pioneers, as she took a pass from senior captain Prudence Rydstrom to get the Pioneers on the board just three minutes into the contest. Only two minutes later, Niciforo fed freshman midfielder Hanna Westerling in the box, and the Swedish striker headed the ball into the top left corner, to double the lead for the Pioneers.
After 19 minutes, the team’s top-scorer, freshman forward Susanne Vistnes, took over the show. She started by blasting the ball in the top right corner from 25 yards for a goal that will be in the contest for Goal of the Year at the end of the season. After the game, freshman defender Jackie Niciforo said, “It was one of the greatest goals I’ve ever seen.” Vistnes herself was delighted to see the ball go in. “I just had a go at it from far out, and I am so happy that the ball went in where it did,” Vistnes said. “It was one of my best goals ever.”
Molloy’s goalkeeper was probably still dizzy after Vistnes’ first goal when the Norwegian striker got the chance again, eight minutes later. She took down a long ball from the back line, dribbled past both a defender and the goalkeeper to seal the game at 4-0 for the Pioneers, with her second goal of the day.
The Pioneers returned to conference action at Homecoming as it hosted Queens College. The Pioneers honored seniors before the game and hoped to give them a good experience in their last conference home game as Pioneers. Still, Queens College started the game stronger, creating several scoring opportunities before capitalizing at 11:36. The Pioneers answered fairly quickly as Westerling found the back of the net from two yards out, after Vistnes dribbled down the left side and crossed the ball to find Westerling for the tap-in. 
Neither team managed to find the back of the net again. The game ended at 1-1 after double overtime. Senior goalkeeper Nicole Fierro has had an outstanding season in the net so far, earning ECC Defensive Player of the Week honors four times. 
After Saturday’s game, there is a good chance for her to earn it for yet another week, as she registered a career high 12 saves in the game against Queens, and played an important role in keeping the Pioneers in the game with the Knights outshooting the Pioneers with 18-11. 
The Pioneers have an overall record of 13-1-2 and 7-0-1 in conference play. The Pioneers return to action on Wednesday, October 24, as the team welcomes Southern New Hampshire University to campus for a non-conference matchup at 3 p.m. The Pioneers then close the regular season by traveling to Philadelphia to take on Philadelphia University on October 27.

For the third year in a row, the New York Yankees came up short and did not make it past the American League Championship Series to advance to the World Series. Although the Yankees battled the injury bug, the team seemed to sail through the first half of the season and held a hefty lead in the American League East standings by the All-Star Break. The team was able to battle despite injuries to closer Mariano Rivera, relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain, and outfielder Brett Gardner, to name a few. The Yankees appeared to have the AL East sewn up.
However, the Baltimore Orioles started to make things a little more interesting and gave the Yankee’s players a run for their money. After the All-Star Break, the Orioles hit the ground running and continued to put the pressure on the Yankees. Meanwhile, the Yanks had a less-than-stellar second half of the season. The team lost its ample lead and saw the Orioles tie them for first. It was an on-going every day battle between the two teams for first place and it came down to the final games of the season to determine which team would win the American League East division title and who would win the Wild Card.
The Yankees went on to win first place in the American League East and clinch a playoff spot. Meanwhile, the Baltimore Orioles had to face the impressive Texas Rangers in a one-game wild card game. The Orioles made quick work of the Rangers, winning the game and gearing up to face their rival Yankees in a best of five series. These two teams battled, but the Yankees came away victorious thanks to the extremely clutch hitting efforts by outfielder Raul Ibanez and impressive pitching performances from both the starting pitchers and the relief pitchers.
The Yankees then had to face the dreaded Detroit Tigers to get into the World Series. The Tigers, led by talented hurler Justin Verlander, posed a very serious threat to the battered and beleaguered New York Yankees. Suddenly, the homerun-dependent Yankee bats went silent and the team could not get a hit, let alone score a run to save their lives. Although the pitching continued to be lights out, the offense was frustratingly nonexistent.
The Yankees suffered another crushing blow when the team’s veteran shortstop and captain Derek Jeter sustained a left ankle fracture during the American League Championship Series against the Tigers. Prior to this latest injury, Jeter had been playing in pain for most of the latter part of the season as they battled for first place. Unfortunately for the Yankees, the most productive and consistent hitter of the 2012 season was now out for the rest of the playoffs. This would be the first time Jeter had not played in a Yankees postseason game since 1995. 
	This was yet another setback for the already struggling Yankees offense, which had failed to score more than four runs since the first game of the American League Division Series. A prevailing theme this season was the lack of production with runners in scoring position and that was no different in the playoffs. In fact, in game five of the ALDS, the Yankees left the bases loaded for a franchise-high three straight innings. The offensive woes were highlighted by the ineffectiveness of second baseman Robinson Cano and third baseman Alex Rodriguez. Rodriguez was even benched for the fifth game of the ALDS and for two of the four games of the ALCS.
Although the majority of the offensive output was dismal, one bright spot was veteran outfielder Raul Ibanez. In a turn of events even Hollywood could not write or predict, Ibanez ended up helping the Yankees tremendously by hitting homerun after homerun, mostly in extra innings. He cemented his place in Yankees lore with his spectacular and unexpected heroism.
“As a Yankees fan since childhood, I was extremely disappointed with the way the team performed during the ALCS especially. With the lineup the Yankees have, there was not reason the team couldn’t score more runs. Some changes definitely need to be made this off season,” said senior political science major Nicole Duckham.
The Tigers all but destroyed the Yankees, sweeping the team in four games. So many rumors have begun to circulate around the sports world in regards to next season for the Yankees. Many say Rodriguez should, and will, be traded. However, Rodriguez is signed until 2017, according to his most recent contract. Others say that this injury may cause Jeter to hang up his cleats. There is also much speculation about outfielder Nick Swisher’s future in pinstripes. These questions and more will undoubtedly surround the team until next Spring Training.

October 5th & 6th was filled with Beatlemania at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. Classic Albums Live performed both sides of the White Album on the 5th, and the album, Let It Be, along with a compilation of Beatles songs on the 6th. I’ve been to many Beatles tribute bands for I am an avid Beatles fan, and Classic Albums Live sacrifices the costumes and the looks for sound quality. 
There were 10 people on stage, and they sounded incredible. They had four different singers each playing a different instrument, a violinist, a cellist who sang back-up vocals, a drummer, a pianist, saxophonist, and trumpeter. All the songs were played in the correct order of the album, and they played without interruption. There were many points in the album where I wondered if they can pull something off, such the song Revolution #9, but they delivered. Although there were some points when the singers’ voices got tired, it was easily overlooked. 
If I could change one thing, it would be to add trombone, baritone, and tuba players. There were some points where a stronger brass section was needed. While listening to the music, I was looking around at the audience and realized most of them were older, some of them young when the Beatles were still live. Almost all of them were extremely happy with what they were hearing, some closing their eyes lost in their memories. Overall, Classic Albums Live had a spectacular performance and if the Beatles were to play these albums live, it would sound a lot like them.

	“Beauty and the Beast” is filled with killings, fights, beautiful faces, and secrets waiting to be revealed. But don’t waste your time on this show. It’s 42 minutes of waiting for something to surprise you, only to find that it never will. 
	If you expect a Disney fairytale with a hairy beast rescued by a beautiful Belle, you will be disappointed. Why? Because “the beast” is a handsome doctor with a scar, hiding at his best friend’s place (for the record, not a castle). 
	With Krisin Kreuk (Smallville) and Jay Ryan in the leading roles, the CW uses its regular formula of good-looking actors to attract viewers. There’s only one problem: The plot is stupid. It’s so predictable, you’re smiling. Not because it’s funny, but because it’s bad.
	Cat Chandler (Kreuk) and Vincent Keller (Ryan) cross paths for the first time in 2003, when Kreuk’s mom gets shot and killed, and Cat is saved by a mysterious person. In the aftermath, everyone convinces her that this “beast” was all in her head.
	Nine years later, Cat is a homicide detective in New York. Of course, most of her co-workers are ridiculously attractive, and have no problems solving crimes while still looking gorgeous. In one case, Vincent’s DNA shows up. Kind of weird, since Vincent was confirmed dead nine years earlier. Oh, well. I already knew that. 
	“The beast,” Jay Ryan, joined the military after losing his two brothers in the Twin Towers attack. He was chosen for a secret project and when adrenaline kicks in, he becomes a “beast” with non-human abilities of speed, fighting, and more. Now, the military wants to cover their experiment and they’re chasing Vincent to kill him. Through the investigation, their paths cross again and Cat finds out that “the beast” that saved her exists after all. 
	Don’t waste time. Avoid tuning into CW on Thursday’s at 8 p.m.

	“Tonight’s the night when we forget about the deadlines,” sings Taylor Swift in “22”, one of the better songs on her new album, “Red”. For most of us college students, forgetting about the deadline isn’t realistic, but for multi-million record selling Taylor Swift, I’m sure it can be. It’s been two years since Swift has released an album, and “Red” is already the #1 album in the USA, on iTunes. Swift’s fourth album was released Tuesday at midnight and anxious fans, especially in the Twitter world, have been expressing their excitement all week. Swift herself kept fans on their toes by tweeting an hourly countdown all day on Monday. She tweeted a picture of herself with the accompanying tweet “this is my last day of life before #RED. Midnight. Tonight.”, which scored over 25,000 re-tweets and over 19,000 favorites. 
	As far as the well-anticipated album goes? It’s far from her country roots that can truly be seen in previous albums.  Listeners can decide whether this is a good or bad thing. The “pop” feel is present in many of Swift’s songs, but they are also the better half of the album. (Example, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, which uses auto-tune.) The other, slower and more country sounding songs, such as “Sad Beautiful Tragic,” seem to lack her usual heartfelt emotion.  
	The collaborations she includes are, however, great indeed. “The Last Time” features Snow Patrol lead singer Gary Lightbody, and their two voices sound almost angelic together. It’s truly a touching song, which embodies more of that deep emotion that fans love and that was so present in her last album, “Speak Now”. “Everything Has Changed”, featuring Ed Sheeran, is also one of the better songs on the album, and seems more true to her country roots. 
	For me, this album isn’t as whiney and heartbreaky-achey as the previous ones, which is a positive. I like the fun, upbeat tempo featured in a lot of her songs, but can also appreciate the honest, more serious and sad lyrics as well. There is something to listen to, whether you are having a good or a bad day. The song “Stay Stay Stay”, really hit home for me. I thought I was the only one who threw phones when mad at a guy, but I’m not surprised that Swift was in my brain when writing this album, too. What, I’m not the only girl who swears that Swift writes her songs about my life? Oh…awkward.

	As you walk around LIU Post campus you may see a good amount of young men that could possibly be mistaken for a homeless person. The look usually includes baggy pajama bottoms, a ratty looking hoodie, either socks with sandals or sneakers, a terrible five o’clock shadow and that just rolled out of bed hairdo. I understand that things happen; sometimes you’re going to wake up late for class and not have time to look like Channing Tatum. But in all honesty, this should not be an everyday look for you.
	I find that a vast portion of these fashion offenders are the guys who think they’re God’s gift to woman. A word from the wise my friends: no one is going to want to talk to you if you look like you may potentially be asking them for spare change. If any female wanted to have a conversation with a hobo, it would be more beneficial to just roam the streets of Manhattan.
	But really guys, do you not have any sense of pride in your appearance? I hope you answered no to that question because if you take pride in looking like you just crawled out of a hole than we have a bigger issue on our hands. What’s worse is, a lot of guys crack jokes about how long it takes girls to get themselves ready. Well, we end up looking pretty good, don’t we? Unlike you who looks like a heathen.
	It can only take all of five or ten minutes to put yourself together. That does not include a shower and shave. But honestly, would it kill you to put on a pair of jeans and a nice looking t-shirt? Probably not, seeing as most girls do it everyday, myself included.
	Bottom line: don’t expect to go up to a girl and hit on her when you are sporting the aforementioned getup and get a good response from her. No one is asking you to walk around in a tuxedo but looking presentable is a must. Homeless looking guys are beginning to plague this campus, don’t be one of them. Girls like boys who at least appear to take care of themselves.

The halfway point of the semester is approaching us, which means two things—we’re getting closer to winter break, and it’s midterm time. With the heavy course loads and busy schedules of students, it can be difficult to sit down and focus to study. Here are five tips, suggested by Post students on how to manage your time and workload to be successful on your midterms: 
1. Shut off your electronic devices. Turn off your cell phones, iPads, computers, video games and all other electronic devices known to distract you. Christina King, a junior majoring in English, says that doing this helps her concentrate while studying. For Apple users, the new software of the iPhone has a “Do Not Disturb” setting that keeps the phone from receiving any incoming messages or calls, which is a useful tool to keep you focused on studying. 
2. Review, review, review. This is one of the more popular techniques that Post students use to study. Making review sheets is one way that Dan Morris, a fresh¬man accounting major, studies for big exams. He goes through his notes that he took in class and compiles the most important information into a single sheet so he can study the information easier. Review sheets help con¬dense the information that the professor has given, so you won’t be as overwhelmed with a large amount of information. 
3. Rewrite your notes. When Kristen Costa, a freshman English education major, studies her notes she likes to rewrite them by hand. When she rewrites her notes she simplifies them and writes in different colors to differentiate various topics. She said that this trick is especially helpful when your teacher allows it to be an open book exam. Rewriting your notes is a great studying device because it gives you a chance to read your notes while thinking about them. 
4. Make practice tests. Wolf German, a sophomore adolescent education major, says that following what is going on in class makes it a lot easier when it becomes time to study. He uses blackboard to go over information his professors posted to supplement his notes. German also uses a website called quia.com; if you join the site you will gain the ability to create your own quizzes to test yourself on how well you really know the curriculum you need to know. Stephen Corr, a freshman film major, says that he goes over his notes and makes practice tests as well to help him study for big exams. Going over notes from class and the assigned readings helps him a lot while studying. This is an effective way of studying since you are forced to ponder over the most important parts of the curriculum while creating a tool that will put you in a similar format as the actual exam you are preparing for. 
5. Use music to help your memory. Other students find that music helps them study for a big test. “I like to listen to a good song,” Nori Abranson, a senior history major, said about what she does to study. She associates difficult questions and topics with songs that she likes to help her remember the information. When she can’t remember some¬thing she starts to sing it to the rhythm of the song so that way when she thinks about the song, she will also think about, and remember, the difficult pieces of the course that she was studying. She learned this trick in a psychology class. 
Midterms are an important part of the semester because the tests often weigh heavier than other tests in your grade for the class. Studying, and getting to know the curriculum is vital when it comes to acing a test. Get to know how your mind works; once you find the studying technique that works best for you midterms may actually seem a little less daunting in the future.

	As much as we may hate to admit it, the bitter cold fall and winter months are approaching fast. It is now time to pack away your flip-flops and opt for more fall and winter-friendly footwear. The popular shoe trends for this fall and winter that I will discuss include loafers, cap-toe ballet flats, ankle boots, and studded motorcycle boots.
 	When you hear the word loafers, odds are the image that pops into your head is that of a grandfather shuffling about or maybe a sharply dressed businessman. However, I am here to tell you that loafers for women are becoming increasingly stylish. Take Steve Madden’s popular leopard print loafers or even Jeffrey Campbell’s edgy studded loafers for instance. Celebrities from actress Anne Hathaway to style maven and television host Alexa Chung have been rocking this latest trend. These shoes are comfortable and functional, but can still dress up or add a pop of color to any outfit. Pair these loafers with your favorite skinny jeans and comfy sweater for the perfect autumnal school outfit.
	Ballet flats are just about as versatile as shoes come since they fit in just about every setting from fancy to casual. This season, cap-toe ballet flats are popping up in many stores. A cap-toe ballet flat simply means that the front of the shoe is a different color or material than the rest of the flat. Some cap-toe variations include sparkles and other accents. Stop into your local Nine West or Designer Shoe Warehouse, DSW, to get your pair of cap-toe ballet flats.
	We have now come to the boot portion of our foray into shoe trends. As the temperature begins to decrease, warmth is a serious priority. Thankfully, there are many ways to stay warm yet look great at the same time. Ankle boots are a huge trend for fall and winter this year. Whether a more cowboy-inspired translation or perhaps in a classic suede material, these boots are in stores from Target to Bloomingdale’s and everywhere in between. These boots provide style, comfort, and most of all protection from the elements. Throw on a cozy cardigan and a pair of leggings to show off your ankle boots this season.
	A shoe trend article such as this one would not be complete without the mention of motorcycle-style boots. Studs, spikes, buckles, and other metal hardware on boots are all the rage this year and provide a new take on a classic look. I would suggest checking out Steve Madden and Sam Edelman for help with this trend. These boots can be worn with virtually anything. Rock a pretty dress, black patterned tights, and a pair of studded motorcycle boots to try a more surprising approach. For more inspiration, look to young Hollywood actresses like Pretty Little Liars star Lucy Hale and Academy Award nominated actress Hailee Steinfeld.
	“Boots are a staple in my fall wardrobe. I like boots because they really complete an outfit and can make you look more put together. Plus, they keep you warm, which is necessary this time of year. I like to invest in a few high quality pairs of boots that will last me a few seasons,” said public administration graduate student Denise F.
	The best part of these aforementioned fall and winter 2012 shoe trends is that they can be adapted to fit within any budget and within any comfort level. Take a walk on the wild side or opt for a more classic approach to footwear.

Autumn is here, and winter is just around the corner. We have been hiding our skin beneath our clothes for a while now. In no time we will be digging to the back of our closets to pull out our jackets to keep warm.
But how do you find a cozy jacket while staying fashionable?
Amanda Dolle, a sophomore vocal performance major, likes to wear North Face jackets “because they’re comfy.” She sports a solid black North Face that has faux fur sleeves. Dolle says that she likes her jackets to be neutral colors because “your jacket needs to match more [of your clothes].”
In October’s issue of Glamour magazine, the editors show fabulous ideas on how to feminize your jacket. They show every day people walking the streets adding scarves, skinny jeans, leather bags and wild printed pants with their jackets.
Glamour encourages leather on leather—try pairing your chic leather jacket with an over­sized leather bag, while using multiple colors.
“I like leather jackets because they are warm, but not too hot for fall,” Kirsten Corwin, a sophomore music education major, said as she was rocking a light tan leather jacket.
When choosing a jacket, you should also keep your body shape in mind. Every girl has a unique body, so one jacket will not be perfect for every girl. Looking your best in your jacket is easy if you have the right cut.
If you are slim, get a jacket with a belt to define your waistline. If your jacket is too oversized, your petite frame will get lost. A belted waist defines your body, creating the hourglass look. Urban Outfitter’s “Jack by BB Dakota Belted Abi Coat” ($99, urbanoutfit­ters.com) is a soft woven coat with a soft blue and black plaid design. The angled pockets and the defined, belted waistline will define your frame perfectly.
The bustier girl should go for a big, tai­lored frame. Try Zara’s “Hook and Eye Fas­tened Coat” ($129, at zara.com); it comes in light grey with a feminine paisley pattern. Bal­ance the boxy look the jacket gives with your favorite pair of skinny jeans!
If your frame is curvier get a jacket that is longer than your hips to elongate your body. Take a look at American Eagle Outfitter’s “AE Hooded Military Parka” jacket ($129.95, ae.com). Its soft nylon and cotton mix will keep you feeling warm all winter long while doing wonders for your shape. Get it in white, olive green or black and pair it with skinny jeans to balance the look.
For girls who are lacking in the height department, buttons will be your best friend when it comes to jackets. Buttons have a way of elongating your torso, making you appear to be much taller than you actually are. Check out Burlington’s Coat Factory’s “Faux Wool w/ Oversized Knit Collar” coat ($69.99, at burl­ingtoncoatfactory.com). It comes in two shades of blue, black and a deep red. The double but­ton detail of the jacket will make you appear several inches taller!
Going through the racks trying to find the perfect warm, yet fashionable winter jacket can be tedious at times, but it will be worth it when you find the one that fits you just right. Your jacket should reflect you. It’s the first thing people will see when you step into a room, escaping the frigid air outside. When you find the right jacket you will feel confident in it, you won’t have to worry about your appearance for your first impressions, and be able to live your busy fun-filled life looking great!

Homecoming week was something truly memorable, especially the Post Got Talent event. On Thursday October 18, 2012 at 7pm in the Tilles Center Atrium, the annual Post Got Talent competition was held. Thanks to the combined efforts of the Association for Campus Programming (ACP), Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity Inc., and Sigma Delta Phi Epsilon Fraternity Inc., the night was very much successful.
Post Got Talent is a diverse competition where students get to reveal their true passions. There are those who live for the stage and others that learn to love it. Performing turns into a safe haven for many whether they are performance inclined or the shyest of wall flowers. With events like this, kudos must go out to the brave contestants who took part in the competition.
To kick off the show hosts Shaun Jack¬son and Sarah Taylor entertained the room with warm welcomes and hilarious antics. According to ACP Music Chair Ariel Carner “the competition is held every year so that contestants get the chance to perform at homecoming pep rally and it is a great opportunity for students to break out of their shells and showcase their talent to the cam¬pus community.” Along with the performance debut at the Pep Rally the performers were exposed to a larger community of people from outside of the campus. “Sure, the main benefit is getting to perform in front of a large crowd, but the friends made in the process were all the more worthwhile” said ACP President Mya Grey.
Performers:
The Tilles Center Atrium was filled with talented young adults in the category of poetry, vocal music, rap, instrumental and dance. There were ten acts consisted of singers Jameil White, Robert (?), Cody Petite, Joseph Alvarez, Abigail Dawson, rapper Kadeem Baptiste Lavine, dancers Jay Smith and Kevin Guardia, comedian Dinaa Fausther-Keeys, pianist and poet Kimberly Leger and the band The Core Combo consisting of Jason Reese, Charles Jourdan, Brandon Newell, Mikhail Brown and Matthew Van Doff.
Before the show when asked why she got involved with Post Got Talent, Freshman Kimberly Leger said “I love performing so it was a great opportunity…oh and my friends told me I should.” On another note nerves were racking through several contestants but not freshman Jameil White, he said “I am not nervous; I’m just trying to have fun and perform tonight.” They all put on a great show from risky tricks and theatrical presentation, to soul and outstanding vocal skills.
Winners Circle:
At the end of the night judges William Clyde(Director of Higher Education Opportunity Program), Selvino Andrade Jr.(Technical Services Specialist), and Scott Towers(Residence Hall Director of Riggs Hall) tallied their votes for the top three performers. Their choice was based on sportsmanship, appearance and other aspects of performance. After careful deliberation the winners were chosen. The third place winners was The Core Combo, Jay and Kevin came in second and the first place winner was Joseph Alvarez. After winning the com¬petition Alvarez stated “I’m just so happy to have won against all these talented people, thank you so much to the audience, judges, and other contestants for your support.”

The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, RCIA, which prepares people for confirmation, is now being offered in the Chapel on campus every Tuesday at 9 p.m. “It is a process, not a class; people choose to do it,” said Pastor Ted Brown, the Catholic chaplain and director of Religious Life at LIU Post. The confirmation process for this year started two weeks ago. However, anyone can join without missing any crucial parts up to mid-November. It is an hour to an hour and a half each week, depending on how many questions people have in the end, Brown said. Each session starts in October and ends in April. “They are learning as adults what Jesus is asking us to do for the world,” he added. 
Each branch of Christianity handles confirmation differently so Reverend John F.C. Dornheim, the Protestant chaplain, helps students find their own specific requirements of confirmation for each branch of Christianity. “It helps people become better followers of Jesus Christ, as we really understand what Jesus wants us to do, help the poor,” said Brown. He is in charge of RICA and confirms candidates to become members of the Roman Catholic Church. Brown has been confirming LIU students since 1989; he said over the years about 100 candidates have been confirmed in the Chapel. “It is part of the job description [of being a pastor], if you think the faith is worth it yourself, than you want to pass it on,” said Brown. 
Many people think they know all they need to about the Catholic Church once they are confirmed. “What happens to young people who have an eighth grade understanding of their faith? They don’t know how to handle adult problems; they need an adult understanding of their faith,” said Brown. Many people and adults think God is Mr. Fix It; they remember when they were struggling in life and that God didn’t solve their problem. However, God did help them through it, according to Brown. 
“Confirmation was something that was pending, it had to be done for me personally and I wanted to do it here with Father Ted,” said Jesus Medesto, a senior art education major. He was confirmed last year by Father Ted and is now part of the National Catholic League; the largest Catholic Civil Rights Organization in the U.S. Medesto grew up in a Catholic family but did not receive confirmation when he was younger. “I wouldn’t have understood it or remembered anything. When you are older, you get to see the real reason you’re doing it,” said Medesto. He was waiting for the right time and opportunity. In Medesto’s opinion, it benefits you more when you are an adult because you are more consciously aware of your beliefs. “If it wasn’t for Father Ted, who told me about it, I wouldn’t have done it,” Medesto said. He joined RCIA soon after. “The best part of RCIA is you can ask anything, even the doubts you have about your faith,” he said. “I would definitely encourage others to do it. If you’re reading this and thinking about becoming confirmed, this is the place to do it,” said Medesto. 
The confirmation learning process is not just for those wishing to be confirmed, but also for people who already are confirmed who want to learn more about their faith. Companions are people who are already confirmed who are involved in the sessions. They help the candidates through their journey while learning more about their faith. 
“At first, I did it for myself but then I realized that it was extremely beneficial for those going through it for the first time,” said Erik Raessler, a senior physics major. This is Raessler’s third year of being a companion in RCIA. He said he shares his experience of getting confirmed and the struggles he had with his faith since he was a teenager. “Half of it [getting confirmed] was definitely for my parents. I got confirmed seven years ago, but there was always that spark to get confirmed for myself and that’s what pushed me to join RCIA for myself,” said Raessler. He wanted a more clear understanding of his faith as an adult in college. “It’s an experience that you’ll never have anywhere else; each year is different from the next even though it is the same material,” said Raessler. “It will be interesting to be a spiritual guide for the entire group this year.”
“People open their eyes to see that each person has the spark of the divine in him or her,” said Brown. Over the years, there has been a mix of confirmation candidates who grew up Catholic but never got confirmed and people of other religions who want to convert, he said. There are a handful of people who grew up Catholic but are just now getting confirmed before marriage so they can have the ceremony in a Roman Catholic Church, he added. This is a recommendation by the church but not a requirement, Brown said. One must be baptized and receive first communion in order to be confirmed into the Roman Catholic Church. As an adult, all three of these practices are done on the same day during the first ceremony, which takes place in the Chapel. “It is a process of allowing yourself to be closer to God; everyone is pretty much coming from the same spot,” he said.
“I want people to change the way they see the world that is hurting, broken and healing. In most cases, God works through us, and hears that call to say I’m going to work with you, Christ, to do the healing,” said Brown.

The annual Jones Beach Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk took place on Sunday, October 21, with an estimated 50,000 people in attendance at the 20th noncompetitive five-mile walk.
Among these 50,000 people was a group of LIU Post students who had taken their time to sign up with the Association for Campus Programming (ACP) early Sunday morning. Even after a weekend full of Homecoming celebrations, many students were determined to wake up and show their support. They also got free breakfast in Hillwood before leaving campus on an LIU bus.
Kristen Grant, a Cancer Society spokeswoman, told Newsday this past Sunday that this year’s five mile awareness walk raised about $3.5 million for research and support services, further proof that raising awareness also helps raise money.
Making Strides Against Breast Cancer is the American Cancer Society’s series of walking events nationwide to support research, honor survivors and raise money to help the fight against cancer. It started in 1984 with Margery Gould Rath, who worked with other survivors and volunteers to create a “walk-a-thon” to encourage and to raise money towards the battle against breast cancer. 
The organization has three purposes in hosting the walk. They walk to show passion, power and purpose. On a beautiful, sunny day like this past Sunday, these three purposes were very much alive, and the supportive atmosphere was ecstatic. 
No other day of the year is Jones Beach dressed in as much pink as it was on this day. At a fence at the end of the first two and a half miles of the walk, many people posted pictures and encouraging words of and for loved ones who they were walking for. Other participants were survivors themselves, which was evidenced by the pink survivor shirts that they were wearing. However, people were not only walking, but also celebrating the survivors and the supportive spirit. A child rock-band, a disc jockey and Zumba instructors all contributed on an elevated stage. Others offered information about breast cancer alongside coffee or bagels. Pink hair extensions and temporary tattoos were also offered in some of the tents.
Gine Soerboe, a junior chemistry major, explained how she feels about the walks, considering that one of her family members is a survivor. “I think it’s great that they are raising awareness. But I think there are other types of cancer that need attention as well.” She attended the Jones Beach breast cancer awareness walk last year. “I thought it was amazing to see how supportive people are, and I would love to attend it again. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time this year.” She said she especially honored and respected everyone in a survivor shirt, and she felt proud for them walking for awareness.
If you missed out this year, you will get a new chance next year. The walk is an annual event, and everyone can and should attend. LIU Post clubs arrange transportation to and from the event every year.

The alumni association of WCWP, LIU Post’s campus radio, met on October 20 at the station at 4 p.m. to announce the second class inducted into its Hall of Fame. The event was a casual barbeque where radio station alumni had a chance to mingle with the staff and current students. There was also a 50/50 raffle being held where 50 percent of the money would go to the station and the other 50 percent would go to the winner. Inductees included Bill Mozer, Maura Bernard, Steve Radoff, and Harry Lowenthal.
Mozer, who was station manager from 1970 to 1990, was also an engineer at WABC and WPLJ radio, and Emmy-award winner for his audio work on daytime soap opera, One Life to Live. He currently works on the ABC show “The Chew.” Bernard spent years at LIU Post as a student in 1960s and 1970s and went on to become on-air personality at WBAB and Voice of America and is currently a WCWP on-air personality and LIU Post adjunct professor. Radoff was one of the first Chief Engineers of WCWP and helped build the first control console to get the station on the air via carrier current. Lowenthal, another Chief Engineer, worked to help make the station “state of the art” and taught engineering classes at the station.
“WCWP has always been a part of my life,” said Bernard. “Since I was a student until now as a professor, this is my home. It is nice to receive this honor.” The names that were announced will be officially inducted on April 20 in the Tilles Center.
The hall of fame class is selected through an election process by a board consisting of alumni and current WCWP hall of famers. At the last year’s WCWP 50th Anniversary Dinner, a dinner celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the launch of the station, the alumni association had a chance to raffle off an iPad for $500. The inductees included people that made a lasting impact and contribution to the student body at LIU Post through the radio station.
“This place is for the students, for the students to excel,” said Peter Bellotti, the association’s program coordinator. Last year’s Hall of Fame inductees were the founding class of 2012 members. They included Art Beltrone, Hank Neimark, Virgril Jackson Lee, and Dr. Herb Coston.
Some of the more recent graduates came out to support the radio station and many claimed that working at WCWP helped mold their career. “I would not have a career if it wasn’t for the radio station,” said Karen Fiorelli, class of 2003, who is now a news producer for News 12. “I tried something different while I worked at WCWP, from the news department to production. It helped me know how to pick put important stories, which is a great tool.”
“I want to give back because [WCWP] had a huge influence on me. I want to see it prosper,” added Karen Sangimino, class of 2003. As a student, Sangimino helped with fundraiser events and was very hands on. “I knew what it was like to work hard. It was like any other job I had.”
“We hope to unveil a plaque on the side of the radio station to honor The Hall of Fame inductees,” added Bellotti. In honor of the alumni, the station also broadcasted its programming all weekend long. “WCWP Alumni took over the airwaves with live shows; all different alumni as well as coverage of the football game.”
