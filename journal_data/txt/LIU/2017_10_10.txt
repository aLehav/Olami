Former United States President, Bill Clinton spoke to a sold out audience at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Oct. 5.
The event, hosted by former U.S. Congressman Steve Israel and the LIU Global Institute, featured Clinton speaking for nearly an hour on topics including global issues, his wife’s presidential campaign, and the current White House administration.
The event then switched over to the Q & A session with Israel, focused on a number of important topics making news headlines today, such as gun violence, college debt, North Korea, and immigration.
Throughout the night, Clinton spoke about embracing our differences as Americans and working together. Our goal should be “to build more inclusive prosperity, more inclusive societies…and more inclusive politics,” Clinton said.
“In this age, you can build all the walls you want; we are still interconnected,” Clinton said. He stressed that it’s what brings people together that’s more important than the things that divide us.
Abraham Orenstein, a senior broadcasting major was one of the few LIU Post students who attended the event. He was impressed with the speech, although he described himself as a Sanders supporter. “I thought it was a really strong speech that focused on embracing our differences and coming together,” Orenstein said.
Clinton also spoke about the Electoral College which ultimately put Donald Trump in the presidency, although Hillary Clinton won popular vote. “Since I believe in democracy, I believe the person who gets the most votes should win,” he said.
The audience applauded when Clinton spoke about college affordability. “We should do whatever we can to have the maximum amount of people graduate debt-free,” he said, adding that our goal should be for every student from a non-rich family to get out of college without any debt.
On the topic of North Korea, Clinton said that North Korea’s Dictator, Kim Jong Un, has “done and said enough to be of grave concern.” However, Clinton admitted that he didn’t know much more about the current situation than what we read in the news. Clinton did however, caution our current administration, warning that we should know exactly what we are getting into before taking any action. The Trump administration should work with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia on handling North Korea, Clinton said. Israel asked Clinton what international challenge made him “toss and turn the most” during his presidency. “I was always worried about Osama Bin Laden and al- Qaida because he came from a wealthy family and he lived in a cave, which should tell you something – he believed what he was doing,” Clinton said.
Gun control, in light of the recent massacre in Las Vegas, was also discussed. “You do not need this to defend yourself,” Clinton stated about bump stocks, devices which allow semi-automatic weapons to mimic the ring speed of a fully automatic weapon. Clinton recommended “giving the voters the direct voice on this; they trust themselves more than they trust the politicians,” he said.
Michael Themistocleous, a 2017 Post alumnus who is the Tilles Center’s guest services manager, said that the Tilles Center staff worked with the Nassau County Police Department, the former president’s secret service, and the Old Brookville police to ensure everyone’s safety during the event. “I’m really happy about the Global Institute being a part of LIU. Steve Israel’s knowledge and connections can really enlighten everyone on campus, on both sides of the spectrum,” he said.
The Global Institute is partnering with the Hutton House for a book event on, “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign” by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. The event will be held in Lorber Hall on Oct. 25 at 1 p.m.

Homecoming is only a few days away, and students are preparing for what will be one of the most important game of the Pioneer football season. The annual event, which takes place on Saturday, Oct. 14, is against Southern Connecticut State University, who the Pioneers defeated last year in a 30-23 victory. This year, the Pioneers expect another win as they head into the big game, and students on campus cannot wait to see another Pioneer win.
Greg Vavrinec, a senior broadcasting major and sports reporter for WCWP, says that homecoming is “super important for all faculty, students, and supporters to attend. It is the biggest and best game of the year so it is encouraged for everyone to come out and  watch.” Vavrinec has an important role in the game, calling the play by play for football. He says he enjoys homecoming because it is one of the most “close and competitive football games of the season. As the game ends, every single play matters.” Vavrinec feels his job as a sports reporter for important games such as homecoming will help prepare him for his career. “All of the little steps of preparation are things that are done in the professional world,” he said. It is because of this that Vavrinec enjoys his job so much during homecoming, and is excited to be a part of this year’s game.
Theresa Kelley, a junior, agrees. She loves homecoming because “it is always great to see the entire campus come together.” She says that at times school spirit is not apparent on campus, yet “[during] homecoming, everyone is really excited about the school and there’s a lot of unity.” Kelley says she has never missed a homecoming game in her years at Post, and that she is most excited about “hanging out with [her] sisters and friends,” and taking a break from the rigor of academics to enjoy the game. For many students, this game is a relaxing reprieve from the business of their week as the middle of the semester and midterm exams approach.
Also excited for the homecoming game is a sophomore business major Alyssa Curzio, who is on the cheerleading team that will be performing on the day of the game. She says that “cheer is getting super prepared and excited for homecoming. We have been practicing every night trying to create a routine and make sure the crowd loves it as much as we do.” Curzio, who is a transfer student, says that this homecoming game means so much to her because she gets to be on the field for her first homecoming as a transfer student.
As Post students begin to prepare for the game, it is clear that they are extremely excited to see a Pioneer victory.

On Tuesday, Oct. 4, seven members of The Pioneer attended the Megyn Kelly Today show at Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.
Freshman Mikey Domagala, senior Victoria Onorato, junior Andrew Servedio, junior Gillian Pietrowski, sophomore Luis Viloria,  junior Angelique D’Alessandro, and junior Griffin Albrecht were members of the audience as Kelly and her guests discussed the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, where 59 concertgoers were murdered and over 500 were injured.
Veteran journalist Tom Brokaw, Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman, psychiatrist Sue Varma, and former Secret Service agent Evy Poumpouras spoke about the shooting from various angles, including preaching awareness, supposed defects of the NRA, and advice to victims and their families. Varma urged courage, saying that while “fear is expected” in the wake of horrific events, so is hope.
Bauman, who lost both of his legs during the Boston Marathon in 2013 and now relies on prosthetics, gave hope to victims through his own experience. “To the victims waking up in a hospital right now wondering how life will ever be the same… I know your pain,” he said. “The most important advice I can give is to remember that healing your mind is just as important as healing your physical, visible injuries. It took me too many years and dark moments to realize that and it is so, so important. You will walk again. You will laugh again. You will dance again. You will live again.”
The first half of the show was coverage of the tragic event in Las Vegas. Kelly then brought on two guests to revive the gloomy audience with uplifting and joyful stories. The first guest was Charity Tillemann-Dick, an opera singer who had a rare lung disease that could have ended her life if she sang another note. Two double lung transplants and many songs later, Tillemann-Dick performed on the Megyn Kelly Show. Comedian and actor Russell Brand was the next guest, promoting his new book “Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions.” Brand admitted he was a “terrible drug addict” and advised an audience member in early recovery to reach out to other people like herself for help. He also hilariously spoke about his baby daughter Mabel and shared a few stories about her.
After the show concluded, it was open mic for the audience and senior broadcasting major, journalism minor Victoria Onorato complemented Kelly on the structure of her new show. Kelly was extremely respectful to her audience throughout the entire show, both on or off camera.
“It was an unbelievable experience, one that I am so grateful for,” said junior Angelique D’Alessandro. “I was able to view how production on a television set works and see Megyn Kelly in person. She is an inspirational woman and I am so happy to have been a part of the taping of her show, especially in the aftermath of the terrible events in Las Vegas. Megyn truly created an environment where people felt comfortable discussing the losses in Las Vegas and how to combat gun violence in the future,” she said.
The entire day was an exciting and beneficial experience for LIU Post’s student journalists.

The Be the Change club is planning to hold a ‘Positivity Sale’ every day during common hour, from 12:30 p.m. to 1:45 p.m., Monday, Oct. 16 through Thursday Oct.19. The event will take place in Hillwood Commons at a table in front of the Fishbowl. This is the Be the Change club’s second year holding this event, and the club’s first event of the fall semester.
The event is called a “Positivity Sale” because the club will be selling not only baked goods, but offering positive sentiments as well. Participants will be able to write out a “Positive Post-It Note” and stick it on the glass windows that look into the Fishbowl. They will also be able to make a compliment card to give to a friend, receive tips on how to stay happy and learn about ways they can make a positive impact in the world.
Adam Silverstein, the club’s President and a sophomore social work major hopes the event will build on the success it had last year. “This is the Be The Change Club’s second time running this event; the first Positivity Sale served as the club’s first-ever event on campus after it started up in the Fall 2016 semester,” Silverstein said.
“The club feels that this is the perfect event to start off the semester with, as it is a great opportunity for the club to introduce itself to the rest of the campus and show what it does to stand for the values of love, compassion, kindness, and peace,” Silverstein said. “The club is really excited for an awesome week and an amazing year.”
Half of all proceeds will be donated to the Challenge Day organization, which creates and runs workshops designed to foster people’s social and emotional growth, and the other half will be donated to hurricane relief efforts to help victims of the recent Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma.
During the week of the Positivity Sale, the club will host another event called “I Love Myself Because…” This event will be an open discussion about what the attendees love and appreciate about themselves and each other. “I Love Myself Because…” will be held in the End Zone at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct 17 and Wednesday, Oct 18. “At the event we’ll talk about the importance of self-love and what we can do to increase our self-esteem and take good care of ourselves.” Silverstein said.
Students interested in joining the Be the Change Club can email the club at postbethechangeclub@my.liu.edu

After facing Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, the United States is hit with yet another tropical storm, Hurricane Nate. At 85 mile per hour winds, Nate is deemed a category one hurricane, and has already made damage along the Mississippi coast and the northern Gulf coast, clearing entire roads, knocking trees and ripping down power lines. Nate has made its way up the east coast and is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rain, and possible ash ooding to the northeast.
In the event of a hurricane or severe storm hitting Long Island, LIU Post is prepared. The university works closely with the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) to determine the best course of action with the most up-to-date information, according to Michael Fevola, director of Public Safety. “The university will send out mass text messages and emails to our campus community, advising them of what precautions should be taken,” Fevola said. Those precautions could range from students remaining in their dorms, away from any windows, to partial evacuation, which includes commuter students, faculty, and staff, or a full evacuation of the entire campus.
“I feel like the [resident] building is very sturdy, and I feel safe inside my dorm,” Michaela Fox, sophomore musical theater major, said. “If it would come to the point where I thought the windows would break through, I would just stay away from them,” she said. Public Safety advises the community to avoid large trees, windows, elevators, and low-lying areas in case of a violent storm.
Sophomore psychology major Makayla Lopez, has her storm preparation plan. “I would get a bag together with all of my necessities, valuables, and a comfort item, and I’d make sure all loose items are put away around the room if the window breaks,” Lopez said. “I would charge my phone if I could. If the storm got really bad, I would go to the hallway or a room in the center of the building.”
Fevola stated that all buildings on campus provide refuge from a severe storm, as all buildings meet or exceed building codes. Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls. All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.

Coalition for Conservation (CFC) and Be the Change Club will join together to present the event “Billion Acts of Kindness,” on Oct. 12 at 12:30 in the Tilles Patrons Lounge. Guest speaker, Ram Singal, a survivor of the terrorist attack in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, will speak about his experience and how his life has changed since 9/11. Singal started the company “7 Billion Acts of Goodness” and travels globally spreading positivity.
Singal was a civic engineer working in one of the twin towers the day of the terrorist attack. After this traumatizing event, Singal switched career paths and now travels around the world speaking about goodness, spirituality, and kindness.
Last year Singal spoke at a CFC event and was invited again this year, along with the Be the Change Club. Singal tries to bring awareness to global issues pertaining to college students. He “wants to make students aware that there are bigger things happening and it’s very easy to fall into a bubble here on campus,” Erica Ferrara, junior geology and environmental sustainability major, and president of CFC said. Be the Change Club will jump on board naturally as a club that focuses on spreading positivity.

Sarah Tsang, a freshman forensic science major, is the proud owner of a half teacup yorkie and half yorkie, Penny, who is 16-years-old. Tsang’s family chose the name for their dog because her fur is the color of a penny.
The Tsang family adopted Penny from the North Shore Animal Shelter in 2010 when she was about 8 years-old. “I think of my dog as my sister,” Tsang said, as Penny as become an important part of the Tsang family.
Penny is soft, quiet, and gentle. She’s very energetic and dances in circles and jumps before she goes out for walks. She’s small in size with wired hair. “I like how she looks like a moving stuffed animal,” Tsang said.
“Sometimes I miss Penny since I dorm,” Tsang said. Penny is cared for by Tsang’s parents while Tsang is away at school.
One of Penny’s favorite activities is going on car rides. Penny sits down in the driver’s seat when Tsang’s parents drive and enjoys the ride. “She likes to smell out the window,” she said.
Penny also likes to go for walks and eat American cheese and apples. If Penny were on campus, she would explore as much as she can, Tsang said. “She would be smelling around the entire campus because she loves new smells and new places.”

Fraternity recruitment is right around the corner, and the men of the brotherhoods of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Theta Chi, Phi Sigma Kappa, and Tau Kappa Epsilon say they are excited to welcome potential new members. The four organizations are very active on campus, already began tabling for their philanthropies at common hour and representing their letters on campus at events like Meet the Greeks.
Peter Grabowski-Ramirez, a senior and former president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, says during recruitment he “[thinks] about the potential to build new friendships.” For the potential new members, Grabowski- Ramirez says they should “go to an event for each fraternity and evaluate” how they feel with the different groups of people. Grabowski-Ramirez feels recruitment is an exciting time to welcome new members to his brotherhood.
Brandon Mohan, a sophomore and member of Tau Kappa Epsilon, says his favorite part of recruitment is meeting new people. He says his fraternity “makes you feel part of a real brotherhood.” Mohan advises potential new members not to be scared, and to “make [themselves] open to new things.”

When you look at what was trending on campus when it came to fashion last year and compare it to this year a remarkable change has definitely taken place.
“It was actually really hard for me to gather my wardrobe together for this fall semester because it’s hard to keep up with the trends of today,” Tarah Simon, a junior political science major said. Simon is one of many students who found it a bit hard to pick outfits for the fall not because the weather is drastically changing but because the trends in fashion change so often.
Last fall most students had on a pair of UGGs and a parka coat to not only stay warm but to look like they just came off a music video or from walking in a huge designers fashion show. However, this fall most students are walking around with visor sunglasses giving off a very futuristic look. “I bought these shades because Nicki Minaj wore a pair just like them. Most of today’s trends usually stem from mainstream celebrities like Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Beyonce and so many other powerful women in the industry,” said Keolani Williams, a senior forensic psychology major.
Celebrities definitely have had a huge impact on college students fashion choices.
Nowadays big name brands like H&M are partnering up with local social media stars like Aaliyah Jay and Khalid. With no big hits to their name, no million dollar contract, social media was able to make regular people fashion icons overnight. Here, most students are getting their fashion inspiration from a range people including Nicki Minaj or Kim Kardashian.
“I mean, why should I even care about fashion? It’s not like people even look at me to see what I’m wearing. All they see is football player and they keep going about their business. If I felt people appreciated when i dress up then maybe I will but for now i’m going to be one of the guys and just wear my t-shirt and sweatpants,” Hakim Ahmed, a sophomore biology major said.
The male demographic on campus doesn’t really follow trends the way females do. Usually the males who aren’t athletes follow dress trends on campus, but not as much as the females. The males who do follow trends on campus have noticed the difference between last year and this semester. “I just think fashion is the thing now, last year nobody really cared. Now you have everyone walking around in visor glasses, long kimono dresses, long bomber jackets, it just feels like high school all over again where nobody actually comes to learn but to show off their latest and best out fits,” Fahruk Soni, a sophomore broadcasting major said.
At the end of the day, put on your best look and head to campus where the fashion show doesn’t start till you arrive.

Perfect for the fall, these caramel apples are easy, fun, and of course, a delicious treat. You can add your favorite toppings, enjoy with friends, and savor the sweetness.
Prep Time: 30 minutes
Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Popsicle sticks
6 apples (fuji apples, if possible)
Directions:
Insert popsicle sticks into the ends of the apples, and put them in the refrigerator. To make the caramel from scratch, melt butter in a large saucepan, then add sugar, corn syrup, and water. Occasionally stir over medium heat, for about 10 minutes until it boils and the sugar dissolves. Let it simmer for a little longer in the heat until it is a light gold color, swirling it in the pan, not stirring. Remove from the high heat, and then stir in the cream, vanilla, two tablespoons of unsalted butter and a pinch of salt, until it is smooth.
Let the caramel cool until thick. Dip the cold apples into the caramel, letting the excess drip off. Roll the apple in toppings, such as sprinkles. Then set to cool on a parchment-lined baking sheet, or waxed paper, that is greased or covered with cooking spray.

“We live in a world where violence and negativity are deemed normal,” Runway president, Keolani Williams said. The first program the Runway club put together this semester was called, “You Are Beautiful”, a program that takes place annually to promote community and body positivity, self acceptance through modeling and fashion.
The Runway club was added to the campus clubs list 10 years ago and has been able to put on an annual show every spring semester where all the money raised is donated to a charity.
Body positivity has been a huge trend all over social media with hashtags like, #ILOVEME, #FLAWLESS and #BodyPosi floating all over various social media platforms. Celebrities on social media ranging from Nicki Minaj to Ariana Grande helped plus-size model, Lesgeo Legobane condemn a twitter troll that used a picture of two females and captioned it “Girls I like v. Girls I don’t”. Legobane simply replied “I don’t like you”, and the tweet is on it’s way to reaching 100 million likes and has been retweeted 316,000 times. Minaj tweeted words of encouragement to Legobane, while Grande liked her tweet and told her she’s beautiful.
“I think it’s pretty awful that we have people who thrive and find happiness from hurting others. The moment I saw that tweet, I sent it to two of my eboard members and we promised to make sure that this years, You Are Beautiful was different from the rest. I wanted everyone to come out for the event from every walk of life so we could show the naysayers that they can’t break us with their words,” Williams said.
Tarah Simon, secretary of the Runway club and junior political science major, and Williams arrived to Winnick dining hall at noon and the models started to flood in right after. Chloe Rosario and Shawn Henry were the photographers for the event. The models painted negative words on their body that they had been called ranging from “Anorexic” to “Fag.” Henry photographed the models in dark scenery and had them pose in ways that showcased defeated and hopeless moods. “I used to be the president of Runway before I graduated and this is one of my favorite programs to host because the models really show out and we have many people who aren’t models come to the event to support. I chose to shoot the dark words in a form where you weren’t really looking at them, you were more so looking at the derogatory word or label that someone gave to them,” Henry said.
Rosario, a junior photography major took the second set of photos. The models used bright colors to cross and cancel out the negativity and some even wrote over the negative words with positive words, hearts or something that was beautiful to them. Rosario brought the models outside into the sun where the light showcased the new words and drawings on their bodies. “I chose to shoot them in the light because the words reflected positivity and happiness. Body positivity needs to be talked about more and seen more. You never know how much words can a ect somebody.” Rosario said.
The models all left with positive mindsets and were happy that they were able to turn their insecurities and aws into positive things. “I believe body positivity is a movement that impacts people’s daily [lives], once you embrace yourself you can spread love to everyone else around you. This photo shoot gave me the courage to take the bad names people called me and turn it into a positive and embrace my flaws. Model and junior criminal justice major, Keyara Williams said.
The photos taken during this event will be showcased in the Endzone located in Hillwood Commons on Oct. 26 during common hour. The models will also be handing out “You Are Beautiful” stickers and paper will be handed to everyone to write something positive about either themselves or someone else.

This semester, we have already faced difficult events. Whether or not we were personally affected or just watched from afar, natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma, left many people distraught and homeless. Last week, the mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas killed 58 innocent lives. Hurricane Harvey did the most damage in Texas, Hurricane Irma’s most damage was in Florida and Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Homes, cars, clothing, and food, which are all things we use in our everyday lives quickly, became something that these people needed to survive.
There are many ways to help those who were affected by natural disasters. One way is to donate money to organizations such as the Red Cross that provides emergency assistance due to disasters. People are also raising money through a Go fund me page that will be sent to the victims and their families to help rebuild their communities. Another is to send food, water and clothing. Any way you can help is more than enough get them get back on their feet.
When it comes to helping with disasters such as the shooting in Las Vegas, we tend to feel as though there isn’t much for us to do. Luckily there are a few things that can help a great deal. Many locals in Las Vegas have been bravely donating blood for those who are in serious need of it. Also sending money donations to the victims’ families via a Go fund me page will help cover funeral costs and medical bills.
Coming together when situations like these occur is extremely important. Having these opportunities to give back can help us as individuals restore happiness.
If you would like to contribute to help these victims please go online at www. redcross.org, www.gofundme.com, or choose an organization that you wish to support.
To donate on a local level there will be a Hurricane Relief drive during the homecoming football game on Oct. 14. Donations can be dropped off at the Pratt Recreation center during throughout the day.

“What’s up? …Life!,” a solo exhibition, opened on Oct. 4 in the SAL Gallery. Artist Shwanpach Ratanapinyopong, also known as Jid, is a second year art therapy graduate student.
Her artwork seems fun and animated until one looks a little closer, Ratanapinyopong takes inspiration from the world around her, her patients, and people she encounters. “I get depressed when I read news, so that expresses through my artwork.” Some of her pieces were filled with people and chaos since this is how Ratanapinyopong sees the world.
Within these drawings there are crosses between animals and people in swirls of disarray. “This is how I see people, I don’t see them as a human anymore. I see them as animals,” said Ratanapinyopong.
Other artwork exhibited depicted animated characters that took up most of the canvas. One in particular was of a chicken holding a pair of shoes. “He has wings but he cannot fly, why?” Ratanapinyopong explained. The canvas next to that one showed a wolf holding a sheep. It is supposed to represent an alternative to the story, “The Boy who Cried Wolf.” Ratanapinyopong wanted to present the alternative notion that the wolf did not want to eat the sheep, but that the wolf loved the sheep very much.
Ratanapinyopong is very devoted to her art therapy work; much of her artwork represents patients and their feelings. One in particular, represented a patient who needed medication. She explained that this patient had hallucinations and medication would make him feel better. However, she was apprehensive of this decision, unsure of whether is was the right thing to do. Most of her artwork represents deep feelings of anxiety correlated to experiences.
Ratanapinyopong also exhibited her own character in various snapshots pinned to string wire. Her character’s Instagram is @jid.rid.s.

Artificial fall oral stems
8 oz mason jar
Candy corn

Next, trim the ribbon to size to make the bow smaller and symmetrical. Then hot glue a fall-colored artificial ower to the center of the bow. Fill the jar about halfway with candy corn. Lastly, stick the fall oral stems into the candy corn, creating a fun fall room decoration that is quick, easy, and perfect for a dorm room or other living space.

The year is 2049, synthetic humans, known as “replicants,”are even more humanoid than they were in 2019, European Peugeot cars are being driven in the states, the game console Atari is still relevant and wood is more precious than diamonds. This is where “Blade Runner 2049” takes off. 
An LAPD blade runner, Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is on patrol when he reaches a farm outside Los Angeles looking for replicants. A blade runner is essentially a bounty hunter assigned to retire (kill) replicants. At the farm, there is a tree and a NEXUS-8 replicant produced by the long-gone Tyrell Corporation. It is Officer K’s job to eliminate the NEXUS-8. The tree is an arche-type of something else seen later on in the film.
The story of “Blade Runner 2049” is simple, Officer K is assigned find the off spring of Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), the original blade runner. As the plot evolves throughout the movie, a more personal sub-plot takes shape and threatens to take over the main plot, leaving the movie a bit scattered. I will say this: the new replicants created by Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) are more advanced not only physically, but also mentally.
Throughout the movie, director Denis Villeneuve presents viewers with what are most likely the greatest special effects of the 21st century. Everything is so crisp, from the holographic housewife named JOI to interactive billboards and that’s not even all of it. The casting is great; Gosling does complete 180, coming from his last blockbuster lm, “La La Land” where he plays a jazz pianist. Leto bounces back well from his horrific portrayal of “The Joker” in David Ayer’s “Suicide Squad.” Ford, while he is not in the movie for long, did his part as Rick Deckard and brought a smile to my face, due to the fact that he plays Han Solo in “Star Wars.”.
It is hard for me to explain how I feel about “Blade Runner 2049,” it’s a good movie, but it’s a bit long; the movie’s run time is over two and a half hours. This makes it a struggle to sit through for the casual fan, and also hurts the box office. Due to the movie’s length, theaters can only show the movie so many times a day.
It’s estimated that the opening weekend for the movie will only bring in $31.5 million, which is not good when compared to how much the movie cost Warner Bros. to produce: a whopping $185 million.
So, in my opinion, “Blade Runner 2049” is put together well, but the length makes the movie a bit of a yawn.

Smokey Robinson, known as the “King of Motown,” will be performing at the Tilles Center on Oct. 21.
This event is one of the Tilles Center’s 2017 gala shows and is a special event to commemorate the life of Gerald Monter. Monter was an active fundraiser and a board member of the Tilles Center.
Prepare to spend an evening with this legendary singer-songwriter whose smooth and silky voice is widely recognized. His performance will consist of timeless hits and motown favorites from “My Girl” to “Ooo Baby Baby.”
Robinson’s career has spanned over four decades and he has received numerous awards including the Grammy Living Legend Award, NARAS Lifetime Achievement Award, and even an honorary doctorate from Howard University.
On Oct. 8 he launched a new annual holiday called “Father-Daughter Day” to promote parental bonding as he has six daughters himself. Robinson not only wrote hits for his group the Miracles, but other notable groups, including The Temptations, Mary Wells, Marvin Gaye and many others.
“It would be a show to take my mother and grandmother to for a night out,” Junior pre-pharmacy major, Dajha Judge, said.
“I enjoy his timeless and classic style of music,” senior psychology major, Katerina Loizou, said.
Robinson’s music style has shifted from energetic R&B to mellow romantic soul. Tilles Center employee and junior musical theater major, Paris Dickinson said, “Smokey Robinson’s music is classic and you should definitely see this show.”

Just like the men’s soccer team this week, the women’s soccer game against American International College on Saturday, Oct. 7 ended in a tie of 1-1. The tie extends the team’s unbeaten streak to six games, which is the longest streak of their season.
Both teams’ shots on goal were mostly even throughout the first period, with American International scoring one.
The game’s tide turned around during the second period, when the Pioneers were on top of their game. The women’s soccer team has its next game Wednesday, Oct. 11 at Queens College, game time to be determined.
