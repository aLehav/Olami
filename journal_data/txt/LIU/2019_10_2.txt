 The men’s soccer team played its first North-east Conference game at LIU Soccer Park on Friday Sept. 27 against Saint Francis University. After being down two goals in halftime, the Sharks bounced back, took the game to overtime and won with a score of 3-2. “We showed courage, heart and belief today,” senior captain Kyle Parish said after the game. 
The two teams were evenly matched during the first half of the game, but the Sharks got the first dangerous scoring opportunity in front of the goal. After 15 minutes, sophomore Athanasios Coutroumpas received a pass from freshman Papa Ndoye inside the penalty box, but the shot went over the goal. However, three minutes later, the Red Flash moved forward along the Shark’s left side and scored their first goal of the game.  
After the goal, The Sharks kept attacking but without any luck. With only a minute left of the first half, the Red Flash scored their second goal on a penalty kick and took a 2-0 lead into the second half. “We made a couple of bad mistakes to go down early, but I thought the possession, the passing and the movement was really good, and as the game got going we got better,” Coach Michael Mordocco said.
The Sharks came onto the field in the second half with new energy. Only four minutes into the half, Ndoye scored his fourth goal for the season assisted by junior Camarri Johnson. 
The Sharks kept pressing the Red Flash after the goal and had the upper hand throughout the whole half. In minute 82, the Sharks’ hard work paid off, and Coutroumpas tied the game when he scored his second goal for the season. When the clock struck 90 minutes, the scoreboard showed a 2-2 result and the game went to overtime.
As the teams kicked off the third period, the men’s lacrosse team came running to the field to support their fellow Sharks. “Having the lacrosse team coming out giving us that extra energy in overtime, it was really special,” Mordocco said. 
With additional audience cheering them on, the Sharks came flying towards the Red Flash’s defence. Only three minutes into overtime The Sharks got a free kick right outside the penalty box. Sophomore Anton Ocampo took the free kick and tapped the ball to Parish who sent the ball past the Red Flash’s goalkeeper up to the top right corner. The Sharks won the game with the score of 3-2. “We went into the sheds at halftime and checked ourselves and came back out and smashed it,” Parish said. “I’m proud of all the boys and [their] never-die attitude.” 
Regarding his game winning goal, Parish was humble. “I wouldn’t credit that to myself, that’s a team effort,” he said. “I would never have got that if it wasn’t for the fellows up front.”
With eight games played, Coach Mordocco was proud of his team’s growth. “The guys have just been fantastic. They keep getting better every day and just keep believing,” he said. “There is something special about this group.” 
Looking forward, Coach Mordocco said they will focus on preparing for the next game and Parish thinks the win on Friday will give the team an extra kick. “It’s a huge momentum boost lead-ing into the rest of the league,” Parish said. 
The men’s soccer team plays their next game on Sunday, Oct. 6 against NEC opponent Sacred Heart University at Park Avenue Field in Fairfield, Connecticut.

 The women’s tennis team has kicked off their fall season, and with only one returning player from the 2018-2019 roster, members of the team are looking to make a name for themselves in the Northeast Conference. 
The women’s tennis team did not have any players transfer from Brooklyn to Post after the merge between the two campuses. Junior Veronika Koudelkova was the only player who stayed from Post to play as a Shark. This left Head Coach Jan Griga with an entire roster to fill. However, Coach Griga believes he did a great job bringing in players and filling an exceptional roster. 
“I don’t know if it’s luck because sometimes, when you’re recruiting, it’s a little bit of a coin toss. You don’t know what you’re gonna get. I have to say I must have outdone myself because they have all came and exceeded my expectations,” Griga said.
With a new recruiting class, most of the new team members are freshmen. Five out of eight team members are first-year players. However, Coach Griga does not see this as a point of concern. If anything, he is excited about his talented, young class. “It’s a very strong team and they’re all looking really good,” he said.
The Sharks saw their first day of live play on Friday, Sept. 13 at the Columbia Invitational. Coach Griga was very pleased with their level of play. 
“I was pleasantly surprised with the way everybody turned out, and with the attitude, and the fight, and [the] work ethic that everyone showed in the matches. But there is obviously a lot of work ahead,” he said.
Coach Griga is focused on making sure his team’s players have everything they need to be successful in their upcoming season. A priority of his, that he believes will set the Sharks apart from their competition, is physical toughness. Griga wants his players to be in peak shape to outlast and outperform even the most difficult of opponents. 
“We’re going to come across pressure situations and tight matches where the freshman might run into playing more experienced opponents,” he said. “I want to be able to lean on our physicality and on our hard work and endurance to try and compensate in that area. If we’re stronger and fitter than the other team, then we will be able to outlast them when it comes down to the wire.”
Over the weekend, the team traveled down the road to the Hofstra Invitational. Here, the Sharks made many positive strides in their season. Both Valentina Dancenco and Sofiia Kuzina won singles titles. In doubles, this pair made it to the championship fight but fell to Hofstra players Brown and King with a score of 4-6.
The Sharks look forward to traveling down to the UNC Charlotte Invitational on Friday, Oct. 11, where Coach Griga will bring four of his eight players. He is excited to bring his players to a place where they can experience a new level of competition, include playing teams such as Princeton University. 
The Sharks will finish out their fall season in West Point, New York at the ITA Regionals hosted by Army.

 Greetings fellow commuters! With the first few weeks of the semester out of the way, we should have a solid commute routine in place. For some of you who might still be struggling, here are some tips for an effortless commute. 
I like to keep a few things in the back of my head when traveling. One of the most important things to do is leave enough time in your commute for literal roadblocks that may come up. These can turn what you thought would be a smooth ride to school into a 45 minute headache after dealing with bumper to bumper traffic. 
Roadwork or an unexpected car accident are some things that can hold you back from being on time since they can cause delays in your regular schedule. You may leave the house at the same time every morning. Some days you may be 30 minutes early, while on the other days you can be 30 minutes late. It’s best to leave about an hour window in case you have to make up for any lost time due to complications on the road.
Once you arrive at school, your first concern is probably parking. Getting a good parking spot depends on what time you arrive on campus. I find parking to be the easiest between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. before most students arrive. As the day goes on, parking spots begin to fill. By common hour, every parking lot is usually full. If you’re lucky, you could find someone who’s leaving, allowing you to cash in on their spot. 
To avoid frustration, I choose to park in the lot across from Hillwood, which students often refer to as the commuter lot. This parking lot is one of the biggest parking lots on campus and is usually never full. You are always guaranteed to find a spot there. The only downside is that it’s quite a walk back to campus, which I don’t mind because cardio helps alleviate stress that stems from commuting overall.

 Young Americans for Liberty, otherwise known as YAL, is a libertarian student activism organization that might be coming to campus. Thomas DiGennaro, a sophomore philosophy major, is attempting to start a local chapter of the organization on campus.
According to YAL’s mission statement the organization’s goal is to “Build a bench of 250 liberty legislators by the end of 2022 at the state level who will advance libertarian philosophy, ascend to higher office, and reclaim the direction of our government.” 
The beliefs of the group are to promote free speech, and other constitutional rights. “The philosophy of the group is having less government in people’s overall life and defending individual liberty, namely free speech and free association,” DiGennaro said.
If the local chapter is approved, YAL plans on hosting events such as a Free Speech Ball. During this event, students will be able to write down whatever they want on a giant inflatable beach ball. The goal of the event will be to “encourage an environment of free speech,” according to Digennaro.
Once 15 students commit to joining, YAL will be able to draft their club constitution and submit it to the Student Activities Board. If you are interested in joining YAL, or have any questions about the club, you can contact Thomas DiGennaro at Thomas.DiGennaro@my.liu.edu.

 The faculty exhibition at the Steinberg Museum of Art located in the lower level of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library will be on display from Sept. 4 to Oct. 12. There was a reception held on Wednesday, Sept. 18 from 5-8 p.m. The exhibition showcases the artwork created by the faculty of the art department.
This year, some of the featured artists include associate professor Winn Rea, professor Seung Lee, adjunct professor Chris Ann Ambery, and professor Dan Christoffel, among others. This is an annual exhibition. There was a callout in May to the faculty for artworks. All works had to be received by mid-August. Based on the works shown, the response was lively.
This Art show gives students the ability to see their professors’ recent work. Barbara Applegate, the director of the Steinberg Museum, aimed to have the art pieces that are “sympathetic” to each other. It is important that the flow of the artwork is complimentary.
The artists who were featured shared a common thread of having grown up with an internal drive to create and explore. “Art is about self expression, the need to create something whether it be painting or dance,” Robert Calame, adjunct professor of art, said. 
“Art in general is definitely creative expression, and should be very personal to the artist. It is about creating visual conversation,” Ambery said. 
 The artworks presented at the exhibition are as diverse as the artists. There are paintings, sculptures, drawings, installation, drawing, various mixed media compositions, and a print-making piece. The exhibition as a whole is about faculty artists sharing their artwork together. 
One piece from the art show is Dan Christoffel’s drawing, “Lincoln’s Eyes- Lincoln Douglas Eyes”. This drawing features a close-up perspective of Lincoln’s eyes as he was listening to Steven Douglas pres-ent. The eyes show that he is deep thought. The exhibition is a glimpse into the creative minds of artists who teach other artists.

 As a relatively new club on campus, The Studio kickstarted the semester with the Sidewalk Chalk Fest. On Friday, Sept. 13, the sidewalk leading into Hillwood Com-mons was filled with works of art designed by students. “The goal was to represent the Studio, recruit new members, and to spread the joy of art and de-stress from class,” said Emily Ruben, a junior forensic science major and vice president of The Studio.
The Studio is dedicated to students interested in learning about art and showcasing their artistic skills without the pressure of a classroom environment. “We’re an open club to students of any major who love art and just don’t have the time to be an art major,” junior forensic science major and president Cassidy Shankar said. “You don’t even have to be that great in art, it’s just a fun time where you don’t have to stress about anything.”
Shankar developed the idea of The Studio with the help of Ruben and other friends in the summer of 2018. There was only one art club on campus before then, known as the Art League. According to Shankar, the club was exterminated, leaving her no choice but to start a club of her own. Shankar and Ruben, as well as others, put their thoughts into action and established The Studio in the spring 2019 semester. “The E-Board and I started this club mainly for the purpose to de-stress from school and meet others with an interest in art,” Ruben said.
The club participated in events in the spring, such as Cultural Explosion Day and Relay4Life, and this semester, they have more events planned. On Wednesday, Oct. 2, members of the club will receive an exclusive presentation of 3D modeling and printing by associate professor Winn Rea. On Wednesday, Oct. 9, adjunct professor Laura Sweeney will be giving a demonstration on figure drawing and allowing students to take part in a drawing activity. Every event is open to all students, regardless of club member status.
The E-Board is interested in the idea of a Paint and Sip night. “It’s a night where students can come, relax and paint a canvas while enjoying some nice, warm coffee or hot chocolate,” Ruben said. Although this event isn’t fully developed, Ruben said it is something they are looking forward to.
The Studio gained about 15 new members this semester, but Shankar and Ruben want to welcome more. A recurrent member of the club, Melissa Passik, a junior geology major, joined The Studio in the spring semester of 2018. “I’ve always been interested in art,” Passik said. She also mentioned that the club provides her with a stress-free environment to simply relax and make art. The E-Board encourage students with the same interests as Passik to join their team. 
Meetings are held every Wednesday during common hour at the Craft Center, the white building next to Pell Hall. Shankar encourages students interested in “expanding their creativity” to stop by for more information about the club.

The Steinberg Museum of Art announced their fall-themed photo contest via Instagram on Monday, Sept. 23. All students are welcome to participate and share their photos until Thursday, Oct. 17. The host of the contest, museum educator Arianna Nuzzo, specified that submitted photos should be taken on campus. “Anyone works or lives on campus can make a photograph of a fall scene,” she said. 
Photos can portray any fall aesthetic theme. “It could be a landscape, or something that feels ‘fall’, like a cup of tea. [Something] that gives us the beauty of Post,” Nuzzo said. The aim of the contest is to incentivise participation in art across campus. Students can participate by tagging @liupost_steinbergmuseum in their photo on Instagram, and following the account. Three winners will receive Starbucks gift cards; $15 for third place, $30 for second place, and $50 for first place. 
Photographers of all skill levels are welcome to participate in the contest, and there is no need to buy expensive materials, according to Nuzzo. “We want to bring art to the whole student population, and everyone has a phone; it’s easy to take a photograph,” she said.
Nuzzo was inspired to create this event after seeing an Instagram post of a student’s dorm room. “It was a beautiful warm light coming through the curtain, and it reminded me that fall is on campus and it’s a great time to feel collegiate and part of the university,” she said. “I thought it would be a great mood to capture.”
“I’ll definitely snap some pictures around campus and have some fun,” Evelin Figueroa, freshman arts management and economics double major, said. She plans to take photos at the seven arches near the Winnick Mansion, or at the labyrinth. “I’m waiting for all the leaves to fall down though before I take pictures, because I feel that’s more of the fall aesthetic,” Figueroa considers herself an intermediate photographer when it comes to photographing her friends, and a beginner when it comes to landscapes and the like.
This is the first time the museum has hosted a contest like this, though Nuzzo hopes to continue this event annually and in different seasons. Students can anticipate a winter or spring art competition. “I love taking aesthetic photography shots; I especially love taking more winter-aesthetic photos, so if there was a winter competition I would definitely be on top of that,” Nicholas Frank, junior digital game design major, said.
Submitted photos will not be featured in the Steinberg Museum of Art, but Nuzzo wants to curate a small installation of the photos and keep a portfolio of the contest entries. “Since I’m a photographer, I’m really interested in seeing what students produce. I’m interested in seeing what the scene means to everybody,” Nuzzo said. 
Nuzzo would like to increase comradery amongst students in varying departments with this contest. “My hope is that people with like-minded interests in photography can find each other,” she said. 
“The worst that could happen is you don’t win, but you have some really cool memories of taking pictures and getting to know the campus,” Figueroa said to encourage her peers to participate. “The best thing that could happen is you get a gift card, and you can enjoy that with your friends.”
