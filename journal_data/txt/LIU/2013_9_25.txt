One of the most influential advocates of free speech, Mary Beth Tinker came to LIU Post on Monday, Sept. 23! Tinker and Mike Hiestand, a First Amendment attorney with the Student Press Law Center, came to Post to discuss her landmark case, Tinker V. Des Moines School District, and to remind students how to use the First Amendment, and to let them know of their rights while in school.
Tinker’s speech took the audience back in time. Students listened as she recalled her life changing moment. In 1965, Tinker and her little sister watched pictures of the Vietnam War on the news. “We would see these images of huts on fire, children running from their huts. The body bags on the ground. Every night we would watch this, we were getting more and more upset.”
Tinker, her brother, and some of their friends decided to do something to express how sad they were about the war and the lives lost. Tinker and her friends agreed to wear black armbands with peace signs on them to school. Tinker was warned by school officials not to wear the armband. Although she described herself as very shy, and not the type to speak up, she attended school with the armband anyway. Tinker was asked to remove the armband and was suspended. Tinker’s case went all the way to the United States Supreme Court. In 1969, in a 7-2 decision, the court ruled that students had a right to wear the armband. Justice Abe Fortas emphasized that faculty and students have First Amendment rights. “It can hardly be argued that students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,” said Justice Fortas.
Students found Tinker’s story to be inspiring. “She knew before going to school that wearing that armband would get her in trouble, and she didn’t let that stop her because she was doing what was right and standing up for what she believes in. That’s really inspiring because not many people our age are passionate about [things], which is not good,” said Lauren Malesky, a sophomore Political Science major. Kristen Costa, a sophomore English Education major, agreed with Malesky stating, “I like that they didn’t want her to wear the armband and she did it anyway. She knew that there would be consequences.”
Tinker and Hiestand want students to know that being able to express yourself freely in schools is still an issue today. Just a few weeks ago, a 25-year-old college student was handing out copies of the United States Constitution on his campus in Modesto, California. An officer approached the student and told him he could only distribute in a “designated free-speech area” that must be reserved in advance. The student was forced to stop handing out copies of the Constitution, on Constitution Day (Sept. 17). According to Fox Nation, “one in six of America’s 400 largest and most prestigious colleges have ‘free speech zones,’ limiting where speech can take place.”
Recently, two middle school students in Pennsylvania, were suspended for wearing their “I (heart) Boobies” bracelets to promote breast cancer awareness. The case went to the federal appeals court, which ruled in favor of the students’ First Amendment right to wear the bracelets.
“It’s important to remember that Mary Beth’s case is written on paper, laws are written on paper, they’re not carved in stone, and they can change. We’re seeing a lot of that these days. That’s part of the reason we’re on tour. Just to remind students, you have the right, it’s time to use it,” said Hiestand. Social media is one of the most powerful ways to get a message out to the public. Hiestand spoke about the power that students have right in the palm of their hand. If you can’t express yourself at school, use social media. Students have the right to voice their concerns about an institution that they are consumers of. “It’s time in 2013 to use those rights, take advantage of these new speech tools that are available out there.”
Tinker said that she could never have imagined at 13-years old, that her case would have become so meaningful. “I grew up and I became a nurse, and I slowly started realizing how important this case was, and what an important landmark it was for students’ rights. One of my tip offs of how important it was is when I saw my case in my nursing textbook, when I was in nursing school,” said Tinker.
Tinker spoke about the importance of raising your voice. If someone is afraid to stand up to something alone, look for others who believe in the same cause as you. Tinker encourages students to use their voice to help the world grow and become a better place. “Rights are like your muscles, if you don’t use them, you could lose them. If you know your rights and use them, it keeps our democracy alive, and it keeps your ability to express yourself alive, and your creativity alive and your power alive too,” Tinker stated.
The Tinker Tour has just launched and will continue to visit schools around the country this fall. For more information about the Tinker Tour, visit www.tinkertourusa.org.

Over 100 people attended the annual Meet the Greek event in the Pratt Recreational gym. The event was an opportunity for students to get to know the Greek organizations on campus.
The turnout, according to Michelle Seke, a Sociology major, was amazing. Seke is also the President of the Inter Fraternity Sorority Council (IFSC), which played a role in making the event possible this year.
The IFSC is an organization that unifies all fraternities and sororities. It also plans and coordinates all major events and programs concerning Greek life on campus. There were 14 traditional and cultural fraternities and sororities present.
Traditional organizations are often referred to as the National mainstream Greek organizations, while the cultural organizations are based on the multi-cultural diversity among their members. “[This is] a great outlet for freshmen to get involved on campus,” said Seke.
The crowd this year was diverse, as it is every year. Supporters from other sorority and fraternity chapters also participated this year. The so- rorities and fraternities who performed their strolls and dances this year were: Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Alpha Xi Delta, Lambda Pi Chi, Lambda Upsilon Lambda, Zeta Phi Beta, Sigma Iota Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Phi Sigma Sigma, Delta Sigma Theta, Kappa Alpha Psi, Kappa Sigma, Omega Phi Beta, and Lambda Sigma Upsilon.
Each fraternity and sorority had a table set up that was stocked with information and history on their organization, and they were ready to share what they were about with those who revealed their interest in joining.
The gym was buzzing with excitement, and Jesus Cardenas’, a senior and a Business Administration and Film major, voice could not be heard over the chanting and cheers of each fraternity and sorority. Cardenas is the president of Lambda Sigma Upsilon and served as the event’s announcer for the night.
There are 134 students on campus that are currently a part of a Greek organization and there is no limit as to how many students can join, however, many organization base entry on a specific grade point average (GPA).
The fraternities and sororities performed special chants and dances that were practiced for months prior to the event. This was also the time when each organization would perform their stroll, a line-dance specific to each fraternity and sorority. Everyone who participated in Meet the Greeks was proud of their accomplishments as an organization, espe- cially Delta Sigma Theta, a sorority that was celebrating their centennial this year.
Seke, who is a part of the sorority Sigma Iota Alpha, insisted that joining a fraternity or a sorority is one of the best ways to network and secure a stable life. “It’s an opportunity to be a part of something bigger than yourself,” Seke added.

It is that time of year again! SGA wants to welcome all the new and returning students to our beautiful campus of LIU Post. For those of you who do not know, SGA stands for Student Government Association. SGA does many things here at LIU Post. Our goal as student leaders is to develop a place where the student body feels comfortable to state their positive and negative feedback about our campus. We also sponsor and work closely with each club and organization to make them be as suc- cessful as possible. Whether you are a resident or a commuter, SGA is here to help make your school a home away from home. There are many ways to get involved on campus and SGA is a great way to do it.
Along with every other club on campus we have an executive-board. Our e-board consists of: Dan Potenzieri, President; Kiara Braithwaite, Vice President; Melina Gonzalez, Parliamentarian; and Nicole Balnis, Treasurer. Anyone is welcome to become a senator and we highly en- courage you all to come to our meetings every Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Top of Commons in Hillwood. SGA also has four different committees: Student Activity, Food, Campus Quality & Security, and Academic. Each committee has office hours where you can go and meet with some- one to express your comments and concerns. As members of SGA we work hand and hand with faculty and administration to ensure your voice is heard.
SGA worked diligently over the summer to make LIU Post even better for the upcoming year. One of the changes that SGA worked on
this summer was finishing and perfecting the fishbowl in Hillwood. We also played a key role in ensuring facilities worked on repaving some of the roads around campus, as well as the parking lots. One specific park- ing lot was the one near the music rehearsal building. Maybe one of the biggest questions SGA asked was about our graduation ceremony. We made sure the new President and Vice President understood the impor- tance and tradition behind the Great Lawn ceremony, and as a result, we confirmed graduation would be held on campus this year and not in the Barclays Center which was rumored for last year. As members of SGA we work hard to get your voices heard. We all share a common goal in bet- tering the campus community, so come out and help make a difference in your school where you can watch the changes happen!

The official home page for LIU was, at the beginning of the fall semester, changed again. Why is the home page different now? What do these changes in design mean, and how will LIU students respond in exchange to these new changes?
Changes to the new website include a new interface, where students can browse the home page, and look at the new carousel that depicts images of LIU Post, including various headlines like,  “Career Connections,” “Where You Want To Be,” and “Powerhouse Professors.”
Jackie Nealon, chief of staff and vice president for enrollment, campus life, and communications, provided various reasons regarding the abrupt changes to the LIU website. She stated, “The technology that drives web design has changed dramatically since the current LIU site was launched in 2009. What was cutting edge four years ago seems old-fashioned today.”
Nealon continued, “In order to best serve our students and most effectively tell the LIU story, it is critical that we refine our digital presence.” Students, however, are divided about the new website, and its appeal to the eye.
Farhaan Niaz, a senior Broadcasting major, was optimistic as well. Niaz stated, “It’s different in a way, and it looks better than before.” Niaz, like Parmar, is pointing his eyes ahead, to see what else will be in store, regarding the website in progress.
However, other LIU Post students were not as positive. Angelique Vito, a sophomore Management major, labeled the new website as “odd,” when asked about the new design. She stated, “I was confused about where everything was.” She continued, “All 5 schools on the same home page was really confusing.” Unlike Parmar, and Niaz, Vito instead found the minor changes, a little “weird,” a first glance.
Nealon emphasized, “We aim to enhance the site’s functionality, make it easier to navigate, update the look and feel, and increase its integration with social media.” She stated, “Changes to the website are being made in phases. Some interim design solutions were implemented in time for the start of classes, new admissions pages will go live shortly, and a full redesign of the entire site will follow in the coming months.”
Will students become accustomed to the new website? Well for right now, one thing is for sure. It is safe to say that the new LIU website is certainly attracting students’ thoughts, eyes, and minds. Students can expect more changes to the website, in the next couple months.

If you know anything about LIU Post’s eating culture, you know that the masses of students that flood Hillwood during common hour is comparable to Macy’s department stores on Black Friday. And if you dorm on campus, you know that the Winnick waffle bar is not a satisfy- ing solution to a Sunday brunch fix. But what is the solution to these hunger pains? Dining off campus!
We inhabit a commuter campus, which means any given student has a friend with a car, or is the friend with the car. Good grub is waiting to be devoured just outside our front door.
Whether you’re a commuter or a resident, everyone enjoys some good frozen yogurt once in a while. Right down Northern Boulevard in the Wheatley Plaza shopping complex is the beloved self-serve sweet shop, Red Mango. If you’re craving delectable deli sandwiches, you might want to try Ben’s Deli, which caters to all and is completely ko-
sher.Have a hot date and a couple of bucks to spare? Gentlemen, take notes. Bar Frites is the perfect impresser, dishing out top of the line French cuisine in a lovely atmosphere. It’ll have your special someone cooing, “Ooh la la” in a heartbeat. Ben’s Deli and Bar Frites are also lo- cated in Wheatley Plaza.
Some other notable restaurants on the North Shore include Bar- ney’s Restaurant, which serves contemporary American fare housed in an old country inn.
Interested in crossing the culinary border? Well, Tex Mex Cactus Café serves up authentic Mexican eats in a space that closely resembles a hopping Mexican cantina. And if you’re looking for real-deal Italian cui- sine then head over to Forest Avenue Pizza. The pizzeria offers multiple Italian favorites from only the freshest ingredients, and has gluten-free
options as well. “Forest pizza is the best pizza I’ve ever had,” said Alexandra
Roxin, junior Childhood Education major. “[Since] I have a gluten allergy, it’s my go-to place for Italian food. Everyone who works there is very friendly.”
If you want to break your hunger for Italian without breaking your bank, check out Amalfi’s Pizzeria. On Monday nights, the restaurant has a special offer that allows you to have a beverage, a soup or salad, one of their delicious entrees, and a dessert for only $13.
Another cheap eat not too far from campus is Sweet Tomato, which serves piping hot soups, assorted pastries, and unique panini sandwiches assembled on homemade bread. Sweet Tomato also caters to the health- conscious with diet-friendly items.
Salivating yet? Good, I’ve done my job. Now go out, and get some grub.

After facing Dowling College and Millersville University this week, the LIU Post men’s soccer team brought home two wins. Junior forward Eivind Austboe continued his hot streak scoring in both games, one of which being the game-winning goal. These wins bring the Pioneers re- cord to a still undefeated 6-0.
The Pioneers hit the road Wednesday, Sept. 18 for their East Coast Conference season opener against their rivals, the Dowling College Golden Lions in Oakdale, NY. An uneventful game quickly changed gears in the second period when senior forward Cemil Turan scored the first goal of the night off a pass from senior back Eirik Bjoernoe. Things were looking up for the Pioneers until the Golden Lions’ graduate forward Kariym Balthazar answered with a goal of his own, with only 10 regulation minutes remaining. The fans at this contest sat on the edge of their seats for a suspenseful overtime. Austboe broke the suspense just past four minutes into the extra period off an assist from sophomore mid- fielder Alex Billington. The Pioneers brought home their fifth straight win, beating Dowling 2-1.
The Pioneers traveled to Pennsylvania to play the Millersville Uni- versity Marauders on Saturday, Sept. 21 for their last of five straight road games. The Pioneers wasted no time putting numbers on the board. Just under 15 minutes into the first period, graduate midfielder Tom Bowen scored the first goal of the game off an 18-yard pass from sophomore midfielder Matias Ruiz. The Marauders didn’t even have a chance to an- swer. Junior back Oscar Kjellstrom set up Austboe for his seventh goal
of the season. Millersville tried to catch up less than 10 minutes into the second period when senior forward Andrew Dukes scored the Maraud- ers’ first goal of the game, but their efforts weren’t enough. The Pioneers beat the Marauders with a final score of 2-1.
The Pioneers stay home this week to host the Philadelphia University Rams on Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 3:30 p.m. and the New York Institute of Technology Bears on Saturday, Sept. 28 at 2:30 p.m.

As summer ended, along with its beloved TV show hits, the buzz for the autumn TV line-up is a good bounce-back from summertime sadness. The fresh fall TV season offers brand new shows, recurring favorites, and even some spin-offs. There are a lot of upcoming premieres from September to November.
A new show that is receiving a lot of hype is Fox’s “Sleepy Hollow.” The show premiered on Sept. 16 to a staggering 10 million views, and a rating of 3.4. “Sleepy Hollow” puts a fresh spin to the classic tale of the Headless Horseman and Ichabod Crane. This is a modern-day version, with Crane and the Horseman transporting from the Revolutionary War era into today’s Sleepy Hollow town. Tom Mison portrays the infamous Ichabod Crane, and his depiction is amusing and sincere in the “fish-out-of-water” role. The first season of this modern- day retelling seems to hold some promise as a new drama/fantasy favorite. “Sleepy Hollow” can be watched Monday nights at 9 p.m. on Fox.
Another eagerly awaited newcomer is ABC’s “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D,” based off of the Marvel Comics’ organization. S.H.I.E.L.D (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division) is the same organization that was seen in the last “Avengers” film. Clark Gregg returns in his role as Agent Phil Coulson, and the show will revolve around Coulson and his team. The entire pilot was screened at San Diego Comic-Con this past summer, and was met with a positive reaction from the crowd and critics. It is certainly a show to watch out for, especially for fans of Marvel and “The Avengers” film. “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D” premieres Sept. 24 on ABC.
Apart from new shows, the fan-favorites are returning for new seasons. The popular zombie show, “The Walking Dead,” is returning for its fourth season on Oct. 13. This season will introduce a character from the comic books that the show is based on. This is an incredibly well- received show, and the fourth season will more than likely please the audience.
Some other fan favorites that are coming back for new seasons are “American Horror Story: Coven,” “Once Upon A Time,” “The Vampire Diaries,” “Modern Family,” “Sherlock,” “New Girl,” “Boardwalk Empire,” “Doctor Who,” “Elementary,” “Homeland,” and many others.
There are a few spin-off shows premiering this fall season. Coming off of the popular “The Vampire Diaries” (TVD) is “The Originals,” which was hinted at in the fourth season of TVD. It follows the original vampire family, which all other vampires descend from. “The Originals” follows familiar character, Klaus Mikaelson, and his family. It airs on Oct. 3.
Another spin-off show airing soon is “Once Upon A Time in Wonderland,” inspired by the popular fantasy show, “Once Upon a Time.” The story alters Alice’s tale to better fit the world of Storybrooke, the fictional town in “Once Upon A Time” where there is no magic, and all the popular fairytale characters live. Alice’s non-fairytale counterpart is in an asylum in London, and that is where her story begins. “Once Upon A Time in Wonderland” airs on Oct. 10.
The fall TV lineup looks promising this year, with many interesting shows making their first appearances, as well as many old favorites returning for new seasons. Let us know what your favorite fall TV shows are or which ones you are looking forward to the most at liupostpioneer@gmail.com. Your review could potentially be published in the next issue of the Pioneer.

In 1974, Stephen King was in need of a change. His first two novels, “Carrie,” and “Salem’s Lot,” both took place in small towns located in his home state of Maine. A step out of the comfort zone was in store, so King packed up his bags, taking his wife and children to visit a place called the Stanley Hotel in Boulder, Colorado. Nearing its off-season, the hotel was practically deserted, its halls empty, but for an unusual history – the Stanley was allegedly haunted, said its workers.
King awoke one morning on his stay, lighting up a cigarette and gazing out into the nearby mountains. By the end of that drag, King had formulated the bones of what would become “The Shining” – a roaring success of a novel, published in 1977 and adapted into the classic film directed by Stanley Kubrick. It’s a story recalled in those haunted halls of the Stanley Hotel – renamed the Overlook – that would drive troubled alcoholic writer, Jack Torrence, into insanity.
Taking an opportunity to be the winter caretaker for the Overlook, Torrence tried to find solitude and focus for his writing. Just like King, the fictitious Torrence struggled with alcoholism and was at one point a teacher, a writer and a family man, which included his young son. But unlike King’s real son, Owen, the young Danny Torrence had a strange power. He had a “shining” telepathy that acted as a defense mechanism to the macabre spirits that laid siege to the Torrence family at the haunted hotel. After the destruction of the Overlook, and Jack Torrence, in an unnatural winter fire, Danny and his mother kept running, running, running. Thirty years later, we finally find out what became of the fatherless telepathic boy, the ghosts of the Overlook and their supernatural world.
“Doctor Sleep” is a vastly expanded telepathic world. Moving from the direct years after the destruction of the Overlook, through the ‘90s and to the current day, the novel is very smartly structured. The first chunk of “Doctor Sleep” is filled with a lot of exposition, dealing with Dan’s struggle and overcoming of alcoholism – something he has used to drown out the ghosts of the Overlook that still make an appearance from time to time – and revealing the agenda of a dangerous group of psychic vampires called the True Knot.
The True Knot are led by a beautiful but very dangerous woman named Rose the Hat — aptly named for a top hat she wears at an unnatural angle on her head. The group feeds on the life energy of “shining” children. They have set their eyes on a very powerful young girl named Abra Stone, who eventually psychically reaches out to the now middle-aged Dan for help. The striking thing about the character development in “Doctor Sleep” is how gradual and comfortable it is. Unlike “The Shining” which was practically an isolated incident, King guides us through the maturity of his characters and takes them across both country and time, making the novel feel like an epic adventure.
We see Dan join Alcoholics Anonymous after hitting rock bottom. We see him find work at a New Hampshire hospice, helping the elderly into the afterlife with his powers and developing the titular nickname, “Doctor Sleep.” At the same time, we grow up with Abra. At a few months old, Abra projects early images of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks into her parents’ dreams. A few years later, there is a very strange incident involving levitating spoons. Years after that, Abra sees the death of a young telepath in the Midwest at the hands of the True Knot, setting off a dangerous chain of events. When the bulk of the novel begins, Abra is firmly set at 13 years old, while Dan is around 40. But her youth is rather deceiving, especially for people like Rose the Hat, who at first underestimate her. Abra is very, very determined to stop the reign of the True and – with the help of Dan and a few others – follows through in a thrilling journey of self discovery and telepathic warfare. One heartwarming scene depicts Abra’s full-on realization that she is not alone in her power. Sending humorous psychic images back and forth as they sit at a bench and discuss their plan to take down the True once and for all, Dan gives Abra a name for her power: shining.
As usual, King adds a witty tang into his writing. It is as if there is an aftertaste to the words, making use of the short, quippy inner thoughts of his characters and referencing popular cultural in a semi- satirical manner. The use of cultural context consistently finds its way into King’s novels, helping to ease the reader into a reality that can be shaken and twisted. A sense of normality later reveals a shady underbelly of vampires, telepaths, ghosts, and sinister forces. At 66 years old, King is not slowing down. He’s very much a man in and of the times, who sure as hell knows how to soak in the world around him and let it flow into his work.
“Doctor Sleep” was released on Sept. 24 through Scribner Publishing. The novel is over 500 pages, but is a very quick read with its thrilling pace. It is available at a bookseller near you at the hardcover price of $30, as well as online and for tablet devices. If you have some spare time between classes and liked “The Shining” or enjoy a good book on the supernatural, “Doctor Sleep” comes highly recommended.

Today marks National Comic Book Day. The unofficial holiday is not known nationwide, but it is an interesting holiday nonetheless. As a kid growing up, one of the more popular comic books was Captain Underpants. They were always a big hit with kids during book sales and during the elementary school and middle school years. The books would crack everyone up and people shared the enjoyment of reading the comics.
The origin of National Comic Book Day is still uncertain, but it is believed to have become a big hit because of the amount of people that share a bond through reading and talking about comic books.
One of the reasons why a lot people like comic books is the idea of good prevailing over evil. A lot of people find themselves in some way, shape, or form relating to the “good guy.” The Superman and Batman comic books are filled with intrigue and suspense, which keep the reader on their seat. It is a much different story, and feel, from the movies.
“I was always a big fan the Batman comic books,” said junior Education Major Joseph Ansalone. “They kept me entertained and amused as kid. He had the coolest weapons and best car. He is one of the few super heroes that doesn’t have a super power. He’s just the man.”
“I was never really a big fan of comic books,” said said Nicholas Laspina, a freshman Physical Education major. “I am more a fan of the Superman and Batman films. I like both series a lot.”
Some of the more recent and popular movies that have come out within the last year have been the Marvel action movies, such as The Avengers. These movies have taken comic book characters like the Incredible Hulk and Captain America and put them in a battle against evil. This idea has obviously been a big hit, as it has made over $600 million in the movie industry.
Another interesting thing about comic books is that they are a great collector’s item. There is a rather large market for selling comic books. Some have sold in the high thousands, even millions. “Action Comics 1,” released in June of 1938, was sold for $2.16 million making it the highest sold comic book ever, according to an article by The Independent.
Comic books have come a long way. They started out as soft paperback covers, and now they are created into multi-million dollar movies. I plan to celebrate this holiday by whipping my old “Captain Underpants” out of the box and dusting it off. How do you plan on celebrating?

When this question turned up on The Pioneer’s story board, one single thought surged through my brain: Tina Fey. I volunteered to write the article instantaneously, and here I am. The reason I was so incredibly willing to write this piece is because Tina Fey is everything I aspire to be. Understandably, I want to be a writer and (I think) I already have the adorable funny girl part down – so if I could choose to be anybody for even a day, it would be her.
I remember back in the days of middle school; I was flipping through the channels one gloomy afternoon, and a program on VH1 caught my attention. It was a compilation of some of the best moments from the 2000s of the hit sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, and there was this woman on screen talking about the show, who looked awfully familiar. It then dawned on me that the woman was the same ac- tress who played Cady Heron’s math teacher, Ms. Norbury, in the ever- beloved pop culture phenomenon Mean Girls. I remembered how much I enjoyed Fey’s performance in the movie, and only discovered after seeing it that she was responsible for its inception, having written the script.
The gloominess of the day cleared as I read up on all of Fey’s numerous achievements. In her star-studded career, she has received
seven Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, five Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Writers Guild of America Awards. She had an impressive nine-year run on SNL, in that time being a staff writer for the production, and acting as co-anchor to Jimmy Fallon on SNL’s Week- end Update segment. She became a household name with her spot-on impersonation of Sarah Palin. After leaving SNL in 2006, she created the television series 30 Rock, which skyrocketed to popularity thanks to ingenious writing. You could imagine my excitement two years ago when Fey announced she’d be writing an autobiography. Bossypants was the first item on my Christmas list that year, and I read it cover to cover before winter break commenced.
So, why would I want to be Tina Fey? She’s a creative force to be reckoned with. She’s a highly successful celebrity all due to her dedication to her craft. She’s one of the greatest talents in the comedic world. Her humorous anecdotes found in her Weekend Update jokes and in her best-selling book are enough to make any fellow writer green with envy. She is my hero, my role model, and my reservoir of self-confidence. Fey’s persona is one for the history books, and her career is one any aspiring writer – like yours truly – would be forever grateful to inherit.

The LIU Post football team was handed its first loss on Friday, Sept. 20 when the Bentley University Falcons defeated the Pioneers 38-24. The Falcons (2-1) scored 21 unanswered points during the final 6:30 to close out the game to steal a win from the Pioneers (2-1).
Junior quarterback Steven Laurino finished the contest completing 16 of his 31 pass attempts for 196 yards. Although he threw two touchdowns, Laurino also threw two interceptions and fumbled in the fourth quarter. Freshman wide receiver Michael Richardson made five receptions for 84 yards and a touchdown. Senior wide receiver Joe Botti also caught a touchdown in the loss. Botti has found the endzone four times already this season and has scored at least once in every game.
The first half was an offensive struggle for both squads as the Falcons led 10-7 going into the break. The score at the end of the third quarter certainly did not make it seem like this game would be a shootout. At the end of the third, it was evened up at 17-17.
Less than two minutes into the fourth quarter, Pioneers’ freshman running back Mike Williams broke free and sped his way to a 48-yard touchdown to make the score 24-17 in favor of LIU Post.
However, this was the last time the green and gold rejoiced. The Falcons answered back a few minutes later with a touchdown of their own. Senior quarterback Danny Guadagnoli launched a 65-yard touchdown to sophomore wide receiver Chris Walsh to once again tie up the game with just over eight minutes left to play.
On the ensuing possession, Laurino fumbled and Falcons’ senior linebacker Mike Marini recovered the ball to give excellent field position to Bentley at the 38-yard line of LIU Post. Guadagnoli needed only two plays to give the Falcons the lead 31-24. This time, junior wide receiver Jeff Hill was the beneficiary of a touchdown pass from Guadagnoli.
The Pioneers came up empty with a three-and-out as they tried to respond back to the Falcons stealing away the lead. At the end of their offensive sequence, the Pioneers punted from their own 18-yard line. However, the punt by sophomore Tim Sternfeld was 29 yards giving the Falcons a short field.The Guadagnoli-Hill connection delivered the back-breaking blow as with 2:22 left in the game, the two found each other for a 34-yard touchdown to give the Falcons a 38-24 lead, which proved to be the final score.
On the defensive side of the ball, junior defensive lineman David Sumter finished with six tackles and 1.5 sacks. Senior linebacker Rob Bright added 13 tackles in the loss.
The next time the Pioneers play is on Saturday, Sept. 28 on the road against the University of New Haven (2-1) at 1:00 p.m.

Have you ever thought about what sound a fox makes? Probably not, but a comedy duo from Norway did. Brothers Vegard and Bård Ylvisåker made a song about it and got more than 40 million YouTube views in just two weeks. This year’s Gangnam Style is called “The Fox.”
“Dog goes woof, cat goes meow, bird goes tweet and mouse goes squeak,” that’s how the Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis begins the hit song “The Fox.” After listing a bunch of animal sounds that we’re all famil- iar with, they head on to the tricky question: What on earth does a fox sound like? Think about it – if you were to imitate one, what would it sound like?
That is the theme in “The Fox,” a song with a colorful music video that went viral since its upload in early September 2013, and just entered 29th place on Billboard’s Hot 100 list last week.
“The Fox” is available for purchase as a single on iTunes and it recently became official that Ylvis signed an album contract with Warner Music in the U.S. The number of YouTube views grows rapidly by the hour, and is now at a speed of around two million views a day.
The comedy duo has their own late-night television show called “Tonight with Ylvis.” They produced the song and video together with Stargate, (a New York-based Norwegian production company known for working with Rihanna, Ne-Yo and Beyoncé, and other artists), and the plan was to air “The Fox” on the season premiere of their show. Even though the Ylvis brothers expected to get some attention for it in Nor- way, they never imagined popularity of this magnitude.
They were also surprised to hear many people compare their song to “Gangnam Style,” last year’s super hit by South Korean pop star Psy, which today has more than 1.5 billion YouTube views.
“What surprised me the most was that even the earliest comments on YouTube were: ‘This is going to go viral,’ and ‘this is the new Gang- nam Style.’ Normally, we get some hits and get some comments for our work, but they’re all about the actual contents of the songs. But these comments were about ‘The Fox’ as a phenomenon, and that was really strange to read,” the Ylvis brothers said in a recent Billboard interview.
The music video “The Fox” has already become popular in the U.S., and many new YouTube videos have popped up, where people post their interpretations of the song. Just last week, a marching band at Ohio University performed “The Fox” instrumentally in front of a large crowd to kick off a college football game. That video already has over a million views.
So what makes “The Fox” so popular? Could it be the humorous theme? Also, who makes a song about fox sounds? In addition, the lis- tener never really finds out what the sound a fox makes. However, here are plenty of suggestions. “Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!” or “Hatee-hatee- hatee-ho!” are just two of the suggestion, so could it perhaps be the funny potential fox sounds that appeal to listeners?
Maria Lysén Kotti, a senior International Business major, says that the irony makes the song. “The fox song is ironic, but the artists sing the lyrics in a very serious tone, which adds a lot of humor to it,” she added. “Also, if you ignore the lyrics and simply focus on the melody, you’ll probably hear simple, but catchy vibes that sound pretty familiar to ‘Gangnam Style.’”
The melody does have a simple pop or house vibe to it and there are similarities to the “Gangnam Style” beat, a beat that easily sticks due to its simplicity. It is difficult not to hum the rhythm after hearing it.
But could it also be the music video that catches the viewer’s attention? The singers and a bunch of extras wear animal costumes while singing at a cocktail party, dancing in the forest, and run into a fox in
the woods. A Dalmatian dog makes a toast, a yellow chicken shakes his feathery head while dancing, and a mouse walks down the stairs while drinking champagne. There is simply a lot of fun and peculiar stuff to watch.
With such popularity on YouTube, fame and fortune is a likely next step. There is plenty to fetch in ad revenue, and the Ylvis duo has also gotten many new offers. In the Billboard interview, they say: “Oh we’re getting extreme offers. Fully booked tours, record deals from all the biggest companies, and it’s strange; we’re kind of a band, but not musicians.”
It is pretty amazing what millions of YouTube views could mean.
