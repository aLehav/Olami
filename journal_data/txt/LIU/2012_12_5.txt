Every May, LIU Post students and their families convene at Post for a ceremony that marks the end of their academic career — and that has been the tradition for 53 years, according to Kenneth Mensing, LIU Post historian.
That tradition became a thing of the past when LIU President David J. Steinberg announced, on November 28, that the 2013 Commencement Ceremony would be held at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
The announcement, issued by Steinberg’s office by email to students, faculty and staff, stated: “On Thursday, May, 16, 2013, LIU will celebrate the success of every one of our students at a single commencement ceremony.”
The move, according to LIU Provost Dr. Paul Forestell, was under consideration since the summer of 2011. Steinberg, university officers and the Board of Trustees, made the final decision.
The Barclays Center reached out to LIU, “and asked to set up a relationship where we would be the designated university sponsor with the Barclays Center,” Forestell said about the move. The partnership partially involved the LIU Brooklyn campus Division 1 Basketball team.
Under the long-term partnership with the Barclays Center, LIU has special access to events, discounted tickets, special mention during games and the use of facilities for events, such as the commencement ceremony.
Cost was another factor that determined the move. The university, which has recently undergone an expensive new rebranding initiative, is trying to cut the cost of the commencement ceremonies or at the very least keep it the same. Yet, “That’s a hard one to determine until we’ve been through it once,” Forestell said.
Some of the cost-saving measures are already at play, “We won’t be setting up the huge tent on the Great Lawn,” he added. The tents, which have been raised each May since 1999, cost a quarter of a million dollars, according to Steinberg.
The change of venue isn’t the only adjustment to the commencement ceremony. The ceremony, which was scheduled for May 4, 2012, was adjusted twice before the November 28 announcement; once for May 10 and then May 11, before it was decided that it would take place on May 16, 2012.
The dates were changed to accommodate the difference in semester schedules; LIU Brooklyn operates on a 15-week semester while Post operates on a 14-week semester. “In order for us to have a university-wide commencement, we’ve got to wait for the Brooklyn campus to finish,” Forestell said.
The move to have the commencement ceremony held at the Barclays did not come soon enough to change the calendar. “We have a calendar problem this year. There’s no question about it,” Steinberg said.
“As a New Jersey resident and one of the lucky few able to enter directly into the workforce, I can’t travel into Brooklyn and sit for the commencement,” said Mike DiFilippo, a senior Photography major.
“I appreciate the LIU unity and everything, but I went to LIU Post,” said Ara McPherson, a senior Sociology major. “I know the students of LIU Post and I feel as though the class of 2013 of LIU Post is my graduating class, not the class of 2013 Long Island University,” she added.
Post will host Deans’ Recognition and Awards ceremonies on May 10 and May 11, 2013. At these ceremonies, deans will recognize students by name and graduation photos will be taken. All graduating student are required to wear caps and gowns.
Previous Post commencement ceremonies have been organized by Dana Weiss, associate provost for Business Operations and Auxiliary Services. However, Weiss announced her resignation on November 15, 2012, effective January 1, 2013. Weiss has not responded to request for comment.
Now, a group of staff members will handle the commencement ceremony at the Barclays Center. Those members will work on the logistics and the planning of the university-wide commencement, according to Forestell.  And to alleviate the concerns that are being raised by the Post community, since last week’s announcement, a campus “task force” of faculty, upperclassmen and staff members is also being formed, according to Forestell.
The move to Brooklyn is being met with mixed reactions from the Post community.
One of the nicest things about graduating from Post, according to Dr. Barbara Fowles, professor and chairperson of the Media Arts Department, is that students get to bring their families to the campus in the spring when it’s at its most beautiful. “The Barclays Center may be glamorous and is probably a great place for the Brooklyn ceremony, but it means nothing to Post students, and will be difficult for everyone to get to. So I think the whole business is sad,” she added.
“If it is an opportunity to join together all of the hard working students of the LIU campuses, I think it is something us students should be grateful for,” said Brittany Scelza, a senior Public Relations major. Yet, “the fact that one of our proudest days is going to be so chaotic and dragged out makes it something less exciting to look forward to,” she added.
The university plans to address those concerns by streamlining the event, according to Forestell. “We may not have as many honorary degree recipients, we may cut out some things. It may take longer, but the ceremony itself shouldn’t be much different than the timing at Post,” he added.
“I hope most students go to the commencement ceremony because it’s going to be a phenomenal event,” Forestell said. “However, I want to make sure that students graduate with an opportunity to celebrate on campus as well.”
Steinberg opposes the idea that this move is his final initiative before he retires in the fall. “It has little to do with it being my last year. It has to do with the fact that for the first time since the university has been founded, we can gather everyone together to celebrate the students who are graduating,” Steinberg added.
“[I hope that] this move will be embraced as an opportunity for the university to feel whole, connected and combined,” Steinberg said.  “If that’s the case it’s worth doing. If it doesn’t work and if there’s a deep sense of anger — well, that’s my successor’s problem, but we’ll probably continue doing it anyway because we are one university.”
However, for some at Post, the sense of campus loyalty runs deep. “Post students live, dorm and attend school here. Why graduate elsewhere?” said Rachel Ipsen-Reisses, a freshman International Studies major. “Post has a sense of community. Students take pride in their campus and should graduate with Post students at LIU Post, end of story.”

	The Writing Center’s new program, “Recover Writing,” that was launched November 4, helps students affected by Hurricane Sandy with academic papers to support them in finishing the semester despite the hard times. 
	“I don’t know how to rebuild a house and I’m not able to fix their electricity, so I decided to use my academic knowledge to help,” said Ed Niemczura, adjunct professor of English, who also works at the Writing Center. 
“Recover Writing” is a program designed to help students, who were affected by the hurricane, with their writing based homework for classes, no matter the subject. Because LIU Post’s Writing Center has limited space for appointments due to all the days missed from the natural disaster “Recover Writing” is a way to accommodate students. The program allows students, who are unable to get an appointment with a tutor from Post’s Writing Center, to have the opportunity to receive writing help from writing centers at other participating colleges from around the country as well. The tutors from both Post’s Writing Center and writing centers from other colleges work with students on grammar, structure, organization and other parts of formulating an academic paper. 
“The Center reopened to LIU Post students on Monday, November 12, [after being closed for 11 days, including weekends] but is experiencing very heavy volume. However, thanks to the efforts of Belinda Kremer, Director of the Writing Center at Post, writing centers at other colleges and universities around the country have agreed to help LIU Post students with their academic papers,” said Dr. Paul Forestell, LIU Post provost. 
The Writing Center at Post can help up to 40 students a day; however, after the hurricane the volume of students who were seeking help with their writing assignments exceeded that limit.  If a student wants to make an appointment, and there are no appointments available, the student is given the option to use one of the 30 participating college’s Writing Center. The student has a choice to go on the campus and meet with Writing Center’s tutors face-to-face, or have the session via email or Skype. Select colleges offer phone services for students to ask quick questions without waiting for an appointment.
The participating colleges allow students to go on their campuses, although many don’t normally grant access to other students who do not pay tuition, according to Niemczura. He added that similar services could cost between $75 and $100 a session, but “Recover Writing” is free. 
	Niemczura and Kremer worked together to come up with the idea for “Recover Writing.” Kremer declined to comment on the program because all of the previous publicity has focused on mostly her, although they are a team. Kremer came up with the idea for the program and contacted the other colleges across the country to ask for their participation in the program. Niemczura created their Facebook page, answers the emails from students and touches base with the other colleges involved. 
	Post’s Writing Center has tutors that are mostly graduate students with diverse degrees. All tutors go through training that takes the duration of a semester. 
	“The schedule filled up after Sandy; there are a lot of back to back appointments now,” Christopher Leach, health care administration graduate student who works as a tutor in the Writing Center, said. He has directed students to other colleges participating in the “Recover Writing” program and has also been the tutor for affected students. Leach has tutored in a Skype session and said that they use a share screen to open the paper they are working on so that it is visible on both screens, which helps make the virtual option effective.  
	“The students I’ve told about it [Recover Writing] are not only excited about it, they are spreading the word: networking it, liking it and sharing it with their friends. Sharing the page is a good option if you are unable to donate clothes or food,” Niemczura said. The page currently has over 200 likes. 
	On the Facebook page, the participating colleges are able to connect with college students who were affected by the disaster. The Facebook page, created November 4, has an individual post for every participating school that states what is offered and how to contact the school. The student can go through the page and find the tutoring that best suits their personal needs. Students can go directly to this page; they do not need to go through Post to be able to take advantage of this service. A few schools even offer help for affected high school students. 
	“It’s very accessible,” Nicole Cosentino, English graduate student who works in the Writing Center, said.  “We made a conscious decision to create it on a Facebook purchased page. It takes a long time to create a webpage.  Facebook was quick and students already know Facebook, so we put the time into the Facebook page instead of waiting 3 weeks before we can offer the help,” Niemczura said. 
	If a Post student wanted to get involved with helping this program, the best way to do so is by liking and sharing the page. A student who is not already a tutor at the writing center cannot help by coming in to tutor because the new tutors would need to go through a semester-long training. However, he said by liking the page and sharing it to make the program known to those who need the help is an amazing thing in itself. To find the page, search the words “Recover Writing” in the search bar. You do not need to be a member to view the page. 
	The program will last as long as there is a need for it, according to Niemczura. He said that students will still feel stress from the storm through finals and possibly through the beginning of the spring semester. Niemczura adds, “The point is to not turn anyone away. The point is to get them the help they need.”
	The Writing Center is located in Humanities 202. It is open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Friday 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. The Writing Center can also be contacted at 516-299-2732.

It’s early December and the city is already sparkling. Fifth avenue is filled with contrasts: Families in matching outfits, couples holding hands, men in suits, fashionable women, and tourists with cameras and running-shoes, all encountering the christmas traditions of the big apple.
Ice rinks, lights, spectacular window displays, and holiday shopping attracts millions of visitors, both from far and near, to experience the timeless and beautiful streets of Manhattan. Here’s four ways to find holiday spirit in the city:
Watch the sparkling lights – Good feelings don’t have to be expensive. During the holiday season, the city is embellished with beautiful lights and decorations to bring out your festive mood. Walking down Fifthth avenue, with the impressive and costly window displays often accompanied by holiday tunes or passing by the famous Rockefeller center Christmas tree, is a great way to welcome the holiday feeling. Located between Fifth and Sixth avenue in the middle of 49th and 50th street, the tree is lit daily from 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m until early January. The top holiday window displays are at Lord & Taylor, Macy’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Barney’s, Bergdorf Goodman, and Bloomingdale’s.
Ice skate in the city – If you’re a restless soul looking for activities, visit one of Manhattan’s most popular ice skating rinks. The Rockefeller Center Ice Skating rink is located in the heart of Rockefeller Center. Enjoy skating with friends and family against the backdrop of New York city with the Rockefeller Christmas tree close by. If you want to move away from the busy city avenues, the Wollman Rink in Central Park is another option. Put on your skates and enjoy the site of the Midtown Manhattan skyline, as well as the beautiful park environment. For urban hearts there’s “the Pond” in Bryant Park, an ice skating rink located among sky scrapers in Bryant Park, close to several huge city attractions on 42nd street between Fifth and Sixth avenue.
Shop presents and decorations – It’s no secret that the Big Apple offers some of the world’s greatest shopping opportunities. Whether you’re seeking exclusive gifts, or shopping on a student budget, there’s something to be found. Macy’s is filled with gift-ideas for everyone, in all price classes, and there’s often a discount to apply. Visit the in-store Santaland on the 8th floor for a trip back to childhood, and see snow-capped mountains, twinkling lights, candy canes, and of course, Santa Clause himself. If you want to stay outdoors, visit the holiday shops at Bryant park with special boutiques selling clothes and accessories. Drop by for a snack at one of the food kiosks, and sit by the fountain located next to “the Pond”, only a short walk from the Rockefeller Center.
Be entertained – There’s numbers of musicals, and theaters that celebrate the holiday with traditional shows. The annual Radio City Christmas Spectacular performs through December 30th for prices starting at $39. With high kicks and holiday themes, accompanied by christmas music, the Rockettes are sure to amaze. At the Lincoln Center you can watch “The Nutcracker”, performed by the New York City Ballet. Tickets starts at $29 dollars and go up, and runs until New Years Eve. On the Broadway scene, you can watch “Elf: The Musical”, up until January 6th, and “A Christmas Story: The Musical”, ending at December 30th. Prices vary, and tickets can be found with a quick search on broadway.com.
So whether you’re budget is limited, or you have some money to spend, the Christmas spirit is available in the streets of Manhattan, any day of the week.

Bill Eichenberger, sports reporter and editor for the online publication, The Bleacher Report, was the second speaker of the Food for Thought lecture series this semester. During common hour on Thursday, November 29, in Humanities 027, Eichenberger shared his thoughts on the rules of newsgathering and reporting. With his 40 years of experience in the business, he discussed what he called the “school of hard knocks” with students so they could know what to expect in the journalism field.
Standing up to speak with the audience, Eichenberger started off talking about his mistakes during his career with a list of things not to do. “Don’t be afraid to fail,” he said.  He explained his stuttering problem and how that affected his talking to sources and gathering information. “[My mother] wanted me to be a librarian so I wouldn’t have to talk to people but that was not what I wanted to do, that was not my passion… the best advice that I would give is to confront your fears…don’t accept that status quo.”
Eichenberger went on with more advice, such as: “Don’t cut corners,” “Don’t take constructive criticism personally,” and “Don’t underestimate your influence.” Each word of wisdom was followed by an anecdote from his life, from his time working at his school newspaper, the University of Georgia’s Red and Black, to interviewing Derek Jeter for Newsday.
After his speech, students took the opportunity to ask questions. Mimi C. Montgomery, asked him about his career. “Have you ever covered anything besides sports?” asked the junior journalism major.
“I covered six counties in southwestern Virginia and covered everything from a murder on the Appalachian…to city council meetings,” he answered. Even as a sports reporter, he believes that it is better to be well-rounded in every area of journalism, especially when first starting out in the business.
“I liked his speech; it was very informative,” said Akilah Courtney, a junior electronic media major. “He gave truthful answers as opposed to just telling us things that we wanted to hear.”
The Food For Thought lecture series brings speakers in the media field to campus several times during the semester. The lectures are free and open to all students. The next and final lecture will be held on December 6 during common hour in Humanities 027. Jennifer Jo Janisch, producer at CBS Evening News-Weekend Edition, will speak.

	On Saturday, December 1, the LIU Post women’s basketball team defeated the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights (5-2) by a score of 73-68. The Lady Pioneers (4-0) remained perfect due in large part to senior center Samantha Kopp’s huge game on both sides of the ball. Kopp scored 12 points, grabbed 13 rebounds, blocked seven shots and played physical defense all game long on Bridgeport’s best scorer, ECC Preseason Player of the Year Tanisha Carter. Kopp and the LIU defense made life difficult for Carter who ended dropping 14 points on a rough 6-22 from the floor. 
	The first half was sloppy from both sides as there were turnovers throughout the first 20 minutes of action. Sophomore guard Chelsea Williams sparked the offense early for the Lady Pioneers as she showed a variety of different looks to score the basketball. Williams attacked the basket to draw contact and get to the foul line. She showed her mid-range game and also drained a couple of three-pointers. At the end of the first half, despite being unable to control the ball on offense, the Lady Pioneers still led 31-23. 
	With just over six minutes left remaining in the game and the Lady Pioneers’ lead ballooning to 18 points, it appeared as if the game was easily in the hands of LIU, but that was not the case. The Purple Knights went on a run fueled by junior guard Aziza Patterson. She scored 15 of her 24 total points in the final six minutes of the game to cut the huge lead to as little as four points with 40 seconds left in regulation. 
	Despite the late run, the Lady Pioneers did enough to defeat the team’s East Coast Conference rivals. This game signified the ECC opener for both squads, as well as the home opener for the Lady Pioneers. 
	Senior forward Nicolette Marciniak, previously recognized as the ECC Player of the Week earlier this season, and Williams both led the Lady Pioneers with 18 points apiece. Marciniak was in foul trouble late in the game, but she still managed to make plays late in the game when her team counted on her the most. Williams finished with 18 points (6-13), five rebounds and three assists.
	The Lady Pioneers had excellent play from its guards the entire afternoon, especially when it came to rebounds. Senior Ashley Caggiano finished with six points, seven rebounds and five assists. Junior guard Alexis Peters had seven points, secured seven rebounds and dished out four assists. In addition, junior guard Kenyatta Sears stifled her opponents defensively as she caused several turnovers with her aggressive style. 
	Although the Lady Pioneers came away with a victory, there are improvements that need to be made. First and foremost, winning on a consistent basis is going to be extremely difficult when you have 32 turnovers, as the Lady Pioneers had against Bridgeport. In addition, it is imperative for the Lady Pioneers to shoot better from both the free-throw line and from beyond the arc. As a team, the Lady Pioneers shot 13-22 (59%) from the line and 4-17 (24%) from three-point range. 
	The next game for the Lady Pioneers is on Saturday, December 8, at home against Pace University (5-1). Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org to hear all your LIU Post basketball coverage. Pregame starts at 1 p.m., with tipoff scheduled for 1:30 p.m.

Is this end for Mark Sanchez? The fourth season was supposed to be the year where everything turned around. There would be no more silly, rookie mistakes when dropping back to pass. His confidence would be at an all-time high. There would be no quarterback controversy because he would have learned enough through his first three seasons to no longer repeatedly make the same types of interceptions over and over again. 
Yeah, about that fourth season…
It’s not how Sanchez drew it up and it’s definitely not how head coach Rex Ryan, general manager Mike Tannenbaum, and owner Woody Johnson thought it would play out. No, the fourth season was supposed to be similar to that of the other New York quarterback (and I’m not talking about the Bills here…), Eli Manning. Sanchez was supposed to have made significant improvements, but it’s the same old mistakes game after game. On Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, Rex finally had enough and pulled the “Sanchise” in favor of little-known Greg McElroy. 
Tim Tebow was not active for last week’s game due to an injury to his ribs, so McElroy filled in and orchestrated a touchdown drive on his first opportunity at the helm late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Though only passing for 29 total yards, McElroy completed five of his seven passes, and got the team on the board when they hadn’t done so all game long previously with Sanchez.
Sanchez was relieved of his duties after an ugly performance. It was downhill from the first play from scrimmage for Sanchez. He stepped back to pass, surveyed the field, had plenty of time, and ended up heaving up a pass off his back foot directly into the waiting hands of Cardinals’ safety Kerry Rhodes. It was the type of interception that just wanted to make you give up on Sanchez completely. 
The Jets edged out a 7-6 victory over the Cardinals, who have now lost eight games in a row. The Jets improve their record to 5-7, but the playoffs are very bleak for Gang Green. Although there is a consistent media circus surrounding the Jets, Rex has an intriguing decision to make at the quarterback position for this weeks game against the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-10). 
Does Rex resort back to Sanchez who helped him lead his squad to back-to-back AFC Championship games in his first two years as Jets coach? Does he go to the fan-favorite in Tebow? Or does he go to the relatively unknown, under-the-radar play-caller in McElroy? 
As if this Jets season couldn’t get anymore interesting, right?

In their first ECC game of the season on December 1, the men’s basketball team defeated the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights, 89-71, at the Pratt Center. 
 Four Pioneers players scored double-digit points, with junior forward Vaughn Allen leading the way with 23. Allen shot 7-12 from the floor and made nine of his 12 free throw shots. Senior guard Tobin Carberry shot 8-16 from the floor and shot 3-4 from outside the arc. He finished the game with 20 points of his own. Freshman guard Emile Blackman and senior guard Billy Butler contributed 10 points each by the end of the game. 
As a team, the Pioneers shot 55 percent (33-60) from the field and 69 percent (9-13) from three-point range. The Purple Knights shot 48 percent (28-58) from the field and just 28 percent (4-14) from behind the arch. 
Like previous matchups last year with the Pioneers’ ECC foes, the game started off close. The Pioneers and Purple Knights spent much of the first half vying for the lead. Through the first 10 minutes of the half, there were nine lead changes and neither team could pull ahead by more than five points.  
It wasn’t until there was 7:08 left in the half that the Pioneers took a 30-22 lead off a three pointer from Carberry. It was the first time either team had extended the lead past five.  The Purple Knights cut the lead to five when Darian David scored a three-pointer a few minutes later. The Pioneers countered with a 7-0 run, highlighted by a layup from Allen and a three-point play by Carberry. LIU Post ended the half with a 45-35 lead. 
In the second half, LIU Post picked up where they left off at the end of the first half and controlled the play from start to finish. The Purple Knights pulled within 10 points several times in the second half, but never mounted a serious comeback. The game ended with an 18-point victory for the Pioneers. 
The second half performance was one of the team’s strongest of the season. They put up 44 points, 12 of which came off turnovers, and did not relinquish the lead once. The Pioneers move to 2-3 for the season and 1-0 in ECC play. Their next game is on Saturday, December 8, at Dowling College at 3 p.m.

Both of New York’s basketball teams, the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets, sit atop the Atlantic Division. The two squads are also the best teams within the Eastern Conference only behind the Miami Heat. The Knicks are coming off a 106-99 win against the Phoenix Suns last Sunday afternoon.
The Knicks are currently 12-4, as they started off the season with six straight wins, the best they’ve done since the ’93-’94 season. Carmelo Anthony leads the team averaging 26.6 points per game, and is followed by Raymond Felton who averages 15.1 points per game. J.R. Smith, Tyson Chandler and Steve Novak are the next highest scorers and have had a big impact early on in the year. Chandler is currently leading the team in rebounds with 8.9 per game. Behind him is Anthony with 6.9 boards per game. Felton leads the team in assists and Jason Kidd leads in steals.
In their latest win against the Suns, Melo put up 34 points to further their home start to 7-0, the best it’s been in 20 years. Felton also had a great game with 23 points and seven assists. Chandler added 15 points and 13 rebounds in the win. Although this was a great victory for the Knickerbockers, power forward Rasheed Wallace was ejected a meager 1:25 into the game after a hard hit to Luis Scola and having words with the referees. The Knicks will suit up against the Charlotte Bobcats in North Carolina
tonight at 7 p.m.
Across the Hudson, the Brooklyn Nets had their five-game winning streak screech to a halt after 102-89 loss to the Miami Heat. Brooklyn kept the Heat at bay for the first two quarters, leading 59-50 at the half. The Heat trailed the whole game but managed to go on a 10-0 run with 4:41 left in the fourth quarter to snag the win.
Center Brook Lopez leads the Nets averaging 18.5 points per game. He is trailed by Joe Johnson with 15.6 and Deron Williams with 15.4. Reggie Evans leads the team off the bench with 8.4 rebounds per game, and Williams leads the squad with 8.9 assists per game. The next game for the Nets is at home on Friday night against the Golden State Warriors at 7:30 p.m.

Believe it or not, Netflix has vastly improved its online streaming library over the last few months. Here are some films to take a peek at:
Oldboy – If you’re looking for a thriller that features quality character development, a deep engaging plot, and epic fight scenes, Oldboy is a must see. Korean filmmaker Chan-Wook Park delivers on his trademark vengeance plots and stomach churning visuals. Not a film for the easily queasy or uncomfortable, Park often likes to push and pull his audience with graphic scenes of sex and violence. Don’t be discouraged however; this film is worth every uncomfortable and intense moment. In the end you will be left wide eyed and with incomprehensible satisfaction.
Netf﻿lix synopsis: With no clue how he came to be imprisoned, drugged and tortured for 15 years — and no one to hold accountable for his suffering — a desperate businessman seeks revenge on his captors, relying on assistance from a friendly waitress. (Subtitled)

	TellTale Games recently released the last episode of “The Walking Dead” video game series completing the entire story. It’s an interactive point and click game with quick time events, some puzzles, and a lot of decision making in choice of dialogue and how to proceed in surviving. This is not really an action-based game as one might expect a zombie game to be. This is completely story-driven. However, every decision you make affects the outcome of every character in the story. The plot revolves around Lee, who was taken to prison near Atlanta, Georgia after being convicted of killing a state senator who was having an affair with Lee’s wife. When the sheriff, who drove the car, hits one of the zombies, Lee finds himself stuck in an apocalyptic nightmare of zombies and survival. 
What I really enjoyed the most about this game is the character development and the graphic style that was chosen. You feel close to the characters and emotionally invested, especially when a character dies. The graphics make everything look like it was drawn in a comic book and given 3D affect to make it come alive; very appropriate for a series that started as a comic book. There is also a lot of suspense and always a feeling of uneasiness when playing. You never know what will go wrong and who to trust. There are some good scares that give the game a much more eerie feeling. I do recommend this game for those of you who love zombie games, but also want something more drama based.
However, I feel there are some issues that need to be addressed. First, if you hate story-driven games, you will hate this game. It’s very slow at some points and a lot of it is looking around and solving problems. Also, this is the kind of game you play through once and then that’s it pretty much. There’s nothing else that it offers. You can replay and try different decisions but the story will be in the same parameters. The story can only divert so far from the linear plot despite this being a “decision” based experience. Still, this game is different and very interesting with a great style. 
 Steam is currently selling “The Walking Dead” for $24.99. The retail price at local game stores has not yet been announced. I recommend waiting for holiday sales on Steam as I have no doubt that they will have a discount for this title. My rating for this game an 8/10.

	“Deadlight” is a new 3D graphic zombie-themed platformer game from Tequila Works S.L. available on Steampowered.com. It follows Randell, who is traveling to Seattle to find the last known stronghold for survivors in hopes of finding his family and friends. It takes place in the 1980’s where a terrible disaster led to the rise of the zombies, also called shadows. 
This game is really fascinating since I only know of zombie-games where you’re shooting them down one by one as they come at you in massive hordes as in “Left 4 Dead.”  This game takes a different approach where you only have your wits and timing to get past the zombies. This is more of a survival-based game. You gain weapons as you progress, but you have to use them wisely or else you will drain your stamina, which leaves you vulnerable. The style of the game is grim and foreboding with a sort of washed-out look. Everything looks surreal and dark. It also has some decent scares. For example, you could be walking to a platform and suddenly a zombie comes out of nowhere. I also like how the zombies look. They are dark and shadowed with red eyes, which for this game, looks appropriate rather than the blood-dripping and rotting flesh look we usually see. 
	There are some problems with “Deadlight.” It ran pretty slow when I started it. At first, I thought it was my computer so make sure your computer can handle the graphics and frame rate. Also, during cut scenes, the sound and voiceover just stops for no reason which is honestly a stupid glitch that I have yet to see updated with a patch. However, the bigger problem I have with this game is it doesn’t save! There are various checkpoints but they are so far from each other and if you don’t reach it when you shut off the game, you have to start from the beginning again. A lot of games use the checkpoint system and that’s fine but for this kind of game there really should be a save system or an indicator when you’re at a checkpoint. There is no reason why you can’t pick up right from where you left off. I had to redo stages several times and it’s completely unnecessary. 
From what I understand after reading comments online, “Deadlight” is a really short game. Some players finished it in 3 hours so you’re paying around $15 dollars for a short, average 3D indie platformer. I don’t know about you but that’s seems pretty shallow. I feel like this should be at most an $8 or $10 game since its extras are pretty pointless. All you’re getting is the single-player story-based game and once you finish the story, that’s it. Wait for a sale to pick it up for a better deal. It’s on Steam for download at around $14.99.  My final rating for “Deadlight” is a 5.7 out of 10.

	The WiiU, Nintendo’s latest console, has finally been released as of November 18, just in time for the holidays. Since this console is on a lot of people’s wish list this year, the question remains if this launch will be a success or a bust? This is a great concern since the Wii had good intentions and some success with games like “Mario Party 8.” Many games ported to the console were not well executed as the remote style control is extremely limited. 
For the hard-core gamesters who like Halo and other extremely cutting edge games, the Wii was NOT the console of choice by any means. The WiiU is trying to get into the gaming ring with a console that is meant to bring a new generation of games forward. The biggest innovation is the WiiU Gamepad, which acts as the main controller and introduces features that create a different kind of gaming experience. The gamepad is touch screen with two analog sticks, a D pad, and several buttons. It looks rather clunky to some but from what I see, it’s easy to hold. The best way I can explain how this works is by looking at some of the games that were immediately released such as ZombiU and NintendoLand. The gamepad screen is integrated into these games. For example, in ZombiU, you use the gamepad to customize your weapon, scan your TV screen in search of hidden items, and as your map.
	The main issue with this new console is that the games really have to showcase the technology the WiiU is trying to convey to people. It needs to prove it’s the real deal and that it will bring new and fresh games to the table, and not just a gimmicky one-time use toy that would make a cool present for your little brother or sister. Besides games, the WiiU is also said to have more features like NintendoTVii which allows people to use the console to stream programs from Hulu, Amazon, and other web based services including the Nintendo Network which will allow players to access an EShop to download game titles straight to their console. 
	Consoles today are trying to be much more than just games, to be a complete source of media-based entertainment including TV, Internet use, and online shopping. Still, the WiiU brings very interesting ideas to the table and a new way to program games by using a gamepad to make game play more interactive. Also, the WiiU introduces the Pro-controller, which has an uncanny resemblance to the X-Box 360 controller. However, this makes practically any game compatible with the WiiU since the control scheme will be easy to program for. So far, a large list of games has been announced for release this coming winter and next year. While I am cheering on Nintendo to get back on its feet, I am still worried that this launch with the current games might not be enough to make the WiiU as successful as it needs to be. I have seen the system and many people whom I know have said that the system is solid and so far has no problems. The WiiU is currently being sold at $299.99. I don’t think I’ll be getting this console yet but it’s definitely worth looking at and keeping an eye on.

On November 19 around 7 p.m, students took a break from their academic studies to gather in the lecture hall located in Hillwood Commons for a special campaign against bullying. Like my roommate, the first thought that probably popped into your mind was, why was this program being held on a college campus, after all isn’t bullying a high school thing? Surprisingly, while bullying has always been seen as a right of passage for young children into teens and teens into adulthood, over the years bullying has turned into in an epidemic leading to many suicidal incidents among college students. Before the night began, I was able to catch up with Samantha Vega, a senior english lit major here at Post and one of the lead coordinators for the event. When asked what her expectations were for the campaign she said “leaving lecture hall, I want everyone to have a sense of unity in a smaller scale and actually bring it out to other people.”
The night was interestingly informative. After a brief background on bullying, several counselors took the stage introducing themselves and the many forms of bullying. I haven’t been bullied for a while but when I was bullied, it was usually by some kid, who was probably older than me or bigger than me, picking on my threads and calling me outside of my name. However today because of advanced technology, cyber bullying has become pretty popular. Now anyone can sit behind their computer screen and bash someone through social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and many more. Nonetheless, the counselors explained that bullying takes place not just in school and over the internet but it is commonly explored in organizations such as sport teams, fraternities and sororities, through hazing, in living communities such as dorming on campus, and even in the workplace.
After the introduction the program shifted from the audience listening to actually participating. Eyes glanced around as everyone anxiously waited for directions in the fishbowl. The activity consisted of everyone forming a giant circle. A few of the coordinators stood in the circle asking a series of questions. Whenever the question related to an individual, one would step forward in the circle. Cliche much? Freshmen biology major, Luchena Belizaire thought so; while she found the program to be good overall she had opposite views on the activity chosen saying “the game we played was so cliche, I know everyone in the room had played it at least once.” Although Belizaire may have been right about everyone being familiar with this activity, students were reluctant to play at first, shyly edging their foot inside. As they moved into the circle, eyes glanced around, as it was allowed, to see who else would be stepping in. But by the by the last question, the cliched activity had served its purpose allowing students to see that they were not alone. Some of the questions included being bullied for race, religion, style, and most shocking; political party.
The last segment of the program which was my favorite consisted of a few members from the poetry club S.N.A.P.P.S. The readers read two poems each: one written by themselves and the other written by a famous poet. The lecture hall grew silent as poetic words fluttered from the lips of the readers and unto the ears of the audience. I personally took a delight in Maya Angelou’s poem Phenomenal Woman because she is one of my favorite poets of all time. Without a doubt each poem allowed the audience to experience what it would be like to be in another person’s shoe.
The campaign lasted about an hour and a half. To me, my hour and half was well spent. While it was not meant to stop bullying overnight, the intention of the campaign according to Vega, was to give an insight into the epidemic and develop a sense of unity. Even though it seems as we’re are too small to make a difference, saying hello or even giving a smile can help someone who may be in need. I hope to see more opportunities like this on campus where we can be encouraged to be the solution and put an end to these problems.

	It is uncommon for students in a new environment to find a club on campus that they immediately connect with. Some students may want to join any club to make new friends while others want to be a part of something more than just a club. To be part of a community that can be called family, to form bonds that will last forever, and to create a culture on campus that has an unshakable foundation is what I was looking for, and I found it at LIU Post’s B.A.S.I.C.
This club in particular caught my eye just from the name of it: Brothers And Sisters In Christ, B.A.S.I.C. The name of a club says a lot and is one of the first things students see when looking to join. When I think of brother and sisters, I usually associate it with family. However this is a different kind of family; actual brothers and sisters in Christ. You may have guessed by now, B.A.S.I.C. is a Christian club, but is not limited to Christians. In fact, it is encouraged for non-believers and students of other faiths to come and ask questions they may have or discuss matters of Christianity. All are welcomed.  
So how does a club like this get started in such a secular world? I sat down with the president of B.A.S.I.C., Joshua Manning, for the details. 
In the fall of 2011, Manning sought Don Mann, Information Technology Systems Manager, who introduced Manning to the club. However, it had been inactive for some time due to the lack of students. Manning, a junior Electronic Media major, along with Karena Roberts, Treasurer of the club and President of the Anointed Voices Gospel Choir, decided to reignite B.A.S.I.C., but had somewhat of a different vision for the club. “It’s different than the traditional stuff,” Manning says. “It’s not a Bible study or a lecture, students get that all day. We look into a scripture, talk about it and keep it moving.” Manning feels strongly about keeping Christianity pure. “[Some] tradition is dangerous, people try to Americanize Christianity, and in doing so it has stunted people’s spiritual growth.” He says it can teach values but can also cause social issues, “but to fight against this and fight against that is not always what God wants from us. Sometimes he calls us just to be different and keep our focus on him and not on the differences between us.” 
Roberts, a junior Social Work major, feels that B.A.S.I.C. is serving its purpose. “It brings fellow brothers and sisters in Christ together in union. It’s not your average club, it’s a family and I’m glad to be part of it.”
Manning describes B.A.S.I.C. as being a group here for the students. “We’re not Bible thumpers and we’re not here to make people feel bad about themselves. We’re here to help students get through whatever is going on.” He adds, “We want to establish B.A.S.I.C. as part of the community that’s built on faith with social responsibilities.” It looks like the club is just getting started. 
Manning and Roberts both have high hopes for the future. In their last meeting, they spoke about upcoming events in the spring. B.A.S.I.C plans on having a Valentine’s Day event, calling it LIU’s ILU which stands for I Love You. Very creative! You can be sure that love will be the theme there. The club also plans on hosting or co-hosting an event for Spring Break, but that’s still in the works. 
The reason I advocate B.A.S.I.C. is because I personally know how much their message can change a person’s life. Not one of us students can say we are perfect or are problem-free. Not one of us can say we don’t struggle with everyday issues or personal situations where we wish we just had someone’s help. There is an answer and a solution for everything, but we’re so blinded by temporary fixes that we fail to see the real solution. Now I know what the world has perverted and twisted Christ to be, but I embolden those who are looking for something more to life, to put everyone else’s view aside and draw a conclusion for yourself. 
The meetings are laid back and relaxed. Almost like break from your busy day. It’s not like every other usual “meeting.” Come as you are and check it out for yourselves. B.A.S.I.C. meets every Thursday at 12:45 during common hour in the Hillwood Commons Cinema. Bring your lunch and bring your friends. Even bring issues that you may be struggling with, B.A.S.I.C. is here to help.

	I was on my weekly spot on 808’s and Fastbreaks last Wednesday with LIU Post grads Matt Soldano and Max Caster and we were talking about MTV’s new show Catfish when a very difficult question was posed to me. Is it worse for your significant other to cheat on you physically or to be involved with someone else emotionally and telling the other person that they love them? At first, I didn’t know how to answer. If you really think about neither option is exactly appealing.
	Personally, I think it would be easier for me to get over the physical act, like if it were a one-night stand. For my boyfriend to tell another girl that he loves her though? I don’t think that is something I could ever get over, not that I would have an easy time getting over the sex either. Being emotionally involved, to be in love and committed to another person is very difficult in the first place, at least in my opinion. It’s rare and hard to find. Sex doesn’t have to involve emotions, under certain circumstances it just happens. Of course the two people are going to be attracted to one another but that’s very different for having feelings for someone. 
	When I asked three of my girl friends the same question, they all agreed with me. They would have any easier time getting over the physical act as opposed to emotional commitment. One said that some people have sex for different reasons; they just want the physical sensation, for the ego boost of being able to feel like they can get any girl they want. There does not have to be emotions involved.
	However, when I turned the tables and asked Max and Matt they disagreed, they both thought the physical act would be more unforgiveable. They couldn’t fathom getting over the physical act. The guys thought that the physical cheating would be more intimate then just some harmless flirting. I agreed with them there, a little flirting is no big deal. It would be the love thing I wouldn’t be able to wrap my head around.
	Either way, one option is not exactly better then the other. It ultimately comes down to choosing the lesser of two evils. But really people, don’t do either to your spouse, you wouldn’t want it done to you. To put it bluntly, cheating sucks. More often then not, both people end up hurting, not just the victim.

We are in the middle of the holiday season. Thanksgiving is over and Christmas is coming up. All over the world for many people, Christmas is a time to watch beloved movies with family and friends. Here is a list of 10 movies you should include in your vacation plans.
Elf: Will Ferrell plays the role of the sugar-loving elf, Buddy, who chooses to flee the North Pole to get reunited with his New York-based father, played by James Caan. The plot revolves around Buddy trying to save his father from Santa’s naughty list, while trying to integrate into a new cynical society. If you love Ferrell, you have to love Elf, as Ferrell plays the role as the enormous elf in his recognizable style, creating ample amounts of laughter.
Love Actually: This romantic movie is a must see for all couples during the holidays. Starring Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Rowan Atkinson and more, the British comedy has many main characters falling in love during an eventful Christmas in London. Characters fall in love, and fall out of love with both the right and wrong people. Love Actually is an entertaining movie about 8 people who follow their hearts, in four different stories, all of them ending at Heathrow Airport. 
How The Grinch Stole Christmas: How the Grinch Stole Christmas tells the story about the city inside a snowflake, Whoville. Everybody in the town loves Christmas, everybody but the cynical Grinch. The Grinch despises the Whos and their love for the holiday with great wrath, and plots to steal the Christmas away from them. The Grinch is a comedy movie for the whole family, starring Jim Carrey as the Grinch. 
Die Hard: For most people it is surprising that Die Hard makes the list of the best Christmas movies, but it is in fact one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time. Yes it is violent, no it’s not a family friendly movie, but it takes place during Christmas, it has Christmas carols in it. Bruce Willis plays NYPD officer John McClane in his fight to save his wife from terrorists. Die Hard is a movie to quench the thirst for action, during a time filled with family movies. 
The Polar Express: A computer animated movie from 2004, telling the story about a young boy who boards a train headed to the North Pole and Santa’s home. In this film, an extraordinary train-ride unfolds; taking the boy on a journey of self-discovery as the train travels through a series of unexpected events teaching the young boy to believe in his dreams. The Polar Express is a great drama for the whole family to watch. 
Mickey’s Christmas Carol: In 1983, Walt Disney produced the world famous short film featuring all our favorite Disney characters: Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck and Goofy.  The film is this base for all Christmas movies, as it illustrates the important things during the holidays: family, peace and happiness.
The Holiday: A romantic comedy, with Jude Law, Jack Black, as well as Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz who play two women with guy-problems. They decide to switch homes over Christmas holiday, where they both fall in love with a local guy; but the drama doesn’t stop there. The Holiday is a movie that puts you in the perfect holiday mood. 
Home Alone: Eight-year-old Kevin is accidentally left behind when his family travels to France for Christmas. Two idiotic burglars are breaking into the neighborhood, and Kevin has to defend his home. He sets up creative traps to stop Harry and Marv, while his mother is desperately trying to get home.
Home Alone 2: One year after Kevin was left home alone, he finds himself in New York City and the same criminals are not far behind. With credit cards and cash, he makes the Big Apple into his own playground, trying to stop Harry and Marv’s huge holiday-heist, with a massive battery of booby traps. 
National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation: There is no Christmas without the Griswold’s. The family plans for a seasonal celebration, but things never run smoothly for Clark Griswold. Some obnoxious family guests arrive, but he manages to keep going, knowing that his Christmas bonus is due soon. 
	Now you should be better prepared to meet all the movie options you are presented during the holidays. Home Alone 1 & 2 should definitely be included, and classics like The Grinch and Mickey’s Christmas are movies you can watch over and over again. Good luck with your movie choices!

Halloween and Thanksgiving have passed, November has come to an end, and it’s time to wish Christmas (and finals) a warm welcome. It’s getting colder and darker outside, and looking at the pile of schoolwork that has yet to be demolished, life can seem very depressing. However, Christmas is all about happiness, so why not turn your dorm into a holly jolly Christmas, if only to relieve some stress off your shoulders? Now, our residence halls have pretty strict decorating policies as far as Christmas goes. You can’t hang up lights or have candles. But don’t let that stop you.
Put on some Christmas music (a Christmas spirit requirement). Start with cleaning your dorm room. Yeah, that has probably not happened very often for the past months. Go ahead, your room deserves it. It is almost surprising how much dust and dirt one room can collect in a short amount of time.
Once the room is clean, head over to the local dollar store at the Broadway Mall, which has many different seasonal decorations, like stockings and garlands. Get some and put those on your door.
Go to Walmart or Target and pick up a small and cute Christmas tree and decorate it with ornaments in whatever size, shape and color you desire. Then, do your bed, and get Santa pillows or Santa hats and throw them on top of a red bedspread.
Be creative if you are trying to stay within a budget. Make snowflakes out of white print paper and attach them to walls or windows. Find gift boxes and wrap them up like they were presents and attach them right next to your beautiful snowflakes. Ah, you didn’t know you could be this artsy, did you? And here is a suggestion if you’re too lazy to do this yourself: go to a kindergarten and have the kids draw you Christmas drawings or make snowflakes. It is cute, and you can tell people that there is a story behind your decorations this year. Playing with children also tends to be a good stress reliever.
“I really wish we could have Christmas lights in our rooms. I don’t understand why, and I don’t know what else to do with my room either. I don’t think I’m going to decorate my room this year, but if I was going to, then I would hang snowflakes on my window, and garlands,” said junior Education major Mia Hansen.
“I’m going all out this year. I’ve got a couple of different advent calendars and a mini Christmas tree. Then, my friend and I are going to make a fake fireplace and put a Christmas tree and presents in front of it. And then I’m going to snow spray my window, and hang mistletoe above my door. My walls are going to be decorated with snowflakes,” said sophomore International Business major Ruth Fredriksen.
Take a picture of your decorated room, and send it to the Pioneer (cwpstpnr@gmail.com) to be published.
Christmas is all about being creative. Happy Holidays!

The Xi chapter of the Hermandad de Sigma lota Alpha, Incorporada sorority teamed up with the Phi lota Alpha fraternity to bring the ninth annual poetry reading and cultural showcase called Letras con Sazon to campus on November 26 in the Tilles Center Atrium. The event showcased students reading original poems as well as professional poets such as Bonafide Rojas, featured on season four of Def Poetry Jam, a show on HBO that showcases up and coming poets, and Peggy Robles-Alvarado, a recipient of the 2012 Mujeres Destacadas Award, an award created by the online magazine La Opinion to award the accomplishments of Latinas in the Los Angeles area. The event started at 7:30 p.m. and was hosted by Nuyorican poet Papo Swiggity. In total, five students read along with the two professionals. 
The event was an outlet for students to come and express themselves and their creativity. “I saw the flyers around campus about how they wanted [readers],” said Simone Medley, a senior psychology major. Medley was one of the presenters and said the event sparked her interest because poetry has been a hobby of hers for so long. “I have been writing for 11 or 12 years… I write about whatever I’m feeling.”
 “Stephanie told me to come and spread the gospel,” said another presenter, Jeremiah Ariles, an undeclared major freshman. “I like to write about the Bible…but more down to earth, more involved in what I go through. It is what I believe in, what I do.”
“This event is to bring poetry awareness [to the campus]. It seems to be overlooked but it is an important form of art,” commented the sorority’s community service chairperson Stephanie De La Cruz. “Our sorority is always working to improve cultural awareness on campus.” The two main poets, both of whom were Latino, recited original poems. The event was for everyone regardless of background to enjoy
“[Letras con Sazon] deals with stuff people can relate to,” added Michelle Seke, secretary of the sorority.
This is the second time the sorority and fraternity teamed up to do this social event. “It is deep rooted in traditions,” said Phi lota Alpha president Gilbert Martinez. “Our founders showcased underground poets to put on a great show. It is a great way to keep students inspired and entertained.”

The Post Library Association, part of LIU Post’s B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, held its annual book sale on Tuesday, November 27, and Wednesday, November 28, in the Hutchins Gallery in the library. On Tuesday, the sale was open to PLA members and LIU cardholders only and the public was invited on Wednesday. Both days were attended by around 50 people.
This was PLA’s second book sale this year, and the first one was held during the spring 2012 semester. This is the first year it has held one so close to Christmas. “Appropriately placed between Thanksgiving and the holiday season, this new addition to our calendar will draw attention from LIU Post students and the general public in their efforts to purchase gifts,” said PLA’s 2012 brochure, which can be picked up at the library.
The sale included donated books and media from the members, and one could find almost anything in any genre. The money raised goes back to the PLA for trips to historical places and other events like lectures and programs. Check out the library website for more information.
“I think we have done the book sale since 1992,” said office manager of PLA Derek Stadler. He has been working on the book sale for five years. “The attendance is always positive. A lot of people show up every year,” he said.
The PLA was not sure exactly how many books were sold each year, but for the holiday book sale, the association had to say no to more book donations. The price range depended on the shape of the book. The PLA ask people to hold their donations until the spring sale of 2013. 
“I loved it! I thought the book sale was great. But I think they should have it where it’s more visible to all students, instead of having it downstairs in the gallery,” said junior international studies major Madelaine Olsen, who attended last week.
“I love books, and I thought they had a good variety of books there. I’m studying Journalism, so I looked for literature that might be useful for my major. The people who worked there were really nice, too,” said junior journalism major Mimmi Montgomery.
The PLA will have another book sale this upcoming spring, the date has yet to be announced, so if you missed out on this one, you are welcome to come to the next one.
