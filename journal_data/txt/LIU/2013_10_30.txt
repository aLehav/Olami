Throughout his monthlong show on the streets of New York, the famous graffiti artist known as Banksy has turned the city into a giant game of treasure hunt this October.
Unveiling a new art piece on a daily basis, Banksy communicates with the public through social media and his website, banksyny. com. Posting only a picture of his recent work, and the located area, he leaves it up to New Yorkers to find the exact location—and they do.
People are getting swept up in the hype that is Banksy, and rush to see his art work before it is defaced. The mysterious artist, who remains unidentified to public, calls his monthly exhibit “Better Out Than In,” meaning that art is better on the streets where it is free rather than in a museum.
Banksy challenged authorites with his first piece. On October 1, he painted a kid standing on another kid’s back, reaching for a spray can inside a sign reading: “Graffiti is illegal.”
LIU Post students are captivated by Banksy and his mischievous work. Broadcasting students Rob Hairston and Karoline Onsrud defines graffiti as a visual way of seeing people’s thoughts, thus being art and a way of expression. “Graffiti is more accepted these days,” said Onsrud. “It started as vandalism, but it has developed into an impressive art form which is much more accepted these days. Banksy sends political messages that concerns all of us look at how his work makes all these people flock together!” she added. The British street artist has gone from being a cultural icon in the graffiti community to the name on everyone’s lips.
He wins his audience over with political and social messages, as well as creativity. There is often a double meaning behind his work. However, regardless of Banksy’s increasing popularity, graffiti is still looked at as an illegal action. Or is it?
Banky’s work has forced a new debate about the definition of graffiti. What started out in the ‘70s, with young people tagging their names on buildings and such, has evolved into a form competition with each artist “out-doing” each other.
Banksy has become a living example of how graffiti has expanded its limits. CBS New York reports that his drawings are being protected by plexiglass, and in some cases even by security guards.
The whole meaning behind graffiti has transformed from something that used to be an illegal action into becoming a legal way to make big money.
While certain building owners jump with joy when finding Banksy’s valuable paintings on their property, the NYPD and Mayor Bloomberg are less than enthralled by the brazen acts of the artist, according to CNN. “Graffiti ruins people’s property and is a sign of decay and loss of control,” Bloomberg said.
Despite Banksy leaving his marks all over the city, the NYPD is having a hard time finding him. The search after the elusive artist is still ongoing by law enforcement.
Although not legalized by law, there’s no doubt that Banksy’s work has opened people’s eyes to see graffiti as something more than just vandalism.

This Friday, LIU Post will have a soft opening for the new campus boutique located in the old gaming lounge on the second floor of Hillwood Commons. This will be the first student-run business on campus, which will sell unisex clothes and accessories.
Three weeks ago, a committee of five students began working with President Kimberly Cline in developing the idea of the boutique. Students on the boutique’s committee, Christina Principato, senior Accounting major, and Carissa Gallo, senior Economics major stated that the ultimate decision for putting in the Boutique was “to get experiential learning on campus.”
Students who apply to work for the Boutique through Jobnet, according to the women, will have the opportunity to be a part of the first student-run business on campus. Students can obtain jobs in sales, marketing, fashion, public relations, and social media and learn about management. All majors can apply.
Principato and Gallo stated that the Boutique is open to the possibility of student entrepreneurs being able to sell their items in the store. Half of the profits made by the Boutique will go toward student scholarships, while the other half will go toward future student-run businesses.
Principato declined to comment on how the boutique was being funded. “We are not allowed to say where the money is coming from since we are not even 100 percent sure.” Hours of business and the name of the boutique have not been determined yet.
Melanie Vanvoorhees, junior Childhood Education major, believes the new boutique would improve Post. “It’s going to benefit campus, it’s gonna provide job opportunities for students as well as more scholarships and it could definitely help people with their futures,” said Vanvoorhees. “I love shopping and adding this to campus is going to be exciting for me,” she added.
“I think it’s a great idea because it does create better job opportunities for some students that lose their workstudy and [also for students] that have workstudy, but need to get another job,” said Dana Goodman, senior Early Childhood Education major.
However, Enrique Perez, senior Criminal Justice major, said, “I don’t really feel anything for the boutique, it doesn’t appeal to me at all.” The school, according to Perez, should focus their attention on more important things like activities that would enable commuters to spend more time on campus and student life in general.
“I’m a commuter and I don’t think I’ll ever be using that,” said Jessica Hart, junior Art Education major.
To make room for the boutique, the gaming lounge had to be moved. Students were informed of the change at a Student Government Association (SGA) meeting. Students requested for the game room to be relocated, sent out emails and created a petition with 70 signatures.
“This upset me because as a freshman I didn’t have anywhere to gravitate to except the game room. It’s hard to find a place on campus that you can gather socially, and the game room provided that opportunity,” said Matthew Jarvis, senior Accounting major.
“That area is not a good space for a boutique, I’m more focused on saving the gaming lounge,” said Gerard Gilmartin, senior Digital Arts and Design major.
Daniel Potenzieri, senior Political Science major, and president of SGA, explained that he looks forward to more budget jobs being available to students, since there is such a lack of them on campus right now.
“Before we shut an idea down, lets see what happens first,” said Potenzieri. “Dr. Cline has a vision for the school to make it better. She’s very student- driven. Every plan is designed to help the student in the end, be patient.”

Job interviews can be a nerve-wracking experience. However, it plays a pivotal role in determining whether the company and applicant will make an effective match.
To help students who are interested in acing their future job interviews, LIU Post held an information session on Oct. 24 in Humanities Hall, where Geico representative Jennifer Githens gave students an informative speech on job interviews. Githens offered advice on how to prepare and execute a job interview in order to go from qualified candidate to a newly hired employee.
Students should research the company they are interviewing with and be prepared to explain what they can offer them and what they can contribute to the company. “Job interview preparation is important. Take a look at job requirements and your own qualifications for the job before your big interview,” said Githens.
Every company goes about the interview process differently, Githens said. “If you have questions, reach out before the interview and ask them.” Find out how the company likes the set up of a cover letter and resume. Githens mentioned that it’s important to try and determine if the interview will be conducted in person, over the phone, through video or in a group setting. If that is not possible, Githens advised students to try to prepare for all scenarios.
Google Yourself
The old saying about the importance of first impressions holds true for meeting an interviewer for the first time. Githens further clarified and said, “First, Google yourself and find out what you see before the interview.”
In this day and age, constant usage of social media could backfire on the interview candidates, especially if any inappropriate material is easily found. “Geico does not check the Facebook pages of applicants, but some companies do, so you want to make sure your media sites are appropriate. That goes for email addresses and ring-back songs on your phone. You want to make sure those do not hurt your professional impression,” said Githens.
Physical impressions are another crucial factor that need to be taken seriously. Dress professionally and somewhat conservatively. “For men, suit and tie, clean shaven is always preferred, even if the work environment seems informal,” said Githens. Think neutral, conservative colors when choosing a business suit. Avoid bold colors, which can be distracting for your interviewer and can be inappropriate.
Black, navy, browns, and grays work well for suits,” Githens said. “For women, a matching suit jacket and skirt is the most formal, or dress pants. Never wear a skirt that rises more than right above the knee to a job interview. Make sure the skirt fits well enough and is long enough for you to sit down comfortably without showing your thighs. Hair, for both men and women, should be clean and styled. “Make sure you look professional and well groomed,” she added.
Proper etiquette is important. Arrive early, smile and shake hands firmly with the interviewer, and keep good eye contact. Be relaxed and friendly. Your etiquette will speak volumes. Speak confidently and avoid word fillers like, “ummm” or “I don’t know.” Most importantly, show enthusiasm. “Remain engaged throughout the interview, make eye contact, smile, but not to the point that it is a teeth whitening commercial,” Githens joked.
Zach Servino, a junior Broadcast major, said, “Githens was great. Personally, I felt that I could do well on an interview even before this lecture, but she touched up little things and things that I often forget, like cleaning up anything inappropriate via social media, and how to use proper etiquette.” If asked about anything negative in your job history or profile, do not criticize former employers. Being tactful shows prospective employers that you are professional and will not say negative things about their company down the road.
Also, do not be afraid to ask questions. Githens advised students to ask questions to show the company you are enthusiastic on how you will fit into their company.
“Ask questions like, ‘How would you describe your corporate culture?’ This is a good question because it shows you what to expect,” Githens commented.
Nick Butera, a sophomore Health Science major who attended the lecture, said, “I always knew that it was good to ask questions, however I didn’t really know what good ones to ask were. Now I know it’s good to ask questions that will show your interest in the corporation.”
Roni Badrian, the assistant director of Career Development, organized the event and said, “The lecture was coordinated and developed for students to learn from a Human Resource representative who was willing to share the ‘dos and don’ts’ of interviewing that she encounters daily. It also gave students the ability to network and find out about the upcoming job opportunities that they have available.”

It is that time of the semester again; students are now able to create their schedules for next semester. Students at LIU Post are now beginning to look at classes and begin the process of making their schedules for the upcoming spring semester.
When making a schedule, there are some key things to remember.
Students logging onto their LIU account will find a section on the website that lets them know exactly when they are allowed to create their schedule and officially add classes. This section is located in the student center under the Enrollment Dates tab. It is organized in such a way that students who already have more credits will get earlier dates to choose their classes.
On the LIU website, students can look at classes and see what may interest them for their next semester. In addition to looking at classes online, students can also make their schedule by adding classes to their shopping cart. If students are on probation, have a block on their account, or are in the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP), they cannot register online.
“I have to meet up with my advisor and look at what classes are being offered next semester and what classes interest me,” said Alec Abramowitz, freshman Physical Education major. “I don’t want to get locked out of any classes that I want.” The longer that students wait to register, the more likely they are to get locked out of classes.
Another thing that is helpful to students who are creating their schedules is to sit down and have a face-to-face meeting with their academic advisor. Students who are relatively new at making their own schedules should meet with an advisor so they could get the classes they need and want.
It is also a good idea to meet with an advisor because there are several competency requirements that need to be passed in order to graduate. The competency requirements are: computer, oral, and library examinations.
The competencies test your knowledge in specific areas within computer skills, speaking/reading, and library skills. Advisors help students understand the specific guidelines/prerequisites that need to be taken while approaching graduation.
Meeting with an advisor is by appointment only; however there are times during the semester when appointments are open to walk-ins. Contact Kumble Hall to set up a spring advisement appointment.
Before making class schedules some students go to the website www. ratemyprofessor.com. From this website, students can get a gauge on the instructor and the course based on what former students have said.
Sometimes students suggest avoiding some professors over others, and that may be a deciding factor during the schedule making process.
“I always make sure to check out ratemyprofessor.com to make sure I get the teacher I want,” said freshman undecided major Tyler Talboom. “The professor is what makes the class, and I want a solid one.”
Registration for the spring semester is underway; students who haven’t already done so, should look into registering before the classes they want to take are closed.

Everyone eats Oreos differently: some twist the cookie to eat the inside first, some dunk them in milk, while others prefer to eat the cookie whole. Oreos, also known as “Milk’s Favorite Cookie,” come in various shapes and sizes to appease different palates.
This beloved cookie, in all of its shapes and sizes, has been proven to be just as addictive as cocaine, according to a recent study by Connecticut College.
Joseph Schroder, associate professor of Psychology and director of the Behavioral Neuroscience program at Connecticut College, tested the addictiveness of Oreos compared to rice cakes with some of his students by using rats in a maze.
At the same time, they issued another test, injecting some of the rats with cocaine, and the others with saline. The results of both tests were measured by the reaction of the cells in the rats’ “pleasure center” of the brain.
The researchers compared the reactions of the rats’ brain cells on Oreos and cocaine. “Our research supports the theory that high-fat/ high-sugar foods stimulate the brain in the same way that drugs do,” Schroeder said in a press release from Connecticut College. “It may explain why some people can’t resist these foods despite the fact that they know they are bad for them.”
This study doesn’t surprise many LIU Post students, and they believe junk food can be addictive. “My dad is diabetic, but he can’t stop eating sugar,” said Aaron Mann, a freshman studying Biology and Pre-med.
Ayaka Yonezawa, a junior Broadcast major, claims that people eat junk food because it’s cheap and fast to get. “[People who eat foods with high sugar/fat] should know how dangerous it is to eat junk food,” Yonezawa said.
Although students understand the risks of junk food, they still consume it. “Sugar helps me wake up,” said Soloman Hedmere, a junior Engineering major.
Yonezawa believes that students continue to consume food they know is bad for them because they are “just used to it.”

Since you began attending LIU Post, have you found out how great college really is? Or are you one of those people, like myself, who has found college to be one of the most stressful times of your life? I know it is an exaggeration – because the real world will be ten times harder, but boy is college difficult.
Every day more and more work accumulates. Between keeping up with readings, studying for tests, and working, I wonder how people do it. How do people stay sane in college? I have yet to understand how to make time to go out every weekend and sometimes even on school days—kudos to all of those who manage to do so. Care to share your secret? I could use some advice, and I’m sure so could many other students.
According to a survey taken by the American Psychiatric Association, college students have expressed the following feelings in the past year: 45 percent of students felt things were hopeless; 50 percent felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety; 30 percent felt so depressed that it was difficult to function; 36 percent felt an overwhelming sense of anger; and seven percent seriously considered suicide.
The survey also reported that 62 percent of students used alcohol and 14 percent used marijuana in the 30 preceding days.
Maintaining mental health is extremely important to overall well-being and success. College is tough, but there are ways to cope. Never let the stresses overwhelm you to the point where you feel any of the above emotions. It is not worth the damage to your well-being.
There is no reason to feel that these terrible emotions can’t be managed. The moment you feel hopeless or overwhelmed in any way, it is important to seek out help and ways of coping. Be proactive.
Maybe it is not the assignments, work, or school that stresses you out, but maybe it is something more personal. In that case, it is important that you recognize the triggers and handle the situation appropriately. No issue regarding mental health should be taken lightly, because it can always escalate to a greater, more serious issue. Stress can even trigger other symptoms, like headaches, perspiration and insomnia, just to name a few.
So whatever the issue may be, drugs and alcohol are definitely not the best ways to cope, and you know it. Find things that make you happy and relieve your stress. Make it a tradition to see a movie every Friday, or maybe attend a weekly yoga class. Whatever it is that relieves you, stick with it.

Have you ever been in class and started slowly dozing off in the middle of a lesson? If so, then you were probably suffering from sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is a condition of not having enough sleep. Online articles have shown that not sleeping enough can affect a student’s performance in the classroom. Therefore, all students should be getting the necessary hours of sleep every night, and should view sleep as a very important priority.
Sophomore Arianna Rodriguez believes sleep is very essential to college students. “Yes, sleep is very important to me,” said Rodriguez. “However, I don’t get enough of it because I usually stay up late doing homework, and I have to wake up early for my commute to school from Queens.”
An online article by Loreal Lynch, titled “Student Sleep,” published on Nov. 10, 2011, states that a lack of sleep has a negative effect on college students in a number of ways. Lynch writes that sleep deprivation leads students to have poor judgment, memory, moods, and grades. According to researchers from the University of Pennsylvania in 2008, students who were limited to about 4.5 hours of sleep a night were more stressed, sad, angry, and physically and mentally exhausted. In her article, Lynch also shows that students who stay up late have a cumulative GPA average of 2.65, while students who go to sleep earlier have a GPA average of 3.05.
Richard Renelique, a sophomore Broadcasting major, knows he needs good amounts of sleep in order to perform well in the classroom. “I can’t function well without sleep. I try to get at least 8 hours, but it’s kind of difficult to do that in a dorm like Riggs Hall because of the non-stop partying and loud music.”
The proper amount of sleep to get is anywhere from seven to nine hours for a student, according to Time magazine author Laura Blue. In college, there are many distractions that prevent young adults from getting sleep; some students who dorm hang out with their friends too late, some watch all of their favorite TV shows, others have jobs, and some participate in sports teams at school, and the while trying to juggle all of those activities in one night. It is extremely essential to give the body the amount of rest it deserves. Sooner or later, a lack of sleep will catch up with you.
Robert Gramstad, a senior English Literature major, believes enough sleep is mandatory for every student. “When I first started college, I was able to deal with five hours of sleep and just catch up by napping on weekends. But now, I have three jobs and I’m taking 21 credits, so I try to get at least seven hours of sleep a night in order to maintain energy throughout the day.”
I believe at least seven hours of sleep a night is necessary for all students. During my sophomore year, I used to get three to four hours of sleep a night, so I’ve been down that sleepless road before. Not only did it have an effect on my moods, but also it had a terrible effect on my grades. I tried to do a lot of things last year, during my first year in college, and sleep was not one of them. Now I know the importance of a good night’s sleep, and not only are my grades better, but I’m smiling a lot more too.

Space: the final frontier. To boldly go where no man has gone before – or, in this case, woman. The woman is Sandra Bullock, who stars in “Gravity,” directed by Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron (“Children of Men,” “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban”) released on Oct. 4 through Warner Brothers Pictures. This “sci-fi-action-hold-onto- your-seats-it’s-going-to-be-a-bumpy-ride” thriller stuns the audience, beginning the tale with Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Dr. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who are on a mission that goes quickly awry when an explosion of a Russian space module hurles debris at them, ripping apart their ship, separating and stranding them in space.
The idea of floating around alone in a place surrounded by nothingness, where sound cannot travel and no one can hear you call for help is simply unimaginable.
Stone continually spins for what seems forever until she finally meets up with Kowalski. The two manage to find a space module to board, but of course, good fortune is not on their side. The pair is separated, leaving Stone, once again, truly alone. Through misfortune after misfortune, Stone’s journey is inspiring. As she fights her inner demons, Stone becomes more endearing as she hovers above planet earth. The character development was important in this film and truly added to its overall wow factor.
Another highlight of the film was the visual effects. On top of seeing the film in IMAX 3D, I really felt that I was in outer space with Stone and Kowalski. The special effects were sublime and truly accentuated even the tiniest detail, such as the reflection of Earth in an astronaut’s helmet. Seeing a module explode in outer space, and without the slightest sound, was actually terrifying. When there is an explosion and the sound is swallowed up by the vacuum of space, you can never see it coming.
After its fantastic reviews from Daily News, Rotten Tomatoes, and more, the film has gained Oscar buzz for its special effects and for the Academy Award winning Bullock (for the “Blind Side”). In my opinion, both special effects and Bullock should be recognized by the Academy. The special effects team for Gravity has a great chance of winning, but I cannot say that for Bullock. I would like to see whom she goes up against. She may win her second Oscar.
“I personally enjoyed the movie because the stagnant setting forced the audience to focus on the character, Dr. Ryan Stone, and her internal struggle,” said Marissa Lant, a junior Speech Pathology major. “I definitely think that Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar for her spectacular performance. As the protagonist, her acting skills dictated the fate of the movie. In my personal opinion, the movie was a great success!”
“Gravity” definitely sets itself apart from other films released this year. Michael Biondi, an English and Film Appreciation teacher at Hicksville High School in New York, described how Gravity is unlike any other film. “The fact that it had a real-time sense of pacing gave it a greater level of suspense,” said Biondi. “We are literally watching time go by and Dr. Ryan Stone is waiting for the next wave of debris, or trying to gain access to a space station. There was no sense of comfort provided in time passing.”
Biondi continued, “What also signified a change in narrative style was the exclusion of multiple characters, locations, and plot lines. There was simply Dr. Ryan Stone’s story without any other competing plot lines. Traditionally, other films would have included scenes of mission control, or other characters back on earth. In this film, we didn’t even see the characters who were in the shuttle when the disaster took place. Which forces us as viewers to be completely immersed in this one character’s struggle.
Make your way down to a movie theatre, grab those goofy 3D glasses, and sit back, relax and enjoy Cuaron’s masterpiece. “Gravity” will grab hold of you, launching you into this electrifying and mind-blowing journey into space. You may not want to go to space camp after this.

On Oct. 23, during Common Hour, the second poetry reading of the semester featured married poets Steve Dalachinsky and Yuko Otomo. The poets presented their work to many students of the LIU Post community in the Steinberg Museum of Art in Hillwood Commons. The event was open to the public and was sponsored by the English Department. The pair took turns sharing some of their pieces that expressed their emotions when viewing artwork or listening to music.
Yuko Otomo, a native of Japan, is known for her bilingual poetry as well as her haikus. At the reading, she shared four haikus that reflected the four seasons of the year. Otomo mentioned before reading that the series was being translated into a dance piece to be performed in front of audiences. “From a Firefly’s Eye,” choreographed by Nancy Zendora and performed by the Zendora Dance Company, embodied Otomo’s haikus and captured the changing moods of the seasons. The haikus were first read in Japanese, and then in their English translation.
Otomo’s knack for visual artistry is seen through her poems on art. In her art concentration, she had focused on the study of abstraction and created a body of work spanning over three decades. Several of her poems are published in the anthology “A Convergence of Birds: Original Fiction and Poetry Inspired by Joseph Cornell.” Otomo’s work was recently picked up by Ugly Duckling Presse, which The Village Voice voted the Best Small Press of 2013. Otomo conducted her reading with a calm, soothing nature, which was the perfect accompaniment for the deep lines of poem she is known to create.
Steve Dalachinsky, also a visual and verbal artist like his counter part, is a native New Yorker from Brooklyn. Dalachinsky is one of the last surviving poets of the Beat Generation, and was influenced at age 14 by famous poet Allen Ginsberg. He told the audience that his first poem came from his work, which was written entirely while listening to live music. The piece was inspired by musician Cecil Taylor and artist Jackson Pollock, who Dalachinsky labeled as “wild” in their craft.
He read poems of great length with some confusing terms scattered throughout, which he then clarified as his stylistic use of nonsensical and made-up words. He presented two poems about the homeless of New York that were based on true stories from his time in the city, and read a piece from a collection of poems he had written while listening to jazz saxophonist Charles Gayle. The jazz piece, he said, was intended to be “a ha-ha to those who assumed [he] was a jazz poet.”
While spending time in France with Otomo and fellow poet Ted Joans, Dalachinsky wrote a poem while viewing the show “The Origin of Abstraction” in Paris, and shared it at the reading as his final piece. Dalachinsky was alive and animated during his time at the podium, and was an all-around inspiring figure, sharing personal anecdotes along with his poetry.
The Poetry Center at LIU Post, which was started by the English Department in the 1960s, will be hosting other events later in the semester. A one-woman show, featuring Prudence Wright Holmes, comes to Hillwood Tuesday, Nov. 12. Artist Belinda Kremer showcases her work in the Steinberg Art Museum on Wednesday, Dec. 4. These events will also be hosted during common hour, and will be free for students to enjoy.

The annual East Coast Conference Championships, held on the LIU Post campus on Sunday, Oct. 27, ended in success for the hosting Pioneers, as both the women and the men secured the East Coast Conference title.
Before the Championships started, senior Matt O’Keefe explained this year’s goal for
the men’s cross country team. ”We are looking to get our fifth straight”, said O’Keefe. After overwhelming their opponents, with five runners placed in the top 21 finishes, the men’s team won comfortably with a total score of 44 points and could keep their mark on top of the ECC’s for the fifth season in a row.
Consequently, two Pioneers earned all-Conference honors. Joseph Lasher was the fastest Pioneer, as he placed second with the impressive time of 25:28:62. Also, O’Keefe earned an all-Conference second team spot after placing 14th after finishing in 26:28:25.
The women’s team also finished on top with 44 points. However, the competition was alive all day, as a runner from St. Thomas Aquinas College finished second but the Pioneers managed to defend their leading position and win by four points. It was
the women’s team second title in three years.
Moreover, the women’s team also earned two spots in the All-Conference team. Sophomore Elizabeth Stirling was the first Pioneer to cross the finish line with a time of 18:44:65 that placed her eighth overall. Nonetheless, senior Jenn McLaughlin took the thirteenth spot after her 19:02:87 race.
As a result of the successful performances, the Pioneers are now looking ahead to the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships on Saturday, Nov. 9, which will take place in Boston, Massachusetts. The contest is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.

As the head coach of LIU Post’s women’s lacrosse team, Meghan McNamara has many goals for the upcoming season. She wants her players to focus on the little things and developing good fundamentals. Also, McNamara wants her players to develop strong bonds with one another and improve every game by taking the season day by day, which is essential to winning a national championship. McNamara stated that the first step as they climb the ladder towards another national championship is their first scrimmage against Yale.
McNamara started playing lacrosse in eighth grade with a wooden stick. The wooden stick was given to her because her sister won MVP at a camp. That’s when she first started playing.
McNamara was encouraged to play lacrosse because she loves the competitive nature of the sport and she was surrounded by great teammates. She also loves lacrosse because it’s challenging everyday and it’s fun and enjoyable. Her parents told her to always strive to be the best she can be, which has led her to amazing success.
As the head coach, McNamara wants to make sure that she can be a great role model for her players. Demonstrating leadership, teamwork, and character will help these young women be a positive impact in the world. McNamara will do anything she can to help her players achieve their goals both on and off the field.
Originally, McNamara thought she was going to college to play soccer. She played ACC lacrosse at the University of Maryland where she won four national championships. McNamara played as an attacking midfielder. As a player in college, she only lost four games in all four years. Three of the losses came as a freshman.
McNamara shared with me some of the strengths and weaknesses of the current team. One of the team’s many strengths is that they have a great core group of returning players. In addition, many of the players are experienced in championship play. She factored in that leadership, character, and compassion are second to none. They’re growing as a team, which is every year’s challenge and the team’s biggest weakness.
Academics was always first on McNamara’s list and it kept her in check. Without her education, she wouldn’t be able to play lacrosse. Both academics and lacrosse made her who she is today. She was determined to be the best she can be and academics was a great outlet for her achievements.
McNamara gave an inspirational quote that demonstrates how great of a coach she is, stating: “I have a pleasure to work for a tremendous group of young women and I get to share with the university how special they are.”

This past week, the men’s soccer team experienced its first winless week so far this season. Though still number one in the East Coast Conference, the Pioneers fell to the Post University Eagles and tied the Mercy College Mavericks last week.
The Pioneers traveled to Waterbury, Conn. Wednesday, Oct. 23 to play the Eagles. The game was scoreless at halftime and well into the second period. It was looking like overtime would be the deciding factor of this match, but the Eagles had other plans. With less than four minutes remaining, the Eagles’ Joe Baccielo managed to dribble past two Pioneer defenders and score what would be the winning goal. The Pioneers made the best of the remaining time on the clock, but it wasn’t enough. The Pioneers lost for the first time this season to the Post University Eagles, 1-0.
Coming off the first loss of the season, the Pioneers hosted the Mercy College Mavericks Saturday, Oct. 26. The Mavericks were quick to get the game started, scoring the first goal less than five minutes into the first period. The Pioneers did their best to score, but trailed 1-0 at the half. Less than five minutes into the second half the Mavericks scored again, leaving the Pioneer fans holding their breath for almost 25 minutes.
Finally, junior forward Eivind Austboe scored for the Pioneers, his 20th goal of the season. It was an offensive struggle for both teams, but freshman forward Johann Kristjansson managed to score for the Pioneers off an assist by senior forward Cemil Turan. With about seven minutes remaining in regulation, the Pioneers found opportunities for three shots on the Mavericks goal. Unfortunately the regulation clock would run out before the Pioneers could score.
Double overtime came and went without any change to the scoreboard. The Pioneers tied for the first time this season, 2-2. With the tie, the Pioneers won their third straight ECC regular season championship, and will be hosting the East Coast Conference Tournament that starts on Nov. 7.
The Pioneers close out the regular season on the road this week. The men travel to Washington, D.C. to take on the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds on Wednesday, Oct. 30, and to Queens, N.Y. to take on the Queens College Knights Saturday, Nov. 2.

The LIU Post field hockey continued its push for an undefeated season with wins over Mercy College on Tuesday, Oct. 22, and Saint Anselm on Saturday, Oct. 26.
Both victories came by relatively wide margins. In addition, the Pioneers continued their winning streak with an 8-1 victory over American International College yesterday. The three wins moved the Pioneers to a perfect 17-0 record with one game remaining on Saturday at home against Stonehill College.
On Saturday, senior forward Carlee Dragon put up two goals and two assists in her team’s 4-1 win over Saint Anselm. Her first goal came in the 26th minute when she scored from the top of the circle to give the Pioneers a 1-0 lead.
Junior forward Lyn-Marie Wilson made it a two- goal game two minutes later off a pass from Dragon. Wilson returned the favor in the 39th minute when she set up Dragon for her second goal of the contest.
Saint Anslem scored the team’s only goal 10 minutes later when sophomore forward Canada Stewart put a rebound past Pioneers freshman goalkeeper Meredith Stocklin.
The Pioneers rounded out the scoring in the 57th minute when sophomore Keliann Margiotta scored the team’s fourth goal of the game.
The Pioneers outshot Saint Anselm 28-2 in the win and Stocklin only had to make one save. Freshman Katherine Sears made 19 saves for Saint Anselm.
Earlier in the week the Pioneers easily defeated Mercy College 8-0. Margiotta recorded a hat trick in the win and Dragon also had two goals.
It only took 6:13 into the game for LIU Post to get on the board. Graduate midfielder Dani Crouse gave the Pioneers the 1-0 lead and junior forward Stephanie Ruhle made it 2-0 less than two minutes later.
Dragon got on the score sheet in the 16th minute and again in the 44th minute to give the Pioneers a 4-0 lead. Margiotta scored first goal of the contest in 50th minute and less than a minute later scored again.
Freshman midfielder Steph Mocerino scored her first collegiate goal in the 62nd minute and Margiotta completed the hat trick in the 68th minute to make it 8-0 Pioneers.
Stocklin made just two saves to record her fourth shutout of the season, while Mercy senior goalkeeper Kristen Znaniecki had to make 13. The Pioneers out shot their opponent 27-2 in the victory.
The Pioneers will look complete a perfect season with their upcoming showdown against Stonehill College on Saturday, Nov. 2.
