The ongoing uncertainty around whether Brooklyn Nets’ star Kyrie Irving will receive a COVID-19 vaccine has overshadowed the Nets’ start to their season, which Irving cannot currently participate in due to his status.
Irving cannot play in Nets’ home games at Barclays Center in Brooklyn unless he receives the vaccine due to the NYC requirement that you must be vaccinated to attend or participate in any indoor entertainment spaces. The Nets later announced on Tuesday, Oct.10, that Irving will not play for them at all this season until he becomes eligible to fully participate.
The Nets’ guard was not forthcoming about the situation, calling into the Nets’ media day via Zoom. 
“There’s just a lot of questions about what’s going on in the world of Kyrie, and I think I’d love to just keep that private and handle it the right way with my team and go forward together with a plan,” Irving said.
Kyrie would lose the entirety of the $35 million he was supposed to make this year if he sits out the whole season.
Senior broadcasting major Nicholas Paniagua is concerned about how the Nets will play while Kyrie is ineligible.
“Missing Kyrie is definitely going to hurt the Nets because Kevin Durant needs another star player alongside him in order for him to play his full game,” he said.
Paniagua, like many, feels that Irving’s looming absence severely limits the potential for a championship season. He predicts that the Nets advance no further than the Eastern Conference Finals without Irving’s services.
“He is a good enough player to join just about any team and immediately make an impact,” Paniagua said, 
Brooklyn Nets star guard Kyrie Irving is continuing his holdout over New York City’s vaccine mandate. The team’s Sunday, Oct. 24 home opener saw a lively anti-vaccine protest take place on Irving’s behalf, with protesters chanting “let Kyrie play” and “I’m with Kyrie.” Protestors at one point broke through the barricades, forcing security to rush to the doors to prevent the crowd from breaching Barclay’s Center.
Paniagua is surprised at Irving’s continued decision not to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 
“I really don’t understand why he has such a negative view of the vaccine,” he said. “I get that people have bad reactions to it, but a lot of other players got the vaccine, and here they are still playing basketball.” 
During postgame availability following the Nets’ second loss in their first three games, superstar forward Kevin Durant was asked again about Irving’s absence.
 “Nobody is going to lose confidence while we’re playing and hope Kyrie comes to save us,” he said.
Durant left the Golden State Warriors, where he won two NBA championships to team up with Irving and the Nets. 
Nets’ guard and former MVP James Harden, who was acquired by the Nets via trade after the arrivals of Durant and Irving, has struggled with his play so far this season. Harden typically improves his conditioning as the season progresses but is also adjusting to new NBA rule changes that affect his playing style. The league office has set out to eliminate actions by offensive players which are done solely to cause the referee to grant a foul. Harden has long been the best drawer of fouls in the league, attempting the most free throws per game every season from 2016-17 to 2019-20.
With the Nets off to a 2-2 start, the clock is ticking on Kyrie Irving’s return. Until he joins the team, Durant and Harden will shoulder a heavy workload.
Brooklyn has clear championship aspirations; the team was eliminated last postseason in overtime of Game 7 against the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round. Milwaukee went on to defeat the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Finals.

Men’s soccer players have made certain that they want to win the Northeast Conference(NEC) championship this season. 
Junior defender Henry Haferkorn says that there is no excuse to come up short this year.
“Because we lost in penalties at the conference championships last year, it is our goal to redeem ourselves by winning the NEC title and getting that ring,” he said. 
With the COVID-19 restrictions last year, limited fans were allowed in the stands during home games, which affected the Sharks’ energy while on the field. However, most restrictions have been lifted this year, and spectators are allowed at the games.
Sophomore forward Emil Jaaskelainen is excited about the new atmosphere this season.
 “The energy is so much better than before. I get a buzz every time I get the ball from hearing the cheers in the stands,” he said.
A graduate student from Washington, midfielder Julio Abad wraps up his last season with the Sharks. Abad plans to stay in New York and work as a Jr. financial analyst with Teads, a company in NYC. Abad is excited to see what his team has in store on and off the field once he leaves LIU.
 “The coaches have built a successful program, and with the new freshman, I can already see that the success rate is just going to go up from here,” he said.
Head coach Michael Mordocco expressed that he is happy with his team and how they are playing. Mordocco believes that his team will make it to the NEC tournament with the consistent commitment the team has to make it there. 
“We have one goal for this fall, and that is to make it back to the conference playoffs. We want to have fun during the process, and success will follow. If we stay true and committed to our goal, this group can attain anything.” he says.
Mordocco is proud of the strength and leadership from not only the upperclassmen on the team but also new players that have contributed to the wins that this team has seen in the past weeks.
“We have a lot of talent in this team, but our strength is our leadership from Fridtjof Andberg, Javier Rehberger and Henry Haferkorn,” he said. “We have also added some young players to the program that have contributed to the early success. Alan Martinez, Robert Winkler, Mathias Heiland, Jeremy Guardado.” 
Currently, the Sharks sit second in the NEC with a conference record of 5-2 and are 9-4-2 overall. The top four teams will make the NEC tournament, with the #1 seed hosting all the games. St.Francis Brooklyn is currently in first, with an NEC record of 6-1. The Sharks have two games left on their schedule, where they play the last place Mount Saint Mary’s Mountaineers on Sunday, Oct.31, and then play their final match against St.Francis Brooklyn on Sunday, Nov.7.

After 25 years of accusations of grooming and having a sex cult, infamous R&B superstar R. Kelly was found guilty Sept. 27 on all counts. He was being tried for sexual exploitation of a child, bribery, racketeering and sex trafficking. 
The details of Kelly’s history of abuse were recounted by prosecutors during the trial. 
“Kelly, after grooming, isolating and intimidating his child victims, recorded them being sexually abused and humiliated by him,” prosecutor Elizabeth Geddes said.
Students on campus were horrified at the graphic details revealed during the trial.
“I know that allegations against him had come to light in the past without much consequence, and I felt a lot of frustration and sympathy for the victims,” junior acting major Olivia Gonzales said.
R. Kelly has been facing public allegations of sexual abuse since the early ‘90s, and many wonder why it took three decades for him to face justice. Prosecutors described him as a “serial predator”. 
Students on campus believe it is a multifaceted issue and there are many reasons why Kelly, and other abusers in the music industry, escape justice and live above the law.
“First and foremost, the responsibility is on the criminal justice system to hold these people accountable. Fans should also stop supporting them and separate their love for the music,” sophomore social work and business major Angelina Anastasio said.
“We want to believe that beneath the sensationalism there’s a real shift in the culture to make the world and the industry safer. The reality is it’s extremely rare for people with this much influence to face lifelong consequences.” Gonzales said.
Prosecutors revealed during their closing arguments that, among other things, Kelly managed to escape consequences for decades by tormenting, blackmailing, bribing and threatening victims – both psychologically and physically. 
Another aspect of the prolonged trial is the role that race played. 
“Our reality is that our society just does not view Black women and girls as credible,” said co-founder of the #MuteRKelly campaign Kenyette Barnes.
It is often suggested that one way to not enable Kelly and other abusers in the music industry is to not consume their art. Students share similar opinions on the level of responsibility fans have in holding public figures accountable and whether it’s acceptable to separate the art from the artist.
“I think there is only so much separation to be made between the art and the artist. As an artist myself, art is a reflection of an individual’s worldview and will always reflect an individual’s personal bias,” Gonzales said.
Anastasio believes that these artists should be held accountable by fans.
“Separating the art from the artist is a problematic statement in itself, people have to draw the line somewhere because the artist flows into their art,” Anastasio said. 
The social and cultural climate has changed dramatically since Kelly first began facing allegations. One drastic development is what is dubbed cancel culture, which is an online phenomenon of public call-outs demanding accountability from public figures. 
“I would define it as a collective condemnation of a person’s words or actions,” Gonzales said.
Students on campus don’t believe that cancel culture is an entirely positive development, and are skeptical of the role it actually plays in holding public figures accountable and bringing them to justice.
“I think it can be real, but I can’t recall anyone who has actually been completely cancelled. It usually ends up giving them more publicity,” Anastasio said.
“The thing is, rarely does “cancelling” someone affect them beyond their reputation, and with how fast our news cycles are, this isn’t always something that lasts. It’s by-and-large performative,” Gonzales said.
However, students hope that Kelly’s trial will make others re-evaluate the public figures they support, and that more abusers will not evade justice for as long as Kelly has.
“I think it’s unfortunate that it took this much public outcry,” Anastasio said..
Kelly will be sentenced in May 2022 and is facing a possibility of 10 years to life in prison.

A deal has been reached between the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) to avoid a threatened strike from IATSE.
The deal was reached just a few hours before the threatened strike would’ve gone into effect. “I can confirm we reached an agreement that will keep the industry working,” a spokesperson from AMPTP said.
IATSE had a collective bargaining negotiation contract with AMPTP regarding production on the set of shows for streaming services. That contract expired in July of 2021.
Many claims are being made about the producers’ treatment of the technical workers on set.
Most of the complaints have come from sets of streaming productions, further highlighting the changes that streaming services have brought to the industry.
When negotiations started after this contract ended, IATSE had many concerns about what policies and working conditions should change. Most of these concerns centered around meal breaks, working hours, and pay rates.
As part of the contract that was previously in place, producers were able to ask workers to forfeit their meal breaks in exchange for an extra hour of pay. 
In addition to this, workers would be scheduled to work shifts starting on Friday mornings and ending in the middle of the night. These shifts would sometimes not include meal breaks at all for almost 24 hours.
IATSE runs out of thirteen local chapters in Los Angeles. These chapters came together to demand changes in working conditions.
“What the below-the-line crew, the 13 Locals, are asking for is very bare minimum,” makeup artist Shutchai Tym Buacharern said.
“If the strike would’ve happened, it would have been a big deal and it would’ve shut down Hollywood,” sophomore theatre arts major Logan Bolhouse said.
“The movie producers were not treating the workers correctly. That’s why they thought about striking. It was kind of a last resort for the workers, since the producers weren’t agreeing,” Bolhouse added. 
The shutdown of production on the set of streaming shows would halt the output of some of viewers’ favorite shows.
IATSE president Matthew D. Loeb said that the agreement included negotiations on fair wages, workload, and hours. No specific details have been released about the matter so far.
“In my opinion, I think that the producers buckled a little bit and gave better hours and pay, but I don’t think they budged that much,” Bolhouse said.
“I feel the conversation is long overdue,” costume designer Antoinette Messam said. “We’re tired and I just really hope the producers hear us. No one wants a strike.”
Many people believe that working through the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the view of many workers in the industry.
An anonymous IATSE local 600 source told The Hollywood Reporter, “These issues should’ve been addressed 30 years ago. COVID gave people time to stay home and rethink their lives. They came to the conclusion that they’re done with 16-hour days.”
IATSE has been around for 128 years and has never striked before. This highlights the point that the workers have reached with the producers. 
The general consensus in Hollywood is that no one wants a strike, and that this one being avoided is a good sign.

Halloween is a day that many people, including college students, get to express themselves by dressing up as whatever they want. Many take different routes with their costume ideas, whether they choose to dress as something funny or clever, Halloween is a way for students to express their creativity and imaginations.
Many students also incorporate their own wardrobes into their costumes. For example, a lot of students would rather be something based on what they can put together with pieces of clothing they already own than buy a new costume from a store. Sophomore business major Gabrielle Selter likes to use her own pieces to create a costume. 
“I like putting together my own costumes because I feel like it makes it more original. And to me, it’s part of the fun of dressing up,” Selter said.
In addition, many students also enjoy taking a “do it yourself” approach with their costumes. People often go this route with their costume if they cannot find a certain costume, a specific piece that would be significant for their costume to have, or if they already own some things that they can put together to create their own version of whatever they chose to be. Making a costume can really bring out a persons’ artistic skills, and it allows them to express their artistic ability visually.
“I am making a crown for my Sylvie costume,” junior musical theatre major Hannah Winston said. “Because this costume idea came to me last-minute, I decided that making it myself would be easier, and faster, than buying it from Amazon.”
Some students like to dress up as characters from their favorite movies and TV shows. 
 “I enjoy dressing up as characters from TV shows and movies, like “Stranger Things” and “Star Wars”,” sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato said.
Because social distancing guidelines and safety restrictions have been reduced since the COVID-19 lockdown, students are excited to express themselves in what they choose to be their costumes. 
“I am really looking forward to Halloween this year because we all wanted to be cautious with COVID-19 last year, especially because the vaccine was not available yet,” Ritirato said. “My family is throwing a party where we’re going to have a costume contest.” 
Costume contests are a popular theme when it comes to Halloween parties, and this can also promote each person to want to have the best costume in order to win, making peoples’ creativity shine through even more.
Students at Post believe that Halloween is a holiday in which they have creative freedom with what they choose to dress as, and students say that it allows them to express themselves.
