Recently, LIU Post was awarded a grant from the Avon Foundation for Women as part of the company’s 2014 Campus Grants to Activate Bystanders to Reduce Sexual Assault, Dating Abuse, and Stalking. Since its inception in 1955, the organization has aided charitable, scientific, educational, and humanitarian activities that improve the lives of women and their families.
According to Sarah Boles, a social worker in the Center for Healthy Living, the university will use the grant to launch a new program called the LIU Post BRAVE Initiative. BRAVE stands for Bystander Rape Assault and Violence Education.
“In order to raise awareness on our campus about these issues, our proposal was to institute this initiative,” Boles said. “The idea was to train [and] make students almost like experts in these topics, so that they can go out and raise awareness within the campus community.”
“When any kind of a violent act, whether it be sexual or otherwise [occurs], there are things that you can do as a bystander to intervene without putting yourself in harms way,” Boles continued. “I think that the more you educate people on how much of an impact they can make as a bystander when these incidences occur, people will feel like they can actually help in a situation.”
Incidences such as the alleged mugging of a freshman girl on Chipmunk Trail last week, which shook the Pioneer community with
fear and concern for the safety of the campus. Public Safety confirmed, however, that this incident was simply a rumor.
BRAVE is not the first program of its kind to educate Post students about sexual assault awareness and prevention. “For the past eight years, we’ve done a program here called the Red Flag Campaign, and the whole idea behind that [is] to raise awareness about dating violence, which includes sexual assault,” Boles added. “We were actually one of the first schools in the country to have a Red Flag Campaign.”
The establishment of the BRAVE Initiative coincides with two events occurring on campus this month that also aim to raise awareness about sexual assault. The first is a conference sponsored by the Long Island Interbranch of the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which will be held in the Great Hall of the Winnick House on Saturday, Oct. 25, from 12:45 p.m. to 2 p.m.
The conference will feature a panel of professionals. The panelists include: Christine Cione, the education coordinator of The Safe Center; Kyle Rose-Louder, the bureau chief of the Special Victims Bureau within the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office; Lynne A. Schwartz, the director of the Counseling Center and Center for Healthy Living at LIU Post; and Mary Logan, the legal advocacy fund chair of the AAUW Westchester County Branch.
AAUWs conference presents the statistic that college women are four times more likely to be raped than the average woman, and that the Department of Justice estimates only five percent of rapes are reported. Diane Haney, former co-president of the North Shore Branch of AAUW, said the panel will discuss what colleges nationwide are doing about this issue, and what each of us as individuals should be doing about it.
“Colleges resist dealing with this [issue] because it’s bad publicity, and they have a strong stake in making it as minimal [of a problem] as possible,” Haney said. “I realized the other day that I know four women who were either raped, or whose daughters were raped. And this is our issue as women, of any age. If we don’t stand up for it, who will?”
When asked about The White House’s government-level task force intended to protect college students from being sexually assaulted, Haney said, “There’s a lot of pushback that sounds on the surface to be very balanced, and it’s only when you dig into it a little more deeply that you realize it’s not quite balanced. Everybody is entitled to fair representation and due process [under the] law, but somehow when we think about where the concern should be [placed at the federal level], it seems that women are still being minimized.”
Madelaine Olsen, a senior International Relations major, will host a conference called “Speak Up! Breaking the Taboo” in The End Zone on Oct. 2 during common hour. The event focuses on the issue of violence against women. “It’s in light of the International Day of Non- Violence, established by the United Nations General Assembly to educate and raise public awareness around this topic,” Olsen said.
Olsen’s major specialization is the Middle East, perhaps due to the fact that she grew up with her mother stationed in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. “I think as both a woman and a mom she had a hard time not getting emotional when hearing about how grotesque certain rape cases were [in that area].”
Olsen hopes her conference will broaden people’s opinions on the topic stateside. “I got interested in learning more about why this [was] taking place, [as well as] the mentality of people and societies that don’t share the same views that we do here [in terms of] law and human rights,” she said. “I soon learned that violence against women is just as prevalent in America as it is widely ignored. Although we are lucky [to be] living in a developed nation that enjoys good security, domestic violence statistics are still very dark.” Olsen also emphasized the fact that there’s a social taboo attached to the issue of sexual violence.
“[The] point I want to raise is that violence is not just taking place in India and Pakistan, although this is what’s acceptable to talk about since we see it in the news.” Olsen continued, “But when we talk about rape, we tend to hide [the fact that] this is taking place in homes, college campuses, and on the streets of the U.S. as well, but people don’t talk about it as much, and almost no victim reports it. By breaking the taboo and educating students [about] utilizing the criminal justice system [in these cases], we can change the attitudes surrounding this subject.”
Lauren Lipari, a sophomore Radiology major, believes that the new initiative and the conferences are “positive steps towards helping students become active bystanders. People will know what to do if they encounter a situation where sexual violence is involved. Once people become more educated on the topic, they won’t be as nervous to step in and help someone who is in need,” said Lipari.
“I think sexual assault is essentially a worldwide epidemic,” said Jack Thedinga, a senior Political Science major. “Part of the problem
is that a major focus is on ‘How Not to Get Raped or Assaulted,’ and there’s not enough focus on how or when to intervene as well as what constitutes assault. For instance, numerous studies have shown that a shockingly large proportion of adolescent and adult males don’t consider the legal parameters defining sexual assault to actually describe sexual assault or rape in their eyes.”
“It’s exciting for us to get a grant like this, and the fact we have [BRAVE] is really great,” said Boles. “If there are students that are interested in becoming a BRAVE mentor, they can certainly be in touch with me.”
Boles’ office is located in the Life Science Building, room 154. For more information about the BRAVE Initiative, Boles can be reached at (516) 299-4163, or by email at sarah.boles@liu.edu.

On Sept. 8, LIU Post launched a revamped and redesigned version of the university’s website. The new site is more colorful than the old one, and is more interactive, featuring promotional slideshows that highlight certain aspects of the university, such as LIU Life and Discovery & Innovation.
The home page also has a new “By the Numbers” info-graphic, showcasing statistics like the 200,000 plus alumni worldwide, the 500 degrees offered across all LIU campuses, and the 118 countries that call LIU home.
“In this day and age, a website is the single most important marketing and communication tool that an organization has, so in keeping with our mission of access and excellence, we felt it was necessary to create a new website that best positions LIU as a forward- thinking university, utilizing the latest online tools and interactive experiences,” said Jackie Nealon, Chief of Staff and Vice President for Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. LIU’s Communications and Marketing office was responsible for the project.
“As part of our ongoing institutional effectiveness and strategic plans, the regular updating of LIU’s technology is always a priority,” Nealon continued.
George Baroudi, the Vice President for Information Technology & Chief Business Process Improvement Officer, said that IT was also involved in the project. “[Our] input was in making sure that the website [was] built based on a responsive design. Responsive design allows you to adjust the web links to any screen size, from a mobile screen to a large desktop screen size.”
Students, faculty, and staff were not officially notified of the change to the website.
Nealon explained, “Most of the work on the website took place over the summer when many students [were] not on campus. We did engage several students on the project in the areas of coding, developing pages, photography, and so on.”
Jacob Schmotzer, a sophomore English and Secondary Education major, commented on the new site. “I think it’s a major improvement over what it was, but there is still room for improvement. It’s still not too easy to navigate if you’re looking for something very specific.”
Now that the initial launch is behind the university, Nealon said that LIU is going to start a multiphase web update schedule that will eventually convert the entire site into new templates. “The comments and concerns of the entire LIU community will be taken into consideration, as this will be a joint venture involving students, faculty, staff, and other stakeholders,” Nealon added.
“Our goal in doing this was to highlight various aspects of the university that showcase our flagship programs and pride points, while upgrading the usability of the site as a whole,” Nealon said. She continued, “Information is quicker and easier to find, with a sleek new responsive navigation that is also optimized for mobile and desktop devices. We encourage faculty and students to send us feedback, as they are among the biggest users of the site.”
The last website redesign was launched in 2009. Nealon stated that the school was going to continue updating the site further. “We will incorporate additional changes and updates that reflect the latest developments in online functionality. While we have made enormous strides in transforming liu.edu to better reflect our dynamic university, there is still much to do in the weeks and months ahead. A website is never completely finished.”

To Whom It May Concern,
In reference to the Sept. 17th edition of The Pioneer, which featured front page News Brief, it was a pleasure to see that Adrianna Alvarez was recognized for her first place award and featured article along with her subsequent honor at the Media Awards Dinner.
Adrianna entered LIU Post under the auspices of the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program, which offers academic support services and financial assis- tance to students who would not meet the normal criteria for admission into college. In addition to her work with The Pioneer as the former News Editor, Adrianna was active as a member of the Newman Club. What was most impressive about her academic journey was that Adrianna completed her degree with honors, Magna Cum Laude. All this for a young woman from upstate New York who would not have been considered college ready upon entry. The motto for the program is ‘HEOP Works!’. It certainly rang true for Adrianna.
The HEOP family is very proud of Adrianna and her accomplishments. We applaud her as she continues her journey at Simmons, and wish her all the best in the future. Finally, to the members of The Pioneer, good luck with the publications throughout the academic year!
Sincerely,
William Clyde, Jr.,
Director Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program, LIU Post

On Tuesday, Sept. 23, more than 120 heads of state gathered at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City — convened by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon — for a historic summit on climate change.
To raise awareness on the topic, the People’s Climate March was held on Sunday, Sept. 21, and consisted of more than 2,700 events in 166 different countries. Among the 400,000 participants in the NYC march was a group of 13 LIU Post students, including members of the women’s swim team and women’s soccer team, who were willing to show their support and appreciation in the largest climate march held in history.
Professors Scott Carlin from the Earth and Environmental Science department and Jennifer Brown from the Sociology and Anthropology department organized the event.
1,400 organizations supported the monumental rally, including non-governmental organizations, labor unions, grassroots networks, churches, faith organizations, as well as over 300 colleges with student marchers coming from as far away as Minnesota and Kansas.
The march was a two to three mile stretch through Manhattan; from Columbus Circle east along 59th Street, down 6th Avenue, and finally finishing west along 42nd Street to 11th Avenue, outside of the UN Headquarters.
“As a person who is not involved in marches or protests, I was captured by the overwhelming amount of energy,” admitted Kat Kazaba, a junior Public Relations major. “It was inspiring to see so many people express their passion for such a timely issue. I hope we see changes stem from this historical event.”
“It was cool to be part of such a big event,” said Jacqueline Tonn, a freshmen Nutrition major. “Especially since it was the first one, and that it was taking place all over the world.”
Professor Scott Carlin explained the significance of the event and the students’ participation. “I think attending events like this can be very inspiring for students. Scientists have expressed concerns about the threat of climate change for decades. We have a very good understanding of the science and the economic, humanitarian, and ecological threats associated with climate change.” Carlin added, “There are a variety of recommended policies that are excellent tools for tackling these problems. What we still need is the political leadership to implement effective policies, such as investments in renewable energy.”
Professor Jennifer Brown was delighted with the group of students who decided to attend the event. “The People’s Climate March was an excellent opportunity for students to participate in a democratic action that has [the] potential to sway US and world leaders to take real steps toward reducing carbon emissions and protecting vulnerable populations.” Brown added, “I thought the march would be a wonderful way for my students to witness and participate in the environmental justice movement. The students who did attend were able to see a wonderfully diverse march with people talking about a variety of issues.”
Brown hopes that the students have taken something away from the experience, and that it has changed their views on global warming. “The People’s Climate March, the UN Climate Change Summit, and other recent climate change events have hopefully sparked conversations in families and communities about our individual roles in environmental destruction.”
After the meeting at the UN Headquarters, world leaders are expected to come to an international consensus on climate change and emission restrictions, which is set to be signed in Paris, France in 2015.

President Kimberly R. Cline announced on Dec. 10, 2013, that seven new sports teams would be added to the school’s athletics department this semester. The seven teams are women’s fencing, women’s golf, wres- tling, and men’s and women’s indoor and outdoor track and field.
Michael Corona was brought in to coach the women’s fencing team. “There was no one else doing this here, so I had to build it up from scratch,” Corona said. He isn’t new to fencing or coaching, however. Corona was an All-American while at Penn State University, has coached the Brentwood High School team, and has received Coach of the Year in Suffolk County three times. Despite his numerous achievements, this is Corona’s first time coaching at a college-level.
“I was hired after the admission process, so I couldn’t bring people in, but there were three girls at the school who already knew how to fence,” Corona said of the recruiting process. He considers himself lucky that there were interested fencers on campus, and is now begin- ning to recruit girls who have never fenced before. Corona hopes that the three experienced girls will help him teach the newcomers.
“As of right now, we have 10 girls on the team,” Corona said
with a smile. He mentioned that there were some girls on the team who signed up before getting their course schedules, and later had to quit be- cause fencing conflicted with their classes. Corona assures that next year it will be better: “People can build their schedules around the team, like they do for the other sports,” he added.
Corona is very optimistic when it comes to the future. “There are 1,500-2,000 fencers on Long Island alone, and 17 high schools with fenc- ing teams.” Corona also explained that he has been trying to get the word out about the program. “With so many fencers nearby, you’d want them to come to our university.”
Corona also explained that because he was hired late he couldn’t acquire any home tournaments for the on-season. “In a tournament or meeting, you meet say five other teams, and spend the whole day doing it,” he said. “Since I got here so late, every school was already booked, so we’re doing a lot of traveling.”
Fencing season starts on Nov. 1, with a big tournament at Temple University, and can continue through March depending on the team’s performance. “I hope we can get some of the girls to nationals, or at least regionals. If not, the season finishes in February,” Corona said.
Alexa Perry, a senior Health Care Administration major and one of the three experienced fencers on the team, is optimistic about her new coach. “He’s very positive and a really good coach. He taught completely new girls to be fairly good fencers in just a few weeks,” Perry said.
Corona explained that it is a big challenge that he has such a wide level of experience to work with as far as the fencers are concerned. “I have to teach basic techniques to some, [while also having to improve] the already experienced girls.” Corona calls his team a “work in prog- ress,” but hopes to have a full team to work with this time next year.

WCWP, the campus radio station, and PTV, the campus television station, will begin a new collaboration on Sept. 29, as the radio show “In the Clutch” will be recorded and aired on PTV. This will be
the first video recorded radio show broadcasted on PTV for a long time, according to the Assistant Station Manager Christina Kay.
“In The Clutch” covers a wide variety of sports topics, including previews and reviews of professional sports games. The co-hosts are junior Broadcasting majors Deandre Wilson and Nick Morgasen. This year they have dedicated the show’s content to covering campus sports and interviewing student athletes.
This is the second semester of “In the Clutch,” and the first time it has been aired on television. The show airs on wcwp.org every Monday from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. On Monday, Sept. 29, it aired on PTV for the first time. The show will be cut down from its original two hour format to a 30 minute highlight clip aired on PTV.
The idea spawned from an Applied Television class taught by Professor Jean Carlomusto, the Director of the Television Center in the Media Arts department. The class assignment was to create a show that could be aired on PTV. Carlomusto approved this idea presented by
Wilson and Morgasen because “this idea allows Deandre and Nick to utilize the best material from their radio program in a television sports show,” she said. “The key will be giving it an added visual component for television.”
Professor Maura Bernard, alumni of the Media Arts Department, said that the cameras are “good for a viewing audience so they can
have insight into the studio.” Bernard, who has hosted her own radio shows, believes that having a show recorded for television is much more revealing due to the fact that you have a face to go along with the voice.
Mike Nicosina, a sophomore Accounting major, thinks that this is a great idea. He also co-hosts a sports show on WCWP with Tyler Bet, a senior Rhetoric major. “I would like to try that on our show,” said Nicosina. He also added, “I think in today’s age of sports television, it is a definite improvement over just the radio.” Nicosina and Bet’s show is called “The Fast Break,” and it airs on Fridays from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on WCWP.
Wilson added, “I think this is going to be something different, [and will] also set an example for other shows.”

Once again, the Apple incorporation did not disappoint its loyal customers by dropping the new iPhone 6/iPhone 6 Plus on Sept. 19, 2014. These new and improved models of the iPhone exceeded four million pre-orders within the first 24-hour-span of its availability, and 10 million phones sold during the first weekend, which marked an Apple record. There are a few new features that make this new phone unique besides its size increase. The criticism from Post students varies, where some believe Apple has outdone itself again, while others believe the hype over the new iPhone 6/6 Plus is overrated.
“It’s the biggest iPhone in Apple history, but it works for me; I love it!” said Andrew Reynolds, an Information Technology junior. “My vision is not that good, so the 5.5 inch screen on the 6 plus is perfect for me. In addition to that, the battery life on this phone is amazing,” Reynolds added.
The iPhone 6 Plus measures 6.22 inches high by 3.06 inches wide, which is nearly a half inch taller than the Galaxy Note 3. It has a 5.5 inch display screen, with a faster processor, upgraded camera, an improved Long Term Evolution (LTE) and WiFi connectivity. However, despite its extreme difference in vertical height, the 6 plus is noticeably thinner, being just 7.1mm in thickness. While some people may say Apple is “copying” the android style by making the 6 Plus larger, Apple just views this as tackling a different audience that demands larger phones. Despite the many positives about this phone, there are some negatives surfacing about the iPhone 6 Plus. Its new design more or less requires two-handed usage for the average person. Not only is the phone big, but the price is higher, varying from $750.00 – $950.00, depending on how much GB of memory one desires. Lastly, there have been rumors of the 6 plus being able to bend, but despite the rumors there hasn’t been evidence of this “bending” affecting the usage of the phone.
Senior Sociology major Nigel Simmons doesn’t believe that the iPhone 6 is worth all the hype but does enjoy his new phone. “My last phone, the iPhone 5, was beat up and I was do for an update so I said why not get the new iPhone 6,” Simmons said. “It’s faster, has a better camera, and I now have the finger print scanner so I’m happy. But honestly, compared to the iPhone 5s, it’s not worth all the hype; it’s the same phone, just slightly altered,” he continued.
Larger, but yet dramatically thinner, explains the 4.7 inch HD display iPhone 6. The 6 has the same features as the 6 Plus but doesn’t distribute the same amount of power when it comes to battery life. Some may believe it’s just a bigger iPhone 5s with a better camera and are therefore not too sold on it. Jillian Obasa, a sophomore Biology major, was just eligible for an upgrade, so she took the offer. When asking Obasa if she believed the iPhone 6 was worth all the hype, she said “No, it’s not. It’s really just a way for Apple to make more money.”
Every year since 2007, Apple has come out with a new version of the iPhone. Regardless of the amount of improvements, they have continued to sell their products through the roof year after year. The iPhone6/6 Plus has improved since the iPhone 5s, but is it really worth spending that extra hundreds of dollars?

Almost everyone in the world knows something about cancer, whether it is through a family member or friend affected by it, or through society advocating for a cure. Breast cancer is the third deadliest cancer in the world, and the second most common among women. Although women are the ones commonly diagnosed with breast cancer, men can get it, too. Men have breast tissue, just like women, and that makes the susceptible to developing breast cancer.
Breast Cancer Awareness month takes place all throughout the month of October. The national awareness color for breast cancer is pink, which is often used in commericals and events. Although it may seem repeatitve to constantly hear about breast cancer on the news or social media, it demonstrates that this disease should never be taken lightly.
The American Cancer Society (ACS) is the foundation that advocates for all cancers in every possible way. The foundation says, “Our research goal is simple— find answers that help save lives. Our strategy for funding research is just as straightforward—fund the best science.”
Fundraising and spreading awareness aretwo of the most commonly used tools out there, because getting people involved and educated in the matter could help save lives. “I feel that over the past few years advertising and awareness for breast cancer has risen quite a bit,” said Tommy Russo, a sophomore Psychology major. “As breast cancer begins to affect more and more people, and even celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, there have been more efforts to raise funds for research through walks and other events. Breast cancer is something that can affect anyone and it is good that society is being proactive about it,” Russo added.
The ACS is dedicated to finding a cure and building a community that allows cancer patients, survivors, families, and friends to come together to support each other. The foundation has spent more than four billion dollars since 1946, which has established the American Cancer Society as the largest private, nonprofit funder of cancer research in the United States.
Nearly 1.7 million new cases of breast cancer occurred amongst women worldwide in 2012, according to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). “My mom had breast cancer when she was 35, and I was just one and a half years old,” said Margaret Pepe, a sophomore Public Relations major. “Obviously, I don’t remember what it was like for her when she had breast cancer. What I do remem ber is how, 18 years later, she still has to go to several doctor[s] appointments every few months to make sure she’s still cancer free; how the spot where she had her surgeries still hurts her from time to time; how she never let it break her. Cancer runs in my family, sadly, and it’s scary knowing that I have a higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer. I’m grateful every day that my mom is a survivor, and that her cancer hasn’t come back,” Pepe continued.
Surviving cancer does not mean the battle is over. Cancer changes lifestyles, mentalities, and overall outlooks on life. Making Strides Against Breast Cancer (MSABC) is the largest network for breast cancer awareness in the nation. There are so many ways to get involved, whether it is participating in walks, fundraising across the country or spreading knowledge to others. If you would like to donate or learn more you can visit www.cancer.org.

1) The Winnick House, the former Post estate’s lavish Tudor-era revival mansion, was a symbol of Marjorie Merriweather’s preeminent social and financial status in the early 20th century.
2) In 1921, Marjorie Merriweather and her second husband, Edward F. Hutton, who worked on Wall Street, purchased a Wheatley Hills property for $400,000, which would later become Brookville Hall.
3) The couple renamed the estate Hillwood due to its rolling hills and wooded terrain.
4) The front door of the Winnick Dining Hall contains carvings of a court jester, a fox and hunter, and cornucopias with flowers.
5) When LIU purchased the property from the Post family, they barely made any changes to the mansion. They built an entrance on the west side, which became the Provost’s Office and is now the Admissions Office.
6) What was once Marjorie Merriweather’s master bedroom in the mansion is now the Chancellor’s Office.
7) The doll house on campus is actually called Deen-Wee. It was built in 1934 for Marjorie’s daughter, Nedenia, as a playhouse. It is made of timber and was meant to look like the larger mansion. The structure is still on the campus today.
8) The building that is named Kumble Hall today was originally a guesthouse known as Post Cottage, and was once considered the nicest building on the property. The university kept the original structure, with the exception of a brick addition that was connected to the rear of the structure in 1960 by LIU Post.
9) The campus used to have many greenhouses that were built in 1928. However, due to the deterioration of the greenhouses they were removed by the university on July 20, 2001.
10) The structure that currently houses the LIU Post Campus Craft Center was originally an estate garage which included a repair shop. The building’s appearance remains exactly the same besides the enlargement of its structure to the classroom usage.

Homecoming, which will be held on Saturday, Oct. 18, is one of the main events on campus during the fall season, where students, alumni, and faculty are given an opportunity to come together and celebrate their school pride.
The football game is one of the main events of the weekend. It will take place at 1 p.m. at the newly renovated LIU Post Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium where the Pioneers will play against St. Anselm. Tailgating in the Pratt parking lot will take place from 11 a.m.–5 p.m. On the South Campus, there will be a free family carnival with rides, games, food, and drinks.
Attending the pep rally on Oct. 17 at 7 p.m. at Pratt Recreation Center can pump students and alumni. The pep rally is an event that introduces LIU Post’s fall sports teams to the student body and alumni. The event includes dance and spirit contests, and provides food and drinks catered by Aramark.
On Saturday, Oct. 18, there will also be many alumni events. The LIU Post Fields will host alumni games for lacrosse, baseball, field hockey, and softball at 10 a.m. An alumni breakfast for women’s and men’s basketball and wrestling will be held in the Pratt Center at 10 a.m., and our own Pioneer newspaper will be having its first ever alumni breakfast at 11 a.m. in the newsroom in Hillwood Commons.

There is one branch that everyone dreads from the tree of higher education: essays, school work, or homework. I myself have hated these words since my first day of school, and, low and behold, I have had an essay from each class pretty much every day. However, subjects in which we—the students—have chosen as our majors or minors should have a greater interest to us, so I guess homework from these subjects is more justified, no? I am not saying, ‘essays are great fun, because you chose the subject.’ No, because no matter what the essay entails, it is hard to focus on and enjoy, especially when you have so many to do at once.
Whoever came up with the idea of Core Curriculum, I just want to give them a round of applause… for ruining most students lives! Do all students feel like this? Are they hating the fact that they are busy all the time with essays and math homework, or do people like the fact they don’t have a free moment? On a personal level, I am loving my core subjects at the moment, English and Sociology have been “right up my alley.” Every time I have Professor Bernstein’s Sociology class it brightens up my day and furthers my horizons on things I may not have known about American society.
So, in this piece I want to give you guys—as well as myself—an insight on how international students are coping with the change in work load and change in academical system.
Coming from a different country, like so many of us Pioneers do, it is hard to understand and grip the American educational chain. For example, in American high schools, they teach calculus in math. Calculus: if you said this foreign and frightening word to any normal Brit, they would be (for once) at a loss of words and baffled. I haven’t been taught such a thing in my English high school back in Oliver Twist’s London, and I certainly won’t be saying to any math teacher at Post, ”Please, sir, can I have some more… calculus?” No, you won’t catch me asking for this exciting request.
I can feel the pain for many of us international students who come from countries where they are taught completely different things. However, I know for a fact that in pretty much every country they have homework. So, do we really need to get used to homework for every class? Well, I believe that no matter how many years and how many assignments you have been given, homework and essays are always a burden to the modern student. We have way more exciting things to do, such as playing Xbox, going on our iPad’s, or simply sleeping.
I was speaking to one of my teammates the other day. We spoke about the old ‘to-do’ list, which I know everyone uses. I said that I had three essays to do on my list on Monday night, by Tuesday morning I had worked it down to one. But by Tuesday evening, it was back up to three again. This made us chuckle, but it wasn’t a laugh because it was ‘so funny.’ Nope. It was the laugh of despair and comprehension that it is going to be like this for my whole college life.
It’s safe to say work from college life has welcomed me with open arms! This sheer amount of work can be extremely hard for any student to cope with. Even more so for international students in these early days of the new chapter in our lives; dealing with issues of settling in, sorting out our accommodation or housing, or even making new friends who might not take school as seriously as we might. But we have made an even bigger sacrifice, hence the reason we have to keep working hard. And the moral of the story is, ’kids, do your homework!’ I’m joking. The only advice I can give is just to accept that no matter what, you are going to have homework and essays to do and the worst thing you and I can do is let it get on top of us and begin to get ‘lates’ or ‘incompletes’ on our class records. Why do you think coffee—or tea in my case—was made for?
Now with all of this hard work, there must be a time where you can let a bit of steam out, and there is. One of my many mottos (if you can have more than one motto) is “work hard, play hard.” You are not at college to hate life and write every hour of every day, so have a day where you can relax, kick back, and enjoy yourself. This will really help decrease stress levels and also allows your mind to freshen up and start again with your work. Well, apart from calculus, you’re on your own there!

Student opinion varies when discussing the dorm life here at LIU Post. Of course, every person has a complaint because nothing is perfect. I have lived in Riggs Hall for two and a half years now, and personally feel the dorms here are sufficient, and that many students complain too much. That being said, there are a few things I would improve in the dorms. For example, there is no WiFi in the residence halls.
If students feel it necessary to have their own WiFi, they are newly permitted — as of last year — to bring their own router. While this is definitely helpful, I don’t feel it’s fair to make students buy a router in order to have Internet access in their rooms. The school should provide residents with Internet, because we already pay quite a lot of money to live on campus.
Also, the mini kitchenettes in each building aren’t really helpful. These kitchenettes are usually in each hallway, but some are located in the basement and on the upper floors. In Riggs, we have to either go downstairs or upstairs to use a microwave. These microwaves aren’t powerful and take forever to heat anything – they also burn students’ popcorn daily. Other than the bad microwaves, there is also a single sink; we have no access to a stove or an oven. I believe campus life needs to reevaluate these communal kitchens so that students can cook their own food, especially when the dining halls are closed.
I also believe each building should have air conditioning for those first brutally hot weeks after move-in day. Brookville, one of the residence halls, provides self-controlled air conditioners in each room. This is the only hall with A/C and it costs an extra fee to live there because of this feature. The other dorms have no air conditioner, and we are not permitted to bring our own. We can bring a fan, but it’s not enough to keep cool. Luckily, the heat is only an issue for a short amount of time, as most students do not live in the dorms during the hot summer months.
Though there are some negative aspects to dorm life, there are positives too. The actual quality of the dorms is decent enough to keep myself and many other students living here throughout our years at Post. For example, the bathrooms and hallways are kept very clean. Maintenance staff cleans the bathrooms two to three times per day. When I use the showers and bathrooms in the morning, I never find a mess. I have heard stories about other schools with disgusting bathrooms. Of course, there are times where students make a mess of the halls and such, but they are quickly cleaned up most of the time.
I also think the rooms are decently sized. I have lived in a double for the past few years, and it is definitely big enough for two students to live comfortably. Post also offers triples that are even larger and have a greater amount of space. I had enough room to bring an extra piece of furniture to store more clothing, and the room still didn’t feel cramped.
Though I have heard some complaints about the furniture in the rooms, I feel that the desks given to us are larger than students need. I have never had an issue with fitting my supplies, and neither has my roommate. The beds aren’t huge, but having bigger beds would just take up unnecessary space and make the rooms seem smaller. They’re big enough to sleep on comfortably.
Each year before move in day, the rooms are completely cleaned and sanitized from the year prior. I have never come into the building and been disgusted with the quality of a room. The Residence Assistants, Campus Life Coordinators, and staff here do a wonderful job of making sure residents come into a safe, clean space each semester.
Anjelica Roman, a senior Arts Management major who dorms in Riggs Hall, agrees that there are positives aspects about dorming. “My keypad stopped working for my door recently, and Facilities was attentive and quick to fix the problem,” she said. Roman and many other Post residents, including myself, do feel that there improvements can be made, but Post isn’t a bad place to live. It has most certainly become our home away from home.

If you’re looking for food on campus, especially healthy food, your options are very limited.
Ever since my freshman year, I’ve seen the food options on campus as a huge problem. It’s either extremely greasy, way too overpriced, or comes basically frozen in plastic packaging. To me, it’s hard to understand why there is constantly a huge line in Hillwood for what I see to be over-expensive hospital food.
The food is pretty bad, but once you add in some dietary restrictions, it becomes borderline impossible to find anything that both suits your requirements and is also edible. As a former vegetarian, I’ve eaten way too many bland, pre-packaged salads, and purchased countless $4 yogurts.
Sure, I could have waited on line for a freshly made salad, but that takes about 30 minutes on a slow day and the same issue applies for Subway. I had hoped that it would get easier to eat on campus once I started eating meat again, but my options remained limited. There is still the dreaded refrigerator case, with pre-made wraps and sandwiches, some of which contain my daily requirement of carbohydrates and fats. I could order fatty, fried food or stand on a long line for the duration of common hour to get food that is acceptable at best.
To me, in a place where we spend time bettering ourselves, you would think that we should also be spending time improving our health. How are we supposed to focus when we’re weighed down by heavy meals packed with oils and who even knows what else?
Not only is the food unhealthy, but it also seems as though the university is making an active decision to eliminate anything remotely good for you from Hillwood. The case of Odwalla juices has been replaced by a case of milkshakes, and the pre-packaged healthier items are always way more expensive than the mozzarella sticks or french- fries.
For all of these reasons, it was especially enraging to me when I discovered that 50 dining dollars had been placed into mine and all other commuters’ tuition with no way to avoid the charge. It’s incredible to me that instead of changing their food options to make people want to buy it, the school essentially has to force you to do so by pretending to give away free dining dollars that you absolutely pay for.
Instead of forcing us to buy the food, the university needs to change it—but first, we need to make a demand for it.

LIU Post wants you to “find out how good you really are,” but how can the students do so if they are not given the tools needed? There doesn’t necessarily have to be a smart-board in every classroom, although most colleges and primary schools on Long Island are providing just that. Even just changing all of the old chalkboards into white, dry erase boards is enough.
However, not everyone feels that Post is in the Stone Age when it comes to technology. “I know that a lot of classrooms don’t use a lot of technology, but in the Broadcasting department, we are being given state-of-the-art video cameras, and just got brand new Mac computers,” said Connor Vogt, a senior Broadcasting major.
“I’m in the graduate program in the Psychology department and it’s not like we use a lot of technology, but what I don’t get is that every year incoming students are being given free iPads. So, why aren’t they being incorporated into the classrooms?” questioned Joann Scimeca, a graduate student in the Psychology department.
A lot of students feel the same way, and also said that many professors don’t let you use these iPads, or any technology in their classrooms. Why give us something that can be used in the classroom to better our education, if professors won’t incorporate it?
Then again, there are professors who believe strongly in learning what technology can be used for in your future occupations. “In a journalism class I took last year, we had to learn how to use Instagram, and Pinterest, and many other social medias that we students use almost every day,” said Talia Charlton, a 2014 graduate of LIU Post.
It’s hard to understand why a school that prides itself on its slogan, “find out how good you really are,” doesn’t take advantage of the learning possibilities that technology has to offer. It’s not even manageable to have WiFi working properly in all buildings, let alone Internet working on all of the computers.
Students want to see more technology being incorporated into the classroom, but how long will it take to do so?

The issue of assisted suicide has become one of the “it” topics in the United States. Assisted suicide is defined as “the suicide of a patient suffering from an incurable disease, affected by the taking of lethal drugs provided by a doctor for this purpose,” according to the Oxford Dictionaries. The raising question is: How ethical is this?
There are two very strong opposing opinions about whether or not it is right for someone to have the ability to ending someone else’s life.
In the United States, assisted suicide is a crime in 34 states Only two states, Oregon and Washington, however, permit physician assisted suicide.
The question of the morality of assisted suicide is whether or not the act of suicide can, in fact, be considered a “treatment” for a disease. Autonomy is the real issue in the assisted suicide debate—the right to refuse or accept medical treatment. According to opposing articles on www.euthanasia.com, there are two types of this autonomy—negative and positive. Negative autonomy gives the patient the right to refuse treatment advised by his/her doctor. This practice is well known and commonly accepted throughout the United States. Positive autonomy is the ability to request and attain a specific medical treatment, but this has limits. A patient cannot request a heart transplant for a broken ankle, for example. The treatment requested by a specific patient has to match the condition the patient is suffering from, for example chemotherapy for cancer patients.
So, is a lethal injection a “medical treatment” for the terminally ill? I say no. Killing is killing for whatever reason. In my opinion, life is precious and you should try to preserve life at all costs—so I am not a supporter of assisted suicide. I can see, however, how people would be in favor of it. Take a sick patient, for example, a cancer patient. Say a cancer patient is terminally ill and in an intense amount of pain; treatments are not working and the pain is stronger than the medications can take care of. This patient would much rather be dead than be in pain any longer.
I could understand why a person would want the option of having someone else end their life so they wouldn’t have to.
Assisted suicide is advertised and promoted in some European countries, such as its most popular proponent, Switzerland. People travel from across the world just to use the assisted suicide services in these countries because the “treatment” is not readily available and is also criminal in most of the United States. Assisted suicide doesn’t conform to the norms of medical treatment—more traditional ones like chemotherapy or organ transplants. People still find the idea of “pulling the plug” to be morbid. Whether assisted suicide is performed by lethal injection or a killer cocktail (a poisonous one that stops the patient’s heart), it still yields the same effect. Assisted suicide, in my opinion, is not moral and should not be done. Of course, there always will be a few extreme circumstances in which someone is better off passing away than being in pain, but that is a matter of opinion.

LIU Post hosted an art exhibition for South Korean schools Ulsan and Honam Universities in the Hillwood ASL Gallery, from Sept. 16 to the 27. During this time, works from Art students of Ulsan and Honam Universities were showcased, featuring a variety of mediums that included painting, drawing, printmaking, sculptures, mixed media, and collages.
Curated by MFA graduate Helena Song, Ulsan University’s opening reception was held on Wednesday, Sept. 17, followed by Honam University’s, held on Wednesday, Sept. 24, from 5 p.m. – 7 p.m. Heon Woo Nam, a MFA student of LIU Post, is scheduled to have his own art reception on Wednesday, Oct. 1, from 5 p.m. – 8 p.m. in the gallery.
The relationship forged between LIU Post and the Korean universities arose about three years ago, when foreign exchange student, Ok Kim, graduated from LIU Post with a Master of Fine Arts. Kim went on to acquire a position as a teacher at Honam University. Her connections with both LIU Post and Honam University were the propelling forces that set this international art exchange in motion.
“[Kim] knows about [LIU], so using this alumni connection was very important [in making] this event happen. She’s such a great asset,” said Professor Seung Lee, director of Fine Arts and graduate studies here at LIU Post.
Through Kim’s connections, Lee took seven students and one faculty member on an art expedition through Korea’s colleges. They showcased their artwork at, as well as alongside, four Korean universities that they visited abroad. “It was a fantastic experience for everybody. LIU students [got] to show [their artwork] with Korean students and experienced a real exchange. It’s not just [about] sending the work or looking at the work, but really [getting to] interact [with the artists],” Lee said.
He continued, “A lot of times we use the fancy word ‘exchange’, but it’s not [a] real exchange, it’s just send[ing] it.” 11 delegates including the Dean of Honam University traveled from South Korea just to attend the art exchange reception at Post. “This is a truly successful experience for our students, faculty, and the university because [we’re letting] Korea know that LIU is very active [in the arts],” Lee said.
Ulsan University’s past exhibit was very similar to Honam’s, in both success and meeting expectations. The purpose of the exchange was to have three diverse universities find a common ground through art.
Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students presented their creations at both Uslan and Honam’s exhibitions. “I tried to make it [so that] everybody get[s] involved, so [that] they can be part of it instead of saying ‘oh, only our top graduate students or faculty will be shown’,” Lee said.
Plans have already been made for next year’s art expedition to Korea, with four different schools lined up. The excursion is a 10-day, full credit summer workshop sometime in May 2015, and will be open to both Art, and non-Art majors. “All my students are so excited about it because they heard how great [of an] experience it was when I took students three years ago. They keep begging me to take them so we’re going to do it right after school is over,” Lee said.
The final exhibit of the international series will feature LIU Post’s Heon Woo Nam (a.k.a. HuNoo). HuNoo is a sculptor who will be showcasing a series of eyepieces at his reception in the SAL Gallery. “When I was in Korea, I usually [made] 3D realistic animal[s], and when I finished my work, I just took the eye part. I’m going to be concentrating on [the making of the] eye series,” HuNoo said.
“I’m curious about the imagination, and also I’m curious about the real creation. I don’t want my work to be only my imagination. I want the audience to make their own imagination, so we can both make a creation,” said HuNoo regarding why he shifted his artistic focus to the eye. HuNoo explained, “Through this, my audience can make their own animal, whatever they want [based on the] eye pieces.”
“I think that everybody is connected because we can’t live without each other,” Kim said. “There are very different pieces [in the exhibit], yet they are [all] together in one space. [Each piece] expresses [different] characteristics, and their style is very different, yet they [are] all together in one space.”

LIU Post’s Little Theatre Mainstage is gearing up for their next production. “Big Love,” written by Charles L. Mee, and directed by Jason Jacobs, is edgy, dark, and thought provoking. As the playwright himself puts it: “It’s jagged, it has sharp angles. It’s like life.”
“Big Love” is an adaptation of “The Suppliants” by ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus, who was known as “the father of tragedy.” This particular work focuses on the story of 50 brides who flee to a manor in Italy to avoid marrying their 50 cousins. Mee’s play is full of blood, violence, death, and conflict — elements Aeschylus would surely approve of.
In the midst of this madness, there is a sigh of comic relief, provided by student-actors Emily Locklear and Jeffrey Tierney, who play lovers Eleanor and Leo. Locklear, a junior Musical Theatre major, described Eleanor as a British woman vacationing in Italy, who then meets Leo. “She absolutely [falls] in love with him,” said Locklear. “She used to be this uptight woman, and the joy and love she found in Italy opened her up.”
Tierney, a junior Acting major, stated the importance of the writing and acting in a play, and how the two components are essential for good characters. “When a play has both good writing and acting, the characters are given more depth. You don’t see a character and judge them,” he explained. “You should be able to see from the character’s point of view, [and] sympathize with them. There’s more to them than it seems. You learn their backstory.”
To build these strong characters, the actors built a strong connection with each other. “We’ve been approaching the play intellectually and physically,” said Locklear. “In rehearsal, we all stood in a circle, focusing on creating an open heart as a group. We would have to jump or turn in a circle at the same time.” By doing this unity exercise, the cast created a shared heartbeat, pulsing together throughout the show.
The cast and crew of “Big Love” recently rehearsed the play’s climax, in which particularly maddening elements are showcased. Without giving too much away: there is a wedding, and it is a most unholy matrimony, reminiscent of the “Red Wedding” from “Game of Thrones.” But bloodshed takes a lot of work, rehearsal, and blood packets.
Emma Barishman, a junior Musical Theatre major, is the production blood specialist. Her job is to figure out how to get blood on all of the characters that get killed. There are a few options: “We have spray bottles, water balloons filled with blood, and squeeze bottles filled with blood,” she said. These options are death scene-specific, so to speak. “Depending on how the person dies, that determines how we get blood on them,” Barishman explained. “We look at what kind of injuries they have on them and how the blood would leave those injuries. Depending on how you get killed, blood could pulse out, spray out, ooze out.”
“This is a big, physical show,” explained Jacobs, the director. “It’s an exciting challenge for the actors and myself, because the playwright asks for larger-than-life physical gestures to express the emotions of the play. Most of the plays you work on are more restrained — you are recreating ‘realistic’ behavior, or you have a set of rules: the historical setting, societal norms, and the story. This is a very open play, anything can happen. But it calls for us to express ourselves much bigger, louder, [and] fuller than we ever do in real life. That is an exciting challenge.”
Having directed the production of “Marat/Sade” last year, Jacobs is no stranger to bringing plays that have a bite to the stage. He does
so with incredible execution; his methods are clear and concise, his approach seen with an expert eye. These are shows that stick with you after you see them.
“Two things I really love about directing plays at LIU: First, the teachers choose really exciting, challenging, ambitious plays, and the department supports those productions. I aim to push my own boundaries by working here. Every time [Theatre Director] Maria Porter calls me, it’s like she’s saying ‘I dare you to come direct this show’, and I usually always want to say yes,” said Jacobs. “The other great thing is the attitude of the students in this program. I find these actors so courageous and willing to go for it. By and large, they also say ‘yes’ to the dares I give them. So everyone is working to push past boundaries. It’s not always easy or comfortable, but it’s always exciting. I love that.”
“Big Love” premiers at the Little Theatre Mainstage on Oct. 3-4, and Oct. 9-12 at 7:30 p.m. It will also be shown on Oct. 10 at 2 p.m., and again on Oct. 12 at 3 p.m. Tickets can be purchased at the Post Theatre Company Box office, at $10 general admission and $5 for students and seniors with ID. For more information, call 516-299-2356.
“It’s a lot to take in,” exclaimed Locklear. “I had fun watching it!”
