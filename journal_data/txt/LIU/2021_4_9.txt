Freshman Laura Fekete made history when she won the Fencing NCAA National Championship in Epée, becoming the first national champion for the Sharks in program history. 
The championship was held on Saturday and Sunday, March 27-28, in State College, Pennsylvania. Three Sharks were selected to compete in the tournament. Anna Szántay finished 12 of 22 in Foil, and Chejsa-Kaili Seck finished 11 of 24 in Sabre. 
Head Coach Ivan Lee had great things to say about his team, especially after the adversity they faced throughout the season. 
“It went very well. We battled several quarantines, injuries and a shortened schedule, but still finished with a winning record, three All-Americans and a National Champion,” he said. 
Lee is very proud of the three fencers who competed the weekend of the tournament. 
“They all fenced very well, and I’m sure that they will draw from this experience to continue putting up stellar results in the future,” he said. 
Fekete was very confident after finding out she was selected to play in the championship. 
“I was expecting it, I did really good in the regular season, but I was still happy to see my name on the list officially,” she said. “I was looking forward to the competition. I was excited about it.”
Fekete knew she had to keep a strong mentality going into the initial rounds of play. 
“I knew I had to be as untouchable as I could because not only the wins but also the touches I got counted,” she said. “Even though I did not finish the poles as I wanted to, I still got into the top four, which I wasn’t even brave enough to dream about.”
The opening five rounds were split with the first three on Saturday, and the last two Sunday morning, the top four from each competition played in the finals Sunday afternoon. 
Fekete did not play as well as she would have hoped on Saturday but kept her confidence up to compete at her best all Sunday. 
“I finished the first-day seventh on the list. I had mixed feelings about this, but mostly I thought I did not have any chance left to make the top four. I remember talking to my mom, saying I’ll be happy if I stay in top eight, coming home with an award,” she said. “When I saw my name on the third place after the poles, I could not believe it. I called my mom again, crying, she picked up crying.” 
Fekete knew she did want to miss the opportunity she had right before her when the round-robin kicked off.
“When the finals came, Ivan told me that all I had to do was enjoy fencing. One thing about me, I am really competitive, so I did exactly what I was told to do,” she said. 
Fekete played the top two ranked finishers in the finals. She knocked off the #2 qualifier Miriam Grady 15-13 and then defeated the #1 ranked player in the tournament, Kaylin Hsieh, in the final round. The judge confirmed the final touch over replay review to give Fekete the 14-13 win and the title. Both Hsieh and Grady are from Notre Dame. 
Fekete had a mix of immediate emotions when she realized she won. 
“I screamed as I usually do after giving a touch, and then I started crying,” she said. “I did not believe and cannot believe until this day that I won.”
It means a lot to Fekete to have made such a significant impact on her team and Shark history so early on in her collegiate athletic career. 
“I did not know until just later after I won that I was the first one to win a national championship for the school. I feel extremely proud, and I feel like I already proved to the school that it was the right decision to sign me,” she said. “I am really happy I could put the LIU fencing program on the map, hopefully attracting more talented fencers to the school, making Shark history even brighter, more known and more feared among other schools.”
Fekete claims Coach Lee and her upperclassman teammates by her side played a huge role in all these achievements. 
“Ivan helped me with everything he could. He was always by my side. My teammates always supported me, cheered on me, helped me at practices with preparing,” she said. “Ivan arranged my preparation by helping me go to a strong club in the city, where I could fence with members of the USA team and other college fencers.”
Fekete loved the experience and everything she took away from it. 
“I really enjoyed the competition, but I think the most important thing I took away is the lessons it taught me about what I need to focus on more when fencing. The competition pointed out things about my fencing that I never really used and knew. This led me to win the competition,” she said. “I learned that I have to get out of my comfort zone and believe in what I do to be able to give my best. Apart from just looking at myself fencing in the competition, it was really good to see how my teammates were cheering for me, even some people I didn’t even know, in the finals.”
Fekete has been fencing since she was eight years old when a few recruiters came to her primary school, and she has loved the sport ever since. 
Anna Szántay was very excited when she found out she was selected to play in the championship as well.
“I felt like I was above the ground! I was happy and started to inform my family members and my friends what I have achieved,” she said.
Szántay always enjoys the thrill of the competition but always remembers to take it all in and enjoy it. 
“I had this kind of experience before when I was a European and World Championship participant, but this time I was more relaxed than ever before. I had nothing to lose, and I was eager to fence with the others,” she said.
Chejsa-Kaili Seck had a very similar sentiment.
“Going to NCAA’s has always been one of my goals, and I was extremely excited to hear I qualified. I felt very accomplished and blessed that the work I put in paid off,” she said. 
Seck enjoyed being a part of the tournament.
“Being at the championships made me very happy, especially after not having fenced in a competition like that in a pretty long time,” she said. “Being back in that setting made me remember how much I love fencing in competitions.”
Seck is very pleased with the way everything turned out and is looking forward to the future. 
“Having performed well at championships made me happy to be a shark and want to continue performing well for my team as well as the school,” she said. “The memories that I made with Laura, Anna and Ivan are some that I will cherish forever.”
Szantay shares a very similar sentiment. 
“I have experienced a lot of new and interesting things. The vibe there was more like a celebration than a competition. The people were amazing. I have already had a good connection with my teammates, but we are more bonded now than ever with Chejsa, Laura and even with the whole team,” she said. “They supported us while we were there, and it gave us energy, and of course, I have learned that LIU has the best coach of all time. He is a character, and we are so lucky to have him here.”

Baseball fans are excited as the MLB 2021 season begins. Fans can watch the games as they untangle their crossed-fingers and start to watch players kick into high gear, a step closer to witnessing fan’s predictions and expectations, hopefully, come to fruition.
Some students have very high expectations for their favorite teams.  Ryan Boettcher, a sophomore broadcasting major, expects  “a playoff appearance after a five-year drought for the Mets.”
Boettcher expects the Mets to excel this season.
“The Mets have a ton of depth with the pitchers and hitters that Sandy and Zach Scott picked up, so I expect us to improve as a team,” he said.
Some have even higher expectations. Dean Carfora, a junior business administration major, enthusiastically talked of his team, the Yankees, saying that he expects a championship run.
 “They will make the World Series and win it.  While that may be a bold statement, it has almost been a decade and a half since they won in 2009.  In the team’s history, they have won 27 out of the 40 times they were in the World Series, which is pretty good if you ask me, so I hope that they are able to revive the once second nature legacy,” he said.
Perhaps what’s more thrilling is the official news that fans will be able to return to the stadiums.  Boettcher expressed that he is “very excited for the new season, especially because of the ability for fans to return.  I have some tickets, and I’m hoping to attend.”  
Though most of the stadiums will be only at about twenty percent capacity (including the Mets and Yankees), most student fans are just grateful to attend.  Carfora conveyed that he “really missed not being able to go last year.”

“Animal Crossing New Horizons”  released March 20, 2020, a mere eight days after the university announced it would remain closed the rest of the semester. When the world was falling apart, “Animal Crossing” gave a sense of comfort and a positive distraction for many students. 
“Animal Crossing” is a time-waster for some, but a sense of routine for many others, especially during these unprecedented times. This virtual world is full of possibilities and its impact is prevalent even a year later. 
Junior acting major Steele Whitney played “Animal Crossing” on his Nintendo DS back in the day. He was looking forward to the release of the new game but was debating buying it. Then quarantine hit and Whitney realized he’d have some extra time on his hands. 
“‘Animal Crossing’ gave me a routine when life felt pretty routine-less. It was really calming and felt like a meditation almost,” Whitney said. “I think ‘Animal Crossing’ means so much to people because of the freedom it offers. You can do whatever you want and there is no way to do it right. It’s whatever journey you want to take.” 
Junior musical theatre major Sophia Quinones started playing New Horizons fairly recently and found it to be a nice distraction from the hectic nature of the real world. 
“I actually started to play New Horizons this past December when I got a Nintendo Switch. It was in the middle of preparing for my finals so I was pretty stressed and the game helped to remind me to take a break every once in a while,” she said.
Sophomore Art Education major Loredana Citizen has been playing “Animal Crossing New Horizons” since it was first released. 
“New Horizons is a customizable escape into a loving, adorable community, and it certainly helped me stay sane throughout quarantine. When New Horizons came out, I was back home in Las Vegas navigating my first couple weeks of an unexpected online class. The time difference between Nevada and New York is three hours, so I had to log on to my 8 a.m. classes at 5 a.m. This schedule shift was really hard to adjust to and I ended up living nocturnally. When I was awake, the rest of my family was asleep, so I spent hours upon hours on ‘Animal Crossing’ to pass the time. Having a project for these long nights helped me adjust and feel productive during one of the strangest times of my life,” Citizen said. 
Citizen believes that the game reached widespread popularity because of the amount of customization it offers the player. 
“I think ‘Animal Crossing’ means so much to people because it gives the player a lot of control and the opportunity to express individuality and creativity. The game design is very cute, the music is peaceful, and is full to the brim with little jokes and puns to make you smile.”
“Animal Crossing New Horizons” is available for Nintendo Switch for $60.

The university is currently considering options to host an in-person commencement ceremony for the class of 2021, according to an email sent to students by Chief of Student Affairs Michael Berthel on March 29.
“The health and well-being of our graduates and community is our number one priority, and the University is awaiting additional information from health and safety officials before deciding our final plan for Commencement,” the email stated. “As we await further direction, the University is exploring options to hold an in-person ceremony for graduates. The ceremony would be streamed live so family and friends can be part of your special day.”
A follow up email sent by the Long Island University Commencement Team on Friday, April 2, reaffirmed the universities goal for an in-person ceremony.
“Our goal is to hold an in-person ceremony for graduates to attend that would be streamed live so family and friends can be part of your special day,” the email stated.
Students have mixed feelings about what format they would prefer for their ideal commencement ceremony. 
Senior psychology major Nicole Ludwig would not be comfortable attending an in-person ceremony.
“COVID-19 is still a concern to me and I have several immunocompromised family members. I don’t want to put their well-being at risk for something that at the end of the day is just one day of my life,” she said. “We can celebrate in other meaningful ways, even if it does suck a little.”
Ludwig would prefer the event to be held virtually.
“If circumstances were different, then of course I’d want in-person, but virtual is both the safest and most realistic option for how 2021 is going,” she said.
Senior psychology major Shayla Harris agrees with Ludwig, and would prefer the event to be held virtually for the safety of everyone involved. 
“I’m fully vaccinated, but I would not be comfortable with such a large gathering where most people would not be fully vaccinated, and I would not be comfortable knowing that the administration almost certainly did not ask the faculty and staff who would have to put on the event if they would be comfortable,” she said.
Harris believes that college graduations across the country should be held virtually this year and that students should have small individual gatherings with family and friends, rather than coming all together for one big ceremony. 
“Students will have parties with their families and friends for their graduation, as is their right, but there is no reason for all of us to gather together with everyone’s friends and families,” she said. “Students could even gather with their friends and families in their backyards and watch the virtual graduation ceremony, and still have all the emotional moments they want without exposing everyone else to their family’s germs.”
Senior psychology, criminal justice and philosophy major, J. Fordsman, prefers the idea of an in-person ceremony, as long as it is held with safety in mind.
“If we do an in-person graduation where all the students are there, but no parents and guests are, then I’m one hundred percent okay with that,” he said.
Senior art therapy major, Kiki Griffin, would prefer an in-person ceremony, but understands why the university might decide to change to an all virtual format.
“You are graduating from college and you always thought you would walk, so I would definitely be sad if I didn’t get a chance to walk,” she said, “but then again it’s a really big accomplishment just to be graduating, so I’m excited to graduate and see what the future holds for me.”
One idea being implemented by other universities is having an in person ceremony for the graduating class, while family and friends would watch virtually from home. 
Senior art therapy major Emma Herrmann described the idea of a live streamed graduation as “the new normal.” 
“It’s a little sad, but it will be cool to be able to do that with our peers,” she said. 
Ludwig believes that prohibiting family members from attending the ceremony would defeat the purpose of hosting it in the first place.
“A ceremony is meaningful for a lot of people because their family or loved ones are there. Also, if you’re concerned to the point where we have to limit who comes, then there probably shouldn’t be an in-person ceremony at all. That in itself, to me, is admitting that it’s too risky,” she said.
Regardless of what format the university decides for hosting commencement, Griffin plans to make the most of it. 
“Either way I’m going to go outside, celebrate with friends and we’re all going to throw our caps up in the air one way or another,” she said.
The commencement ceremony for the class of 2021 will take place on Thursday, May 13. A format has yet to officially be announced.

NBA fans were shaken up on Thursday, March 25, leading up to that 3 p.m. deadline. The day started with some small moves made. The Miami Heat attained Trevor Ariza, a player that fans think will make a difference for a franchise. Blake Griffin agreed to a buyout by the Pistons and then signed with the Brooklyn Nets. 
The Magic decided to blow up their struggling team to nobody’s surprise. The Orlando Magic have repeatedly shown their inability to impact the NBA despite the development of now two-time all-star Nikola Vucevic, who was traded on March 25. The Magic sent over Vucevic and Al-Farouq Aminu for Otto Porter Jr, Wendell Carter Jr, and two first-round picks signify that the Magic are attempting to rebuild. Aminu, a role player who was highly sought out during his short stint as a free agent, signed with the Magic just last off-season. 
The Bulls caused a scene on Deadline Day, adding another all-star alongside Zack Lavine, with Aminu complimenting their very young but talented core and talented coach Billy Donovan serving as their commander.
The New York Knicks made minimal moves, only helping facilitate a trade amongst 76ers and OKC acquiring Terrance Ferguson and Vincent Poirier. 
Freshman Marco Ristic was unhappy with the trade.
 “Well, what I can say about the Terrance Ferguson move is that the Knicks got a guy that has room for improvement,” he said.
The Knicks recently reported that they intended to waive Ferguson and Poirier, and Ristic was not happy with the move. 
“You could say I’m a little disappointed that the Knicks are waiving him, mainly because the Knicks would’ve helped him develop into a great player,” he said.
The Miami Heat acquired Nemanja Belica and two time all-star Victor Oladipo for what most would consider a very lopsided deal on Miami’s side. Moe Harkless, who barely gave the Heat a good minute, Avery Bradley, who was injured for most of his time in South Beach, and the very inconsistent Kelly Olynyk for what the Heat ended up with is ridiculous and shocking when most Heat fans were expecting to lose most of their talented young core, specifically Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson. Miami is still very weak at the frontcourt, with Bam Adebayo as their only threat there with little to no help. Miami so far has missed plenty of chances to acquire a supplemental big man for Bam in Lamarcus Aldridge, Andre Drummond and Gorgui Dieng. There are hopes of signing Demarcus Cousins, but with more teams coming into the mix, hopes are low at the moment.
The Brooklyn Nets have NBA fans shook. The Nets, who acquired James Harden in a three-team deal with the Houston Rockets and Indiana Pacers, recently signed Blake Griffin in early March after being bought out by the Pistons. They have since made more moves, acquiring Lamarcus Aldridge. 
This has led to increased controversy amongst NBA fans, including Shane Douglas, a freshman psychology major, who was shocked at the Lamarcus Aldridge signing news. 
“The Nets really shook up the league on deadline day and have a good chance at winning in the finals.” 
Many fans on the internet have compared the Adam Silver administration to the David Stern administration, who sadly passed last year. While Stern prevented a Chris Paul trade to the Lakers with an aging Kobe Bryant, Silver has let two dynasties form, both with Kevin Durant. The Golden State Warriors team that included Steph Curry, arguably the best three-point shooter of all time, and Klay Thompson, who also belongs amongst the three-point greats, and the Brooklyn Nets, who many suggest will become the same with 40 all-star appearances shared between James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Lamarcus Aldridge, and Blake Griffin. 
NBA fans are in for a wild ride with many scared and many happy for what is to come.
