Over the past several months, life and everything it entails has abruptly forced us to evolve due to the coronavirus. Athletes at Long Island University have had to make significant seasonal lifestyle changes to safely progress during this ongoing pandemic.
Jamie Alvino, a senior on the women’s’ lacrosse team studying health sciences and nutrition/diabetics, claimed when everything was shut down, athletics had protocols to keep athletes in shape.“When COVID started, my teammates and I were emailed by our strength and conditioning coach specific workout plans. They were not mandatory to do but highly recommended. The workouts were emailed around the first week in April,” Alvino said.
The four-year member of the LIU Sharks women’s lacrosse team continued to keep up with the athletics staff’s measures. “Since then, and until the 2020 school year started, I have been following our team’s workout plan. It was mixed with cardio, HIIT, and strength training (bodyweight). When the LIU Post campus closed for two weeks in mid-October, we were emailed again with home workouts that I followed as well.”
Camden Orth, a sophomore broadcasting major and starting quarterback for the football team, shared that he has been making the most of the whole situation. “I’ve spent a majority of the semester at home working out and attending classes through zoom. I have a weight room set up in my garage,” he said. “I work out five days a week and do mobility work seven days a week.”
Since the start of the 2020 school year, teams have granted some allowances for their usual schedules. Although athletes are grateful for this opportunity, many would agree that the circumstances given are not the traditional wholehearted team vibes from the past. Athletes and coaches will attest that isolated and socially distanced practices and workout sessions have directly impacted their teams.
Alvino shared, “I’ve definitely noticed a direct impact on our team’s bond due to COVID safety protocols. Since we have to remain socially distancing when playing on the field, it was a difficult start,” she said. “We started in groups/pods of 5, so it was definitely hard to connect with people outside of our group. But as time went on, we were able to branch out of our groups/pods and play with different groups. My teammates and I are just doing everything we can to stay safe, have fun and focus on the sport we all love to hopefully be able to complete in the 2021 spring season.”
Jilian Hugh, a sophomore criminal justice major on the cheerleading team, claimed the athletic staff taught the team knew workouts to stay in shape throughout the pandemic. “Starting off the fall 2020 season, the coaches provided our program with an hour of assistance each week from LIU’s athletic trainer. We were taught many different exercises along with how to use the various types of weight-room equipment properly and efficiently. The workouts are intended to work every part of our bodies. Our routine begins with basic cardio, warm-ups, and stretching. After that, we begin the more intense, fast pace workouts that may include things like dumbbells, medicine balls, and cardio machines.”
In efforts to keep the entire LIU community safe during these worrisome times, the student-athletes have been extremely optimistic and understanding, given their current circumstances. Teams have even begun alternative ways to bond and stay in shape together.
Emma Cantwell, a junior early childhood education major on the women’s lacrosse team, shared that leadership has been vital in getting the team through these rough times.“Although COVID has impacted our fall season dramatically, our Coach has done an amazing job in finding new and innovative ways to keep us connected. As a result, we have experienced a great deal of events on zoom, such as team yoga.”
Alyssa Boll, a senior education major on the women’s lacrosse team, believes the team has become stronger together.
“This whole situation definitely made us closer as a team because we had to figure out how to have team chemistry while being socially distant. We all worked together to keep each other safe and healthy, so we’re able to compete together as a family.”
Jillian Hugh added that safety is of utmost priority. “While navigating through these new COVID regulations, we mainly all want to make sure we are comfortable, staying safe, and mainly healthy. Our new normals are focused around making sure that our health comes first, and we do our best to prevent the spread.”

Three members of the Long Island University Women’s Hockey team will represent their home countries by competing for their national teams in upcoming tournaments. The players were selected to play against the best teams in other countries. Sophomore defender Paula Bergstrom and sophomore forward Matilda Af Bjur both made the Sweden National Team. Sophomore defender Linn Thomsen made the Denmark National Team. During the 2019-20 season, Bergstrom and Af Bjur made the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance (NEWHA) All-Rookie team.
Playing for the National Team is a significant honor, and Bjur was very excited to have this experience. “Being selected to play for my national team is always a big achievement, and one of the biggest honors in my eyes,” she said. “This time was extra special to me because it was the first time I got to represent Sweden on the senior level and play my first games.” 
Bergstrom will use this opportunity as momentum for the upcoming season. “The nationals gave me an extra boost of confidence that I will bring when I come back to LIU. It is important to me that I stay humble and keep playing my game,” she said. “I am also excited to get back on campus to work on the parts that needs improvement so I can take my game to the next need.” 
The hockey program is young, but in their first season, they were named NEWHA Champions. Thomsen has high standards going into the season and long term at LIU. “My goal is to defend our title as NEWHA champions and keep getting better and grinding in this difficult time as a team so we can play in the NCAA tournament next season,” she said. 
The Sharks will return to play in January 2021 as part of the NEWHA conference.
