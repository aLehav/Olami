At around 7:40 a.m. on Wednesday, February 22nd, a student driver was turning into the campus’ East Gate, lost control, and hit a tree. Two students were in the car. The Old Brookville Police Department responded and dispatched two cars. Roslyn Rescue’s EMS was also on the scene. Public Safety responded with three vehicles and Post’s EMS. No one was transported to the hospital. There was damage to the car. Attempts were made to reach the Old Brookville Police Department and Public Safety. Both institutions declined to comment in order to preserve the privacy of the students involved.

On the night of February 16th, love was in the air in the Hillwood Café. NAACP held a speed-dating event for students who were looking for love or just a friendship. Before the speed-dating started, NAACP got nine tables together and scattered  chocolate candy and tea around each of them. NAACP provided music and beverages to really set the ‘love’ atmosphere for everyone who was arriving to the speed-dating event. The rules of NAACP’s speed-dating were that a male and a female sat at the table, and after three minutes of conversation, the males rotated as the females stayed where they were seated. While the couples were getting to know each other, NAACP members handed out some refreshments to keep the couples comfortable.
Senior Vance Henry, a Radiology major who helped to make this event happen, explained why the NAACP wanted to hold a speed-dating event. He said, “Though Valentine’s day is over, NAACP wanted to do something for everyone to still help them out. It’s also a good way for kids to interact on campus and get to know each other.”
Students who attended the speed-dating event were also asked questions about how they felt while being a part of the speed-dating. When asked why she wanted to participle in NAACP speed-dating, junior Sociology major Ara Mcpherson stated, “It allows you to get to know people on campus better, those who you wouldn’t really normally associate with.”
When asked if they had ever participated in speed-dating before, freshman Broadcasting major Kendall Bruton and Mcpherson both explained that this was their first time. Bruton stated, “I want to meet some new people, new friends, and do something fun on a Thursday night.”  Friendship and getting to meet new people  were the main reasons many students attended this event.
Mcpherson said that she wasn’t really looking for a relationship but, rather, for more of a lifelong friendship. NAACP speed-dating really broke the ice for some people to get to know each other. The speed-dating event had 16 student participants. NAACP has held a few other speed-dating events in the past, but this one had the best turnout according to Mcpherson.

The three panelists who spoke at the lecture hosted by LIU Post’s Women’s Institute provided three essential tips to succeed: Invest in yourself, become a lifelong learner and respect the power of the dollar.
The lecture, entitled “Follow Your Passion: Reinvent Yourself and Your Identity,” was held in the Winnick House’s Great Hall on February 15th.  The setting was intimate: dim lighting, a few rows of chairs and the three speakers sitting close to the audience. No podiums. No microphones.
The invited guests, Karen McKenna, a career counselor, Rona Wexler, a vocational evaluator and employability expert, and Arlene Haims, a financial expert, detailed their tips for success.
The first tip they outlined is to invest time and energy into yourself.  In order to do this, McKenna stressed the importance of dedicating time towards figuring out what motivates you. Find out what it is that you want to do. If you’re having difficulty with this, take an assessment test. Assessment tests take into consideration your passions and interests and can set you in the right direction, she explained. Students can take assessment tests online or in the Career Services Office.
After figuring out what you want to do, invest time and money into it, McKenna continued. This may mean spending a little more money to take an extra class in what you want to do or saving up to take an extra course in the summer. “If you make all those investments, the time and the energy and the money, the result is a life well lived,” McKenna said of her tips.
Following that, Wexler advised the audience to become lifelong learners. “Becoming a lifelong learner means you take risks into learning things that aren’t in your comfort zone,” she said. However, Wexler’s message was more about how to be productive in searching for a career.
Wexler’s career tips include interning, networking and volunteering. “I advise people who are very experienced, as well as less experienced, to do volunteer work and find ways to make yourself visible.” To do this, Wexler recommends making suggestions and assisting team members anytime possible.
The final tip was to respect the power of money. This, according to Haims, is the method to achieving financial security.  Haims stressed the importance of paying yourself first, which means saving a portion of your money every month and committing to that savings plan.
Haims also advised paying your bills on time. Set up one day every month to pay your bills, she said. One of her tips really resonated with the student audience. When it came to the topic of deferment, she advised students against it. “I’m telling you to think two, three, four times before you do that, and the reason is that when you defer college loans, there’s still interest due, and you’re going to be paying interest on top of interest,” Haims added.
The power of money goes beyond affording material things, Haims said.  “It can buy you an opportunity; it can buy you time, so my suggestion is save your money and really think twice about what you’re doing.” She tied this up with an anecdote about knowing people who take on jobs solely because they need money. However, if you respect the power of money, according to Haims, you can afford to pursue the careers you want.
Another tip from the three panelists was to take advantage of all resources. “The alumni association at school is always a wonderful resource,” according to McKenna. Alums can put you in touch with people they know.
Another tip is to test out informational interviews. “It’s a very tried and true strategy. When you go on an informational interview, you are not looking for a job. So, ask good, intelligent questions,” Wexler said.
Finally, pay your credit cards on time. Poor credit history can influence an employer’s decision in hiring you, Haims said.
When the lecture concluded, students shared their views on the event. “I really enjoyed it,” junior Social Work major Audrey Thompson said of the lecture. She added, “It was very educational.”
Senior English Major Elizabeth Freeman also thought it was educational, adding, “I feel like I learned a lot about myself and what I need to do to work on my strengths and weaknesses.”
The LIU Post’s Women’s Institute hosts lectures, forums, workshops and seminars on issues affecting women. On April 18th, the institute will present speaker Virginia Russell, who will address the topic of “Pay Equity.”

On Thursday, February 17th, junior Film major Dontae Hawkins received the 2012 Black American Achievement Award from Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro. Hawkins was given the award “in recognition of your determination and perseverance in overcoming obstacles in your life and becoming the outstanding young man you are today,” as inscribed on the plaque he was given at his award ceremony on Staten Island.
Hawkins, now 20 years old, was involved in a tragic accident when he was only three years old, an accident that doctors said he would never fully recover from. Almost a decade later, he has proven them wrong. His choices after the accident led him to this prestigious award. “I was given the award because after my accident in 1994, I did not give into the adversity and the negativity that surrounded me, but, instead, I realized it was because of a miracle that I survived. I decided to do something important with my life instead of going the same route as the violence that led to my accident.”
Hawkins, who was not expecting to receive any kind of award, also said he felt “very honored to win the award because when I was nominated, I felt that I hadn’t really deserved it, but now that I’ve had a chance to look back at it, I’ve overcome a lot and hope that my story can help inspire others that are going through rough times or adversity.”
So, what is next for Hawkins? He is continuing his academic carrier at LIU Post with ambitions of being a filmmaker. He also hopes that he can continue to inspire those around him to overcome adversity and never give up.

Pulitzer Prize winner, LIU Post alumnus and reporter at the New York Post Josh Margolin gave a lecture as a part of the Media Arts Department’s Food for Thought Lecture Series on Thursday, February 16th, during the Common Hour.  He discussed his journeys as a journalist and the different situations he encountered on his voyage toward the position that he holds today as a reporter for the New York Post.
Margolin attended Post from 1988-1992 as a Journalism major and was the Editor of The Pioneer.  During the lecture, he spoke about his internship with Newsday.  “A big story would break, and they knew I was willing to go out and get stories,” he said.  He was a single guy with a car, and they realized that, so Newsday would send him out.
He went on to stress the importance of deadlines and abiding by them, saying that it’s not about how smart you are, but, rather, about getting the facts of your story and having your piece in by deadline.
Margolin was determined to make his mark within the journalism field.  After graduating from Post, he sent out 145 resumes all over the country.  He received three interviews and one job offer, joking that the job offer he received was from the tenth largest newspaper in New Mexico.  He stayed there for about six months.  After time progressed and he made a couple of moves because of different job offers, Margolin settled in New Jersey for 12 years, writing for the Newark Star Ledger.
After taking some questions from students and realizing he had lost track of the original question, Margolin explained to students the importance of remembering their original questions.  He cautioned them to avoid getting caught up in what someone is telling you, as it is all too easy to do.  Therefore, he said journalists should always keep the original question in the back of their heads and refer back to it.
Margolin concluded the talk with advice for journalism students who are planning to enter the field.  He talked about using every tool that you have.  He mentioned that you should have a tape recorder and even went as far as to say that it is “essential” because it allows for more eye contact during an interview versus looking down at a notepad the whole time. He talked about remembering your job, which is to get the story.  Always keep pens, pencils and a note pad on you, he also reminded students. “A bad day for other people is a good story for us,” he joked.
Mekelia Channer, a senior Psychology major, attended the lecture and finds comfort in stories that each speaker tells about working with different people.  She says this gives her an insight as to what things may be like when she enters the working field.  She found it helpful when Margolin talked about always being ready for a story.  “Just be prepared with everything, whether it’s pencils, pens or a phone because, as a journalist, anything could happen,” said Channer.
Victoria Esteve, a junior Journalism major, said how she enjoyed the lecture.  “I think the lecture gave a good insight on what future career possibilities might be waiting for you outside of Post. It also gives you insight on how your career could look like.  You always need to be prepared because this isn’t a regular 9-5 job,” she said.  Esteve has attended most of the Food for Thought Lecture Series events that are sponsored by the Media Arts Department.  “I like how each lecture has had a different vibe to it,” Esteve said.
The Media Arts Department will hold its next Food for Thought lecture on Thursday, March 1st, at 12:45 p.m. in Humanities Hall. The guest speaker is Mercedes Vizcaino, the photography editor for All You Magazine/Time Inc.

Before every major election, the candidates spend countless hours preparing for debates. Candidates use these debates to show that their ideas are better than their competitors’ to show that they deserve your vote. But what do these debates really do? Are they even worth having?
The answer is not clear cut. It depends on who the candidates are, what the issues are, and what kind of debate it is. Lately, it seems that these debates are doing more harm than good. In the current Republican primary, we have seen several candidates have their chances at getting the nomination ruined by the debates. We have seen Rick Perry forget his own policies and Mitt Romney make a bet in the middle of a debate. Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain have both had to defend allegations of infidelity and Rick Santorum bluntly said that he disagrees with the current birth control system and then quickly tried to apologize for it. So why do we still have these debates in the first place?
We have these debates because it is the best way to get the candidates’ ideas out there. Without these debates, it would be very difficult for people to get a grasp of what a candidate is really like and what their policies are really trying to accomplish. These debates are possibly the best impression we can get of a candidate before an election. So even though they do make mistakes, and lately they have made plenty of them, it is important to look past these mistakes for a second and actually listen to what they have to say and see which one you actually agree with. However, these mistakes can’t be over looked so easily. After you have listened to their ideas, see who has made mistakes and see if the mistakes are really a huge deal. Let’s face it, no one is perfect by any means and mistakes will happen. If you can look past them, finding the right candidate is a lot easier.
But for the candidates, they have to be careful not to let the mistakes pile up because there are only so many mistakes that can be made before they reach the point of no return and they have just “mistaked” themselves out of an election.

No one likes their significant other’s ex hanging around. Why would you? It’s sort of awkward. However, sometimes there is no way around it. They hang out in the same group of friends that you and your boyfriend/girlfriend do (that’s why dating within your immediate circle of friends tends to be a bad idea, besides the fact that you could also end up as the awkward ex!).
So here you are, hanging out with your friends and your boyfriend/girlfriend and in walks the ex, now what? What do you do or say? Does everyone else notice the peculiar look on your face? I guess it all depends on the type of relationship they have with, who is now, your spouse. I’m going to take this from a girl’s perspective, seeing as I am, in fact, a girl.
The worst thing that this ex-girlfriend could do is give my boyfriend a hug or kiss hello in front of my face. It’s just a respect thing; girls as a whole tend to be untrustworthy, especially to other girls. So rule number one, keep your paws of my guy; you had him, you lost him, and now he’s mine so back off.
If I know that you still call, text, and whatever else all the time, talking about your personal problems, chances are I’m not going to like you. What will make it way worse is if I know that you were not the nicest of girlfriends and treated him with less respect then he deserves. Now I’m really not going to like you and will most likely give you dirty looks and make you feel uncomfortable any opportunity I get.
If you maintain a respectful distance and don’t approach me like I’m the evil new girlfriend, then I will be friendly. I don’t want to be mean and make you uncomfortable but if I feel that it’s necessary, don’t doubt me, because I will not make it a fun time for you. I have no problem sharing my friends but I will not share my boyfriend.
I suppose the moral of this story is to treat my boyfriend and I with respect and don’t make your presence uncomfortable for us. If you do, I will be sure to return the favor.

Monday morning, it’s 7 a.m. and the alarm is ringing. The only thing which prevents my alarm clock from being thrown into a wall is the fact that it’s my cell phone. With an improbable effort, I push myself out of warm and cozy bed to start a new study week.
Usually I spend my weekends off-campus- at my friends places in Manhattan or Brooklyn. So my mood is getting worse already on Sunday evening, when I realize that it’s time to stop partying, relaxing, entertaining myself and others—having fun in general—and it’s time to come back to campus and get ready for another hard week.
But Monday morning seems to be even worse. I make my way to the shower in order to wake myself up and get at least a little energy to start a new day. But as usual there is something that adds more trouble to an already difficult morning, you can’t choose what to wear (because by accident you tear your tights or notice some spot on your favorite blouse) or you can’t find some necessary stuff for class. As for me, I have something like that every time! It seems that together with a ruthless alarm and disgusting morning, the whole world is against you!
It doesn’t matter how many hours I sleep, I am unable to start a day without a couple of coffees. Fresh and cool morning wind takes away the last signs of sleepiness and for the first time this morning, you manage to unscramble your thoughts; what classes you have today, what assignments you were supposed to do and so on. In the classroom you are getting involved in your classmates conversations; it could be about your weekend, some assignments, or a quiz. During common hour you grab more coffee and meet some friends. The second half of the day always passes quicker. Thanks God—it’s already evening! That hard Monday practically comes to the end.
Surprisingly, all other weekdays pass even faster and then it’s already Thursday evening and you are done with your school week. So, you are welcome to make new awesome plans for the coming weekend and relax!
I am just a freshman and can’t imagine how the things will be when I have an internship or part-time job. But I hope that a few more cups of coffee during the day and some advice from senior college friends will help me not to get into a real time management trouble and to cope with everything with a little less stress!

I was lucky, or unlucky, enough to grow up in a time where female pop stars ruled the world, in fact  pop music ruled the world. Between Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and the Spice Girls, there were so many to choose from. I was more of a Britney Spears fan overall, but was she really the best role model to a young pre-teen girl about to experience puberty?
Pop culture saved me, but killed me at the same time. My mother was all for buying me all the new CDs that came out and having posters of the scantily clad pop stars in my room. I admired the music and I wanted to be just as beautiful as they were.  I knew deep down I would never look like Britney or be as thin as her, but I could imagine it and I did. What if I was that thin and people all over the world adored me and men wanted to date me? Well, I knew I certainly couldn’t dress the way they did since my parents would murder me and I wore a uniform to school everyday. It didn’t stop other girls from showing that they were trying to be sexy. I didn’t have that appeal or the confidence to even give the hint that I had it. I was a wallflower for a long time until I mustered up some confidence and courage. I decided to lose weight and I did lose a lot of it. And you know what, it didn’t make people notice me any more, in fact, I became more invisible because I was thinner.
I gave up on the sexy thing; I didn’t get my “groove” until my twenties. It didn’t take some pop idol to help me with that, it was all on my own. I had to accept myself as a person, decide who I wanted to be and who I really was. Yes, I could be sexy in my own way by not showing any skin, but by body language. I must say I think I’m doing an okay job. However, it doesn’t always work for all women. Many of my friends have slept with more men than I would rather say. But is that because of these pop stars we grew up with as our role models? Not that these girls came from shabby families, but television and pop culture definitely played a part. These depictions showed that girls who opened their legs could get whatever they wanted. The attention is what they wanted, but how long does that last until another girl comes along who is maybe “prettier” or has a “hotter body?”
This culture showed the world that women can be whatever people want us to be. Britney and Christina were young when they started and they were basically whored out by the media. Whatever you wanted from them, you got. Girls liked that these girls basically got popular for being beautiful and wearing scandalous clothing. Sure music was part of it, but not all their songs were hits. Sorry, but they weren’t. Surprisingly, the media has seemed to take hint of this. Pop acts such as Selena Gomez and Victoria Justice have become popular recently and I must say they are much better role models than the ones I had growing up. So to the future parents out there, watch out for who’s going to be popular next.

Before the start of last semester, Hillwood Commons upgraded some of its food service centers. One of the major changes was the addition of the new Starbucks. By now everyone has noticed it and many get their daily cup of coffee right here on campus. When people heard about the Starbucks coming on to campus, many were excited for its arrival.  The Pioneer investigated whether students are still happy to have it here now that it is a semester old.
Students still seem fairly happy about it. “I love it. I think they do a great job. The service is quality with a smile, and Starbucks coffee and coffee-based products are delicious. Thumbs up in my book.” said Junior Film major, Dontae Hawkins.
Senior Christie Cardinale agreed. “I’m happy with Starbucks because they’re open when I’d expect them to be closed. It makes me smile and warms my heart that they’re open when everything else is closed. I’m spending my meal plan rather than money at Starbucks down the road. Great for my budget as well.” For those who are concerned about their budget, the Starbucks does take dinning dollars and could be a good alternative instead of an off campus Starbucks.
However, no business is perfect and Starbucks still has room for improvement. Junior Photography major, Michael DiFilippo said, “I personally don’t buy Starbucks often but when I do there is always a line. The workers are very slow and socialize with each other instead of paying attention to what they are doing.” DiFilippo isn’t the only unsatisfied customer. Junior Art Education major, Briana Nussbaum, said that she is “not crazy about the service at this new Starbucks. The workers always seem unenthusiastic and work very slowly.”
So it seems that Starbucks may be a good thing but still needs some work. But according to Vincent Gentile, one of the Aramark managers in Hillwood Commons, there are a lot of changes that will be occurring very soon. “Beginning this summer, we will be renovating the Hillwood Cafe. Larger footprint, additional product offerings and food court layout. We are also in the very early stages of planning a renovation of the Winnick Center.”
As of right now, it is safe to say that Starbucks seems to be going over well, but still has some kinks to work out. It is also safe to say that big changes are on their way for the LIU Post dining services and maybe even work out those little problem areas that still need tending to.

Last year’s winter season in New York featured plenty of snow and crowded ski-areas. In the event that we see snow in March, for snowboard and ski enthusiasts at LIU Post, the ski areas are a little further away than just a walk out the door. However, various opportunities are available; some time-consuming to get to, while others can be reached after 90 minutes on the road.
LIU Post student and snowboard enthusiast, Andrew Trager, is not too impressed with the New York snowboarding. “For the time you are going to drive from here, it makes more sense to go to Vermont, because it’s better than New York, and pretty much the same distance,” he said, and then added, “If you want fresh powder, nothing compares to Vermont.” Large, famous ski areas, such as Killington, are located an estimated five hour drive from Long Island.
Trager enjoys doing an occasional Vermont trip, but usually he makes the 90 minute drive to Mountain Creek in New Jersey, where he buys a season pass every year. “I love rails and jumps,” he said, explaining how the mountain offers these facilities from top to bottom. Compared to the mountains in New York, Creek is smaller, but according to Trager, they are not worth more than twice the drive. “Mountain Creek features a ton of terrain, along with park-facilities, and offers riding for everyone, both beginners and advanced riders,” he said.
Junior Film major Christopher Jakobsen has visited Mountain Creek once. “I thought it was decent, but it didn´t have a lot of steep areas or off-piste opportunities,” he said. “For people who like riding the park, it is pretty good.” Jakobsen would rather do a trip to Vermont, “but I wish the drive was not that long,” he said. He is planning a spring break on the mountain as he’s currently researching which areas that will have the best snowfall at the moment. “After I moved to New York, I have done way too little snowboarding,” he said, explaining that time-consuming studies and a limited budget make weekend trips to another state a little too stressful. “Hopefully I manage to spend my week vacation up there, but I would love being able to visit the mountains more often,” he said.
Several online travel agencies offer bus trips to New York locations, Mountain Creek, Vermont, such as Killington, and Okemo. The packages can include transportation back and forth, lift-tickets, and rental- packages for both ski and snowboarders, if necessary. Day trips to Vermont ski areas usually depart from New York City locations around 4 a.m and arrive on the mountain at 9 a.m. The leave the mountain at 4.30 p.m. and reach the city again by 9.30 p.m. Visit sites such as www.nacski.com, www.skiclubofnewyork.org, and wwww.urbansherpatravel.com for more details and prices for day and weekend trips.
For spring break trips, www.skitravel.com offers packages to college students, 18 years of age and older, from March 11th – 15th to Mount Tremblant in Canada. The trip includes transportation (if needed), a shared condo, and four days of lift-tickets.
For LIU Post students, the Delta X Extreme Sports Club arranges ski-trips from time to time, usually once a year. Last year’s trip to Killington, VT, was cancelled because of poor snow-conditions on the mountain. Visit the club´s Facebook page, Delta X – Extreme Sports Group, where times of meetings and ideas can be discussed. “I think Delta X is an excellent club,” asserts group advisor, Kent Hatch. “Its purpose is to expose students to high adventure activities that they might not otherwise be exposed to. Students also get to see parts of the Northeast they might otherwise not get to see. Any students who like the outdoors or adventure should definitely join Delta X.”
Although it feels like spring, those who are not finished with winter still have many opportunities. The season usually ends in mid March, or in the beginning of April, depending on the conditions.

She sold over 170 million albums, singles, and videos. She released seven studio albums and three movie soundtracks, all of which with diamond, platinum, multi-platinum, and gold certification. She is the only artist with seven consecutive number one Billboard Hot 100 hits, surpassing previous records held by The Beatles and The Bee Gees. Her single “ I Will Always Love You” is the best selling single by a female artist in music history. Whitney Houston is often remembered for being a battered drug addict, but that is only a small part of her colossal story.
Through the 1980’s, Houston won countless awards ranging from Grammy’s and Emmy’s to MTV and Soul Train awards. Her first two albums, Whitney Houston and Whitney, both topped the Billboard Charts. Her performance of The Star Spangled Banner at the 1991 Super Bowl received such an overwhelming response that it was released as a single and reached Top 20 on the US Hot 100 list. It is the only performance of the national anthem to turn into a pop hit of that significance.
Houston met Bobby Brown at the 1989 Soul Train Awards and married him in July of 1992. They had their first and only child, Bobbi Kristina, in 1993. Through the 90’s, Houston’s career was still on fire with another chart topping album, another handful of awards, and the release of her most famous single, “I Will Always Love You.” After that, she released her My Love Is Your Love album and a greatest hits album, again proving how amazing her talent truly was.
In January 2000, Houston’s “good girl” image was trashed.  Airport security found marijuana in Houston and Brown’s luggage in Hawaii. The two managed to get on the plane and leave before authorities arrived and the charges against them were dropped. But drug rumors would continue to surface for the rest of her career. In an interview with Diane Sawyer in 2002, Whitney admitted to using drugs, like cocaine, occasionally.
Houston divorced Bobby Brown in 2007 and got custody of their daughter. That same year, Clive Davis announced that Whitney would be releasing another album. In 2009, she did her first on-screen interview in almost a decade with Oprah Winfrey where she spilled every detail of her drug abuse and personal life with Brown.
Whitney Houston’s last performance took place on February 9, 2012, when she sang, “Jesus Loves Me.” She was found dead two days later in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, submerged in the bathtub. Houston’s family later told L.A. County Coroner officials that she had died from a mix of Xanax, other prescription drugs, and alcohol. Her service in Newark, New Jersey lasted four hours and featured performances by Alicia Keys and Stevie Wonder.
Houston may be remembered by some as a drug addict, but that is not exactly fair. She is one of the greatest performers in the past century. She continues to hold records that haven’t even come close to being broken in the music industry. Her songs are still incredibly popular, as they should be. The death of Whitney Houston should be seen as a tragedy to the music industry, her incredible musical legacy is what she should be remembered for.

We live in a world of constantly changing technology. It seems that new cell phones and computers are coming out every week and we are always trying to keep up with them. But even after we get the latest Apple product or the latest Android phone, it opens up a whole new world of things you have to learn. You have to customize the phone to your specifications, new backgrounds, new ringtones, load your music on to it, and more. One of the most difficult question is what apps do you want to put on it. Between the Android market and the Apple app store, there are hundreds of thousands of apps to choose from, all of which useful for one reason or another, but which ones are right for you?
The answer depends on your specific needs. For the shopper on the go, Amazon now has an app so you can be anywhere and still be able to check out the latest deals. EBay also has a very popular app that keeps you connected to all of your EBay bids anywhere, anytime. If you are someone who prefers to shop in a mall or a grocery store, there are dozens of apps that can keep lists so you never forget exactly what you need to buy. For the shoppers who want the best deals, any one of the barcode scanner apps can give you prices of competitors instantly. And if you find something you really want or need, or if you’re just curious about your funds, just about every bank has an app that will let you log in and check your account information instantly so that you are less likely to overdraw your account.
What if you are a gamer? Then you are in luck. The app stores have hundreds of games to choose from, and creators are always uploading more and more. Right now, games like Angry Birds, Temple Run, Fruit Ninja, and Scramble With Friends are topping the charts in the Apple app store. If you are an Android user then Fruit Ninja, Plants vs. Zombies, and Cut The Rope are games that are on top right now. But these are just a few chart- topping games and there will surely be more to follow.
For the Photo enthusiasts, Instagram and Lightbox are the two big names that can help with all of your photo and editing needs. There are also dozens of other apps for special camera editing, picture taking, and everything else relating to photography.
There are apps for everything, from turning your camera flash into a mini flashlight to special apps that let you lock certain parts of your phone so only you can get to them. Now you can even get your favorite books, magazine, and even textbooks for class all on your phone. As technology expands, there will be even more apps and even more amazing things your phone will be able to do.
These ideas seem to follow through to Post students as well. Junior Film Major Dontae Hawkins enjoys a plethora of apps. “I Love Flixster, Twitter, Instagram, Citibank App for banking, Shazam, Subway Map, Flashlight, and a ton of game apps from Angry Birds to Fruit Ninja.”
Junior Photography major Michael DiFilippo says his favorites include “Facebook app, Twitter app, Chase banking app, Weather app, and Lightbox.”
Maybe your interests may vary but if you are looking for something new, try typing anything app related into a Google search or check the App Store or the Android Market and find the apps that work for you and you can make the most out of, until the next great craze comes along.

I must preface this article by saying that I am a recent convert when it comes to the art of organizing one’s closet. One of my New Year’s resolutions this year…well, every year…is to stay organized and keep my room clean.
As a full-time college student with two jobs and an addiction to reality television, I would much rather toss my clothes on the floor than take the time to put them in the laundry hamper, fold them, or hang them up. I know; I should be ashamed of myself. However, I am almost positive that many of you reading this are just like me. Have no fear, my fellow procrastinating fashionistas, I have you covered!
Before embarking on the seemingly arduous journey that is closet organization, you should trim the fat. No, I am not telling you to begin some sort of diet and exercise regimen, but I am insisting that you go through your closet and remove any unnecessary clothing. Now, unnecessary clothing is anything from those two-sizes-too-small jeans you purchased 2 years ago as motivation to lose weight to your trusty graphic t-shirt that has a small, but conspicuous hole on the arm. I am all for nostalgia and sentimentality, but enough is enough! You are wasting valuable closet space.
Ask yourself these questions: Have I worn this at any time in the past year? Would I wear this at any time this year? If the answer to both of those questions is no, you should donate it to charity. If you still do not want to part with it, purchase a storage bin from Target and store some items in there.
Congratulations to those of you that have made it this far! I will no longer sign you up to be on “Hoarders” and you are now ready to organize your closet. An optional part of this process is to remove everything from your closet and begin with a blank canvas. Either way, it is time to plan how you want to set up your closet. The two more popular ways are by color or by category. Although, if you are feeling especially motivated, you could organize by both.
If organizing by color, I advise starting with darker colors like black, brown, or navy, and ending with lighter colors like grey, cream, or white.
If organizing by category is more your speed, I recommend going in order by your top layer of clothing on. For example, the first items in my closet are coats and jackets. Next, I have sweaters, long sleeve shirts, short sleeve shirts, and tank tops. After that, I have jeans, other miscellaneous full-length pants, leggings, skirts, and then shorts. My closet ends with dresses. This is just what I found that works for me.
There are so many benefits when it comes to having an organized closet. It will take you less time to pick out an outfit in the morning. It will help you see what you need next time you go shopping. It will make better use of the space you have. Yet, at the end of the day, the whole point of organizing you closet is to make your life easier. Therefore, you have to find what works best for you.
Thankfully, this assignment will not be graded because there really is no right and wrong when it comes to organizing your closet. Good luck and happy organizing!

This week’s column is dedicated to the ladies here at LIU Post who are members of the sports teams. They’re beautiful, powerful, and confident, but they have feelings just like everyone else. I was approached by some members of the LIU Post Softball team who asked me if I would write a column about how they have been subject to hate speech on campus, being singled out and called “Dykes” without provocation.
Just because these women play sports doesn’t mean that they are lesbians. Even if some of them happen to be lesbians that is no one’s business and it is definitely no one’s place to make hateful remarks regarding anyone’s supposed sexuality.
I guess what it comes down to is this; sexuality is not a something that is visible. Just because a female plays sports or a male does ballet doesn’t necessarily mean that person is homosexual. There’s no law that says any woman who plays a sport must be homosexual. Yet, people think this to be the truth. They assume that if a girl doesn’t like to wear dresses and make up that she must be a lesbian. They couldn’t be further from the truth. Gender roles are created by society and therefore have no basis in nature.
Knowing some of the girls on the softball team, I can tell you that they are beautiful women and they deserve all the respect in the world. This isn’t an isolated incident unfortunately the women’s basketball, lacrosse, and field hockey teams, to name a few, have also been victims of such hate speech.
The thing that I find interesting is that when the Lingerie Football League came around men weren’t complaining or calling them lesbians or dykes. Was this because the women were scantily clad? I’d almost guarantee that it was. So what that tells me is that women can only participate in sports if they are half naked, otherwise they’re lesbians?
Strong women do not equate to lesbians. Strong women equates to strong women. It makes sense that men would be intimidated by the idea of a powerful woman because society has worked so hard to depict women as fragile and emotional. So they label these powerful women as lesbians as a means of ruffling their feathers, so to speak. It’s chauvinism, simple as that.
Also, the use of the term “dyke” or “lesbian” as an insult doesn’t make sense. It’s like calling someone “white” or telling them that they’re wearing a red shirt. Being homosexual isn’t something shameful therefore being called a homosexual slur, though hurtful, it isn’t something to be insulted by. Someone once called me gay. I agreed then asked him if he had a brother who was cute and less ignorant.
Eleanor Roosevelt has been credited with saying “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” These are words that we should abide by. Words only have power when we give it to them.

Now I know I have admitted in the past about my “aggressive driving,” but I’ll let you in on a secret, I have some serious road rage at times. Driving to me is a gift, you studied for this test for almost a year, took the test maybe failed a few times like I did, then had to actually buy a car to drive. So after going through all this, you think people would drive the way they were taught to. So why is it that people drive the way they want to?
The other day I was driving to school when this old guy cut me off in his tank of a car. I was livid, my tires scraped the ground making that awful noise and the smell of burnt rubber was in the air. I sped past him to flip him the bird. This winner comes up next to me, shows me a badge, and tells me he’s going to arrest me for vulgarity. Vulgarity? Is that even real? I started to laugh, it was early and I was already cranky, if he wanted a fight, I was ready. The guy looked to be about 80 years old, so I asked if he was retired because he seemed old enough to be. He screamed back that I wasn’t a lady. Apparently, he hasn’t watched television in over 50 years. I screamed back that he should learn how to drive again. He finally waved me off then proceeded to cut off the next car and speed away. I guess he gets into these arguments often.
Well, after that I decided to not be so “vulgar” because then crazy people will come after me and I already have enough craziness in my life. But it doesn’t stop those horrid drivers on the road. You’ll experience one or more everyday on the road, but I have learned to keep your cool. It’s not worth starting a fight with a complete stranger, the only people you should have fights with are people you know. I mean that’s what your horn is for, to let people know you’re pissed off and they’re doing something wrong. Sometimes a horn honk is even enough to get another person mad, so when you do honk don’t make it obnoxious and long. Just give it a nice old tap and let it do its wonders.
As for the people who cut you off then die while driving in front of you, don’t speed up past them and start screaming. No, no. Just do what my friend does, speed past them take a look at the character that did cut you off and proceed to make fun of them while you drive away. It’s not the nicest thing to do, no, but it will keep you sane for a few minutes.
So if you are a victim of road rage, don’t panic! You can survive. Why let these people that you’ll have to deal with for no more than a few minutes get to you? It’s not worth it, so don’t worry about crazy drivers, worry about yourself. You’re the one behind the wheel so all the decision-making is up to. Safe driving to all this week!

One does not have to travel far to see quality art; just go to the second floor of Hillwood Commons. The Hillwood Art Museum at LIU Post has amazing work by professional artists. I recently visited and was impressed by what the museum has to offer.
The museum is showcasing Mind Space: Minimalism in Contrasts from now until April 5th. The artists on display include He Xiangyu, Zhang Yu, Lei Hong, and Zhu Jinshi. All four are Chinese abstract artists who convey the concept of Maximalism to a global audience.
My favorite piece at this museum was He Xiangyu’s fan series. There are five white fans, all made of silk, which feature scenery from China. In one year, Xiangyu cooked thousands of tons of Coca-Cola and crystallized the resulting liquid into powder creating his ink. I think his series of fans symbolizes going through hardships and overcoming them.
The fan series is an example of reforming traditional wash paintings with Western expressionism and the patterns of Western folk art. According to Mind Space: Maximalism in Contrasts, by Gao Minglu, the curator for this exhibition, Xiangyu pursues the creation of wash paintings with oriental conceptual elements in the 1980s through the expression of personal symbols and intense emotions.
The first fan has a picture of a secluded house surrounded by trees on top of a mountain by a lake. Movement is definitely occurring in the picture. Movement can be seen in the ripples in the ocean created by the rocks and in the different placement and directions of tree branches. The branches of the trees are full grown and have lots of leaves. Nearly the entire fan was done in ink. I think this fan shows someone or something that is usually abundant and well off but is now facing trouble for the first time.
The second fan shows high mountains with growth branches on top and leaves. There are a few houses in the middle of the fan next to tree branches. There are fluffy clouds on top, high on the fan. I think this fan represents obstacles and progress in one’s life.
Enormous rocks take up most of the third fan. There are small branches, which are almost bare on the rocks. The leaves are starting to grow on top of the branches a little. There is a lake next to a rock on the right hand side. Two men have an old-fashioned wagon with three oxen, and they are trying to get across the lake. There is clearly movement in this piece. One man is curled in a ball, hugging his legs, and sitting in the back of the wagon. The other man is guiding the oxen through the lake, standing in the lake with them. The front ox is no longer in the water; he pushed hard. The other two oxen are still in the lake, trying to get out. There is a house in the corner of this piece and a dark, black sky. I think this fan represents the process of overcoming your difficulties and the struggle of trying to get through hard times.
The fourth fan has a mountain on the right hand side with long, full-leaved branches up high. The sky is bright, and there are similar mountains in the distance. I think this fan represents the accomplishment of finally overcoming a difficult struggle.
The fifth and final fan is a bright white sky. There is a house surrounded by long, full-growth branches. I think this represents growth, renewal and rebirth. A fair portion of the fan is blank. I think that this represents that the rest of the future is still unknown and unwritten.
So, next time you are in Hillwood and you have finished your meal or your club meeting, check out what The Hillwood Art Museum has to offer. The Museum is open from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 9:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, and from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. The Hillwood Art Museum’s phone number is 516-299-4073. Its website is www.liu.edu/museum.

Known as the smallest African capital, Victoria lies proudly in the shimmering western Indian Ocean. The Seychelles are comprised of 115 archipelagic islands that cluster around the main island of Mahé, home to Victoria, which is the republic’s business and cultural hub. Victoria is the only port of the archipelago and the only town of any size in Seychelles. Some one-third of the people of the Mahé Island live in Victoria. Here is your ultimate guide to the rare and exotic island.
Airlines: Seychelles International Airport was built near Victoria in 1971 and has a number of international flights with the national airline, Air Seychelles. It has flights to and from Bangkok, Johannesburg, London, Milan, Munich, Paris, Port Louis (Mauritius), Rome, and Singapore. Doha (Qatar Airways), Dubai (Emirates), Nairobi (Kenya Airways), Frankfurt and Munich (Condor), and Reunion (Air Austral) have flights to the Seychelles as well. Good luck finding a direct flight to the Seychelles from the U.S.!
Hotels/Accommodations: A wide range of affordable, new, and refurbished hotels is joining the ranks of existing five-star hotels and exclusive island retreats to offer memorable stays. Other major budgeted accommodations include guesthouses, self-catering apartments, and bungalows. While opting for self-catering apartments, you need to take care of a few things. They do not provide meals, but they have kitchen facilities. Famous hotels include the Four Seasons Seychelles, The Hilton Seychelles and Rocky Bay Villa.
Attractions/Tourism: Though a small city, there is an infinite amount of activity on this sizzling island. The center of the city is pinpointed by the clock tower, a copy of the Little Ben outside Victoria station in London, next to which stands the court house. Victoria’s botanical garden stretches over 15 acres and gathers some 200 exotic plant species, including the famous Coco de Mer and the Tortoise of Aldabra. The National Museum’s seashell collections are also worth a peek. You can stop by the King’s Garden, a 124-acre domain displaying exotic spices and birds. Visit the local art galleries and craft markets to soak up the city’s friendly charm. A more lively pleasure is to be found at the morning market, where the stalls are stacked with tropical fruits, spices, and freshly caught fish. If you are interested in an adventure, stay on more than one island. That’s right: Island hop! Island hop in close proximity to Mahé, or carve across the Indian Ocean and head for parts less known. Only two percent of the Seychelles population lives on the outer islands. Just getting from one island to another is part of the fun. Motor boats connect adjacent islands, whereas ferries run regularly between public islands.
Cuisine: The Seychelles offer a unique blend of modern and cultural delight. Seychelles food is very rich and is exotically prepared, having a mixture of French and Indian flavors. Grilled fish or octopus basted with a sauce of crushed ginger, chilies, and garlic are the national favorites. There are dishes that are prepared with coconut milk and inventive chatinis prepared from the local fruits like papaya and golden apple. As can be expected, the seafood dishes are featured predominantly in the local cuisine because of proximity to the Indian Ocean, which is known for its rich bounty of large and flavorful fish. The tuna and king fish are the favorites and are frequently fried or grilled in a garlic butter sauce. Octopus is a big delicacy in the Seychelles. Often, a spicy curry of coconut is served with the Octopus, diced up and put into the seafood cocktail. One common Seychelles food method involves the mixing of shellfish with pumpkin and cooking the mixture as soup. As Seychelles people come from numerous distinct backgrounds, arrays of various tastes are on hand. Chinese, Indian, French, and English food techniques are all incorporated in modern day Seychelles cookery.

Solo artists Steve Hogarth (of Marillion) and Richard Barbieri (of Porcupine Tree, ex-Japan) have teamed up to record a new experimental rock release out this week from Kscope Music.
In 1989, Hogarth joined and soon became the frontman of Marillion, an English rock band that released 20 U.K. Top 40 hits and 15 studio albums over 25 years. Since 1993, Barbieri has been playing the keyboard on all of the Porcupine Tree’s albums. He was a member of Japan, where he helped to create the band’s synthesizer sound, which influenced many artists, including The Human League, Duran Duran, Gary Numan, Talk Talk, Kate Bush, and Hogarth.
Through the years, Porcupine Tree and Marillion played shows together, allowing Hogarth and Barbieri to develop a working relationship, which lead to this collaboration. In 2011, their schedules allowed for a week here and there to do so. Barbieri sent Hogarth “a number of beautiful and unusual instrumentals, and I have found lyric ideas to create sometimes songs, sometimes narratives, against his musical landscapes.”
Their album includes songs such as “Naked”, “Your Beautiful Face”, and “Lifting The Lid”. My personal favorites are “Crack”, “Cat With Seven Souls”, and “Red Kite”. The melody of every track has a fantastic beat. It’s a bit different from the pop music we have become accustomed to, but it’s experimental. The music is very peaceful, relaxing, and soothing. I kept it running in the background while I was on the computer, and it made for a perfect experience. “Not The Weapon But The Hand” was released on February 28th and is available on CD and iTunes download.

Adam Carlson (John Krasinski), an Alaskan news reporter, gets his big break when he discovers that a family of majestic gray whales is trapped underwater by rapidly forming ice in the Arctic Circle. Soon, other journalists, government officials, and oil tycoons make Alaska their next stop. This includes Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore), an animal-loving volunteer and outspoken environmentalist, who just happens to be Adams ex-girlfriend. With the ice continuing to expand, Rachel and Adam rally Inuit natives, oil companies, and the Russian and American militaries together during the Cold War to free the whales.
“Big Miracle” is based on a true story as depicted from Tom Roses’ 1989 book, “Freeing the Whales” about Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska. Warner Bros. bought the screenplay in April 2009, and filming began in September 2010. It’s a very touching story; who wouldn’t be amazed to see people from different countries in war uniting to save endangered animals? Plus, it’s got Drew Barrymore and John Krasinski in it. However, the film, which had a budget between $30 and $40 million, only took in approximately $8.5 million on opening. Similar movies, such as 2011’s “Dolphin Tale,” about a dolphin that was rescued and who lost her tail and was fitted with a prosthetic, faired better. Both titles are based on true stories, so the audience already knows what is going to happen.
“Big Miracle” hit theaters nationwide on February 3rd, 2012.

The following is a reaction to the New York Times article, “TV in Putin’s Russia: Jesters, Strivers and a Longing for Normalcy,” by Alessandra Stanley, which was published on February 13th, 2012.
This article caused mixed emotions, feelings and thoughts inside of me. I don’t like Alessandra Stanley’s presentation of information because it is quite negative and sarcastic, and it may cause readers to form an incorrect perception of Russian television and of what is happening in the country.
I am Russian and know the TV programs that air in Russia. Now, I live here in the U.S, and I am able to watch American television as well. I have a brilliant opportunity to compare both television standards and can truly say that there is much in common. Both in Russia and in the U.S.A, there are numerous purely entertaining and superficial TV shows. It’s also possible to find and watch serious programs, which pay attention some social problems and discuss crucial issues.
The whole article follows one idea: The point against Mr. Putin, Russia’s Prime Minister, “his long, complicated reign,” and how harmful it is for Russia. Well, it’s true that the political situation concerning Mr. Putin, his strategy, and administration is controversial, but not to such an extent as depicted in the article. Ms. Stanley writes, “Television over the last 10 years has mirrored the country’s economic recovery. State-controlled news deliberately spread Mr. Putin’s message of stability and prosperity at any cost. Entertainment subliminally echoed it.” Since the last decade, the economical and social situation in Russia has been changing for the better, and people are really more stable with their standards of living and higher levels of income.
Ms. Stanley suggests that “there’s plenty of humor on Russian television, though not much political satire; Mr. Putin put a stop to that long ago.” Well, I arrived in the U.S.A not too long ago and have had enough time to read newspapers and watch TV programs. I don’t notice a lot of political satire on American television either. Why, then, is it a trouble for Russia? Thanks to my studying, I had an opportunity to read a brilliant speech by Bill Moyers entitled, “Journalism Under Fire,” and to watch the interesting documentary, “Outfoxed”. I have concluded that in the U.S.A, as well as  in Russia and in many other countries all over the world, exists the so-called “secret rule of government.” There are numerous examples of when TV channels, newspapers, and other kinds of mass media work in cooperation with government in order to present the audience with only a one-sided view of political news while putting on the appearance of being objective. Why, then, does Ms. Stanley find it appropriate to call Russian television “jesters, bathos and bad taste?” As far as I can see, American television isn’t so far off from Russian television. The principles on which they are based are practically the same. Television of both countries can be called whimsical, superficial, and trifling.
Ms. Stanley presumes to give irrelevant, sarcastic conclusions and inappropriate, biased, and even humiliating remarks that Russia can still not be considered a “normal” country. I wonder two things: First, what does it mean to be “a normal country,” and does Ms. Stanley understand that using such word combinations can’t be called “politically correct.” By permitting herself to do so, she loses her prestige as a serious, objective and reliable journalist!

The LIU Post women’s basketball team ended the 2011-12 regular season with a 78-60 victory over the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds Saturday afternoon.
Junior forward Nicolette Marciniak led the Pioneers in scoring with 24 points and added nine rebounds and two blocks. Sophomore guard Alexis Peters contributed 15 points along with seven assists, a block and two steals. The Pioneers shot 43.3 percent (29-67) from the field and 35.3 percent (6-17) from three-point range.
The Firebirds’ senior forward Stacey Griffith scored the game’s first points at 19:54 and gave UDC its only lead of the game. Pioneers’ junior center Samantha Kopp hit a jump shot on the Pioneers’ next possession to tie the game up. Peters then hit a layup at 18:16 to give the Pioneers the lead, and they would not look back. With 10:45 left in the first half, freshman guard Chelsea Williams hit a free throw shot to give the Pioneers an 11-point lead over UDC. The Pioneers ended up finishing the half leading 34-30.
The Firebirds’ junior guard Janelle Junior started the half off by nailing a three-point shot and cut the Pioneers’ lead to one point. UDC managed to keep the Pioneers to a single digit lead until the 12:10 mark of the second half. Then Pioneers’ senior guard Felicia Joyner made a layup that started a 12-0 Pioneers’ run, which saw them move to an 18-point lead. They eventually reached their largest lead of the game with 4:40 left when they extended it to a 24-point lead. The final score would end up being 78-60 in favor of the Pioneers.
Prior to the victory, the team honored seniors Felicia Joyner and Catherine Lutz.  The win was also head coach Deirdre Moore’s 70th career win as the Pioneers head coach.
In the three games prior, the Pioneers defeated Molloy and Queens College and fell to Saint Thomas of Aquinas.
The Pioneers finish the season with a 20-8 record and 11-5 record in ECC play. The win on Saturday clinched the team the fourth seed in the upcoming ECC Championships. The Pioneers will host the NYIT Bears at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, February 29th.

LIU Post’s baseball team has won their three of four games to begin the 2012 season. To open the new campaign, the Pioneers traveled down to Myrtle Beach, S.C., and swept a doubleheader on Friday, February 24th, against the West Virginia Wesleyan College Bobcats.
In the first game, the Pioneers won 3-0, as junior pitcher Bo Budkevics threw a complete game shutout. Budkevics struck out 10 batters while only allowing three hits and one walk. In the second game of the doubleheader, the Pioneers cruised to an easy 13-1 victory. The offensive outburst was led by junior outfielder Gabriel Santos who went 4-4 from the plate and drove in six runs. Also, junior first baseman Anthony Corona hit a three-run home run to lead to back-to-back wins.
The following day, the Pioneers suffered their first loss to Felician College by a score of 6-4, but on the same day, the Pioneers managed to get another win when they defeated Concordia College 4-3.
The Pioneers are trying to rebound off a difficult 2011 season in which the team’s record was 20 games under .500 at 14-34. “We need to improve our offensive production,” said interim head coach Bill Gaffney when looking back at last year. “We started four freshmen last year in most games, and, sometimes, it is a lot to ask of a freshman to step in and be productive right from the start.  Those players are more experienced this year, and we have some junior college transfers who will bring additional experience.”
Pitcher Joey Arena is a freshman that Coach Gaffney mentioned as someone who may have a big role on the team as either a spot starter or pitcher to work a few innings late in games. Two junior college transfers noted by Coach Gaffney that should see significant time playing up this season are shortstop Keith Herring and second baseman Angel Pimentel.
“I feel confident that our pitching and defense will keep us in most games, and that will allow our more experienced offense an opportunity to do their job,” said Coach Gaffney. “Our starting pitchers are worth noting; Bo Budkevics, James Stone, Kevin Chenicek, Paul Bischoff, Rafael Martinez and Mike Eckerly all have the potential for outstanding seasons.  On the offensive side, we will look to Anthony Corona, Keith Herring, Rich Maccarone and Matt Simone to get us moving in the right direction.”
In addition, Coach Gaffney has also noticed improvement with several players throughout the offseason, including outfielder Matt Simone, sophomore first baseman Phil LoPrete, and sophomore infielder Tom Tolan.
The Pioneers return to Brookville for their home opener on Saturday, March 4th, for a doubleheader against Stonehill College that starts at 12 p.m. The Pioneers are taking it one game at a time, but the hope and focus of Coach Gaffney and his team is to get to the East Coast Conference playoffs and to capture an automatic bid for the Northeast Regionals.

The LIU Post women’s swim team, which was just awarded the Team Scholar All American Award for having the highest GPA among all divisions on February 23rd, has continued its roll of success into the postseason.
First, the team headed to Rutgers in New Jersey to take second in the Metropolitan Championships. The team started the meet off strong, winning the very first event on the very first day. The Pioneers’ 200 free relay earned a NCAA ‘B’ cut when senior Cornelia Hanes, freshman Courtney Delehanty, sophomore Tamara Garriock, and junior Mairi Morrison teamed up to finish the event in 1:35.84. Next, Garriock earned her own personal ‘B’ cut with a 5:01.29 500 free, and Hanes earned a ‘B’ cut in the 50 free.
On the second day of the event, the team started off the finals portion with a win in the 200 medley relay from Garriock, Hanes, Morrison, and freshman Johanna Pettersson. As the day went on, Hanes earned another NCAA ‘B’ cut, this time in the 100 fly, while Garriock made another ‘B’ in the 200 free with a first place finish in the event. Finally, Pettersson finished the wins for the Pioneers on day two with a ‘B’ cut win in the 100 back.
The Pioneers continued their success into the third day when freshman Malin Hedberg started the finals off with a third place finish in the 1650 free with a time of 18:06.05. Pettersson then garnered another ‘B’ cut in the 200 back with a second place finish. Before the day ended and LIU Post walked away with second place, Garriock managed another ‘B’ cut, this time in the 200 breast, and the 400 free relay team, consisting of Garriock, Pettersson, Delehanty, and Hanes wrapped up the meet with the Pioneers’ final NCAA ‘B’ cut of the weekend.
On Friday, February 4th, the LIU Post swim team headed to Annapolis, Maryland to compete in the ECAC Championships. Again, the Pioneers looked strong early on, taking first in the 200 free relay early in the finals portion of the day. Next, Hanes finished first in the ‘A’ heat of the 50 free. By the end of the first day of competition, the team was in sixth place with a score of 97.5.
The Pioneers opened up the second day of finals with a silver finish in the 200 medley relay when Garriock, Pettersson, Hanes, and Morrison joined together to swim a 1:44.86. Later, in the 100 fly, Hanes took third with a 56.63 finish.
On the third and final day of competition, the Pioneers, who suffered largely from lack of participants in finals events, fell to ninth place with 150.5 points on the board. In first place was the US Naval Academy, with 583 points, followed by Harvard and Marist, who tied for second place with 529 points each. Next on the schedule for the Pioneers is a trip west to compete in the NCAA Championships in Mansfield, Texas from March 14th-17th.

The LIU Post men’s basketball team defeated the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds by a score of 85-75 on Saturday, February 25th, to clinch the ECC regular season conference title as well as the top overall seed in the ECC Tournament.
The battle between the top two teams in the ECC was also a much anticipated game because it was Senior Day for the Pioneers. The senior guards of the Pioneers, Stefan Bonneau, Terry Coleman, and Vince Rosario, were all recognized before the game, as this was their final regular season game of their college careers.
At the end of the first half of play, the Pioneers led 41-34 due to strong defensive play against two of the top three scorers in the ECC. The Firebirds’ senior guards, Nigel Munson and Brandon Herbert, each finished the season averaging 19.9 points per game, and both had a difficult time getting into a rhythm through the first 20 minutes of action.
The second half was controlled by the Pioneers. The closest the Firebirds came was with over 16 minutes remaining, when the lead was 47-43 in favor of the Pioneers. The Pioneers stretched their lead to as much as 15 points during the second half, as good defense and the usual high-octane offense led to their sixth consecutive win.
Bonneau led the Pioneers in scoring with 26 points on 8-21 shooting from the floor and also created opportunities for teammates, as he dished out five assists. Bonneau finishes the regular season as the ECC’s leading scorer, averaging 22.1 points per game.
Sophomore forward Vaughn Allen recorded his 11th double-double of the season by scoring 18 points and grabbing a season-high 16 rebounds. Allen finished the season as the ECC’s leading rebounder, averaging 9.4 boards per contest.
As a team, the Pioneers had an advantage over the Firebirds in getting to the free-throw line. The Pioneers were 19-24 from the line, while the Firebirds were only 4-6 from the charity stripe. The Pioneers were also smarter with the basketball, making only eight turnovers, compared to the Firebirds 13 turnovers.
A glaring statistic for the Firebirds was that the team had zero bench points. The Pioneers were given a spark off the bench, as freshman forward Charles McCann had five points and five rebounds (all offensive). In the second half, McCann got the Pratt Center buzzing as he threw down a thunderous dunk that made the crowd erupt into a frenzy. The Firebirds were given no such energy off the bench.
The Pioneers finish the season with a 21-5 overall record and a 15-1 record within their conference. The Pioneers will face the winner of the NYIT/Dowling matchup in the semifinals of the ECC Championships. That game will be on Saturday, March 3rd, at 5 p.m. at Queens College.
