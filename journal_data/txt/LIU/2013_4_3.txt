The United States Supreme Court has recently heard two historic cases regarding same-sex marriage. On March 26 and 27, the Supreme Court looked at whether equal rights should be extended to same-sex couples nationally or whether it should be the decision of each individual state.
The debate of same-sex marriage has long focused on political, religious and cultural issues in the United States.
“As a member of the LGBTQ community, I believe the cases in the Supreme Court are a progressive step towards equality,” said Jacqueline Wiswall, president of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBTQ) club, Rainbow Alliance, on campus.
“I believe Prop 8 and DOMA are not constitutional because they do not give us the freedom to live how we so choose,” Wiswall added.
LIU Post’s Rainbow Alliance discusses political issues involving the LGBTQ community as well as how the media portrays lesbians, gays, bisexu- als and transgender. They also remain alert on any possible LGBTQ discrimination. One of the issues the club has addressed is whether Post is moving towards gender neutral bathroom for transgender students.
“Our club is also a safe, non-judgmental zone for any student who is ‘in the closet’ (not openly gay yet) and welcomes any allies of our community,” said Wiswall.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s many states amended their constitutions to forbid gay marriage. However, before that, in 1996, the federal government passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which prevents the federal government from recognizing any marriages between gay or lesbian couples for the pur- pose of federal laws or programs, even if those couples are considered legally married by their home state. In February, republicans signed a legal brief stating that gay people have a constitutional right to marry. The friend-of-the-court, amicus, brief was submitted to the Supreme Court in order to be used in the current case on same-sex marriage.
With the differing opinions on the topic of same-sex marriage, many people in the United States see this as the defining civil rights issue of the generation.
“It’s remarkable how important age is to this issue. One of the strongest predictors of support for same sex marriage is being younger,” said Brian Sweeny, assistant professor of Sociology at LIU Post. “Young people simply attach different cultural meanings to homosexuality. Age is one reason I believe strongly that same sex marriage is inevitable. The younger generations will, over time, become the older generations.”
Michelle Morey, a sophomore Journalism major, states that she supports same-sex marriage. “I think it should be nationally legalized and not in the hands of the states,” she added.
In November 2008, California passed the Proposition 8 ballot that banned same-sex marriage in the state. Only marriage between man and woman would be recognized. The validity of California’s Proposition 8 was the first case heard by the Supreme Court.
Currently, same-sex couples can become legally married in nine states: Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Washington and Vermont.
“This problem needs to be fixed on a federal level,” said Potoula Anagnostakos, a sophomore Journalism major. “Marriage equality needs to be spread across the country.”
In addition to Proposition 8, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionally of DOMA, the federal law.
“I am for equality as long as it doesn’t affect the church,” said Rafe Tangorra, a sophomore Broadcasting major. “I personally don’t support same sex couples but I do believe everyone deserves equal rights.”
Leslie Zurita, a senior Criminal Justice major, stated, “As a Catholic, my religion calls for me to be against it. I have friends who are gay, but I personally don’t feel comfortable when I find out intimate details. I accept people for who they are rather than what they do.”
According to Sweeny, many people are increasingly looking at anti-gay marriage groups critically, as hateful, misguided, or not “open-minded,” rightfully or not. “I think the anti-gay marriage groups are currently caught off guard by the swell of support for gay marriage and no longer so sure how to approach the issue,”
Sweeny added. “Religion calls for compassion, acceptance, and charity,” said Wiswall. “If this is true, why are you so hostile to me just be- cause I would rather marry a girl than a boy?”
Families and the notions of marriage are always changing. Both of these are social institutions that are constantly in flux, being worked out privately and publicly.
“I believe it’s a mistake to say that marriage has ‘always’ been between a man and a woman,” said Sweeny. “Such a statement, while accurately reflecting the dominance of heterosexuality in our culture, ignores the fact that marriage, gender roles, and sexuality have changed radically throughout history.”
Recently, the American Sociological Association filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court regarding same-sex couples raising children. According to the brief, children fare just as well when they are raised by same-sex parents when compared to children raised by opposite-sex parents.
“Thinking two men can’t raise a child is asinine. To say gay marriage would tear the foundation of traditional mar- riage is plain false,” said James Grady, a sophomore Criminal Justice major. “If your foundation of marriage is high divorce rates, domestic abuse, then one should further examine the topic at hand.”
According to Wiswall, the biggest challenge, aside from dealing with people’s crude comments, is watching a population divide against each other over marriage equality. “Marriage should be a celebration whether with a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, a man and a man, or anything in between,” she added.
“Intimate relationships, anthropologists and sociologists will tell you, are often subject to the most intense norms and rules for regulation,” said Sweeny.
The Supreme Court’s decision on the same-sex marriage cases is expected in June. Share your thoughts with the Pioneer: cwpstpnr@gmail.com.

Used shoes don’t necessarily have to live in the back of your closet once you are done with them. The ReUse A Shoe project was created by LIU Post’s Recycling Program as a new initiative to get Post students to recycle non-typical items.
The Recycling Program is looking for new ways to improve recycling on campus, including finding ways to recycle more than just typical items of paper, card- board, and plastics. It was started in the beginning of the semester and allows LIU Post members to donate used shoes that can be recycled and reused.
TerraCycle turns the shoes into a wide variety of products, including fences, benches, and garden pavers. The materials in the shoes are grinded down and incorporated into those types of products according to TerraCycle. The materials are also used in playgrounds, running tracks, tennis courts, and the padding that goes underneath basketball courts.
After purchasing a package of Capri Suns three years ago, William Achnitz, a Graduate Assistant for Sustainability and co-coordinator of the LIU Post Recycling Program, discovered the company TerraCycle. “On the box was a description of how to recycle the Capri Sun pouches. I immediately signed up,” said Achnitz.
Since then, LIU Post has participated in other recycling programs that TerraCycle hosted. The program has collected non-traditional items such as chip bags, cookie wrappers, and candy wrappers. When Achnitz saw that TerraCycle began recycling shoes, he jumped on the opportunity. According to him, “Most recycle programs only have a certain number of openings.” Therefore space is limited for universities to be a part of the programs.
Achnitz said that he tries to educate the campus community about all of the recycling and sustainability initia- tives that are going on. “I’ve helped get the ReUse A Shoe program off the ground by getting collection bins placed in Hillwood Commons and the Pratt Recreation Center and I take care of shipping out the shoes once we’ve collected enough,” said Achnitz. He goes to their website, prints out a free UPS shipping label, and then ships them out to the facility where they will get recycled.
Sophomore Social Work major, Emma Weinstein, is a huge fan of this new recycling idea. “I have so many shoes, when they get worn out or when I get sick of them I would throw them out,” said Weinstein. “I think it’s great that I can help out by donating my old shoes,” she added. Weinstein said she had no idea that shoes could be recycled and used for so many other things.
Sophomore Journalism major, Michelle Morey, thinks that it’s great that the school is finding new ways to be green. “I am all for it. Why wouldn’t you want to help out for this cause, it’s so simple to give back,” said Morey.
Rechelle Abalos, the Environmental Educator on campus, helped spread the word by creating and hanging up the ReUse A Shoe flyers around campus.
An Environmental Educator is a student employee who works for the Recycling Program who is tasked with raising awareness about recycling and sustainability on campus. They create programs, make flyers, and put together other projects to promote the recycling program.
In the United States, an estimated 300 million pairs of shoes are thrown away each year according to Achnitz. “The goal is to always try to reduce those statistics as much as possible and now people at LIU Post have a convenient way to do so,” said Achnitz. “However, it would be cool to collect at least 300 pairs of shoes to kind of coincide with that statistic,” he added. Since the program started in January, 25 pairs of shoes have been collected.
“As we raise more awareness about this program, I am sure the amount we collect will continue to grow,” said Achnitz.
ReUse A Shoe, according to Achnitz, has gained attention around campus. “It is getting featured in the Pioneer after all. Plus, our Environmental Assis- tants have been talking it up to other people and through that word of mouth we have gener- ated a decent amount of shoes for just starting this brand new initiative.”
Athletic sneakers, cleats, flats, high heels, dress shoes, boots & fashion or casual sneakers are accepted. The program does not accept ski boots, roller skates, roller blades, ice skates, completely broken or ruined footwear, single shoes, rubber flip flops or slippers.
This is an on-going program so shoes can be dropped on in Hillwood Commons and Pratt Recreation Center until the end of the semester as well as over the summer sessions.

It was a “wow” feeling hard to describe when I found myself in the middle of the two-story open office landscape where some of the world’s most famous reporters have produced several Pulitzer Prize winning articles. Like in a movie, the journalists that were in on Friday, March 22 frantically typed on their keyboards while talking on the phone. One guy even wore a white shirt unbuttoned at the top while leaning back on his chair in what looked like yesterday’s hairdo, as if he was starring as Woodward or Bernstein during the Watergate scandal. It looked exactly like I had imagined it, perhaps even better.
The outside-class-hours field trip to the 52-floor high, New York Times Building on Manhattan’s 8th Avenue had finally arrived. Together with five other members from LIU Post’s recently formed chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, I entered the 1,046-foot environment- an energy efficient building that hosts some of the world’s most skilled journalists that stand behind articles read by millions of people. I have passed this building many times before on my way home, and since the first time I laid eyes on it, I have dreamt of one day working there. After our inspiring visit, the dream was reinforced. I went home on cloud nine, and had no problems finishing an article that I had struggled with for weeks. I was motivated.
A few days after, I reflected upon this and wondered why my first field trip at Post took place through a professional club and not the school, right before my fourth semester. Why do we rarely take field trips with the university when these visits can motivate students and guide them towards the future? Being an international student from Sweden, I also find it crazy that New York City, and many Long Island businesses, lay so close by, and that the school seems to take little advantage of it.
Dr. Barbara Fowles, Chairperson of the Media Arts Department, agreed that school trips certainly are motivating and beneficial for students, but that our school has tried. On the contrary, she stated, it is the students that haven’t made the effort. “There are many busi- nesses that are happy to have people come. But when faculty organize field trips and no students actually show up, then we become reluctant to put the trips together,” Fowles said.
Fowles also mentioned transportation issues. Chartering a bus is costly, and why do so if only a few students actually arrive? In addition, it will be embarrassing for the school if signed up students do not come on field trips where the business only guaranteed the visit if a certain substantial number of students could make it. “Maybe it is better to let professional clubs organize these trips,” said Fowles.
Sandra Mardenfeld, Director of the Journalism Program, agreed. “It is very tricky to fit school trips into the schedules that Post offer. If I took my 2 p.m. class somewhere, we would never make it back on time for classes at 3.30 p.m.,” Mardenfeld continued. “That requires scheduling the trip to a Friday, which is difficult.”
In order to go on more field trips, it seems like it is up to the students to engage themselves more; to start clubs or not sign up for trips and then skip going. I agree with this, and I certainly have classmates that do not even care that they are in college. I actu- ally think that faculty could do a better job too. Not a single time at Post have I been asked: “So would your students be interested in a field trip with this class?” The closest they have gotten is: “It would be fun to take you to Newsday here on Long Island someday… Well, let’s get back to class now.”
Sophomore Business Administration major, Kristoffer Eidissen, recognizes this from his program. “We have never even talked about field trips and that is strange when New York City and the surrounding area comprise such a business center in the world,” said Eidissen. Organizing activities outside the classroom is of importance since there are many students at Post that are undecided, others are unsure where they are going within their chosen field, and some people have lost motivation and need a reminder of why they are doing this. A field trip to “the real world” can be an answer, and a kick in the butt. In addition, it is interesting and educating, and a possible way to make connections. Start talking to an employee or a tour guide, and maybe you are offered possibilities of an internship.
So, my suggestion is that Post’s faculty looks into what they can do. They can ask for our interest in field trips in the beginning of the semester, reach out to businesses on Long Island to reduce travel-hours, and if not a giant-size class, organize the trip by car-pooling instead of renting a bus. If afraid of low participation, make the field trip mandatory.
When students in the classroom look unmotivated and tend to perform worse towards the end of the semester than they did in the beginning, a field trip could be a fun, educating and inspiring way to push the student in the right direction. It is at least worth a try.

“The French Connection,” an exhibit at the Hillwood Art Museum, was aptly named. It was a mixture of original oil paintings, sketches, and bronzes of 19th century French and American artists. The exhibit was on loan from local collectors, Baker and Pisano, from January 22 through March 16.
The collection included a good number of original still life figure portraits and land- scape oil paintings. As you began your self- guided tour around the expansive, wide-open gallery space, its whitewashed walls displayed paintings that at once drew you closer and made you step back.
French artist Antoine Vollon’s figure and landscape paintings were interspersed throughout the collection. It was his land- scape painting, entitled “Vue de port de Hon- fleur” that drew me in. It depicted a harbor full of sailboats; they looked almost as if they were sketched in pen and ink, rather than painted in oil, so precise were the strokes. It was surprisingly beautiful, considering it ap- peared to be colorless, done entirely in mud- dy browns and blacks. The water and the sky were blended in these muted colors, as well. Yet, this is the painting that I kept circling back to after viewing the entire exhibit.
There was something serene and so life- like about the scene that brought you into it, as if you were aboard one of the sailboats.
Although Vollon considered himself a figure painter, which he was, he became most renowned for his landscape art. He was of what the French call the “en plein aire” school of art. Like his mentor and longtime friend, fellow French painter, Daubigny, he believed in painting landscapes out in the open air.
Daubigny’s oil painting was hung along- side Vollon’s harbor scene. Considering their connection, it is not surprising that the two artists shared the same methods. In fact, I mistook his painting to be a Vollon. Daubigny’s work is done in muted, etched-like, precise brushstrokes of beiges and browns. His work is called “Le Port de Honfleur,” similar to Vollon’s in style, method and title.
I learned from the museum’s Director, Barbara Applegate, that Vollon had no formal academic training. He belonged to what is known as the French Academic Salon, whose artists competed with the academic paint- ers of 19th century France. Yet, he received France’s highest honor when he was inducted into Le Institut de France.
Because I was drawn to Vollon’s landscape art on display, I was quite surprised to learn that the oil painting of a rather menacing man in profile, entitled “Tete d’homme” was the work of the same artist. But, Vollon always described himself as a portrait artist, aspiring to be a landscape artist. The epithet given to him reads “painter’s painter.”
American artist, William Merritt Chase, a renowned 19th century artist in his own right, was a great admirer of Vollon’s style and work. Upon Vollon’s death, Chase acquired some of his oil paintings. One of them is the portrait I had come upon earlier, Vol- lon’s “Tete d’homme.” Interestingly, Chase’s work was displayed alongside this piece. A true “French connection.”
Upon exiting the museum, I was com- pelled to turn one more time to look at the dark blue-stenciled wall centered in the middle of the gallery. On it hung Vollon’s and Chase’s oil portraits. Both figure paint- ings were of a man’s head and upper torso. Vollon’s was a side profile, done in dark, mut- ed, almost monochromatic shades of browns. Even though the eyes were hooded and unde- fined, the man in the portrait left the viewer with an almost mysterious feeling, as if he sensed the viewer looking at him. Alongside Vollon’s mysterious “Tete d’homme” was his American admirer, Chase’s “Portrait of a Young Man.” In the painting, he is facing the viewer; his eyes are prominent in his face. His torso was also done in layered, muted tones. Yet, the man in Chase’s painting is not as menacing as Vollon’s. His eyes don’t seem to look out at the viewer; instead one has the impression he is observing something in the distance.
“We joke around about the ‘relation- ship’ between Vollon’s ‘Head of a Man’ (‘Tete d’homme’) and Chase’s ‘Portrait of a Young Man’ that is right beside it. We wonder what conversations happen between them after we leave for the night,” Applegate said.
Applegate said that the exhibit has generated a lot of interest. While she said many LIU students have visited, there have also been many visitors from the local and wider metropolitan areas, as well. Applegate said, “Everyone gets excited when works from private collections are on view in museums; otherwise, when would most people be able to see them?”
If you missed “The French Connection” exhibit, the museum has a catalog depicting much of the artwork exhibited. It is available at the museum to LIU students at a discount- ed rate of $5.00.
Upcoming exhibits include “The Masters of Fine Arts Exhibit,” which will run from April 8 through May 10. There is a public reception on April 10, from 5 to 8pm. After Memorial Day, the works of Claudia Waters, “The Figure in Motion,” will be on display.
The Hillwood Art Museum has many exhibits throughout the year, free to LIU Post students, as well as to the general public. The museum is open Monday through Saturday. For a full schedule of future exhibits, events and hours, check their website, www.liu.edu/ museum.

At 18 years of age one is legally considered to be an adult. At this age, a person can vote, adopt children, join the military or become a commercial pilot. So why shouldn’t an 18 year old, living in America, be allowed to drink?
The fact that an 18 year old is able to have a say in the potential leader of the United States begs the question: Why can they not have a drink?
When asked for an opinion on lowering the drinking age, freshman Public Relations major, Marisa Kofmehlsaid, said, “I understand why the drinking age was raised because the brain is fully matured at 21. However, the fact that an 18 year old is able to join the military and risk their life, but they cannot buy themselves a drink really bothers me.”
Junior Political Science major, Dan Potenzieri also shared his opinion. “ I think that the drinking age should be brought back down to 18. If you are mature enough to make the decision to join the military and sacrifice your life for this country, then you should also be mature enough to have a beer or two,” he said.
Daniel Cox is the Director and Station Manager of WCWP, LIU Post’s campus radio station. He recalled when he attended Post and the drinking age was 18. Cox looked back on when he met with his professors at the bar on campus (yes there was a bar on campus at one point in time) and talked about class and assignments over a few drinks.
Cox said, “It wasn’t considered a strange encounter at the time because everyone was of age and it’s not like anyone was getting drunk. It was just a casual meet- ing with a professor to discuss class that day.”
Personally, I have a major issue with the drinking age being 21. Why is an 18-year-old legally considered an adult and given so much responsibility yet at the same time, not trusted enough to drink a beer? I think that the age should be lowered because of the maturity level factor; there is not always a difference between 21 and 18, especially among college students.
Also, there are public places where 18 year olds and others who are older are able to mingle where alcoholic drinks are pres- ent and available. For example, around college schools, there are clubs known as “college bars” where the ages are 21 to drink and 18 to party. If an 18 year old wants to drink, they can certainly get their hands on one.

The LIU Post men’s soccer team won the first game of their spring exhibition at home on Thursday, March 28, against Saint Peter’s University.
When asked prior to the game about how he expected the team to perform in its first action since last year, Pioneers’ junior captain Eirik Bjorno said, “They’re beatable. Every team is beatable.”
Captain knows best because the Pioneers came away victorious beating the Peacocks 2-0.
During the spring season the men, who compete in Division II, play against Division I teams, giving them an excellent chance to improve for the upcoming campaign.
The Pioneers had a successful fall season, which ended with them winning the ECC Championship and being ranked number one in all of Division II in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America poll. In a preseason game last August, the Pioneers also defeated the Peacocks by a final score of 6-2.
This was the team’s first game following their fall 2012 season and although the Pioneers are missing a couple of players who have graduated, it gives the younger players a chance to step up, Bjorno said.
It might be the offseason for the men, but this team plays every game like it’s the championship. Bjorno’s aggressiveness set the tone for this game, which started with tough defense for both teams.
As both teams were fighting to get into a rhythm, Pioneers’ junior forward, Cemil Turan, drove 70 yards with the ball, shot for the lower right corner, but failed to score when his shot was rebounded by the goalie. The rebound was followed through by freshman midfielder Per Forgaard, giving Post a 1-0 lead midway through the first half.
It was a back-and-forth game until the Pioneers’ freshman forward Elias Johansson scored on a cross-over during the end of the first half, giving Post a 2-0 lead. Soon after, junior goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen made three saves, two of which were consecutive, keeping the Pioneers ahead.
The second half was uneventful until Bjorno’s fierce drive and emotion came out during a scuffle that broke out after the opposing team’s sophomore center-back, Andrew Kelly, tackled him late. The air was tense, the crowd was on the edge of their seats and the referee showed both Bjorno and Kelly a red card.
According to Bjorno, the spring season is about getting better and staying fit, and there is no room for the team to accept tackles like that. “Maybe it was stupid to react that way, but we cannot accept tackles like that in a friendly game,” he said.
Overall, the Pioneers were relentless throughout and beat the Peacocks for the second time this year during an offseason game, just as their captain predicted.
“It was a solid performance but with plenty of areas that could be improved,” said Bjorno. For the rest of the season he hopes to see Johansson keep on improving and expects big things from Forgaard.
“I’m used to the pressure and I try to respond to it well,” said Forgaard, “This spring I want to work extremely hard and be the best that I can be in the fall.”
The next game for the Pioneers is against Fordham University this Saturday with a 10 a.m. kickoff at home. According to Bjorno, Fordham is one of the best teams in Division I… so it looks like the Pioneers will find out just how good they really are.

Have you ever looked in the background of a photograph and seen a stranger who was caught in an awkward pose with an embarrass- ing face? You may be laughing now, but think about how many pictures of this nature exist in the world, perhaps featuring you as that strange person. Do you find it creepy? Some LIU Post students do.
“I never really thought about it [being in the background of stranger’s pictures]. It’s pretty creepy to think about,” said Stephanie Morales, freshman Art Therapy major.
Julian Wilson, a freshman Journalism major, agrees. “I don’t like to think about it…if I see myself in the background of a picture with a weird face—that’s just not good,” he said.
Millions of people are taking pictures at any given moment of the day. Are you sitting at a sports game behind a group of friends that are taking a group photo? There’s a chance you may be caught in the background of their shot, shoving a handful of crackerjacks in your mouth.
Jennifer Geissman, a sophomore Vocal Performance major, feels that depending on how recognizable the person in the background is the picture could be a violation of that per- son’s privacy.
With the high popularity of social media in today’s society many of these pictures—that may have you in the background—end up all over the Internet. These pictures will be on the World Wide Web, which is accessible to everyone from your grandmother to your future boss.
What if you went to a bar last weekend and took a shot for a friend’s birthday? What if that image gets captured clearly in the back- ground of another group’s photo? If you don’t personally know the people who took the photo, it could easily be posted publicly on the Internet without you even knowing that the picture exists.
“I obviously want to know what pictures I’m in, but I’m not scandalous so I’m not worried about ruining my professional life,” said Geissman. She added that there is a difference between taking pictures with people and walk- ing behind someone in Disneyland and being really recognizable caught with a less-than- flattering facial expression or pose.
“I’m a musician so I see myself in pictures a lot and I wish I was tagged in some of them… I guess it just depends on the picture,” Said Jared Bonanno, a freshman with an undeclared major.
Not all students are fond of the idea that their image may be unknowingly on the Internet. However, if you respect your friends’ wishes of whether or not they want a recognizable picture on the Internet and if you are aware of the feelings of your bystanders, less people may be bothered by this thought.

The Student Government Association (SGA) has been working hard this year to make improvements towards a better LIU Post experience. SGA has been continuing its responsibilities of lobbying for clubs and programs, communicating students’ needs to staff and administrators, and engaging in forums and focus groups which ensure the student voice is represented. Outside of these typical duties our Executive Board and Senators have been working diligently all year on new projects and programs which affect LIU Post for the next year and beyond.
The renovations to the Fishbowl are finally nearing completion and SGA has been active in coming up with new projects to present to the university. SGA has been asked to spearhead a focus group which will have a dra- matic impact on a new ID card system which will result in changed meal plan options, swipe times, dining dollars amounts, and accessibil- ity. We have also been working on improving the facilities services and upkeep on campus, fun programming during Diversity Week, and more locations for studying. But these are only a few of many projects we have been working hard to ensure don’t get overlooked or under- represented.
We have a great, creative team of student leaders involved in SGA but we need every student to take pride in this university and help us identify and make differences any way we can. There are many ways to help us accomplish our goals of continuing to make this university better each and every year, below are a few examples:
1. Come to SGA meetings or Town Hall meetings and let us know what we can do to help improve this campus. Have a problem with the dining services? The food committee is responsible for working with Aramark to ensure your needs are communicated and being corrected.
2. Become an SGA Senator! Being an SGA Senator is a student leadership position that carries a lot of responsibility but also gives students with ideas on how to improve Post a platform to make sure their voice is heard. As an SGA Senator you would join a group of stu- dent leaders whose main mission is to improve the LIU Post experience and ensure everyone is being represented.

Students may have noticed the ongoing repairs taking place in the parking lot behind the Suite Complexes near Post Hall. A leak located 16-feet underground, according to William Kirker, Director of Facilities Services, is the source of the repairs.
“The work behind the suites was not necessarily a parking lot project, but it was work and repairs that needed to be made to our underground heating system,” Kirker said.
Kirker explained that the project is being worked on by fifteen people in different shifts, who are on a mission to mend the leak underneath the ground surface of the parking lot.
“The reason the fencing and barricades are still in place is because the dirt in the hole needs to settle. If we paved on top of it too soon, the dirt under the pavement will settle causing depressions that will result in rip up the new pavement and redo it,” Kirker added.
There have been two phases of this construction project since last August. The first phase, which was to dig the hole and begin the repairs, was completed in October. The second and current phase is to fill the hole and wait for everything to settle.
The construction is currently affecting four parking spaces in the second aisle of the parking lot behind the suites.
Some students are unaware of why this project is taking place. “I don’t know exactly what’s going on in the parking lot, but I do know there is construction in that general area,” said Sarah Montgomery, a junior Education major. When asked if the project inconvenienced her in any way, Montgomery replied, “I feel like it doesn’t affect too many people. It’s only four parking spaces.”
Sneha Kadakia, also a commuter, shared that she does not usually park near the suites. She added, “I didn’t know what the project is about.”
However, the repairs, which have been ongoing for nearly a year, will wrap-up soon. “We will be getting ready to pave in another few weeks to finish off the area,” Kirker said. Once the underground heat- ing system is fully restored, the parking spots will be restored.

The softball team just finished a five-day road trip that concluded on Saturday, March 30. The Pioneers (15-6) ended their stay away from home on a successful note, as they played four double-headers and won six of their eight games. The Pioneers swept South- ern Connecticut State Univer- sity (14-8), split games against Stonehill College (12-14), then once again swept the two games against Merrimack College (5-9), and finally completed the trip with a split against Southern New
Hampshire University (7-5). In the first game against SNHU, the Pioneers shut out the Penmen 4-0, led behind the strong effort and complete game shutout of junior pitcher Liz Weber. She tossed 7.0 innings allowing only four hits and one walk, while striking out nine batters.
The Pioneers squeaked across an early unearned run in the third inning off an error from the Pen- men. Weber kept the Penmen’s bats quiet the entire game, and finally in the seventh inning, the Pioneers backed up their pitcher with some run support. Sopho- more catcher Aly Dzierzynski had a two-run double and one batter
later, freshman second baseman Maria Palmeri followed with an RBI single to make the game 4-0.
During the course of this game, the Pioneers were aided by the poor defense of the Penmen. SNHU finished the contest with four errors, allowing the Pioneers extra at-bats and chances to bring runs across the plate.
The Pioneers were unable to escape the double-header with a sweep. It seemed as if the Pioneers may have found some early offense in this game when Weber drilled a two-run homerun in the third inning. However, that would not be the case as those were the only runs the Pioneers scored for
the rest of the game. The Penmen took advantage of the silent LIU Post bats. The Penmen answered with a combined five runs in the fourth and fifth innings.
Despite the loss, Weber is batting .459 for the season, and has reached base in each of her last eight games. In addition, sophomore outfielder Catherine Havens, who is hitting .309 for the campaign, has a hit in seven of her last eight games.
The Pioneers return home today with a double-header against the University of New Haven (13-5). They aim to continue their winning ways this evening as the games are set for 3 p.m. and 5 p.m

Does March Madness bore you? Do you snore through NHL games? For a competition that will really knock you off your feet, take a trip back in time with a cherished British sport that’s been going strong for 400 years: shin-kicking.
The sport is just as brutal as the name suggests. The aim is simple: kick your opponent as hard as you can in the shins until they fall over. Every time your opponent fall over you earn a point. Whoever has the most points after three rounds wins; simple and ruthless.
The procedures for a regular World Shin-kicking Championship game are as follows: Each combatant faces each other and holds onto each other’s col- lars, and he or she typically tries to strike the opponent’s shin with the inside of the foot as well as their toes. A referee decides the game, and it’s played in three rounds. A round is won when one of the players falls to the floor. No wrestling related moves are al- lowed and the fall must only be caused from a hit to the shin. A match can last for as long as 45 minutes before the kickers cannot stand the pain anymore.
Once again, we have to head back to the United Kingdom to find a strange sport. Shin-kicking can be dated all the way back to the early 17th century. When it first started, it was one of the most popular events at the Cotswold Olim- pick Games. The games were a celebration of sports and games and had its first competition all the way back in 1612. It featured everything from horse-racing to sledgehammer throwing. Shin-kicking used little time to become one of the most attended competitions in the games, and earned a solid reputation in Britain back in the days.
Even though the objective is simple, Shin-kicking requires a series of rules and regulations to make sure its competitors stay in line with the development of the sport, as it has worked its way trough a series of scandals during the last 100 years. We are not talking about the use of illegal substances or blood doping, but the use of safety shoes with steel-toe. Yes, you read right. For a while, more and more kickers used shoes developed for industry use to cause even more pain for their opponent. This development was not healthy for the sport, or for the safety of the competitors. Now, only shoes with a soft toe are allowed. They also added a new safety precaution for the players, as competitors are allowed to fill up their pants with as much straw as possible for padding. This gives the kickers a false sense of security as it’s obvious that straw is not as effective as plastic for use on the shins.
There are no official Shin-kicking competitions in America today, but English immigrants practiced the sport some decades back. If you want to try the sport nothing is holding you back. Just make sure you are prepared for the pain mentally, and don’t start out with kick- ing your kids…try to find someone else. It will be hard to explain to the doctor that you were practicing Shin-kicking. To prepare for the World Championships in Cotswold, England in June, many of the leading kickers use unortho- dox ways of getting used to the pain. It is said they use a hammer and hit themselves numerous times to numb up the muscles and shin. Neither this newspaper nor myself will take any responsibility if you decide to follow up on the tips from the world’s leading Shin-kickers. Also make sure your medical insurance covers any potential injuries.

This week’s column is inspired by an episode of MTV’s Guy Code that I happened to catch. One of the segments was about winning over your new girlfriends friends. I found myself intrigued; it was something I had never really considered before.
When a guy meets his new ladies girlfriends for the first time, he must find a delicate balance. He has to win over these ladies or it could be detrimental to his relationship. However, he can’t come off as being too flirty or overly friendly. It takes a smooth operator to navigate these rough and judgmental waters.
These women he is meeting have the potential to screw up his entire relationship. If they don’t like you, they will talk shit about you to your girlfriend. It will become their mission to make her know what a mega a-hole they think you are. You have to be funny but not annoying or insulting to any of them. If you’re going out for drinks, don’t be that guy that gets overly drunk and sloppy. No one likes to babysit their drunken boyfriend and it will embarrass your lady. It will also payoff in the long run to have these women on your side. That way, if you get into a little argument with your woman, they may take your side. After your girlfriend is done whining about how much you suck, the friends could say something like, “Yea but he is so sweet and loves you so much,” or, “But that doesn’t outweigh all of his other outstanding qualities.” Although they may seem like she-devils to you now, they could be saving your ass in the near future.
If you make those girls think that you think that you are the luckiest guy in the world for getting to be with your girlfriend, you’re golden. They will, in return, make your girlfriend think you are God’s gift to the Earth. One tip I picked up from the episode was to make sure you compliment your girlfriend to her friends when she’s not there. Maybe when she runs to the ladies room say something like, “It’s she beautiful,” or, “I am so lucky aren’t I?” Now, I think that’s kind of cheesy and unrealistic but hey, I’m no expert when it comes to Guy Code.
Bottom Line: Making a good impression with her friends may be more important than you think.

Since the weather is not quite warm enough to be outside yet why not kick back and relax inside a nice movie theater?
With the movies lined up to come out this spring, there are plenty of options. Currently, films such as The Host, Admission, Olympus Has Fallen, The Croods, The Call, Spring Breakers, and Oz the Great and Powerful have taken the box office by storm.
These recent feature films have different genres that will appeal to different college stu- dents. There is no real trend or similarities in the portrayal of the movies, so there is a type for any kind of person.
For Twilight fans, The Host is a must see. Not only was the book that the movie was based on written by the same author, Stephe- nie Meyer, but it also has the supernatural romance that Twilight fans go crazy for. The only difference is that this time the feature film is the love that an outer space alien feels for a human boy. The problem with that is her spirit has taken over his girlfriend’s hu- man body. This sci-fi thriller is great to see if you enjoy science-fiction films with a romantic kick.
Admission is a comedy starring the hysterical acting duo of Tina Fey and Paul Rudd. The film is about a Princeton University admissions counselor who meets a young boy applying to Princeton after a college classmate of hers introduces the two. Not only must she bend the rules for this boy, but she realizes that he is her long lost son as well. If you love the films Baby Mama or Role Models this movie is perfect for you.
The action adventure Olympus Has Fallen is perfect for fans of the hit television show 24. This film is about a former secret service agent who must save the United States President from a terrorist attack when terrorists take over the White House and hold the leader of the free world hostage. Starring in this film are Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman. For people who love action films and look for adventure when watching a movie, this spring film is a great go to.
The Croods is a film for students who wish to get in sync with their inner child. This film by Dreamworks Animation is about a prehistoric family that goes on adventures af- ter their cave, a.k.a. their home, is destroyed. The Croods was the recent box office winner of this previous weekend topping off at over $43 million. Voices of the characters include Emma Stone, Nicholas Cage, and yes ladies, Ryan Reynolds. Is that not reason enough to see this cute movie? This last movie has been smashing box offices within its past four weeks in movie theatres. Oz The Great and Powerful is an exciting prequel to the classic story, The Wiz- ard of Oz. Having an all-star cast of James Franco, Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, and Zach Braff, this film has plenty excitement. The movie also answers fans’ questions about the first film such as “where did the wizard come from,” “who are Dorothy’s parents,” and “how did the Wicked Witch become so terrible?” The film, which is over two hours, is perfect for fans of The Wiz- ard of Oz and is an exciting adventure for all. Some parts are scary for younger audiences, but for college students this is a great film to view this spring.
Many LIU Post students have already seen these recent spring releases.
Alexa Regina, a freshman Social Work major, says, “Oz The Great and Powerful was an excellent movie. It was great to see such a classic film get a new spin to it.”
Hayley Gordon, a junior Economics major, says, “Admission was a very funny film. Tina Fey is a great actress and was perfect as her role as ‘Portia’.”
No matter what genre someone is into, there is a wide selection for every moviegoer to enjoy.

If you are still expecting an acceptance letter from Hogwarts, it may be time you realize the closest thing to the realm of witchcraft and wizardry is Harry Potter: The Exhibition. Following the trail of young muggles in Gryffindor attire will lead you to its location at Discovery Times Square in New York City.
Admission to see the Harry Potter costumes and original props is $30, which does not include the $8 audio tour. Upon entering, there is an opportunity to have a picture taken wearing the scarf of your preferred house, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff or Gryffindor. This photograph can be purchased for an additional $30. This will be the only framed memory to take home since there is a no-picture policy.
Snippets of the eight movies are shown on large screens before passing the Hogwarts Express and entering into author J.K. Rowling’s fantasy world. It is a domain of imagination. Among the items on display are moving portraits, magic wands and a section devoted to Quidditch, an aggressive game played on broomsticks. Encountering these original props can help authenticate the feeling of reality this story has given many fans.
The diary of the Half Blood Prince almost seems real.
The exhibit’s lack of information about the items may make you regret not experiencing the audio tour. However, there are employees around if you have any questions. It is important to take the time to grasp the meticulous work put into every prop. The Quidditch gear looks as if it has been around for generations. Many of the school supplies look worn out. The copper bindings on the books have even turned light green.
A great deal of personality lies in the details of the costumes and character’s belongings. One example of this is Gilderoy Lock- hart who is a defense against the dark arts teacher and famous writer. His narcissistic persona is displayed through his extravagant gold accessories and ruffled clothing. His face adorns the cover of most of his possessions and published works. Dolores Umbridge surrounds herself in everything pink and she seems to be obsessed with cats. Hermione Granger’s clothing matures as she grows up and becomes a woman, which is highlighted by the dress she wore to the Yule Ball.
Located on the lower level is the Forbidden Forest, which contains the dark power and creatures of the night. The exhibition grows more exciting because of the additional special effects that cause a gloomy atmosphere. This demonstrates the dark side of J.K. Rowling’s universe. Under the floating Death Mark on the wall, horcruxes, deathly hallows, death eaters, dementors and Voldemort’s costumes are displayed.
The creators have left little room for interaction, which makes it less convenient to bring smaller children. You can experience a herbalogy class where you conjure up a screaming mandrake, throw a Quidditch ball though a hoop and sit in Hagrid’s gargantuan chair. Altogether, the artifacts and costumes collaborate to create the feeling of being in this fantasy realm, which has affected so many people around the world. If you are a fan, you are likely to see the story behind every prop and get your money’s worth.
Harry Potter: The Exhibition, created by Global Experience Specialists Inc. in partnership with Warner Bros. Consumer Products, will be on display at Discovery Times Square now through April 7.

The Office of Residence Life has shortened the application process for Resident Assistants (RA) in order to make it much more comfortable for students applying for the position.
Some of these changes include eliminating the step where the applicants act as RAs for a week. Now, applicants must send in a personal statement addressing who they are and what makes them an ideal candidate as an RA. Additionally, the applicants must share an experience that shaped them and how they would be an asset to the residence community.
Also, the group process, which used to occur in the middle of the application process, has been moved to the beginning. In the past, Residence Life realized that students who were interviewed after the group process were much more comfortable come time for their scheduled interview, according to Jennifer Fuoco, director of the Office of Residence Life. She added that the RAs and Resident House Directors (RHDs) have also begun conducting interviews on weekends to shorten the process from three weeks to just four days.
The interview process used to be done on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., which is why it took so long. Now the interviews occur over the weekend as well, which shortens the time span and allows applicants to find out if they got the job sooner.
There are currently 77 paraprofessional staff members in Residence Life, which includes RAs and Senior Resident Assistants (SRAs).
“The application process was fun as well as challenging. There were other good candidates but I really gave it my all,” said Natalie Villanueva, a junior Broadcast major who recently became an RA in Post Hall, wing 2W. She worked her first duty day (shift as an RA) on Thursday, March 28.
Villanueva explained the group process, which was broken down into three steps. The first part is conducted to gauge their teamwork skills. The candidates, according to Villanueva, played a game to get to know the other candidates.
The second part is called case studies, which requires applicants to solve problems in situations similar to those they would handle as RAs.
The final step requires the applicant to define themselves in order to show that they possess the qualities needed to be an RA.
“An RA serves a resource for the residents on their floor. They can answer questions about cam- pus policies, how to get involved, which offices can help you with a specific concern, etcetera,” said Fuoco, “In addition, they work to make sure residents in their as- signed residence hall are safe and able to live in a respectful community which supports their academic success.”
Some RAs at Post are excited by the challenge of being RA and are there to help the students in their residence hall whether they are on duty or not. They show excitement towards making programs and hosting activities for those who reside in their halls.
“RAs can answer questions about campus policies, how to get involved, which offices can help you with a specific concern, etcetera,” said Fuoco, “In addition, they work to make sure residents in their assigned residence hall are safe and able to live in a respectful community which supports their academic success.”

Now that the midpoint of the semester is far behind, workload is increasing and due dates, although they may seem far, are just around the corner. With about 11 weeks behind us, there is only one month left until finals, and I can assure you it will pass by quicker than we anticipate. As a result, we have to stay on top of our studies, always be conscious of due dates, and plan how we will effectively tackle our course loads now so that cramming and all-nighters will not be our only option during finals week. This preparation will not only decrease stress, but also escalate the probability of receiving top grades.
Here are a few tips on how to successfully plan and prepare a course paper or essay in order to receive an “A”.
(1) Be sure you have and understand the topic of your paper. There are some professors that don’t assign topics, leaving it up to the students to decide what they would like to write about. I personally like to be the creator of my own topic because I will be able to choose something that I am in- terested in. However, if you’re the type of student that likes to be told what to do, talk to your professor and ask him or her for suggestions.
If the topic of the paper is given, you need to read it over and think about it as soon as possible. If you don’t completely understand the topic or don’t know how to approach it, talk to your professor.
(2) If the paper is about a book or story you have read, be sure you have read it completely. Yes, there are summaries online but they will never give you a full interpretation or comprehension of the material. Most importantly, professors do read these web- sites and so they will know which students did their work and which took the easy way.
(3) After you’ve accomplished step one, you need to give yourself time to research or think about it. Although it is great to get your paper finished early, it may be more beneficial to let the topic sink in and build it up over a few days
in your mind before writing it. I recommend developing your thesis and evidence internally and jotting them down, as well as other ideas, on a piece of paper as they come to you. Tazeen Khatoon, a senior Accounting major, recommends this as well. Khatoon says, “This is necessary so you don’t forget your ideas by the time you write the paper.” Khatoon’s philosophy professor had advised her to “jot down ideas as they come because when you sit down to write your paper, ideas won’t just flood your mind; you should have developed them previously.”
(4) Plan out or outline your paper before you start writing it. Preparation will save you time by giving you a roadmap to follow. You will have everything laid out in front of you and will as a result have a particular informative or argumentative path to follow, which will produce a phenomenally organized paper.
To do this, write the main points you developed in step three in the order you would like to discuss them on another piece of paper, and expand on them. Leave space between each point so you can write down your thoughts and any quotes you find useful. If this paper is for an English course, skim through the book or some of its chapters in order to find quotes to support your points. This is especially important if your paper is persuasive because you will need to show evidence in the story to reinforce the arguments you make.
(5) Write you introduction and conclusion. Your intro can be written either in the beginning (which I recommend) or at the end. Either way, be sure both the intro and conclusion state the main points you go over as well as provide a general picture for the reader. In addition, your conclusion should include any last thoughts and any concerns you may have.
Now it’s time to write your paper. You have everything laid out; all you have to do is expand on your ideas. What is most im- portant now is the actual writing. You need to have accurate spelling and grammar, as well as effectively present your points to your reader.
I recommend Dr. James Bednarz’s(an English professor) approach: provide a “prediction” in your introductory paragraph about the points you will be covering in your paper (this should come after the thesis statement). Tell the reader what you will be talking about in the body, and then when you start writing about each particular point, tell the reader which point it is at the beginning of the paragraph (use “first,” “second,” “next”). Don’t jump from point to point without telling your reader; rather, lead him or her in the di- rection you desire in order to prove your argument.
You are now ready to start preparing your “A” paper! If you are struggling or have any ques- tions, be sure to visit the Writing Center on the second floor of Humanities Hall.

A fourth quarter offensive explosion helped push the men’s lacrosse team to a 14-6 victory over the Mercy College Mavericks on Saturday, March 30.
Freshmen attackers Matty Beccaris and Ryan Slane scored four goals for the Pioneers. Senior midfielder Chris Ruhlig netted a hat trick in the victory over the Mavericks. The trio accounted for five of the six fourth quarter Pioneer goals.
The Mavericks jumped to an early lead in the first quarter when senior midfielder Mike Marzocca opened up the scoring at the 13:47 mark. Minutes later, freshman attacker Kevin Drane put Mercy ahead by two. The Mavericks then converted on a man-up  opportunity at the 10-minute mark to make it 3-0.
But, the Pioneers battled back late in the first quarter and eventually tied the game. Graduate attacker Joe Costello scored back- to-back goals at the 6:13 and 2:22 mark to cut the lead to one and Ruhlig scored the equalizer with 58 seconds left in the quarter.
In the second, the Pioneers took control of the lead. Slane scored his first two goals of the game to put his team ahead 5-3. Ruhlig and Beccaris would score roughly three min- utes apart from one another to extend their lead to four going into halftime.
Freshman attacker Kyle Stockton scored for the Mavericks nearly five minutes into the second half, but Slane answered back for the Pioneers four minutes later.
Two goals late in the third quarter cut LIU Post’s lead to just two going into the fourth. But the Pioneers dominated the quarter scoring six unanswered goals, with fresh- man midfielder Anthony Berardis opening the scoring in the fourth.
Beccaris followed the goal up with his second tally of the game to make it 10-6. Ruhlig made it a five-goal advantage for his team at the 10:51 mark. In the final six min- utes, Beccaris scored his third and fourth goal of the afternoon and Slane recorded his fourth goal of the game to guarantee the Pioneers a 14-6 victory.
Pioneers’ senior goalie Tim Bradley made five saves, while allowing six goals in the win. His counterpart, freshman A.J. Pel- lati, made 11 saves, but surrendered 14 goals.
The win moves the Pioneers to a 7-1 record on the season and a perfect 3-0 record in the East Coast Conference. Their next contest is on Saturday, April 6 when they travel on the road to face Dominican College at 1 p.m.

After an excruciatingly long day that most likely consisted of attending class, working for minimum wage and/or crying over your keyboard while writing your thesis paper, your brain needs a break. You log on to YouTube and your subscription box is flooded with beauty bloggers showing you the latest trends and teaching you how to construct the perfect smoky eye. Each product they use seems to work like magic as it virtu- ally erases their imperfections or makes them looks like Blake Lively or Lauren Conrad.
The only problem is you are not sure whether this “perfection” is due to poor camera quality or flattering lights and angles. Then, you wonder whether you can really trust their opinions. Are they saying this because they know that it works? Are they just saying this because the company paid them to say complimentary things? This is the Internet after all. After borrowing a lab coat and some goggles, just to make myself feel a little more official, I investigated some of the most talked about beauty
products on the market. Here are five products that I think are actually worth the hype. Urban Decay’s All Nighter Makeup Setting Spray – $29
This product boasts lofty claims that include the product’s ability to lower the temperature of your makeup to hold it in place, work on any skin type and last up to 16 hours. Now, I do not know about lowering your makeup’s temperature. However, I do know that when sprayed on my face before and after foundation ap- plication, my makeup did not crease, break down or smudge. “I use Urban Decay’s makeup setting spray for a night out on the town to make my makeup last all night,” said Liza Gomelski, senior Public Relations major. Tarte’s Lights, Camera, Lash- es Mascara – $19
This mascara is marketed as a four-in-one product that lengths, curls, volumizes and conditions. One look at the package and you will see that it alleges that it will increase the volume of your lashes by 424 percent. I will admit that I was dubious. This sulfate and paraben free mascara is definitely my favorite higher end find.
“Tarte’s Lights, Camera, Lashes comes in a purple snake skin pat- tern case and it lasts all night without clumping,” said Gomelski. Benefit’s the POREfessional – $30
I will admit that this hefty price tag kept me from trying this primer, which is supposed to minimize the appearance of pores. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it after receiving a free sample. There is no real magic cure for pores but this product smoothes over them, cre- ating a nice base for foundation or powder, without clogging your pores. I will say that the consis- tency, which was comparable to a thick sort of whipped cream foam, scared me at first but it truly glides onto the skin seamlessly. Urban Decay’s Naked Palette – $50
If you are anything like me, eye shadow is your last priority. Nevertheless, I could not help but lust after Urban Decay’s Naked Palette. Everywhere I went online or in stores, people were touting the amazing color pay off, smooth consistency and ease of use. To be honest, this palette delivers on those accounts and more. The shadows are mostly shimmers and satins, which may seem daunt- ing. However, the shades are very complimentary to most skin tones and most of all they are very wear- able. It is difficult for me to pick a favorite but I especially use Naked, Half Baked, Dark Horse, Toasted and Hustle the most.
Revlon’s Lip Butters – $7
As opposed to the other products I discussed, the Revlon Lip Butters are very affordable and available at nearly any drugstore. According to the Revlon website, 94 percent of women’s lips were softer, smoother and moisturized after using this product. These were marketed as a tinted lip balm that offered decent color and plenty of hydration. However, the lip butters, Lollipop and Red Vel- vet especially, are even more pig- mented than my more traditional lipsticks. They apply easily and last for a couple of hours as well.
At the end of the day, beauty is less about makeup and more about being yourself and being happy. Makeup should enhance and ac- centuate your natural beauty not detract from it. As always, the best beauty product is confidence so try something new or keep it simple!

SimCity was one of this year’s most highly anticipated video games. It was developed by Maxis and published by Electronics Arts, the same companies that produced The Sims franchise, a well-known life simulation game. The last installment, SimCity 4, was released over ten years ago so this new game was a major deal for gamers and the fan base of this series.
The game is essentially a city-building and urban development simulator where players act as mayor of a town and turn it into a thriv- ing metropolis. Users have a lot of freedom to customize the game experience. Users can focus on becoming a major industry town that involves mining for coal and ore or becoming an oil tycoon and expanding your corporation to new heights by making highly priced petroleum and plastic.
Players can also create a bustling sin city atmosphere with casinos and bright lights that becomes a main tourist destination for black-jack and nickel slot crowds. However, for those that want the simple life, a quiet city with high land values and a focus on education is avail- able. Players can have their own university and watch citizens become more intelligent. They can even create new inventions to be eco-friendly and energy efficient. The possibilities in this game are virtually endless.
SimCity was designed well and it is easy to learn how to build roads and buildings as well as zone residential, commercial and industrial areas. The control is very fluid and users can learn how to play the game without watch- ing the tutorial. The challenge is when players tackle real problems that a growing civilization faces such as power supplies, the environment and pollution.
What really sets SimCity apart from previous SimCity games is that this edition has an online multiplayer function. This was met with harsh criticism from some fans. The game requires use of the Internet at all times, meaning this game cannot be played if Wi-Fi is unavailable. The game had previously been a single-player experience, a game that can be played anywhere. It did not have online achievements before.
Another major problem is the city size. Overall, users play in a region of their choosing in various city locations and the cities work together in terms of commuters, students, necessities and services like volunteer fire protection. Even though this is nice when playing with friends in one region, many players that want a simpler experience have trouble juggling cities.
In addition, the very small amount of room provided to make cities is eaten up quickly by roads and structures. To some, this makes the game more challenging but for others, it only makes it more tedious. Many players feel like the multiplayer function is forced onto them.
The graphics are colorful and the city looks alive with moving cars, walking people and changing streetlights. It is visually appealing and it feels as if it is a real city. This is an online-only game. Players must buy the disk but the game requires a free Origin account run by EA. If internet connectivity is a problem, the game experience is not as good as it could be. I recom- mend users to make sure their existing computer can view these graphics ahead of time.
Despite the pressing issues this game has, the actual game play is brilliant. It easily captures what this game is about: constructing and customizing cities. If this game had an offline single-player option and larger city sizes, SimC- ity would have received a perfect score. These issues hold the game back from greatness.
SimCity is available for $59.99. A deluxe version of this game includes DLC content called the “Hero and Villain” set and more customizable city sets. The deluxe version incorporates French, British and German style buildings and monuments. The deluxe version is $79.99. My final verdict is an 8.2/10.

In celebration of Women’s History Month, several clubs on campus partnered up with the Student Caribbean Association’s (SCA) first women’s history program “Her Essence Is A Gift.” The other clubs included: Omega Phi Beta, TWIce as Nice, Student Dance Association (SDA), LIU The Runway, NAACP, Alpha Epsilon Phi Sorority, and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.
SCA’s Vice President, Tatiana Marshall, said, “This program is dedicated to educating the LIU Post community on historical women figures and other women leaders that are un- known to the public.”
The program’s name was inspired by the poems “Phenomenal Woman” by Maya Angelou and “Strong Woman” by Anonymous, whose last stanza reads, “A strong woman in her essence is a gift to the world.” To begin the program, SCA’s Public Relations Chair, Kiara Braithwaite, recited the poem to the guests. During the event, the clubs honored live and deceased women, ranging from athletes to en- trepreneurs of all ages and ethnicities.
Alpha Epsilon Phi Sorority Vice President of Programming, Bianca Singer, honored two of the sorority’s big sisters (older members of the sorority) Elizabeth Glasel and Lauren Weisberger.
Singer said that Glasel was a carrier of the AIDS disease, which led to her being the found- er of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Weisberg- er was a member of the sorority while attending Cornell University. She is most famously known for her book “The Devil Wears Prada” published in 2003, which became a movie of the same title in 2006.
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority also honored their sisters Dr. Betty Shabazz and Vashti Mur- phy McKenzie. Shabazz is well known as Betty X due to her marriage to the late Malcolm X. Dr. Betty Shabazz became a member of Delta Sigma Theta in April of 1974 at the University of Massachusetts.
The Dr. Betty Shabazz Delta Academy of New York, a program designed for young girls ages eleven through fourteen to enhance interest in careers where minority women are scarcely represented, was named in honor of her contributions as an out- standing educator and exemplary role model for young women.
Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, grand- daughter of Delta founder Vashti Turley Murphy, became a member through the Baltimore Alumnae Chapter. She now serves as the national chaplain, member of the clergy who conducts religious services, for Delta Sigma Theta.
Rechelle Abalos, the Special Events Programmer of the twin club TWIce as Nice, spoke about identical twin sisters, Venus and Serena Williams. Venus was the first African American woman in tennis to be ranked the world’s number one single player. Serena also received the title five times within her career.
Samantha Vega, president of LIU Runway, picked two women who changed the concept of the traditional woman’s figure. For this, she chose Tyra Banks and the Marylyn Monroe. Monroe broke the barrier for nude modeling with full appreciation of her full figured body. Banks became the first African American model to make it to the cover of Gentlemen’s Quarterly (GQ) and Victoria’s Secret catalogues, break- ing both the barrier of race and having a fuller physique in modeling.
There were three trivia questions, asked by SCA’s president, Rockshana Desances, and vice president, Tatiana Marshall. Winners were awarded with an H&M gift card, a Target gift card and a Bath & Body Works gift card.
The three questions focused on the year women were allowed to vote, the secretary of state, and the name of LIU Post’s new presi- dent. Many students in the audience did not know that the new president of the university is Dr. Kimberly Cline, but expressed elation that a woman would be in charge.
SCA’s Marshall ended the program with a dedication to her mentor, Dionne Springer, the founder and Corporate Executive Officer of Island Girl Lifestyle organization. Island Girl Lifestyle encourages “Island Girls,” girls who are of Caribbean descent, all over the world to stand tall and proudly showcase their culture, style and vision for the world to see. The mission for the organization is close to the hearts of the executive board of SCA.
Junior Speech and Language Pathology major and Alpha Epsilon Phi sister, Justine Lopez, said “The event was amazing. There was a great diversity in the room and it was great to work with different organizations on campus to open our horizons and support each other.”
Freshman Forensic Science major, Bri- anna Bell, said, “It was a very informative event for Women’s History month. The trivia was a great addition, allowing the audience to participate. Overall, a great event.”
“We hope to continue this grand collaboration of organizations in the future and make Women’s History Month known throughout the campus,” said Desances. The SCA presented a personally engraved honorary plaque to each organization that was involved in the event.

On March 18, the highly anticipated series Bates Motel had its premiere on the A&E Tele- vision Network. The show is inspired by Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 movie Psycho, which was inspired by the novel by Robert Bloch. However, the series, which skipped the initial pilot stage and had 10 episodes ordered, is a re-imagination and not a continuation of the franchise.
The series focuses on Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) and his twisted relation- ship with his mother, Norma Bates (Vera Farmiga), serving as a prequel to Hitchcock’s classic. It begins with the death of Norman’s dad, which results in the family’s move to Oregon in hopes of starting a new life. Norma buys an old Victorian house that had fore- closed and comes with a motel and so the twisted and mysterious story begins.
Although we are familiar with Norman (originally played by Anthony Perkins) and his escapades from Psycho, Psycho 2 and Psycho 3, this is the first time we are in- troduced to his mother, Norma (originally played by Olivia Hussey), alive. The made for television movie, Psycho IV: The Beginning, written by original Psycho screenwriter Jo- seph Stefano, was the first undead introduc- tion to her. The film served as both the third sequel and a prequel to the series, ignoring the 1987 network pilot also named Bates Motel.
Even though Bates Motel has the foun- dation to be a great series, with both a good plot and interesting characters, it fails to impress. It all seems very stiff and predictable. The characters are not believable and after the first episode, I did not need to continue watching. The only things that were interesting are that the production uses the same set and that Norman was watching the original movie in the beginning as a tribute.
Bates Motel airs Monday nights at 10 p.m. on A&E.

While some students soaked up the sun during their spring break vacations, members of various student clubs on campus dedicated their week to helping communities damaged by Hurricane Sandy and the subsequent Nor’easter.
Students in the Pre-Law Club, International Students Union (ISU), Korean Student Association, The Runway, and the Office of Religious Life joined Circle-K and their advisor, Jeanette Murray,
for the community service week, known as “Give Where You Live.”
“I was impressed with stu- dents who would sacrifice their time to help others. It was honestly heart-warming to know so many would volunteer during Spring break,” said Murray.
This is the first weeklong community service event hosted during a vacation period in New York by Circle-K.
The reason for the event, according to Murray, was that, “For the past four years, we would travel to Louisiana and tend to those affected by Katrina, but we felt it was necessary to help our own community.”
The student volunteers wore green T-shirts with the words Give Where You Live in yellow, designed by Business Administration Graduate student, Jesus Cardenas.
Every day of the vacation week, the twenty-five student vol- unteers met in the chapel at 9 a.m. to make sandwiches and leave for the service areas. On Monday and Wednesday the group travelled to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, to participate in the Occupy Sandy efforts.
Occupy Sandy is an organized relief effort created to assist the victims of Hurricane Sandy. The locations vary from New Jersey, Coney Island, Greenpoint, the Rockaways, and Staten Island.
On Tuesday, the group visited the Interfaith Nutrition Network (INN) soup kitchen in Hempstead to help serve and prepare food for the homeless. They also organized pantries and worked in the donation centres.
On Thursday, the group assisted Sandy Help LB (Long Beach), a non-profit organization formed by Bryan Murphy, a resi- dent of Long Beach, who opened his home as an office for the organization. There they helped put up dry wall in the basement apartment of a young couple. “The couple just had a newborn and needed the renovations; we were glad to help” said Murray. International Students Union member and freshman Public Relations major, Stephanie Trieu, who attended the Thursday service day said, “Serving the community was both an enriching as well as interactive experience. I learned about how Hurricane Sandy affected various people differently and met a num- ber of individuals who were helpful and great to talk to. The organization, ISU, participated that day and members, including myself, felt accomplished to spend a day during spring break to give back to the community.”
The volunteer work did not end there. At 9 a.m. on Friday, the group cleaned up beaches in Long Beach. They collected garbage from the water and on the beaches, and separated recyclables from the trash.
On Saturday, the group travelled to Thomas Edison High School in Queens where The Run- way revisited the Stop Bullying Campaign that they presented at Post last month. This event steered away from the Sandy services to reach out to high school students in the community. They informed students of the many dangers of bullying and how it affects those who are victims.
“I believe Give Where You Live was very successful! There were a good number of students who participated and were glad to spend a day (or more) doing something cause-worthy. It was also an efficient, easy way for Post students to actively engage in com- munity service without the hassle of submitting a request and so on. I highly recommend that this is done again!” said Trieu.
Volunteers who signed up for three days got invited to a bowl- ing party to relax after the week of strenuous activity. All participants will also be attending a recogni- tion dinner for their efforts and for representing LIU Post with dignity and pride. The dinner is hosted by the Office of Religious Life, sponsored by Circle-K and SGA and will be held on Monday April 8.
Although the Give Where You Live spring break initiative is over, clubs, organizations and individuals can still get involved. For more information on other community service activities students may want to get involved in, sign up in the Interfaith Chapel or contact jeanette.murray@liu.edu.
