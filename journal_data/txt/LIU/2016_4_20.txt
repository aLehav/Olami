On Friday, April 8, the cheerleading team placed second at the National Cheerleading Association College Championships in the Intermediate Small Co-Ed Division II category at Daytona Beach, Fla., marking a school best in its mere second appearance.
But the road was rugged, even before the team reached competition. Just three weeks to go, talents began dropping out. “We ended up losing four people that were originally a part of our routine, and that’s huge,” said head coach Katelin Townsend. “And it’s not like we lost all four on the same day; we lost one, a week later, we lost another one.”
Injuries are always a big set back,” said Katie Ventrella, a senior Business Marketing major. “While you can’t replace someone because of skills, we had to work together and modify the routine to make the performance the best we could.”
Kicking off with the preliminary performance on Wednesday, April 6, the team came up shy with lots of big mistakes, according to Townsend, which in cheerleading deducts points from the overall performance. Thus, they placed dead last in the division, without a spot in the finals. Their only option: a few hours of rest before going into Challenge Cup. It was time for Townsend and her staff to rekindle a winning spirit.
“I try to learn how to motivate,” Townsend said. “We tried to be sentimental.” So she brought forward a quote booklet with notes that she’d collected from family members and friends of the talents prior to departure. “This was done to give them that little bit of extra motivation, and to remind them how many people were behind them and routing them on,” said assistant coach Matthew Blanar.
“We read them and were just really focused, and we hit everything,” said Dylan Silva, a sophomore Business Management major. “It was an amazing performance.” The team tied for first place, which meant a golden ticket to the final round.
Following the turnaround on Thursday night, Blanar gave each talent a pink heart. “This was to symbolize the love that we have for them as coaches as well as the love they should have for each other on the floor,” he said. “It was so that in those moments when you doubt yourself, or in that moment when all you need is a ‘you got it’ they could look down at their left shoe and get that support and motivation.
“We placed them on our left shoe because it represents the side that your heart’s on,” Silva explained. “And every time we were on the mat, we looked down and it reminded us of our family.”
To Silva and his teammates, there was only one thing in mind. “I’ve never been so focused in my life. You could feel the emotion when you were on the mat.”
“After we hit our routine at Finals I don’t think there was one person that wasn’t crying of happiness,” said Kelly Carey, a forensic science major. The Pioneers had gone from dead last to national second in a matter of two days.
Prior to leaving, the team had doubled up on practices to prepare for a tight schedule. “Our coaches had us do morning practices and night practices in case, so our bodies were used to it,” Silva said. “We would sometimes do night practice from 8 pm to 11 pm, or even midnight, and then practice again at 6 am.”
Townsend admits that it’s difficult to work hard at practice everyday not knowing if the potential to make a difference is measurable. “So I’m really glad they came second because now they know I wasn’t lying to them that they can win the national championship,” she said, giggling.
Some of the returning talents already look ahead. “I expect a lot of hard work and even more determination for the upcoming years,” said Miranda Alldaffer, a biomedicine/clinical laboratory science major. “Getting second by only 0.4 of a point definitely makes us more hungry for that national title.”
Townsend has her mind set, too. “Next year we are winning the national championship,” she said. “And we’re coming back from Daytona with order forms for those rings.”

Meet Daniel Kirsanov: the graduate of LIU’s five-year Accelerated B.S. Accounting/MBA program, and the valedictorian of the Class of 2016.
How did you get recognized with this honor? And what does this mean to you?
I was initially emailed about my eligibility for valedictorian. I was asked to write an essay on my time at the school and why I would be a good candidate and to obtain two recommendation letters. When all of that was sent in, I had an interview with the commitee. Honestly, although I always wanted to be valedictorian, I didn’t expect to actually be nominated. As you can probably tell, this means a lot to me. My hard work paid off. I was always the type that pushed myself to be the best, but to actually to recognized is unbelievable. My biggest experience from the selection process is that I can definitely say that the decision is based on more than just grades.
What’s your most memorable experience or moment from the nine semesters spent at LIU Post? I’m sure there are many.. Anything that comes to mind?
The thing that comes to mind first is my fiancee, my high school sweetheart, who has been with me every step of the way, whether helping me correct my papers, making door tags with me when I was an RA, or handling the Winnick food with me for the first two years. We both started at the same time and finished the accelerated program in December 2015. She received her BA/MS in Criminal Justice.
What’s your plans after graduation? Or, say, five years from now, where do you see yourself?
I hope to remain at Ernst & Young and progress up the ladder and gain more experience in the area of tax accounting.
How would you differ, or liken, American and Russian culture? What was hardest about coming over here at age 8? Have you been able to benefit from this, too?
The hardest part would be learning English since I barely knew the language before I initially moved to Russia. It was also a huge culture shock. The obvious benefits are knowing a second language, which is always helpful.
Lastly, have you thought of what to say during commencement? How should one go about such a thing? Any secrets to reveal?
I am actually mostly done now, but it was a little hard to get the ideas flowing. My secret is mostly not to think too hard. The ideas will flow when needed. Probably my biggest secret is my fiancee. She helped me write the whole speech. If it wasn’t for her I’m not sure if I would even be answering these questions.
Nicole Bellinger was nominated Salutatorian of the Class of 2016, grad- uating with a Bachelors degree in English, and with honors.

On Wednesday, April 20, Alpha Epsilon Phi will host the first annual “Dodging Endometriosis” in the Pratt Center at 8 p.m. “Dodging Endometriosis” is a dodgeball tournament aimed to bring awareness to a disease called endometriosis.
Victoria McLaughlin, a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi who is running the tournament, explained the planning of the event. “One of my sorority sisters came to me in March and asked if I would be able to put together a fundraising event before the end of this semester for one of her friends who suffers from endometriosis. I have wanted to host a big event all semester, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so,” McLaughlin said. “I chose dodgeball because it is a competitive, yet fun game that anyone can play, and there is no limit on the number of people allowed to play. Another reason I chose dodgeball is because of the name of the event that I was able to come up with, “Dodging Endometriosis.” The event name has brought more awareness to this disorder, especially as people are signing up to play,” McLaughlin added.
Although McLaughlin has helped plan other events for her sorority, “Dodging Endometriosis” is the first one that she is in charge of. “Before this, I was usually the person that helped plan an event and remained behind the scenes. I didn’t have such a big role to play. But now, being in charge of this event, I’ve had more of a role. Putting
together this event has been a lot of fun. I have been working with one of my sorority sisters, Stephanie Mercado, who has been an enormous help throughout the planning process,” she said.
Mercado explained the planning process between herself and McLaughlin. “Tory and I planned the event together after talking to our local philanthropy chair about running the event to raise money for endometriosis. I set up the Facebook event and both Tory and I hung up flyers in some buildings on campus,” Mercado said. Each team in the tournament will consist of 15 members. Entering the tournament costs $5 per person.
According to MayoClinic.org, “Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside the uterus.” Mercato said that the money that is fundraised will go to a friend who has endometriosis as well as the Endometriosis Foundation of America if the money is donated. In addition to raising money for the Endometriosis Foundation of America, Alpha Epsilon Phi has raised money for the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric Aids Foundation and Sharsheret. According to Mercato, Alpha Epsilon Phi hopes to raise as much money as possible for “Dodging Endometriosis.” “Dodging Endometriosis” will take place in the Pratt Center on April 20 at 8 p.m.

Joan Powers, director of photography and senior professor at LIU Post, said she will officially retire this September. Powers started teaching in 1981, became Director of Photography in 1990 and Senior Professor in 2008. She has been on medical leave since the spring of 2014.
According to Dr. Donna Tuman, chair of the art department, they are currently “reaching out to adjunct photography professors for the fall semester and hope to have a search approved and someone in place by the spring semester [of 2017].” The art department first requested a full time photography professor in September of 2015.
Tuman also said that three adjunct faculty members, along with full time professors and the chair, have helped students within the program during the absence of Powers.
Along with the replacement of the director of photography, Tuman also said that the department is looking forward to “curriculum changes that will advance the program to better meet the needs of current trends in commerce, media and global marketing.”
Powers said she is not involved in the search for the replacement. She won the David Newton Award for Excellence in teaching while at Long Island University, and she also had multiple solo and group photography exhibitions around the world.

Confucius said, “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” For some of us, what we love doesn’t exactly pay the bills. Or does it? With the spring semester coming to a close and graduation quickly approaching, students are in search of summer jobs. Of course the easy way out would be to find a part-time retail job or work at a summer camp for a few weeks. Rather than competing for these mundane roles, perhaps one could consider a position found on the unbeaten path. Here are five unusual jobs to consider this summer break:
1. Professional cuddler. According to a Business Insider, one can pay a person to professionally snuggle with them for $60 an hour. Sessions typically last about 90 minutes, and for overnight appointments, clients are “encouraged” to bring their own midnight snacks and other forms of entertainment, according to Independent Journal’s website. Cuddling has a multitude of benefits to the human body. According to lifehack.org, cuddling can boost the immune system, relieve pain and reduce stress by lowering one’s heart rate and blood pressure.
2. Undercover bridesmaid. For the social butterfly among us, people will actually pay to have a stranger be a part of their wedding party! According to Business Insider, undercover bridesmaids assist the bride on her big day- almost like a personal assistant. These ladies ready other bridesmaids, cater to the bride in preparing for the wedding day, and can even make arrangements such as bachelorette party plans. Costs vary from $300-$2,000 per wedding.
3. Professional line stander. Don’t feel left out, introverts! One can even be paid to spend alone time and potentially get some fresh air. Think of Black Friday or new release items. Rates fluctuate, but one professional line stander told Business Insider he earns up to $1,000 a week for standing in long lasting lines for other people.
4. Bed tester. After constant all nighters that take place during the academic year, get paid to sleep! In 2009, according to mashable.com, a college student from Harborne, Birmingham, was paid just under $2,000 to be a bed tester and blog about her experience every day for a month. The General manager for Simon Horn Ltd., the mattress company the employed the student said “…[She] will not only provide an objective view of the beds on sale, but will also be part of a look into what brings a good night’s sleep.”
5. Master Sommelier. For all of the 21 and over wine connoisseurs, pairing the perfect glass of wine with a meal can pay up to $80,000 per year, according to the Independent Journal. A requirement for this job is to do taste tests for various wines, some exclusive to specific restaurants. There you have it; life as a college student just got a little easier. Some of these jobs, like undercover bridesmaid or professional line stander can be found through personal ads or websites including Craigslist. Or show some initiative by personally reaching out to individual establishments, such as restaurants for Master Sommelier or mattress companies to be a bed tester. Other open positions may be even more surprising than the ones listed above.

With the summer of 2016 quickly approaching, students can’t seem to wait to book that next summer getaway. This summer, Post’s study abroad program is offering a two-week three-credit TESOL [Teaching English to speakers of other languages] course in Costa Rica.
According to Karen Ogulnick, the director of TESOL courses at Post, students will be given the opportunity to “…experience other cultures,” in this case the culture of Costa Rica. Ogulnick said that aside from teaching locals how to speak the English language, there will be an ‘”environmental focus,” as well as environmental excursions, Costa Rican style, which feature tropical mountain and rainforest adventures.
Ogulnick has high praise for this year’s study abroad program, stating that “the course is really important for any education major, because most of the new students coming into our schools systems speak Spanish at home.” Aside from that, according to Ogulnick, “this course can be used for students to one day get a TESOL certification.” Thus, making this two week course a key resume builder, which may help students who wish to enter the education field find jobs.
The course takes place from August 7 to August 21, and is only catered to graduate students. Students who wish to sign up should contact LIU Post’s Study Abroad office via email: post-enroll@liu.edu, or via telephone: 516-299-2137. Students who swish to enroll are required to pay of $1,400, which covers all travel expenses necessary for the trip; all other expenses are covered through student tuition. According to
Ogulnick, “We currently have seven students enrolled, and we need just ten to go,” student’s have till May 1 to register. “It should be a great time for students,” Ogulnick said. “A great way for students to experience another culture while furthering their education.”

8:30 a.m. Slam. Overturned tables hit the lobby floor of Riggs Hall. The facilities crew takes direction from Arianna Livreri, the campus life coordinator in charge of the school’s first annual Rundead event, which took place on April 1.
A fog settles outside as rain continues to drip steadfastly from the eerie gray sky. It’s like a horror movie, almost perfect for the day’s event – almost. What was originally supposed to be a campus-wide run has been moved, confined into the tight four corners of Riggs.
Some questioned how this would happen; a race throughout the residence hall? Hard to imagine if it weren’t for a similar event – Riggspocolypse – the RA’s hosted a few semesters before. Using the template from the zombie survival-style program, Livreri and her team were able to restructure their run to fit alongside dorm rooms and residents.
The lounge area on the second floor is buzzing with eager volunteers who have been transformed by way of cheap party store makeup. They socialize in little packs, discussing the week’s homework or the plans for the following night, looking passed the fake, bloodied gashes and alien contacts floating in their eyes. Their task: chase and intimidate registered runners as they sprint for the finish line.
A speaker reigns in the organized chaos minutes before the race begins; he introduces the event’s honoree: a Special Olympics athlete from Patchogue. “I would like to thank you all for coming today and enjoying the fun,” said Matthew Schuster, an athlete with Down syndrome who has been participating in the Special Olympics since the age of five.
Schuster expressed the pride he held in his heart for Post in hosting Rundead and helping a cause that directly affects him. “This event is helping Special Olympic athletes to play sports and meet some other friends,” Schuster said. “It helps the Special Olympics get more equipment and volunteers at the games.”
Schuster, who plays softball, golf, swimming and basketball at the games, is one of the many athletes who have benefited from fundraising efforts by Phi Sigma Kappa (PSK) fraternity, one of the co-sponsors of Rundead. The fraternity’s national philanthropy is Special Olympics; on average, the national organization raises more than $75,000 and serves over 13,000 volunteer hours annually for the cause.
Through contributions from the fraternity, runner registration and outside donors, Rundead was able to raise over $1,000 this year to send athletes like Schuster to the Special Olympic games.
“This event was special for us because we were able to bring our whole campus together for our cause,” said Nicholas Sieban, a sophomore adolescent education major and director of programming for PSK. “The reason I joined Greek Life was to become more involved with community service and philanthropy, and this event has made that goal come true.”
Carlos Abreu, a senior marketing major and philanthropy chair for PSK, said the fraternity’s camaraderie around the cause was a deciding factor for him when he was accepting bids last fall. “They were always so passionate and put together, and we always work together; we’re always involved in everything we do.”
The air was tense as runners took their mark at the starting line. In groups of five they poised into pre-running stances, each one unique and energized, chests beating to the rhythm of adrenaline. Horror movie music blared from the DJ booth, and the whistle sounded, sending the pack bursting through double doors that racked against the cinderblock walls upon impact. The racers dodged out of the way of zombies who grabbed greedily at the yellow flags strapped to their belts. Five minutes passed and runners returned to the lobby, the look of relief reaching their faces that were drowned in beads of sweat.
A wave of applause, high-fives and shouts of victory played in the foreground among the “Thriller” tune as each participant congratulated their fellow survivors: they evaded the running dead.

To most college students, their phone is their life. Not only because it houses their favorite social media, games, emails and notes, but also their photographs. Your photos will always mean something and you will have that moment forever. Here are this week’s LIU Post student’s favorite photo on their phones:
“This is my favorite photo because for the past four years my family has supported my decisions when it comes to skating and school!” Ashley Farino, senior criminal justice major.
“I don’t know why I would go feed swans when I’m terrified of them but being adventurous during the warm weather was a nice change of events.” Marisa Vessenmeyer, freshman biology major.
This is my favorite picture because speaking at Relay finally gave me the opportunity for my voice to be heard. Speaking in memory of my dad and being able to support and inspire others made my time at Post truly unforgettable!” Samantha Sterling, senior social work major.
 
“One of my favorite pictures is the one at Villa Roma, on a July Fourth vacation that captured a great moment with some longtime friends.” Kristina Frances, senior criminal justice major.
 
Share your favorite photograph on your phone too! Email it to us at: liupostpioneer@gmail.com and tell us why it is important to you!

Graduation is approaching in just 16 days. Seniors are finding themselves constantly being asked, “What are your plans after graduation? Do you have job?” Those questions makes many of us want to run and hide under our beds. If you’re a senior, chances are you’ve been on an extensive job search since before the spring semester started.
I started browsing through job posting sites in January and one thing I came across was the amount of experience many jobs were looking for. For example, to be an assistant for an editor, you need at least two to three years of professional editorial writing experience. For a social media job, you need three or more years working in social media. These requirements tend to make the process very stressful. I constantly find myself thinking, how in the world am I supposed to have all of this job experience when I’ve been in school for the past four years to get a degree that I believed would open doors for me in the working world?
A degree alone, it seems, is no longer enough. A 2013 report by High Fliers Research, an independent market research company that specializes in student and graduate recruitment, stated that college graduates without any type of work experience, let it be internships or regular jobs, don’t have as big of a chance of getting a job when they graduate.
This is why, as I prepare to leave Post, my advice to students who still have time to prepare for their future in the real world is: Get as much experience as you can in what you want to do, whether it is by writing for The Pioneer or joining your major’s club on campus. Get out there and start to do things that will benefit you in the future. Start doing internships early. I used to think that I didn’t have to do an internship until my junior or senior year, but now I realize how important it is to start as early as possible.
“I started to do internships the summer after my sophomore year,” said senior public relations major Marisa Kofmehl. “Other than that internship, I interned for three other companies during my time at Post.” Kofmehl even interned for two companies at the same time last fall, since she is a strong believer that having done previous internships is what makes a difference when applying for jobs. A hiring manager is going to give more priority to a resume that shows internships, volunteer work, and being part of organizations, over a resume that simply shows the university attended, degree and GPA.
Not only do internships help you gain experience, but a lot of times they open your eyes to what you actually want to do with your career. Doing an internship early in college can help a student determine if that is the career he or she actually wants to pursue. “During my internships, I learned a lot as to what I wanted to do and not do with public relations,” said Kofmehl.
Unfortunately, at this moment, it seems that it isn’t enough to just have a degree. It’s important to keep busy and keep working on a well-rounded and strong resume. As I step into the real working world, I leave you all with the advice I wish I had heard back when I was starting college. Keep yourself busy, join as many clubs as you can, and work hard so you can get any type of experience in the field you wish to work in and then hopefully land your dream first job.

Kanye West has been in the headlines a lot lately. Often it has been because of a random outburst about how he feels mistreated or misrepresented in some way. West has said he will run for president in 2020, but until then he will have to stick to his role as a rapper. It is good that 2020 is a few years away, because West is on a hot-streak musically, especially with the release of his anticipated album “The Life of Pablo.” Originally released exclusively on his buddy’s Jay Z’s Tidal service on February 14, 2016, the album has since made its way to Apple Music, with a few production changes.
Prior to its release, West described the album as a “gospel album.” While there are certainly gospel elements to it, it is hard to describe this album as completely gospel, especially when West says things like, “I feel like me and Taylor [Swift] might still have sex / Why? / I made that b***h famous.” Semantics aside, this is a fantastic album that has advanced the limits of the sound of hip-hop.
Ever since his single “Jesus Walks” released in 2004, Christianity has played a major role in West’s music, and “The Life of Pablo” is no different. The track “Ultralight Beam” starts off the album. Chance the Rapper is featured on this track, he and Kanye West both give their glory to God and Chance thanks God for his ability to collaborate with West. “I met Kanye West; I’m never going to fail,” Chance raps.
As much as Kanye West brags about himself, he offers an apology
on the next track “Father Stretch My Hands” saying “If I ever instigated I’m sorry / Who in here can relate.” It’s tough to know whether West is being sincere or not. The very next line Kanye West explicitly talks about having sex with a model. Mixed messages aside, the production on this track is fantastic, as most Kanye West albums are. It’s hard to individually pick out the instruments or sounds used because they all blend so nicely. It sounds like a choir hence the gospel theme West mentioned.
After this track the hits keep coming. A remix of the song “Panda” by Desiigner is one of the most hard hitting on the album, but it ends abruptly and fades into a lady singing with some odd vocal effect. What ever it is, it sounds good.
“The Life of Pablo” is a very different album sonically, but the topics West covers are typically the same as his previous work. He raps about his life. He is arrogant on his songs the same way he is arrogant in real life. That’s what seems to work for him. Some rappers can separate the “characters” they create in their music (i.e. Pusha T is not a real cocaine dealer, but raps about dealing). Kanye West cannot seem to do this, probably because it isn’t a character. It’s just him.
If you’re interested in West’s life and thoughts then this album is for you, if you feel repulsed by his arrogance and crudeness, do yourself a favor and play something else.

Hip-hop has evolved greatly since the boom-bap era in the early 90s. No longer are the instrumentals under the artists your traditional bass line in which the bass kicks in every few seconds with some slaps mixed in for effect. The sounds are different now; they are more infectious. The melodies are different; more intricate, with several layers of instruments stacked on top of one another to create a catchy tune that will have people humming for weeks. More technology provides more tools at a producer’s disposal. Producers have played a very important role in shaping the career of Young Thug.
Young Thug, born Jeffrey Williams, is a 24 year-old rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. With the help of fellow rapper Gucci Mane, Thug was given a record deal in 2013 by 1017 Brick Squad Records, and quickly rose to fame from the hit single “Lifestyle.” Young Thug is unlike many other rappers in the industry. His voice is different to say the least. He uses it almost like an instrument. He does not have quite the range or control of a trained R&B singer but what he does with his voice is quite impressive. He almost effortlessly varies his cadence on each of his songs, which keeps his material from sounding too similar.
The producers a rapper choses to hire are as important as the actual rapper to the music. Young Thug definitely has his favorites. On “Slime Season 3” (the final installment in his Slime Season mixtape trilogy) he frequently brings in fellow Atlanta-based producer London on da Track, as well as heavy-hitter Mike Will Made It and beat maker Isaac Flame. It’s hard to mistake who produces each song because the producers insert their “tags” or names into the tracks that they produce, usually before the beat drops. (London’s tag is “We got London on da track.”
The mixtape starts out with a song titled “With Them.” Although this title seems terribly unoriginal, the track itself is absolutely not. Produced by Mike Will Made It, this bouncy beat features some faint piano sounds that can be heard over the bass. Lyricism is not Thug’s forte but maybe thats what he’s going for; the most abstract lines that somehow blend together to make a cohesive song. The second line in this song makes no logical sense but thats almost what Young Thug fans come to expect. “I just went hunting/ I found me
a rabbit / I picked out the carrot,” he says. Your guess is as good as anyones as to what this means, but the way he says it just sounds nice. Williams’ energy can be heard through his delivery, which is one of the best aspects of his rapping style.
If the first track isn’t for you, then you probably wont like the rest of this mixtape, and thats okay. “Trap rap” (rapping about selling drugs or living a violent gangster lifestyle) definitely isn’t for everyone. It’s explicit, and it’s raw. When Young Thug raps about drinking unhealthy amounts of cough syrup to feel a buzz, it’s believable. When he changes almost every word that starts with the letter C to the letter B because of his affiliation with the blood gang rather than the crips, that is odd, but interesting.
It is certainly understandable why some people may dismiss this type of music altogether. For many, it may seem like he is saying absolutely nothing and just cursing his way through the song for three minutes. For those who are already a fan of this genre, and Young Thug in particular, it is his best work yet.

On Sunday, April 24, the HBO series “Game of Thrones” will return for its sixth season. Adapted from George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire,” the show takes place in the mythical lands of Westeros and Essos as several noble houses vie for control of the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. Some of the main houses in “Game of Thrones” include House Baratheon, Stark, Targaryen, Lannister, and Tyrell. While there
is a large ensemble cast in the show, there are a few key characters that really drive the story. Some of the more popular characters include Jon Snow, played by Kit Harrington; Daenerys Targaryen, played by Emilia Clarke, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage; and Arya Stark, played by Maisie Williams.
While the main story revolves around the control of the Iron Throne, there are side stories that are just as interesting. One focuses on Daenerys Targaryen, the last member of her house, as she works to reclaim the Iron Throne with the help of her three dragons. Another revolves around the approaching winter season and the arrival of the White Walkers, mythological creatures who have not existed for thousands of years and pose a threat to the entire realm. This show is for viewers who like fantasy, drama and politics. Viewers should be warned that “Game of Thrones” is not for younger audiences, as there are no content restrictions on HBO.
After a less then stellar fifth season which saw the show adapt the last chapters in Martin’s novels, season six will move into uncharted territory as the show has moved beyond the source material and can no longer use his books as a point of reference for the story. The first episode of season six, “The Red Woman,” will have the challenge of addressing several big cliffhangers from the season five finale.
The biggest question from the finale involved the fate of Jon Snow and whether he is truly dead after being stabbed by his fellow members of the Night’s Watch. Other cliffhangers involved Arya getting blinded by Jaqen H’ghar, Sansa and Theon fleeing Winterfell, and Daenerys getting captured by the Dothraki. Season six will also see the return of Bran Stark, who was last seen at the end of season four journeying beyond the Wall to visit the three-eyed raven.

The third-ranked women’s lacrosse team (10-3) found themselves on the short end of an 8-5 decision against twelfth-ranked Dowling College on Wednesday, April 13, in East Coast Conference play at Golden Lions Field.
Knotted up at two at the intermission, the Pioneers gained a 4-3 edge to kick-off the latter stanza on a free- position marker by freshman midfielder Trish Brisotti.
However, the hosts responded with a 4-0 run to solidify the lead for good. Junior attacker Alyssa Milano scored the tying and go-ahead goals for the Golden Lions (11-1). Defensively, Dowling remained stout in the closing moments of the contest, allowing just one shot on goal in the final six minutes, which was netted by Pioneer junior attacker Connor Bird, trimming the lead to 7-5.
For the Pioneers, senior defender/midfielder Honey Roche won a game-high four face-offs and caused two turnovers while junior defender/midfielder Cara Douglas led all players with six caused turnovers. Bird scored two goals for the Green and Gold as Brisotti, senior attacker Jessica Marsh and freshman midfielder Ryan McKinney all punched in a goal for the visitors.
Sophomore goalie Olivia Kirk finished her day with eight saves for the Pioneers. Overall, they held an 8-7 advantage in draws and executed on 3-of-6 free-position shots.
Head Coach Meghan McNamara and the Pioneers continued their four-game road trip Saturday, April 16, when they took down the Spartans of St. Thomas Aquinas College by a score of 9-5, up in Sparkhill, N.Y.
The ECC clash was headlined by senior attacker Emily Delaney, who logged three goals and three helpers for a game-high six-point output. Junior attacker Stefani Vagelatos collected four points (3G, 1A) for the Pioneers as well.
After being deadlocked at five midway through the second half, the Pioneers shutout the Spartans and scored the game’s final four goals for the win. Vagelatos secured the lead with an unassisted marker at the 13:13 mark. The duo of Douglas and Delaney followed Vagelatos’ goal, scoring just 15 seconds apart. Delaney eventually rounded out the scoring when she ripped one passed St. Thomas goalie Kaitlyn Lonergan at the 8:16 mark.
Between the pipes, Kirk denied a game-best eight shots; seven of them coming in the final 30 minutes of action.
McNamara and the Pioneers are back at it on Thursday, April 21, when they prepare for a date with Saint Anselm College up in Manchester, N.H. in a non-conference match-up. Opening draw is scheduled for 3 p.m.

After heading into overtime, senior attacker Ryan Slane finished the script with the game-winning goal three and a half minutes in, as the no. 12 ranked men’s lacrosse team (8-3) upset tenth-ranked Dowling College (8-3) 10-9, in dramatic fashion Saturday, April 16, in an East Coast Conference tilt at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
Slane ended the duel after finding the back of the net on the Pioneers’ third man-up opportunity on the afternoon. Golden Lions freshman defender Tom Cummings was slapped with a one-minute tripping penalty, leading to Slane’s game-winning shot, which he ripped by red-shirt junior goalie Frank Sommers.
Although the Golden Lions seemed to control their own destiny up 9-7 with four minutes remaining, the Pioneers had other plans; as they notched a pair of goals in the final 3:43 of regulation to force sudden death. Sophomore midfielder Eric Donahoe cashed in with his first goal of the season to spark the comeback making it a 9-8 score.
The Pioneers still trailed 9-8 with under a minute to go until Slane followed up Donahoe’s tally with an unassisted goal at the 0:35
mark. Head Coach John Jez dialed up Slane’s number and he delivered for the Green and Gold, evening up the score at nine.
Overall, Slane finished as the leading scoring with five points (4 G, 1 A) and senior attackers Matty Beccaris and Matt Bellando each registered two goals. Junior midfielder Anthony Galeotafiore won 14-of-20 face-offs, including the pivotal draw that began overtime. In addition, he also collected 10 ground balls on the day.
Between the pipes, junior goaltender Matthew Liantonio recorded nine saves, while causing one turnover and adding one ground ball to his stat-line. (Liantonio’s forced turnover led to Slane’s game-tying goal in the final moments of the fourth quarter.)
The Green and Gold converted on 12-of-13 clears, outshot the Golden Lions 39-34 and held a slim 22-21 advantage in ground balls.
Jez and his Pioneer squad look to build on their four-game-winning-streak as they prepare to square off against ECC rival, Mercy Col- lege, on Saturday, April 23, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Opening draw is at 12 p.m.

After dismantling Southern New Hampshire University last week, the Pioneers landed the no. 22 spot in the National Fastpitch Coaches Association Division II Top-25 Poll. After earning the ranking, the Pioneers backed it up; taking two games on their home field from Molloy College on Thursday, April 14.
In the first matchup, junior pitcher Ashley Martin set the tone, tossing a complete-game shutout, (her second in as many starts), and striking out three in the process.
Although Martin was shutting down the Lions offense, the Pioneer offense struggled as well. Through the first six innings, the game was deadlocked at zero. In the bottom of the seventh inning however, the Pioneers came alive. After a lead-off double by junior middle infielder Kayla McCoy, freshman catcher Julia Seader was the hero; providing the walk-off single and delivering a Pioneer win.
The nightcap saw more of the same from the Pioneers, as they continued their stellar play. Powered by freshman pitcher Hannah Olshevski, who threw seven innings and allowed zero earned runs, the Pioneers won by a score of 3-2.
With the score evened up at one in the fifth, Seader put the Pioneers up with an RBI double. Up 2-1, senior first baseman Paige Swantek added to the lead with a run scoring out.
Up by two runs in the final inning, the Pioneers made things a little uneasy for the LIU faithful in attendance. After the Lions cut the deficit in half with a run scoring single, they put the tying run on base. However, Olshevski beared down and got the last two batters out to end the threat and the game.
The Pioneers welcomed Queens College to Brookville, N.Y. on
Saturday, April 16, and, like the Lions, the Knights didn’t fare well. The Pioneers won both games handily.
In game one, the Pioneer bats did the talking, knocking in 10 runs; eight of which came in the third inning. After a misplay in the field, the Pioneers strung together hit after hit in the third inning and Seader capped it off with a two-RBI double, making the score 9-0 after 18 outs.
Martin was back in the circle for the Pioneers and she earned the win; her twelfth of the season. She went seven innings, scattered 10 baserunners and fanned seven Knights. The cherry on top for the Pioneers was a solo blast by Seader in the sixth inning making it 10-3; all but sealing a Green and Gold victory.
After a short break, the two sides met again and the Knights were ousted by the Pioneers once again. Thanks to five unanswered runs in the middle innings, the Pioneers earned their sixth win in as many games.
What else is new? Olshevski was dominant again; tossing all seven innings and allowing one run while striking out a trio of Knights. The offense was led by senior infielder Maria Palmeri, who had two RBIs for the game, and Seader, who drove in a run and also came around to score on a fielders’ choice.
The Pioneers will look to continue their hot streak when they visit NYIT on Wednesday, April 20. The Jamie Apicella led squad will hit the field for first pitch which is scheduled for 3 p.m.

The baseball team opened up a four game set against the University of Bridgeport on Friday, April 15. The Pioneers welcomed the Purple Knights to Brookville, N.Y. with three first inning runs and a total of eight in an 8-2 pounding.
The first run on the afternoon was plated by junior outfielder Kenny Daley and then freshman outfielder Dave Brehm followed that up with a two-RBI double. After the Purple Knights trimmed the lead to 3-1, the Pioneers got that run back on an RBI base hit by freshman third baseman Jimmy Mendyk.
Mendyk drove in another run in the sixth inning and in the later innings, senior first baseman David Groeneveld and sophomore shortstop Joe Spitaleri each plated runs with singles.
On the bump, junior pitcher Jake DeCarli tossed eight innings and allowed five hits while punching out seven batters.
The Pioneers and Purple Knights met up again for a double-header in West Haven, Conn. on Saturday, April 16. Seeking redemption from a loss one night earlier, the Purple Knights came out strong and won the two games 6-4 and 8-1.
In the home half of the first inning, the Purple Knights delivered two back-breaking runs with two outs off of junior pitcher Dan Jagiello. The Pioneers cut the lead in half with a single by sophomore outfielder Rob Andreoli that scored senior middle infielder Matt Bowers.
Up 2-1, the Purple Knights scored a combined four runs in the fifth and sixth innings to take a 6-1 lead into the seventh inning. After the Pioneer bullpen kept the Purple Knights off the board for the rest of the game, the offense flirted with a comeback. The Pioneers scored two runs in the ninth inning, but fell 6-4 in game one.
At the dish, Andreoli and Bowers both had two-RBI efforts in the loss. The nightcap, unfortunately for the Pioneers, saw the Purple Knight bats catch fire.
The hosts mashed 12 hits and brought home eight runs compared to just one run for the Pioneers on three hits. The Pioneer defense wasn’t impressive either, committing four errors in the game.
For the Purple Knights, six players totaled RBIs led by outfielder Tyler Gambardella who drove in a pair.
The Pioneers returned to the comfortable setting of Brookville, N.Y. for the final game of their four game set against the Purple Knights on Sunday, April 17. The high-scoring affair ended up favoring the Pioneers as they won a slugfest, 13-12.
The Pioneers opened up the scoring in the first inning with two runs, one on a sacrifice fly
and another on a wild pitch. After three scoreless innings from both teams, the Purple Knights struck and connected with four runs over a three inning span. In that spurt, Bridgeport third baseman Alnaydo Rodriguez drove in two runs to propel his team to a 4-2 lead.
In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Pioneers battled back to tie and take the lead with four runs. The go-ahead hit came curtesy of Andreoli, who doubled to make it 6-4 Pioneers. The Pioneers extended their lead to 12-4 thanks to key hitting contributions from Spitaleri, Andreoli and Groeneveld.
Trailing by eight runs in the eighth inning, the Purple Knights put on an offensive onslaught. After the first two batters were retired, nine batters came to the plate and eight runs came around to score to tie the game at 12. There was only one extra base hit during that stretch by the Purple Knights, but baserunner after baserunner came around to score.
Tied in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Pioneers avoided extra innings by coming through in the clutch. Groeneveld delivered the goods with a one-out single that scored Andreoli for the walk- win.
Offensively, four Pioneers had multi-hit games led by Andreoli, who had three hits. He also tied for the game-high in RBIs on the team with Spitaleri; both of whom had three.
The Pioneer bats will look to stay hot when they travel to Queens to play Queens College on Friday, April 22. First pitch is set for 3:30 p.m.

1. Ryan Fitzpatrick will give in to the Jets demands and sign a contract under $10 million
With Fitzpatrick having little leverage against the Jets, there is little he could do to drive their asking price up. Reports say the Jets offered a $7 million contract while the Fitzpatrick camp is essentially asking for double that. While Fitzpatrick has been a journey-man quarterback for most of his career, he carved a nice little niche with the Jets; throwing for 3,900 yards and 31 touchdowns last season. Pass catchers Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker certainly helped his cause, as both receivers went over 1,000 yards and hauled in 10+ touchdowns. The combination of the right pieces to win now and a familiar offensive system will get Fitzpatrick back in Green and White, even though the money isn’t all there.
2. The Golden State Warriors won’t win the Championship, in fact they won’t even get there
They broke the record for most wins in the regular season, topping MJ’s 1995-1996 72 win team by one win, but their luck will run out against the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. Gregg Popovich always has a trick up his sleeve and every time we think the Spurs are done and we write them off for being too old, there they are again; making another deep playoff run. For all the attention paid to Warriors and their pursuit of the single-season wins record, the Spurs quietly went 67-15 and also had one of the best seasons of all-time. With the emergence of future superstar Kawhi Leonard and a plethora of big-men like Tim Duncan, LaMarcus Aldridge and David West, the Spurs have the tools to topple the leagues’ best team.
3. LeBron James will win the championship and leave Cleveland
Due to an Eastern Conference that is average at best, the Cavaliers will go pretty much untested on their way to the NBA Finals. They will have to deal with the Warriors, Spurs or Thunder most likely, and the reason they’ll come out on top is #23. LeBron has played in over 100 playoff games and understands what it takes to win. His teammates need to get involved and when that happens, it allows LeBron to dictate the offense and play his way. If that happens, they’ll be hard to stop. After lifting the Larry O’Brien Trophy and getting his third ring, LeBron will mull over his free agency and jet from Cleveland back to Miami and team up with his buddy D-Wade for another run at the chip.
4. Noah Syndergaard will be in the Cy Young discussion
It’s actually a knock to call Syndergaard a no. 3 starter, but that’s what most Mets fans tag ‘Thor’ as. Even though he has pitched less than a season in the bigs, Syndergaard sports an ERA just north of three and just shy of 200 strikeouts in 170 innings pitched. Oh yeah, and he’s only 23. In 2015, he averaged 97.7 mph on his four-seam fastball, the highest average fastball velocity of any starting pitcher, minimum 100 innings pitched, in any season since the stat starting being tracked in 2002. With a fastball, often times coming in at high-90s and occasionally in the 100s, Syndergaard will dominate the porous offenses in Atlanta and Philadelphia and pitch his way to the top of the Mets rotation, which is saying something, and into the Cy Young discussion.
5. The Yankees will trade one of their Big 3 in the bullpen
The Dellin Betances – Andrew Miller combination was unhittable in 2015 and looks the same in early 2016. With Aroldis Chapman sidelined until mid-May, the Yankees will play it out when he resumes gameplay. If the trio are lights out at end of games as expected, no one would think to mess with the formula that has been so successful. The Yankees always inconsistent starting rotation could easily be bolstered if Miller was shipped out. Put it this way. If the Big 3 are lights out and they are striking out hitters left and right, one of them will be pitching games in a different uniform come the trade deadline.
