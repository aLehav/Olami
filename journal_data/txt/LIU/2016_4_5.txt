As of this year, Post is offering a new bachelor’s degree in environmental sustainability. Prior to adding the new major, Post added a master’s program in environmental sustainability about four years ago, along with a minor in environmental sustainability and global climate change. In a description provided by Dr. Margaret Boorstein, geography professor and chair, the new program “will allow students to understand how to advance societies and their cultural, economic, and technological activities in a sustainable manner concordant with Earth’s natural systems.”
This new 129-credit major requires students to take General Biology I and II, Earth Science I and II, Introduction to Environmental Sustainability, Introduction to Geographic Information Systems, Applied Conservation, Introduction to Microeconomics, a math class, and four courses from either biology, geology or earth science, social science, or social science: arts and humanities.
“The faculty firmly believe that students should be well-rounded so that they can think broadly and deeply,” said Dr. Boorstein. “The relatively new M.S. in environmental sustainability provides courses in sciences and in the social sciences. Students then have a good background in environmental sustainability from both scientific and social science perspectives.”
Ashley Oliver, a junior transfer student, is currently the only student enrolled in the program. Oliver said she had chose Post because of this major. “I had never heard of the major as an option before, but soon realized that it fit well into my future.” Students in the major have the option of choosing a track in biology, earth science, or social sciences. Oliver is concentrating in earth science while completing her major requirements.
As for the success of the major, Oliver believes it has a large future. “As we all continue on in life it becomes more inevitable that we need to be able to balance our actions with the environment. The availability of the major allows people to learn about the ways we can change our current actions to ones more geared towards both people and earth,” said Oliver. Post graduation, Oliver hopes on joining the aquaculture field, which is the sustainable farming of aquatic animals. “The field is growing,” said Oliver. “Last year, most of the seafood ate came from aquaculture facilities, rather than being caught in the ocean,” she continued.
“The courses are exciting and designed to encourage students to think and think again. They can develop the skills to understand and try to develop new ways for people individually, and as societies, to operate in more sustainable ways,” said Dr. Boorstein.

On Thursday, March 31, the Tilles Atrium turned into a beach party, complete with a DJ and beach ball volleyball. The Newman Catholic Community hosted its fifth annual cerebral palsy dance, cosponsored by BASIC, which stands for Brothers and Sisters in Christ. The event was started in 2011 by Father Ted, LIU Post’s former chaplain, who retired in the spring of 2015. Although the dance was sponsored by two Christian organizations, it was not a religious event.
This was the first year the club charged for tickets to the dance. Tickets were $3 in advance and $5 at the door. “We figured every college student could spare $3,” said Emily Buonocore, president of the Newman Catholic Community. All money raised was donated directly to UCP, United Cerebral Palsy, in Suffolk County.
Buonocore compared the dance to prom for UCP. “People come here and don’t know what to expect,” Buonocore said. “Some people think they can’t dance because they’re in wheel chairs but they do!” She said as she waved her arms. In fact, a crowd favorite was “cotton eyed joe.” Students from Post as well as care takers of those who struggle with various disabilities encouraged all in attendance to “bust a move.” The dance had students of Post in attendance as well as members of UCP and their caretakers. About a dozen volunteers from the Newman Catholic Community were present.
Buonocore said that there were about 40 participants from Post, students and volunteers included, at the dance. Because “TakeBack-the-Night” was happening on campus at the same time as the dance, the turn-out, according to Buonocore, was less than expected and volunteers were also limited because of the conflictingly timed events.
