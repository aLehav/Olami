The reigning Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, kicked off the NFL’s most unprecedented season yet against the Houston Texans on Thursday, Sept. 10. Fans eagerly watched the teams take the field, bringing back a sense of normalcy. The NFL is attempting to have a full season with expanded playoffs. However, to make that happen, they have had to  change the  standard protocols of a season. 
With the looming threat of  COVID-19, the NFL has had to put in place many new rules and regulations for the 2020 season. The NFL has implemented new protocols such as daily testing, socially distant team meetings, Zoom conferences, and mostly empty or spread out stadiums. 
Another  rule is that all personnel on the sidelines must wear a facemask at all times, even the officials. The NFL is taking this rule seriously, as they warned coaches to wear masks properly during games or face discipline. Troy Vincent, NFL executive vice president of football operations, shared a memo acknowledging league and government regulations are of utmost importance. “We must remain vigilant and disciplined in following the processes and protocols put in place by not only the league, union, and clubs, but also by state and local governments,” Vincent said. This comes after various NFL head coaches such as Rams’ Sean McVay, Saints’ Sean Payton, and Raiders’ Jon Gruden, were seen on camera wearing their face masks, not covering their nose and mouth. 
After the NFL announced the latest test results from Sunday, Sept. 6 through Saturday, Sept.12 had only seven confirmed positive cases, there is more optimism than before. Cleveland Browns’ running back Nick Chubb made it clear he was not very optimistic before the start of the season during a recent zoom session. “Because of all the uncertainty going on before the season, I did not know if we were going to have a season,” Cubb said. 
Despite the case count in the NFL being relatively low, the concern of COVID-19 spreading still exists. The Kansas City Chiefs had one fan test positive for COVID-19 after attending their opening game, the Kansas City Health Department announced. The ten people who had close contact with the individual were notified and told to quarantine. 
Situations like this have led to some fans being skeptical about the season’s outlook.
“Even though I’m excited football is back with everything going on, I wouldn’t be surprised if the league is postponing games sooner rather than later,” Jason Glickman, a senior broadcasting major, said.
Glickman is uncertain about what the future holds for the season. “Football season and fantasy football is something I look forward to every year but with how the MLB had so many outbreaks I don’t know how the NFL will do any better,” he said.

Editor’s Note: The Personal Essays section of the paper is one that invites students to share their personal experiences and thoughts about subjects they are passionate about. The author is not affiliated with The Pioneer, but has given us permission to publish their work.
I just want to dance, like my African ancestors, do a little two-step, a shimmy of my shoulder with my loved ones to celebrate. Oh, how I miss the base on my back, feeling the vibes through my feet. The last “normal” celebration was for my best friend’s birthday, the Sunday before the closings of all NYC bars, restaurants, and public schools, yes, life as we knew it. I’m talking about no mask on, seating inside of a packed restaurant and partying on a dance floor with over 50 people. We should have known things were going to eventually get real.
“Sorry, we have to cancel your reservation due to New York State regulations, but we hope to be open in a few weeks.” Ring after ring, some places not even answering, “Sorry, we aren’t taking any reservations at this time.” After so many rejections, a sweet voice finally says, “Hi, yes, we will be open for brunch, how many people will you be coming with?” Miss Lily’s, a restaurant that wasn’t scared of what was to come. But should I have been scared? Who would have known waiting for that reservation would turn into months of waiting? I had no idea what we would be waiting for. 
 I’ve been waiting to celebrate; the next celebration should have been for me. It should have been outdoor concerts and festivals, vacations, The Polo Classics, Essence Fest, the whole shebang. But now our celebrations consist of Zoom meetings, six feet apart, social distancing, outdoor gatherings, decorated cars for the new era of drive-bys, and to-go windows for drinks in the weirdest places.
Our celebrations have been taken away from us once again in history, like when we were ripped away from our villages in Africa and forced to succumb to what I know now as my native land. I refuse to let this happen again, I will not be scared, I refuse to let my light be dimmed. The world will see me! The world will see us! See me as I celebrate and excel as a smart, educated black businesswoman in America, who deserves to celebrate completing her Masters of Business Administration during a global pandemic. But it’s hard to celebrate, it’s hard to smile when you are trying to survive two global pandemics: COVID-19 and racism.
I don’t know when the next time I’ll be walking through a crowd of fine men and women on the dance floor, swaying my hips to the rhythm of the beat, while breathing in thick air that saturates the room. With men trying to touch my lower back, to excuse themselves as they pass, just because we are that close. The same men that may not make it home if they have that one interaction with that one cop, just because they wanted to dance. I don’t know when I’ll be able to dance, when can I embrace the dance floor again with my six-inch heels?
Because now all I can embrace are the images of people dying from COVID, the images of black people dying at the hands of police, images of all walks of life flooding the streets to stand on the right side of history.
Now, all my ears can embrace are the chants in the streets, “Black Lives Matter,” “No justice, no peace.” Day after day, minute after minute.

Celebrations have been replaced with victories of the American people, holding people accountable for their inhumane actions. Holding people to their word, to their actions and decisions, because after all, your word is bond. No more saying one thing in the light and another in the dark, the light is shining on all of us, God is saying to us, no more hiding.
We have all been hiding for the past three months, a stay-at-home order we were all succumbed to by our native land. A stay-at-home order that has made us hide from one another, to only realize we can no longer hide from the injustices that keep occurring to us all.

 Promise has started the school year with a new program called “September Identity Mixers.” Mixers were hosted from Sept. 9 through Sept. 22 on Zoom during common hour.
 Students were encouraged to join the Zoom link, and meet other students who they shared an identity with. Mixers had been specified for Asian, Black, Jewish, Latinx, LGBTQ+, Muslim and Middle Eastern, and Multi-cultural identifying individuals. 
During each mixer, students were guided by Promise coach Anthony White to introduce themselves, and were then informed of upcoming Promise events related to how they identified. After greeting the students and allowing everyone who wanted to join the Zoom conference into the call, White excused himself to give the students room to talk.
Students who joined the events were given the opportunity to meet new people who they may otherwise never have met on campus. 
“I’m a commuter,” undecided freshman Taryn Zdenek said. “I was just looking to connect with people who I have something in common with.” Zdenek went on to add that she ended up making a group chat with the students from the Zoom call and is hopeful about gaining some great friends from this opportunity. 
Sophomore business administration major Rylie Allen also welcomed the event as a chance to get to know other students she could relate to. 
“I’m living on campus in Riggs hall and I was walking in the hallway and saw a sign with all of the identity mixers,” Allen said. “[I] thought to myself I might have to try [attending one].” 
While some students were excited about the event, not everyone felt included. Users on Instagram questioned why there was not a mixer for Catholic/Christian faiths and various European identities. The Promise Instagram page directed those who were concerned about Catholic/Christian identity to the Newman Club, but no comment was made about European identities. 
Zdenek and Allen both expressed interest in participating in more events like these in the future. 
“Without a doubt [I would] do it again,” Allen said.

The Student Body Boutique is a student-run store in Hillwood Commons featuring clothing options for college students. The boutique is handpicked by students who work at the boutique from fashion trading shows such as “Coterie” in New York City. The boutique lets students expose themselves to the latest fashion trends of New York City and beyond. 
Junior fashion merchandising major Hema Chimpidi, a member of the boutique’s executive board and co-vice president of operations, explained members of the boutique try to find trendy and exciting clothes that students want to buy.
“When we go in we try to find affordable in style clothes that college girls would want to spend money on,” Chimpidi said.  
From Sept. 21 through Oct. 5 the boutique is offering an extra 20 percent off their sale section in celebration of the semester starting.     
 In addition to the opening sales, the boutique is looking to get students more involved in their process this semester.
“This year we want to get the students more involved in the store in terms of what they want to see,” Chimpidi said. “We want to hear from them what they would buy and how much they would spend.” 
Freshman fashion major Anna Johnson, the store manager, is excited for what the future holds. 
“Although because of Covid, the Student Body Boutique is limited in what events and activities it can put on, I’m really looking forward to this upcoming semester,” Johnson said. “We have a really hardworking and creative Eboard and an amazing group of employees. I have no doubt in my mind that we have what it takes to bring the Student Body Boutique to the next level, and incorporate a lot of new and exciting merchandise into the store this semester.”
The Student Body Boutique members look forward to seeing students back in their store to see the changes made from last year.

Covid-19 has led to many people being stuck in the house quarantining, playing games, doing at home workouts, online school and a list of other creative activities. Many students  have turned to binge watching Netflix and Hulu as a way to pass time during this pandemic.
 A survey conducted by The Pioneer was sent out to 46 random students to find the top three shows students watched these past months and student’s overall favorites. The survey found that at the beginning of quarantine that the most popular show student watched, as well as it being peoples overall favorite was “Outer Banks.” The show follows a group of teenage kids with two separate groups, the rich and the working class on their many adventures looking for hidden gold. 
Students enjoyed “Outer Banks” due to unique plot points featured within the show. 
“I loved Outer Banks because of the diversity of trials and tribulations that the characters are put through,” Jessica Day, a sophomore psychology major, said. “The overall adventurous plot was also very captivating and kept me drawn in for the entirety of the show.” 
The second most popular show was “Tiger King.” The documentary centers around Joseph Allen Schreibvogel, better known as “Joe Exotic”  who owns an exotic animal park promoting many lions and tigers. The mystery and suspense of the documentary is what drew Sydney Marzano, a junior marketing major, to watch and enjoy it. 
“What I liked about Tiger King is the cliffhanger it left all of its viewers questioning on what happened to Carol Baskins’ husband.” Sydney said. “Whether the producers did this purposefully to get its viewers more invested or they too truly don’t know the real story behind it.”  
The third most popular show was “Dead To Me” a Netflix series that revolves around a hit and run. Maddy Schaefer, a junior adolescence education major, enjoyed the show because of the complex plot. “Dead To Me was a show that not only made your heart race, but also overthink everything going on,” she said.
The other favorites were older TV shows that students rewatched, such as “New Girl” and “Grey’s Anatomy.” 
Bianca Santucci, a graduate student studying exercise science, enjoyed rewatching “New Girl” with the extra time she had in quarantine. 
“New Girl is such a feel good TV show that makes you want to keep watching over and over again,” Santucci said.
