On Wednesday, Apr. 22, the women’s lacrosse team suffered their first loss in over a month to the no. 15 ranked Golden Rams from West Chester University of Pennsylvania. Their 11-10 loss ended a nine game winning streak for the Pioneers.
The Pioneers found themselves down two goals with just under four minutes remaining and turned on the jets. They sliced the deficit in half when senior midfielder Jenna Pierro found the back of the cage and tied the game with just 28 seconds left on a goal from junior defender Honey Roche. With all the momentum seemingly now with the Pioneers, the Golden Rams made one final charge to end the contest before overtime. With three seconds left, junior attacker Hannah Cowan gave her squad the thrilling 11-10 victory.
The Pioneers hit the road again on Saturday, Apr. 25, to face off against no. 7 ranked Stonehill College. The matchup between the two ranked opponents was very even and the end differential was one single goal.
In the first half, both sides traded goals and were tied at one when sophomore attacker Emily Delaney scored, to put LIU up 2-1. Fellow sophomore Cara Douglas followed that goal with one of her own to push the lead to 3-1. The Skyhawks didn’t panic though; as they quickly went to work and got back both goals to pull even at three going into the break.
The Pioneers came out of the half fresh and aggressive and put up two more goals. Pierro netted a goal while Douglas connected for her second of the afternoon, making it 6-4 in favor of the Pioneers. The Skyhawks, however, responded again. The tag team of senior midfielder Lizzie Lane and junior attacker Caitlin Sweeney evened up the game at six in a 71 second span.
The Pioneers took their third lead of the contest on a goal by sophomore attacker Stefani Vagelatos with just over 10 minutes remaining. Lane continued her spectacular day, as she tied the game and eventually netted the game winner over a nine minute span. The Skyhawks ended up taking the hard fought game by a score of 8-7.
The Pioneers concluded their regular season schedule on Sunday, Apr. 26, when they hosted the Queens College Knights at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. The Pioneers made quick work of their opponent, dominating them in every facet of the game and cruising to an 18-1 victory.
LIU Post got three goal performances from sophomore attacker Connor Bird, Pierro, and Delaney and also got a four goal performance from Vagelatos. The Pioneers outshot the Knights by 25, forced 10 more turnovers, and scooped up more ground balls. The Knights’ lone goal came with one second remaining in the contest as they avoided the shutout which would have been the first one of the year for freshman goalie Olivia Kirk.
Head women’s lacrosse coach Meghan McNamara and her squad return to the field on Thursday, Apr. 30, when they are set to host the Lions from Molloy College. Opening face-off is set for 3 p.m.
