All classes at Post were moved to remote instruction for a period of two weeks as of Oct. 15. University President Kimberly Cline sent out a mass email to the Post community stating that “Last weekend, a small number of positive cases were reported as a result of off-campus social gatherings that violated LIU’s Code of Conduct. Additional cases were reported over the past few days by students who were in contact with students at the gatherings. Most of these cases were contact traced back to these isolated events. Some students, who have not tested positive, have been asked to quarantine.”
    There were a number of students who were required to quarantine because they had been in contact with a student who had coronavirus or tested positive themselves. These students were notified about the matter and moved into Suffolk hall to carry out their isolation. 
“I didn’t prepare for quarantine,” senior psychology major Tiana Ono said. “We got the news last minute that we needed to get tested. One of our friends is an RA and she’s the one who told us that we were being put in quarantine that night so to start packing. I didn’t get a call until around 8 to 9 p.m. from someone at the school telling me to get out of the dorms. So I had a few hours to pack and grab food and stuff, everything moved very fast.” 
Similar sentiments were shared by senior sports management major Emily Poole. “We did not get much time to prepare. We were told pretty late about the quarantine in a different building so we just packed essentials quickly and moved in,” Poole said.
    Food is delivered to our door by resident assistants and Promise employees.
“The food is pretty basic but as an athlete it’s hard not being able to control what foods we eat,” Poole said. “We get plenty of food and snacks but the quality and healthiness is not the best but we don’t go without so that’s good.” 
    Both students shared that the quarantine has had a slightly positive effect on their studies. With plenty of free time and no distractions from peers or activities, they have had more time to study and do their school work. Ono has found solace in the contact and regularity that her classes offer. “Class throughout the week has been helpful since it gives me something to do,” she said. “Weekends feel very long. It also sucks that we can’t even go outside for a walk or something.”
Poole had a similar opinion of her time in quarantine. “One good thing about this quarantine is that it has been around midterms so plenty of time to study,” she said.
    Poole expressed the difficulty being in isolation. 
“Quarantine is a pretty big mood killer. As an international student this is not my first time doing this but it is so mentally and physically challenging,” she said. “Not having the comforts of your own room, the heat and wifi have not been working great, the air in the room gets stuffy and not getting any fresh air, a walk or exercise is so tough. My fellow quarentiners and I joke that the first few days go by slowly, a week goes by and you think ok that wasn’t too bad but by day 10 you are climbing the walls.”
Ono agreed that being alone all of the time is difficult. “My mood comes and goes. Sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m angry, and sometimes I want to jump out of my window. I also wish that they would let us go outside for an hour or something. It really sucks being locked up in a room for a long time.”  
Ono and Poole both tested negative for coronavirus, but were required to quarantine due to being in close contact with individuals who tested positive.

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak on campus causing a two week pause for in-person classes, Hillwood Commons changed its hours of operation. The Hillwood Café is open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Subway is open Monday through Thursday from noon to 4 p.m., and Starbucks is open Monday through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and is closed on Saturdays during the pause.
“Do people not drink coffee on Saturdays?” junior psychology major Kaitlyn Evans said. “I understand the need for extra cleaning time due to COVID, but these changes are a bit extreme.”
The change in hours was not announced to the public prior to the two week shut down.
“I wish I knew about the time changes in Hillwood before this all started,” Evans said. “I feel very out of the loop.”
Student and staff members of Hillwood Commons are discounted with the change in hours.
“I have no shifts for the next two weeks and it is going to be difficult paying some of my bills this month,” junior music education major and barista at Starbucks Kaitlyn Sottung said.
Starbucks employees have been put in a situation that Sottung says is unfair.
“They cut our hours after we went online for classes and it really made things difficult for a lot of my coworkers,” she said. “It was unevenly distributed, with some of us working three shifts, and some working none.”
The students who work in Hillwood are facing financial struggles due to this partial shutdown.
“Some of us had to apply for unemployment for the next two weeks, just to make enough money to pay our bills,” Sottung said.
Although the hour changes have been a struggle for employees and students alike, there are some positive aspects to shortening the hours.
“Even though this change was sprung upon us with no warning, I do like the fact that they’re taking the time to really clean Hillwood,” Evans said.
Sottung agrees with Evans.
“I feel safe working in Starbucks this semester because I’m not working in the store with any of my coworkers at all,” she said.
When classes resume in-person on Nov. 2, Hillwood normal hours will return.

The Student Body Boutique (SBB), along with other student-run businesses, had to close their doors for two weeks because of the suspension of in-person classes. The SBB has been vacant since Oct. 15, when the pause was initiated by President Kimberly Cline. All student-run businesses, including The SBB, will not be able to resume their operations until campus is reopened on Nov. 2. 
Although the businesses have been closed, students involved with running The SBB have used this time to create new ideas for the store.
“We went into this school year prepared for all kinds of possibilities,” junior business administration major and chief executive officer of The Student Body Boutique Alina Chen said. “Our executive team has had to work extremely hard to plan exciting events for the LIU community while ensuring that we are following the newly implemented COVID policies.” 
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, The SBB has been successful in maintaining their operations this semester. 
“In our first two weeks of opening, we achieved record sales numbers, reaching nearly $1000,” Chen said. “We have planned out events for every month, as well as goals we would like to meet. Our main focus, always, is our student community.”
The employees of The SBB have enjoyed working for this student-run business during the pandemic. 
“Working at the Boutique is collaborative, exciting, resourceful and fun,” sophomore musical theatre major and employee of The SBB Quinn Doyle said. “There is never a dull moment among this pristine business.”
Still, navigating a two week campus shutdown hasn’t been easy for students involved in running The SBB, and student workers alike. 
“Being online for these two weeks means we don’t get to work because student employees that live off campus aren’t allowed on,” junior musical theatre major and employee of The SBB, Devin Butera said. “Now we have to suffer unemployment for two weeks.”
The store has also been closed to ensure the safety of students on campus during the two week pause.
“Because of the two week quarantine, we had to pause both our in-person and online operations,” Chen said. 
Though the storefront has been closed, and employees haven’t been able to work, The SBB has found different ways to engage with their customer base during the pause.
“Our marketing team consisting of Elizabeth Beall, Emma Robinson, and Anna Serro, have been making our Instagram absolutely bomb,” Chen said. “We hope to interact with our customers there as much as possible as soon as we are approved to continue business our followers will be the first to know.”
During the pause, The SBB marketing team has also been working on launching a website for the business.
With the recent announcement from Cline that classes will resume in-person as of Monday, Nov. 2, The SBB and its employees are looking forward to working the remainder of the semester. 
“Plainly and simply, I cannot wait to get back to work,” said Doyle. “I miss working, my employees and managers, and getting to run the store whenever I was on the clock. I miss making sure that the clothing items, shoes, bags/purses and accessories were all organized tidied up while then maintaining the register.”
The SBB plans to continue collaborations with student-made items being sold in the store after the pause.
“We look forward to resuming our collaboration with Cassie Cerbone and her brand Tailgate Apparel USA, [where] all proceeds will be donated to the American Cancer Society, as well as continuing our potential collaborations with other student creators,” Chen said. 
“The SBB x Tailgate Apparel USA had only launched for two days before the two week quarantine was put into place,” Chen said. “I know that our staff and customers were very excited for this collaboration. I just hope that LIU will deem it safe enough to resume store operations soon so that this collection can fly off the shelves as it was expected to and for all proceeds to be donated to the American Cancer Society before the month is over. Our executive team has had to work extremely hard to plan exciting events for the LIU community while ensuring that we are following the newly implemented COVID policies.”
Even though adapting to the “new normal” has been difficult for student businesses and student workers alike, especially during this two-week shutdown, health and safety has and will continue to remain at the forefront of both of the store’s operations
“At the end of the day, the health and safety of our students and faculty is our first priority, and we will do whatever it takes to ensure that,” Chen said.
When the store reopens, The SBB Instagram (@studentbodyboutique) will be notifying shoppers.

After being shut down for seven months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that movie theaters outside of New York City can reopen starting on Oct. 23. To be able to be allowed to reopen, theaters have several precautions that must be followed to be able to open safely. New York has been holding back on reopening movie theaters despite other states opening around the country. Governor Cuomo stated how movie theaters are riskier, and less essential than other businesses as movie theater owners blamed Cuomo for the long delays. 
Some of the new precautions movie theaters must follow are: theaters can reopen starting at 25 percent capacity with up to 50 people per screen. Theaters that open must be below 2 percent on a 14-day average and must have no cluster zones. An obvious but big rule is that masks will be required at all times except when seated and eating/drinking. While assigned seating will be required in all theaters, though theaters must enforce social distancing between parties at all times. Theaters are ordered to have additional staffing to help control occupancy, traffic, and seating to ensure compliance. Finally, theaters are required to meet enhanced air filtration, ventilation, and purification standards. 
Despite this, some don’t feel it is safe enough to take the risk. “Absolutely not, to me movie theaters always have been ‘dirty’ and if I went to one it was very rare,” senior broadcasting major Anthony Cavarretta said. “Even with all of the added precautions, I do not feel safe going back to movie theaters.”
As the rest of the country slowly started to open with different reopening phases, New York was different as they kept movie theaters out of the fourth and final phase until they had a good plan. When New York was going slowly into phase four of reopening in the end of June, governor Cuomo announced that movie theaters, malls and gyms will all not be cleared to open in phase four as anticipated. “There are some things that don’t fit neatly into a phase that are going to require further study and we’re going through that right now. This includes evaluating what’s going on in other states to avoid going backwards,” Cuomo senior adviser Rich Azzopardi said at the time of the phase four change. After this change theaters had been waiting until now to finally reopen in New York, wanting New York to open to keep their business afloat theaters have been pleading their case. On Oct. 13, to pressure governor Cuomo to reopen theaters in New York, Regal cinemas put a message on their marquee in times square that read “48 states have reopened theaters so far. Why not New York, Gov. Cuomo #ReopenOurCinemasNY.” 
Even with theaters opening up with all the safety precautions some people still are unsure about going back to the movies. Health expert Dr. Chaitanya Mandapakala a pulmonologist and intensive care doctor with St. Elizabeth Healthcare in Kentucky says he loves movies but doesn’t know if it’s a good time yet. “There is no movie that is good enough for me to risk going to a movie theater at this point,” he said. Medical experts around the world are prompting others to follow their advice such as Shelley Dean, a junior theatre major, who wants to appreciate these filmmakers’ work but not until the experts deem it safe. “Personally, until there’s a vaccine or top health officials tell us it’s okay to return back to ‘normal,’ I won’t feel safe going back to the movies. If we can’t even be in school without having to go back online because of COVID-19 cases, it worries me too much to be in another room full of strangers, even with masks and all of these new precautions,” she said. 
Dean looks forward to seeing movies and being able to support filmmakers when it is safe. “Many people are out of a job and can’t create, and I’m very excited for the day I can safely go and see their work with films like ‘Avatar 2’ and the new James Bond movie ‘No Time to Die’ but I guess we’ll have to wait and see when they’ll come out,” she said. Despite all the precautions and safety measures taken some aren’t as ready to go back to movie theaters as others.

On Oct. 15, University President Kimberly Cline announced that the campus would be  pausing in-person instruction for two weeks. This comes after a COVID-19 outbreak on campus  consisting of over 60 cases in the two week span of Oct. 10- Oct. 23. The outbreak was said to be caused by an off-campus gathering consisting of student athletes.  While outbreaks are almost inevitable with a highly contagious virus like COVID-19, it raises the question of whether campus should’ve reopened at all.  
Campus reopenings in the age of Coronavirus are a testy subject. Some politicians and  parents argue that campus closures are far more detrimental than campus reopenings, while some oppose returning to the classroom in a pandemic. Some Post students feel that a mix of in-person and remote learning would work. “I would say that I support a hybrid of in-person and online” sophomore musical theatre major Julian Schenker said. “I know classes like jazz dance, Suzuki and musical theatre aren’t really possible in a dorm room. I don’t think that the school has to open up for every major though.” 
LIU Post looks to safely reopen for in-person instruction on Nov. 1. Classes for second  semester are scheduled to remain in-person beginning on Feb.1. New York state guidelines  allow for in-person classes as long as college campuses are operating safely. New York state  guidelines will close college campuses for two weeks if they have a five percent COVID test  positivity rate or 100 cases. COVID-19 outbreaks have already resulted in some college  closures, such as an outbreak at SUNY Oswego.

Despite a semester full of uncertainty due to the pandemic and social distancing guidelines, the cast and crew of “Roe” have used the mantra “the show must go on” during their rehearsal and filming sessions. The crew adapted what was intended to be a live show into a production that will be a virtual experience.  
“[The show is] similar to a documentary in that it will show part of our rehearsal process as well as the show,” senior stage management major Indigo Coar, who is the stage manager for the production, said. “[The play] focuses on the lives of women involved in the Roe v. Wade case. The narrator of the story is Sarah Weddington, the lawyer who argued the case, though Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) often takes over.”
Roe v. Wade was a Supreme Court case in 1973 that ruled in favor of women’s right to choose to have an abortion without government restriction. The court decided that a woman’s right to an abortion was protected by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court ruling in 1973 many individual states have imposed restrictions on abortion rights. 
Students believe that the play is timely considering the current political climate in the U.S. “With the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, a play about Roe v. Wade couldn’t be more relevant,” said sophomore musical theatre major BrayLynn Willis. “RBG was a champion for women’s rights. She believed that Roe v. Wade did not do enough to establish a woman’s privacy and autonomy. Amy Coney Barrett does not believe in the protection of a woman’s right to choose and she has the potential to overturn Roe v. Wade. ‘Roe’ presents the history of the case and both sides of the abortion argument, which is all immensely important in understanding the implications of Coney Barrett’s confirmation. You will come out of the show with a deeper understanding of what you are fighting for or against. Whether you are excited or scared by Coney Barrett’s views on abortion, you will see yourself in the characters of ‘Roe’.” 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a recent spike in cases on campus, President Kimberley Cline moved Post classes online for two weeks. The cast was worried that their last in-person filming session would be canceled, but the university approved it.
The cast has had a hybrid rehearsal process; working online through Zoom as well as in-person in the Little Theater. 
“[We always] stayed within social distancing guidelines and [we] all wore masks,” Coar said.
Students in “Roe” credit their director Hannah Ryan and the theatre department as a whole for the successful adaptability of the cast and crew. 
“Hannah Ryan is such a professional and our department is so amazing for being able to give us such an artistically fulfilling experience while still abiding by CDC guidelines,” sophomore fine arts major Shannah Dolan said. “I am so proud of our department for taking COVID seriously and making sure that we are all safe. ‘Roe’ will be presented as a live stream of the finished product as well so that there are no risks at all when it comes to viewing.”
The cast is proud of their accomplishment in finishing this production during the pandemic.
“I’m so thankful I got the opportunity to work with such dedicated people on such an important production,” Willis said.
The Instagram account @liuposttheatrecompany will post when the show will be available to view and how to access it.

Fall is here and we are well into October. Students attending Post seem to favor the crisp air, flavorful drinks, heavy sweaters, but most importantly, Halloween movies. Bingeing old movies on movie-streaming sites like Netflix or Hulu has become a past-time for college students. With the stress of midterms, projects and homework, nostalgic Halloween movies are the perfect mid-semester getaway for students.  
Being confined to their dorm room, bedroom, or computer during the semester trying to pass classes, attend clubs, or work can be stressful. Around this time of year, movies are a college student plane ticket to temporary paradise. “It’s the middle of the semester. There’s always work to be done which is why I don’t stray too far from my computer. But that doesn’t stop me from finishing up early so I can catch up on some of my favorite seasonal movies. It’s a cool temporary escape until I realize I have another assignment due,” senior public relations major Vijay Chandool said. A majority of these movies stem from well-known favorites like Tim Burton, Disney, and Cartoon Network.  
Senior fashion merchandising major Steffan Rowe shared his favorite movie along with his favorite time to watch it. ““The Perks of Being A Wallflower” is literally one of my favorite movies of all time. It’s almost habitual, the way I only watch this movie when it’s cold outside, when I can sit in my house under the blankets with a hoodie, warm flavorful drinks, and the food. The movie literally tops everything off. Maybe because it was set to take place in the fall, I just resonate with it so much. Even their outfits, I love them. The trucker jackets, windbreakers, oversized sweaters, platform boots, and the trench coats. Some scenes make me just want to get dressed and take a walk to Starbucks for my generic, but favorite, pumpkin spice latte. I just get this warm feeling when the setting is right, my blanket is on, my hot chocolate sweetens the air of the room, and my heavy blanket laying on top of me is like the cherry on top.”
Some students like to spend the whole day preparing for their Halloween movie night. “When I have days to myself with no class or work, I like to really prepare my space for the time I spend with myself. I even have my own favorite snacks I like to make on days like this. So here goes. I like to make snickerdoodles from scratch and have them with either eggnog or lactaid milk. Then, I’ll run to Walmart and buy the most fall smelling candle I can find, none of that sweet food stuff because I hate it. After I spark up my vanilla spice candle, it’s time for the movie. I love Hocus Pocus. It’s my favorite Halloween movie of all time. The magic of the movie makes me feel like I am seven again, laying around believing in every spell I see,” senior business major Stacey Francis said.
Students at Post take their movie binging seriously, some take it as an initiative to get their homework done early. “Last week I found myself in the library doing work for the next week, so I have extra time to catch up on my movies. It’s funny how a movie can make me get my work done faster but a deadline can’t,” Chandool said. This season of essential movies gives some students the push to dig through their clutter of work in order to have more time for their nostalgic movie binging.  
Francis often likes to get together with her friends for movie nights. “It’s basic I know, but me and my friends actually still get together and have movie night sleepovers. We’ll all bring a pillow, blanket, and favorite drink of choice. We usually watch about three to four movies depending on how early we start. Everybody gets to play their favorite movie of choice while we either do homework or just laugh in each other’s faces for hours. It’s cheesy but it’s our own little tradition,” Francis said.  
A few essential movies to name, according to Stacey and Steffan, are Tim Burton’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Hocus Pocus,” “Hocus Pocus 2,” “The Perks Of Being A Wallflower,” “My Scary Godmother”, “Twitches,” “Twitches Too,” “Haunted Mansion,” Tim Burton’s “The Corpse Bride,” “Coraline,” and “Halloweentown.” Although these may be older titles, they seem to captivate the constant on-the-go college student. 
Virtual movie nights have become a past-time between friends at home, in dorms, or away in their home countries. Zoom and Facetime have replaced the in-person activities to reinforce those feelings of mutual interest for some essential movies. The warm drinks, heavy blankets, and warm candles are still in effect through the virtual movie sessions. “Me and my friends just learned how to use the share screen feature on zoom recently, whenever we have time or a night to ourselves, we try to get cozy and watch some movies together. The pandemic has us spread so far, but our movie sessions keep us tied together,” Rowe said.  
Essential movies for this season is the new late-night hangout amongst college students.  The changing seasons, Halloween time, flavorful drinks, and warm-sweet scents seem to entrance college students into nostalgia or laziness. The option to lay in bed and watch movies on end is a happy escape for students keeping up with homework, exams and projects.

TikTok trends are slowly taking over all forms of social media. What started as a simple photoshoot with white sheets, has become a viral sensation that has gained popularity on Instagram and Tiktok, and even has made its way onto the Post campus.  The “Ghost Photoshoot” TikTok trend consists of a group of people using a white sheet to turn themselves into “ghosts.” They then take photos and videos for TikTok using the song “Oh Klahoma” by Jack Stauber in the background of their videos. 
“I loved the way the ones I was seeing on TikTok were a little spooky but also a little funny, and the idea was so simple but always so well executed,” Kelly Connelly, a sophomore graphic design major who found the trend on TikTok, said.
Junior special education major Payton Napoli saw it first on TikTok as well. “I wanted to partake in this because it seemed like a fun thing to do with my friends,” Napoli said.
Connelly and her friends took a different creative direction than some of the other shoots. 
“We had sunglasses, a baseball cap, and we randomly found a black and white rose that we used in a few pics which I think added a cool element of almost dead romance,” Connelly said.
Others got creative too. “We used scooters, skateboards, and fun glasses in our shoot,” Napoli said.
Others focused on the aspects of the models that would be seen. “We made sure to have a fire shoe game because our feet would be the only thing visible in the photos.” Marzano said. “I am usually one who loves the art of photography and finding different ways to take photos. For the most part, I do not like getting my photo taken where my face is visible, so this trend allowed me to take something I relatively dislike and turn it into something I can enjoy modeling for.”
While Connely went to Kings Park Psychiatric Center, both Napoli and Marzano took their photos on campus. “Specifically the seven arches. Gave a cool eerie vibe,” said Napoli. 
“I think this idea went viral because of the simplicity of it, and also the way anyone’s identity can be hidden simply under a white sheet, and, you could interpret the idea in so many ways and completely customize it to make it your own,” Connelly said. 
Marzano thought the trend became popular simply because it was on TikTok. “I think this trend went viral for the most part because it was conducted on one of the top trending social media platforms. The fad everyone craves is to go “viral” on TikTok so taking trending artistic photos encourages individuals to reach their sought-after goals.”

On Oct. 23 the No Control Improv troupe performed its first show of the semester. The show was inspired by The Armory Theatre’s shows entitled “Shot4Shot,” according to the presidents of No Control, junior acting major Steele Whitney and junior musical theatre major Jordan Horne. The show itself was a read-through of two episodes from the popular television series “The Office.” 
“We were completely inspired by The Armory Theatre’s structure for improv called “Shot4Shot,” Whitney said. “And we knew we wanted to do something scripted with a little touch of improv because that works best on Zoom.” 
With the COVID-19 guidelines provided by the school and New York State, it became clear that the improv troupe would have to completely adjust their style of show to an online format. 
“COVID has given us a wonderful opportunity to do different types of improv that we wouldn’t get to do in person. This new platform has so many different facets for us to explore and we’ve really been taking that to its fullest extent,” Horne said. 
With the theatre industry up in the air with the virus, both Whitney and Horne thought the most important thing that they could do for the community was to continue to bring comedy and lighthearted good times. 
“The thing that still really excites me about No Control is hopefully making people laugh as a community. In a time where theatre mostly can’t happen, figuring out how to still bring people comedy is our top priority,” Whitney said. 
Horne is excited to continue to explore the different ways that improv shows can occur this semester. 
“I loved seeing our troupe showcase their talents in a totally new way. Our troupe has been so adaptable to change and I really loved seeing them shine in this way,” Horne said. 
Students that missed this show can follow No Control’s Instagram, @nocontrolimprov, to stay updated with any upcoming events. 
“There might be more shows like this, maybe not this semester. We have a big idea for our final show that we know we need to start working on now to have it happen,” Whitney said. “The only hints I can give about our big show this semester are long-form and the bachelor. That’s all for now.”
