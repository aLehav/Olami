Rising graduate student Sarah Borer spent her summer interning for a company that helps guide student athletes towards their ideal college. 2aDays is a website that allows college athletes to rate their coaches and facilities, as well as connects athletes to scholarships and blog posts intended to help athletes have a successful college experience.
“I think of 2aDays as a Rate My Professor for athletics, and I think a lot of people could use it to learn more about coaches, campuses and facilities to make their recruitment process easier,” Borer said. 
Borer found the internship listing online, and applied after taking a sports management course at LIU. 
The internship program was rotational; interns spent two weeks doing tasks for digital marketing, editorials, user experiences and public relations for the company. 
Borer felt inspired during her time at 2aDays by the strong female leader behind the company: Keirsten Sires. 
“I think we lack that sometimes in the world of business and sports, so being able to learn from [Sires] and see her drive as the CEO of a company that is very important for athletes was great … As a student athlete, I think [2aDays] would have helped me a lot during recruitment,” Borer said. “I also learned a lot from the other interns. We were always asked to give our feedback during the program.”
Sires came up with the idea for 2aDays in an entrepreneurship class at Skidmore college. 
“We had to come up with an idea for a company to [develop throughout] the whole semester,” she said. “And at the end of the semester, we had to present our idea to business individuals who were alumni or in private equity.”
Sires’ inspiration for the concept of 2aDays was her recruitment for the tennis team, which she realized was not a fit for her. Rather than switching schools to continue tennis, Sires opted to be a walk-on for Skidmore’s soccer team the remainder of her time in school.
After her pitch, many of the individuals listening gave Sires a lot of positive feedback. Sires then graduated from Skidmore and decided to start her own business on the side while she worked a corporate job. 
“I messed up a lot in the beginning. Like, a lot. Trusting people that I should have vetted more. For example, we hired a company to create our website and they ripped us off. I didn’t do too much research, I got a recommendation from one person and took them for their word … I think the biggest thing in the beginning is making a lot of mistakes and although it sounds cliche—but it’s true— just learning from them … It’s not easy [starting a business], you kind of feel like you don’t know what you’re doing. But if you can tell yourself you know what you’re doing, like faking it till you make it. 
Sires emphasizes the importance of a strong team for the success of 2aDays. 
“Having people you trust that also see your vision is also super important … Be fearless and trust your instincts as much as possible … You’re going to have a ton of people telling you no or different [conflicting] advice, so make sure you can back your instincts and opinion up and really make sure you do your research and have a board of advisors.”
2aDays is currently growing their variety of ratings for colleges. Originally, 2aDays was a website where athletes ranked head coaches for teams, but is now expanding to ratings for all athletic staff, campus visits and athletic facilities. Additionally, the site is currently uploading about five new blog articles a day.
“Our goal is to help our audience understand the intricacies and information that is less publicly known about recruiting and being a college athlete [in general],” Sires said. “There’s a lot of stuff that is entailed in that.”
During Borer’s time at LIU as a forward position on the soccer team, the university underwent a merger between the Brooklyn and Post campuses that impacted her college experience.
“When the merge first happened, I was really devastated. Only about seven of my teammates stayed [on the team] and went to Post,” she said. “We signed up to be in the city, not Long Island. At first, there were some tough times where [teammates on the merged teams] did not always agree on certain coaching styles and ways of playing. But over time, we have been able to work together as a team and be friendly.”
With difficulties such as the COVID-19 pandemic and expenses to visit prospective colleges in person, Sires aims for 2aDays to give athletes access to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of many colleges without the student having to visit.
For athletes in college, Sires advises to enjoy every second. 
“It goes by really fast … [Once you graduate] and you realize you’re not going back for preseason or training, it hits you in a different way. So enjoy everything, even the really tough workouts or morning classes.”

After an impressive victory this past Sunday, Sept. 11, fans of the Giants look like they will have plenty of things to root for this season. 
Prior to Sunday’s win, the Giants had a busy offseason, starting with the firing of head coach (HC) Joe Judge on Jan. 6. Judge, who had spent just two seasons at the helm, finished his tenure with the team holding the second-worst win percentage (.303) by a head coach in franchise history. With Judge out of the picture, Giants general manager (GM) David Gettleman announced his retirement days later, leaving the Giants to revamp their entire front office and coaching staff. 
Just two weeks later, New York found their replacements, bringing in two members of the Buffalo Bills’ front office. The first hire was Bills’ assistant GM Joe Schoen, who played a crucial role in helping turn that franchise into one of the perennial contenders in the AFC. 
Shoen’s first task as GM was to acquire a head coach, and he went with someone who he was very familiar with, Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll. Daboll, who is one of many coaches to find success under legendary Head Coach Bill Belichick’s ‘coaching tree,’ has over two decades of coaching experience in the NFL, including his most recent role, which saw him develop quarterback Josh Allen into one of the best players in the entire league. 
Perry Balsamo, a Junior Broadcasting major, was thrilled with the Giants’ new regime.
“I was excited that they were getting a new general manager and head coach,” he said. “I thought [Joe Judge] did some okay things, but I knew they definitely needed some improvement in that area, so I was excited to see some new leadership on that side.”
 With the coaching staff and front office taken care of, the Giants looked on to April’s NFL draft, where they had 11 total draft picks, including two in the top 10. Under the guidance of their new GM and HC, New York would go on to have one of their best draft classes in recent memory, according to analysts from The Washington Post, ESPN and more. This class was highlighted by their first two selections, where they drafted Oregon defensive edge Kayvon Thibodeaux to be a much-needed pass rusher, and followed that up by selecting Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal to bolster one of the worst offensive lines in 2021.  
 After a draft class that was considered successful by many, the New York Giants were relatively quiet in free agency compared to years passed, only making a few notable signings. The G-Men continued to make it a priority to build their offensive line, signing right guard Mark Glowinski and center Jon Feliciano and acquired one of the premier backup quarterbacks in the league in QB Tyrod Taylor. 
When taking the entire offseason into account, Junior Broadcasting major and lifelong Giants fan Brady Campbell was pleased with the moves his team made. 
“For starters, I definitely like the GM and head coach and all those kinds of personnel changes. I think it was time once again to make a change, even after a couple of years. I really like the people they brought in, especially the GM and coach working with the Bills, so they’ve had some success over the last few years,” he said. “I like the draft a lot, especially the first round with Thibodeaux and Neal. I think they’ll be very good. There wasn’t much in the offseason and terms like free agency and stuff, but I think we’re starting to finally turn it around.”
 While the offseason looked like a step in the right direction for the franchise, none of that matters until progress is made on the field. To the delight of Giants fans everywhere, that started this past Sunday, as the Giants went on the road and defeated the Titans 21-20 in thrilling fashion.
Coming into the game as massive underdogs against the number 1 seed in the AFC last year, the Giants started off slow, allowing 13 unanswered points in the first half. They quickly turned it around in the second half, scoring touchdowns on back-to-back drives to tie the game at 13 a piece. 
Following a Titan’s score in the waning minutes of the third quarter, the Giants found themselves trailing by 20-13 with 5:21 left in regulation. With the game on the line, New York turned to their star running back, Saquon Barkley, who accounted for 50 of the team’s 73 yards in what would go on to be their game-winning drive. With only a minute left to play, QB Daniel Jones found tight end Chris Myarick for the one-yard score, putting the Giants in position to force overtime.
However, HC Brian Daboll had other plans, as he made the bold decision to go for two and try to win the game instead of kicking the extra point to tie. This daring move paid off, as Barkley capped off his all-time great performance with a two-yard reception that gave his team the win. 
Out of everything from the Giants’ Week 1 performance, it was that call by Dabool that stood out the most for Balsamo. 
“I really liked the gutsiness in the fourth quarter at the end of the game to go for two. In that situation in years past, I feel like the Giants would be very passive and just kick the extra point for the tie,” Balsamo said. “I like that they are taking the initiative early on in the season, and ultimately it paid off for them.”
The Giants weren’t the only team to pull off an upset, however, as the Steelers, Bears, Browns, Vikings and Seahawks all emerged victorious despite being projected to lose their Week 1 matchups. For Balsamo, the first week of the NFL can only be described in one word. 
“Unpredictability. If you just show up week after week, eventually things will go your way,” he said. “I think especially for the Giants, if they can just stay strong and play good football, anything can happen.”
Campbell couldn’t help but agree, citing that this has been the trend for as long as he remembers.
“The NFL, especially Week 1, seems to be a crazy week. You never really know who’s going to win, I feel like a lot of the good teams we have seen come out a little flat,” Campbell said. “I think a few teams can surprise people, with some being better and some being worse than we thought. It’s gonna be a fun season.”

As the MLB regular season nears the end, Yankees and Mets fans alike are awaiting highly anticipated playoff appearances. 
The Yankees have been on top of the American League (AL) East division for the greater part of the entire season. At the end of June, they held a 56-21 record, which was the best record in baseball by a wide margin. At their peak, they had a 15.5 game lead in the division over the second place Tampa Bay Rays. However, after struggling in the summer months, they sit only a few games up on the Rays, and are now battling to maintain their division lead and the second place finish in the AL, as they sit a few games behind the Houston Astros. 
Junior digital art & design major Anthony Hines has been closely following the trends of the Yankees this season.
“They were on this historic pace, but then of course we started seeing them come back down to earth and play nowhere near the clip they once were,” he said. “As a fan it’s been amazing, yet frustrating.”
Outfielder Aaron Judge has been the spark for the Yankees offense all season long. Judge has been hitting home runs at an absurd pace, and his 57 homers on the season trail only Roger Maris (61 homers in 1961) for the all time single season record for the Yankees and the AL. 
Hines has enjoyed watching Aaron Judge’s historic season.
“It’s been no question that Aaron Judge is trying to make AL history. He could easily have a chance to win the Triple-Crown for hitting, and plays stellar defense. You almost have to wonder if he will be a unanimous MVP,” he said. 
In order to win the Triple Crown a player must lead the league in batting average (BA), home runs (HR), and runs batted in (RBI). Judge currently sits in first place for HRs and RBIs by wide margins, and is third in the AL in BA. 
Aaron Judge is a free agent at the end of this season, and can sign with any MLB team of his choice. In the hopes that Judge resigns with the Yankees, Hines said pay the man.
On the other side of the Whitestone Bridge, heading from the Bronx into Queens, the New York Mets have been having an excellent season. The Mets have been battling the Atlanta Braves all season long for the NL East division, and currently hold the lead. 
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell is happy with the Mets performance as of late.
“I am very pleased with the Mets season thus far. I liked the pieces that they acquired in the offseason and I knew that they had something special brewing,” he said. “It’s gotten a little choppy as of late but I am still confident that they will make a run.”
Campbell is looking forward to how this season will finish, and any milestones that the Mets may achieve.
“September is always exciting as teams make their final push. I expect the NL East to be tight until the end, and I am obviously hoping the Mets come out on top. It’s still really hard to make any predictions though because everything is so close,” he said. “I think we will also see some statistical records broken by the likes of Aaron Judge, Albert Pujols and others.”
Campbell feels there have been many positive moments to take away from the Mets season.
“There have been so many exciting players to watch on the Mets. It’s always a treat to watch Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer pitch,” he said. “Pete Alonso and Francisco Lindor have had successful seasons and are also very fun to watch. Edwin Diaz has been absolutely electric out of the bullpen.”
Mets closer Edwin Diaz has lit a spark with the playing of ‘Narco’ as his walk up song. We have also seen Timmy Trumpet play the song live at Citi Field, making headlines as one of the great mashups of sports and entertainment in today’s industry. 
“I have loved that song since he began using it last year. It really gets the crowd pumped up and I think it has become so popular due to his dominance on the mound as well,” Campbell said. “It’s so cool to see the song and Edwin Diaz get so much recognition this year. It’s also been fun to see Timmy Trumpet be a part of all of the hype around it.”

Adam Rubin, a household name in the sports media world, joins LIU Athletics as the new Associate Athletic Director for Media Relations. 
Rubin has a background in journalism, covering the Mets as a writer for ESPN and the Daily News. Rubin also has experience in college athletics as the head of the communications departments at NYIT and Stonybrook University. 
Rubin looks to bring his experiences from the sports and media world to rebrand LIU’s public relations to match the quality seen at top-tier Division I universities across the country.
Rubin explains why this position is a perfect fit for him. 
“I wanted to be in athletic communications since late in my sports reporting career, and I’m a native Long Islander, so obviously LIU is one of the premier universities on Long Island for athletics,” he said. “It was immediately attractive, and I was familiar with it because when I first got into athletic communications, I had been right down the block at NYIT, which subsequently dropped its athletic program but certainly having been in the same conference with LIU Post I was well acquainted with the school.”
Rubin believes being adaptable to the changing industry is key to success in the world of sports and media.
“Athletic communications has evolved a lot since my days in college. It used to be primarily about pitching stories to the media, doing game notes and writing press releases. Over time, because of social media and just other technology changes, it’s obviously evolved where we reach our audience ourselves as content creators. Someone who came up through a content creation background is well suited for the role, and that’s what I’ve done my whole life. I was a sports reporter for the bulk of my career,” he said. “At the beginning, I was just a print reporter at a newspaper, but everyone in journalism had to evolve over time to get multimedia skills, so I got a lot of photography and video skills, and I think that makes it conducive to the current job of creating content nonstop.”
Rubin feels this level of direct involvement with the teams he works with is more rewarding than a reporter. 
“It’s the big difference between working for an independent media source, like when I worked for the New York Daily News or ESPN, versus when I worked for LIU or other colleges. You’re the in-house content creator, so obviously, you’re going to skew a little more positive. You’re part of it, which is nice compared to when I was covering the Mets in 2015, and they go to the World Series,” he said. “When the baseball team here goes to an NCAA regional, yes, you’re not on the field, but you’re a part of that whole team versus just covering something as an independent media where you’re traveling separately. You just show up to the ballpark to interview people and kind of disappear.”
Rubin reflects on his first spring season with the university and the anticipation of what will come. 
“I got to see the men’s lacrosse team at Saint Joseph’s, one goal loss to a 19th-ranked team. I got to see the baseball team at the tail end of the regular season and then the success in the NEC Tournament and the trip to the regional,” he said. “I was fortunate that it was eventful and high-end stuff right off the bat. It was good that I got a taste of how things have operated at LIU so that now we recalibrate and have a better feeling going into the fall and know what kinds of things we need to adjust to continue to raise the level of our production.”
Rubin feels he has a tremendous relationship with all the student-athletes and coaching staffs he’s worked with and hopes to continue that path. 
“I’m still getting to know everybody, there are 900 plus student-athletes. The team I was always around the most for obvious reasons was the baseball team because they played longer than everybody. I was around them, I got to go on trips with them, and the rapport was great. I think they respected my background in communications, and obviously, having been a baseball reporter for the bulk of my career, I think resonated with them,” he said. “There are a couple of guys on the team who I actually already knew. EJ Exposito was at NYIT with me, and we overlapped a little bit there. Shane Tucker was actually an NYIT signee, I had left by the time he arrived, but I was part of his recruiting trip and showed him what we were doing there, even at a D2 school in terms of our athletic communications products. He remembered, and we reconnected now.”
Most importantly, Rubin’s primary focus is the quality and capture of the athletic broadcasts. 
“Our goals are to be high-end content creators. We want to look as close as we can to a Power Five school’s product, and I think we’re going to get very close even this upcoming year: number one, the game broadcast. I want to do four-plus camera broadcasts across the board, not just for what someone might perceive as a premier sport. Every sport should get treated equally and high-end, whether we wanna stream every tennis match, we’re making plans to stream cross country meets on campus, we want to have high-end broadcasts,” he said. “In terms of social media, we want to have different social media for all our teams, a lot of it photography based, plus micing up players and things like that, and then we want to be really good storytellers. We want to be able to feature our student-athletes both in video form and in print form on the website.”
Lastly, Rubin wants to use his experience to attract the worldwide leader in sports to cover more LIU teams and games.
“One of our big goals too is to ultimately and hopefully it’ll happen sooner than later with some of our sports getting on the ESPN platform for streaming as opposed to exclusively NEC front row,” he said. “So we have a lot of plans. It’s going to be a multi-step process, but I think we demonstrated that we were serious about making progress, and I think people are going to see huge leaps forward this upcoming academic year.”

It was a busy offseason for the LIU Sharks Football program, as there were changes made from top to bottom. The first, and most prominent change came in the head coach position, as the Sharks brought in Alabama assistant Ron Cooper to lead the program. Cooper has over decades of experience coaching at the collegiate level, serving as head coach at the University of Louisville, Alabama A&M and Florida International (to learn more about Coach Cooper, check out our website liuthetide.com).
    Coming into the season, new head coach Ron Cooper made the expectations for his team clear. In an interview with WCWP’s Ryan Boettcher, Cooper detailed how this season is going to look. 
“We’ve got some goals. The goals are really about us, and it’s not about the team we’re playing. We want to play every single week on offense, defense and special teams. We want to play 90 plus percent and play as hard as we can,” he said. “We talked about playing and doing our best, playing hard, fast and aggressive. If we do that, we do it for four quarters, we’ll have a chance to win every single game.” 
    With those goals in mind, the Sharks’ season kicked off on Thursday, Sept. 1, when they traveled to Ohio to face the Toledo Rockets. Despite coming into the game as massive underdogs, they held their own through the first quarter, holding the high-powered Rocket’s offense to just three points. Unfortunately for the Sharks, the one-score game didn’t last for long, as Toledo’s offense got going in the second quarter, finishing the half with a 20-point lead. That trend continued for the rest of the evening, as the Sharks fell to Toledo 37-0.
The LIU defense had tremendous moments in the loss, stopping the Toledo offense 11 out of 15 times on third down, and was highlighted by Victor Nelson Jr.’s first career interception in the third quarter.
    In reference to his standout performance against Toledo, Nelson Jr. attributed it to the improvements he has made throughout his collegiate career.
“I’ve improved tremendously from the very first time I stepped foot on the field. Weight definitely has been my biggest issue. I fluctuate weight very often, and a mentality thing was a very big switch for me. Last year and even the year before, I didn’t get a lot of playing time, and I wasn’t really bought into the program as much,” Nelson Jr. said. “This year, it flipped around on top, a complete 180, and it shows in my gameplay. I want more picks. I got an interception, I want more. I want to lead the NEC in interceptions this year.”
In their home opener this past weekend, the Sharks looked to bounce back against the Villanova Wildcats. LIU’s defense started off hot once again in this matchup, holding the Wildcats to just 3 points in the first quarter. The Sharks’ offense started to get rolling as well, as QB Derek Green connected with WR Zach Rhodes late in the second quarter for the first touchdown of the season, which kept the game close, with the score being 17-7 going into halftime. 
It was a tale of two halves once again for the Sharks, as a fumble by WR Michael Love on the first play of the second half led to a quick score by Villanova. The Wildcats never looked back, scoring 21 unanswered as LIU’s second-half struggles continued. Although the Sharks did show improvement on both sides of the ball, they fell short once again against the number 5 ranked program in the FCS, losing 38-21 in the home opener. 
    One thing that remained consistent throughout the first two games was the outstanding play of safety Victor Nelson Jr., who had a career-high three interceptions along with four tackles in the loss. 
    The back-to-back outstanding performances by Nelson didn’t go unnoticed, as Coach Cooper had nothing but praise for the redshirt sophomore. In an interview with WCWP’s Ryan Branigan, Cooper discussed what he sees in his young star. 
“Vicks’ a very talented guy, and I saw it probably from day two or three in spring practice. Most importantly, he’s a smart kid, smart athlete, understands the scheme, those formations,” he said. “We’ve got several guys that I think can come out and have games like that, and we just got to get it out of them.”
Despite the team’s lack of success in the first two weeks, Nelson Jr. remains confident in the coaching staff.
“Well, [Cooper’s] been around the best. I mean, he is one of the best. You got really seasoned people on this, on this team, on this ball club. I think he can inflame a fire with just his knowledge from an experience from all these other places in Alabama, South Carolina and Arkansas.”
Quarterback Derek Green shared in Nelson Jr.’s optimism about not only the coaches but his fellow teammates as well. 
“I think Coach Cooper’s done a really good job making practice tougher than a game should be, throughout fall camp and then these two weeks after fall camp leading up to this game, he’s put a big emphasis on going fast and playing hard and through the whistle and just finishing every rep,” he said. 
Green believes the success of this team will come down to mindset. 
“I think they’ve done a good job with getting us ready for game-like situations physically, but then mentally just I think it all comes down to believing that we can, because if we go in there thinking we’re gonna get blown out, then I can tell you we’re gonna get blown out,” he said. “I think we’ve all got a pretty good mindset that, you know, we can go in there. We have the athletes, we have the scheme. The coaches have put together a good game plan so that we can go in and compete, and that’s really all we can ask for is to go and compete.”
    The Sharks will look to get their first win of the season as they travel to Akron, Ohio to face the Kent State Golden Flashes on Saturday, Sept. 17 at 12 p.m. You can listen live on 88.1 Fm WCWP.org or The Wave.

On July 22, an article published by sustainability marketing firm Yard on celebrity private jet CO2 emissions placed Taylor Swift at the top of the list with 170 flights taken on her private jet since January with the shortest flight being just 80 minutes amounting to more than 1000 times the yearly emission of the average person. This list was shared on social media sites and sparked online discussion and a subsequent deep-dive into the politics of the acclaimed singer. In addition, her involvement in the film adaptation of the controversial novel “Where the Crawdads Sing” further added fuel to the fire. 
Avid Taylor Swift fans, also known in online communities as “stans,” rushed to the singer’s defense. Urban Dictionary defines a stan as a very overzealous and obsessed fan of a celebrity. This instinct her fans had to immediately defend her without much second thought propelled the discussion to one about online fan culture. 
Students shared their thoughts on being Taylor Swift fans since childhood and the recent online phenomenon of stan culture. 
“I have always listened to many of her top hits when I was little, and I feel like I grew up listening to her songs. Growing up and going through different stages of life I was about to relate or let loose listening to many of her songs, and it felt like I was maturing, so was her music style,” junior art therapy major Renee Haimov said.
“I’ve never considered myself a Taylor Swift “Stan” but I’ve always enjoyed her music enough to consider myself a fan. She’s one of those artists that I’ve grown up with, so it’s hard not to know what’s going on with her. […] “Stanning” has received such a negative connotation recently because of fans going to extremes to defend any behavior of Taylor Swift’s and other popular celebrities, so I like to distance myself from that culture,” said alumni musical theater and communications major Shelley Dean.
Though fans since childhood, students shared their thoughts on the disappointment they feel regarding Swift’s public political involvement or recently, lack thereof.
“It definitely meant a lot to me back in 2018-2020 when she was more active in politics because it seemed like she was trying to connect more to her audience and be a role model to the younger generation. […] Sadly because she silenced her voice and activism since 2020, it seems like maybe she doesn’t care as much anymore,“ Haimov said.
“Taylor Swift poises herself to be some sort of a political powerhouse through her documentary and comments on feminism. She went through a phase of centering women’s rights and people really loved it, they centered her in the conversation and made her a political icon. Earlier this summer when Roe v. Wade was overturned Taylor Swift was silent. It’s just interesting how she is only vocal about politics when it supposedly is to her advantage,” Dean said.
A common disappointment shared by Swift fans is the inconsistency and weak morals she portrays when it comes to important political issues. For example, her involvement in “Where the Crawdads Sing” and “Amsterdam” has given rise to this sentiment as it morally and politically goes against a persona and image she has previously publicly cultivated. 
“It’s interesting how Taylor Swift’s political activism comes and goes. She will be very outspoken on some issues, but then will be used in the “Where The Crawdads Sing” movie, which is based on a book with an inherently racist author. Swift saw an opportunity for cash and quickly took it even though it would hurt communities she supposedly wants to fight for. She has also taken a role in the upcoming film “Amsterdam,” directed and produced by a known serial abuser. It’s disheartening to see that someone who was once such a strong role model to people my age is now a money machine, ” Dean said
Some fans have an expectation that the people whose art they admire with large audiences ought to do more with the stage they have. Students shared their thoughts on this topic.  
“I think as an artist, she holds a lot of power in influencing a large audience. With that, she could definitely use it for the greater good, and not just something that could only benefit her,” Haimov said.
“It’s a tricky thing to ask any big celebrity to be politically outspoken. If they aren’t politicians, that’s not what they signed up for. But for Taylor Swift, she actively chose to be vocal about politics in the past, you can’t open that door and then shut it when you get overwhelmed or don’t care about the cause anymore,” Dean said.
Students that regard or have regarded themselves fans of Swift shared their feelings about how her lackluster and often spineless political involvement affects their relationship as fans of hers.
“After the recent announcement of [her] latest album “Midnights”, I couldn’t even get excited. She’s been in the news too much recently for so many unethical things. If I would stop listening to any other artist for the things she’s done, why would I continue to support her?” said Dean. 
“There is still so much work that needs to go into changing our country for the better and it seemed like she just gave up, which is not a good trait to look up to as a fan,” Haimov said.
After the news about Swift’s CO2 emissions was released, a discussion was held but it quickly fizzled out becoming not much more than an obscure meme. Students shared their disappointment in the fact that Swift wasn’t held more accountable for this.
“I think it is sad, celebrities and people with higher power and wealth should be held accountable for the issues they are causing. It is unfair to not only everyone who is trying to make the world a better place and fix the climate change issue, but also to her fans who may be feeling deceived as their favorite artist who said they cared about this issue, actually shows no sympathy for it and is helping make matters worse,” Haimov said.
“What is shocking though is how quickly it left the news cycle. People quickly forgave her, valuing Folklore over the planet. […] It’s just very interesting how quickly everyone forgets about Taylor Swift’s scandals, but can’t seem to let go of anyone else’s, ” Dean said.
The relatively recent increase of extremely avid fans of celebrities online has brought with it many questions surrounding what it actually means to be a fan. Students shared their thoughts on how big of a role they believe an artist’s political views should be taken into account by fans and the responsibilities artists have to their fans.
“It’s unfair for a super-celebrity like Taylor Swift to change her narrative to follow the cash flow, especially with young impressionable fans,” Dean said.
“I think it is important for fans to hold the artists accountable to an extent. It is very important to hold them accountable as it is a very important topic and as I mentioned before, artists like Taylor Swift have a huge platform and can influence millions of people at once and the silence feels as though she does not care for her fan base,” Haimov said.

Shortly after the new year began, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it would be hiking interest rates to combat soaring inflation. 
The Federal Funds Rate is set by the Federal Reserve, and is used by banks who borrow money from the government. When banks borrow money at a higher rate, they raise rates on loans given to consumers. The year kicked off with a Federal Funds Rate of 0.25 percent. After four consecutive rate hikes, the current rate stands at 2.5 percent.
These rate hikes were intended to slow consumer spending, and cool inflation. Data shows that these rate hikes are not only slowing the growth of the economy, they are actually shrinking the economy. The U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dropped for the first two quarters of 2022, falling 1.4 percent in the first quarter, and 0.9 percent in the second quarter according to bea.gov. 
These consecutive drops in GDP are creating worry that the economy will enter a recession, or that we are already in one. Generally, a recession is defined as two back-to-back quarters of GDP decline.
Inflation still stands high, with the August inflation report reading 8.3 percent year-over-year according to CNBC. This figure is well above the Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate of 2 percent.
This combination of shrinking GDP and rising inflation has led to many Americans feeling the pinch in the cost of living.
Junior John Jay College criminal justice major Danielle Scotto feels that inflation has made it harder to save money.
Scotto is currently living with her boyfriend, and staying at her mom’s house to save money. She and her boyfriend both work, but she explains that things are still not easy due to inflation.
“We both work about 20-25 hours a week and are full time students, but each week when we go to the food store, we can’t seem to get the prices under $100 for simple groceries for two people,” Scotto said.
Scotto says that when you combine the rise in everyday costs such as groceries, with the occasional expenses of things like car repairs, it makes it very hard to save.
“Things like bringing your car in yearly for an oil change can turn into $500 trips really easily. Birthday presents cannot be bought without spending $50. Plus with clothes shopping and other necessities it’s been really rough trying to save,” she added.
Junior Hofstra University education major Jessica Witkiewicz also says that rising prices have impacted her.
“Because of gas prices increasing it has made it more expensive for me to go to school since I am a commuter,” Witkiewicz said.
Both Scotto and Witkiewicz say that they are worried about a recession in the wake of this news.
“I don’t think that our current economic state would be considered a recession, but we could be leaning in that direction. Because of inflation and the increase of prices all over, people may want to stop using or buying certain products. This could lead to higher unemployment rates,” Scotto said.
Witkiewicz believes that we are already in a recession.
“Things cost more but the wages are not keeping up with inflation,” she said.
Students are also thinking about the lasting effects of a recession.
Witkiewicz says that one of her fears is that the middle class will disappear.
“The poor will become poorer and the rich will become richer and the middle class will soon not exist,” she added.
Scotto says that she is worried about unemployment in the wake of a recession. 
“Unemployment worries me. What if the amount of jobs needed shrinks, and there are too little jobs out there for everyone?” she said.
Unemployment was one of the lasting effects of the Great Recession of 2008. Unemployment peaked at 10 percent in 2009, and still stood high at 8.1 percent in 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For context, the current U.S. unemployment rate is 3.5 percent.
The Federal Reserve will be meeting on Sept. 20, and due to surging inflation rates, many are expecting yet another Federal Funds Rate increase.
Students are worried that if a recession drags on, their post-college plans will be disrupted.
“I’m worried about finding a job after college. I’m afraid that I will graduate from college and go into a world with no jobs that need me,” Scotto said.

More than 3.2 billion people currently use smartphones, with the rate growing each year as technology becomes more accessible. During the COVID-19 pandemic, applications like TikTok gained millions of users that have slowly become addicted to their devices. Additionally, self-isolation caused many individuals to rely on video chat and messaging apps like Snapchat in order to stay in touch.
The author of “Dopamine, Smartphones & You: A Battle for Your Time”, Trevor Haynes claims that social media platforms leverage the same neural circuitry used by slot machines and cocaine. The stimuli, both positive and negative, can be overwhelming for users.
Junior film major Lexy Cassell has personal experience with technology addiction.
“It all started when I was 14 years old,” she said. “I didn’t realize it at first, however, I downloaded [Snapchat] and I would draw on my face and use the filters. Eventually, I became addicted. And before you know it, I was competing with my friends like a game to get the highest snap score. At 17 years old, my score hit one million.”
Cassell deleted the application for a few months before deciding to redownload.
“I realized that you have to limit yourself and the Discovery Page and stories. I also limit how many people’s stories I view,” Cassell said.
In order to ground herself, Cassell spends time skateboarding and making music. She makes videos to post on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.
“Personally, I try and use social media as a tool to monetize my life,” she said. “However, it is so wrong. It depends on what you follow, it can have its positives. For example, art and expressing yourself. Social media is the best way to market yourself. But, it’s like you are seeing [reality] through a lens, and you have to remember that. Try to limit yourself or you’ll get sucked in.” 
Sophomore finance major Ailer Thomas is cautious with his phone use, especially when it comes to social media applications.
“I don’t have TikTok … I’ve never found it necessary for anything. I think it’s one of the dumbest things ever,” Thomas said. “I see so many people —especially people that I live with— getting sucked into their phones all the time, and they don’t know how to hold a conversation or make eye contact. I think that’s very bad for society. A whole generation is growing up not knowing how to communicate with each other effectively. And I don’t want to slip into that cycle.”
Thomas believes the internet popularized the term “chronically online” to describe the addiction so many people have to the internet, and how it can have negative effects like a disease. 
“I think it increases rates of anxiety and depression,” Thomas said. “I also feel like it increases rates of lying because I feel like social media is just lying to everybody about everything … Also, I think it shortens everybody’s attention span. People can’t hold a conversation because they need constant feedback.”
The attention span of media consumers has decreased rapidly over the last few years due to the over saturation of media and the ease at which you can access new media and information. Some TikTok users scroll mindlessly through their feed, and when they don’t like a video, they can easily scroll to the next video. The algorithms of these apps are designed to keep the user active.
“The constant flow of stimulation puts us in a state of paralysis. We’re numbly being drawn back and forth by the waves of information, of so-called progress, without reflecting on them,” writer Alice Capelle claimed in “The Anti-Tech Movement is Back.”
And while many can admit to using their devices more often than they would prefer to, the addiction remains. 
“I think [use of technology] becomes ingrained in your routine. People will go to check the time, and then start looking at their notifications. I think people aren’t really conscious even when you’re doing it, because you’re so used to doing it. People feel a sense of responsibility to respond to friends 24/7. I also feel like part of it comes with the fear of missing out,” junior art therapy major Olivia Glusic said.
And as the addiction to checking notifications and staying active online grows, so does the view of reality. 
“People have lost a sense of what is genuine and what is fake … By only showing the highlights [on social media], a lot of people believe that their own lives are boring or subpar because they are not doing all these exciting things. When in reality, the portrayal of someone else’s life is inaccurate to what it actually is. It creates a sense of disconnect between one person and society,” sophomore [major] Nick DeGioia said.
While it’s easy to criticize society for overuse of technology, Glusic thinks it’s important to remember that the discussion is nuanced. 
“We’re really the first generation that has had this impact of technology on us,” she said. “We are not going to understand it completely, but we should be aware of the positive and negative impacts it has on us so that we can use it to benefit our lives, relationships and activities. Learning to limit yourself and touch grass is essential to being a well-rounded person. It might seem funny to call someone chronically online, but it is a real problem that we as individuals need to learn to address for ourselves.”

The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 decision on Roe vs. Wade on Friday, June 24. This court ruling ended an almost 50 year federal right for an individual to have an abortion. 
The Supreme Court ruled in a five-four decision to overturn the previous ruling, with conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett leading the majority, and liberal justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, as well as conservative, and chief justice John Roberts leading the dissent. 
The justices also voted to overturn Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, a case directly related to Roe vs. Wade. This 1992 decision reaffirmed an individual’s right to an abortion as defined in Roe, but allowed states to place more restrictions on the practice. With the court overturning both decisions, there are no federal protections for abortion remaining.
With these rulings, abortion rights will now be left up to the state governments to decide.
Some states have already begun restricting abortion rights. Thirteen states, including Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky and Utah, among others, have passed “trigger laws” in recent years. These laws were written in a way that made abortion illegal almost immediately after Roe vs. Wade was overturned.
People across the country have reacted to the decision throughout the recent months.
“I think it’s very unfair to the women who have lived through the pro-choice era. They have basically been told that they don’t have control over their own bodies and that the government has a higher say over their well being,” junior nutrition and dietetics major Amanda Battista said.
With abortion rights now being up to the states, people have begun to take notice of how the laws vary across the nation. 
New York has taken steps in recent years to expand abortion access. In 2019, then Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed into law the Reproductive Health Act. This bill codified into New York law the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. This bill also gives the right to an abortion after 24 weeks when medically necessary.
The Empire State is currently one of the states with the most abortion access, in direct contrast with Arkansas, the most restrictive state. In Arkansas, people are only permitted to get an abortion if their life is in danger. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or the protection of the pregnant person’s health.
Long Island resident Elayna Furey feels protected under New York law.
“I feel fortunate to live in New York where mine and other women’s right to choose is still protected,” Furey said.
Others agree with Furey regarding New York’s law.
“I think New York has pretty fair reproductive rights and abortion laws compared to other states. I am a firm believer that no government should have control over anyone’s body. Abortion is a personal choice and should always remain that way,” Battista said. 
There has been talk from many politicians in the Democratic Party about codifying Roe vs. Wade into law. Many politicians have included this in their platforms for the 2022 midterm elections. Robert Zimmerman, Democratic candidate for N.Y’s third congressional district, home to LIU Post, has run on this platform. President Biden has stated that he supports codifying the Roe decision into law.
“I personally do not believe that the government will codify Roe vs. Wade into law,” Battista added.
Furey feels more optimistic about the legislative branch protecting abortion rights.
“I believe democrats will make their best effort to codify Roe, but I’m skeptical of it passing. While I’ve seen more lately than I ever have about fighting for women’s rights, I’ve also never seen so many blatantly misogynistic opinions, articles and stories of putting women’s lives in danger at the discretion of men in power,” she said. 
With many states beginning to restrict abortion, or outlaw it entirely, people are beginning to take this into account when deciding where to live. 
“This decision to strip these freedoms from women has absolutely affected my opinion of moving to other states. I used to think of a possible future where my family would retire in North Carolina. At this point, I would never,” Furey added. “I would never move my family from the safety and freedoms we have in New York, provided that we do not become a state in the future that overturns Roe.”
Battista sees abortion rights as important, but says she would also consider other factors when moving.
“As of right now, I do not plan on moving to another state. I am certainly passionate about choice and freedom of the female reproductive system, but there are so many other more pressing matters that I would take into consideration before thinking about abortion rights,” Battista said. “It would really be a plus though if this other state that I possibly move to had a more pro-choice outlook.”
Even with abortion rights being protected in New York, Furey and Battista both feel attacked by this decision.
“No politician, male or female, should tell anyone how to treat their bodies. People believe this is just a matter of ethics, and to a certain degree it is, but it is also another way for society and the government to control women,” Battista said. 
Many have viewed this decision as an attack directly on women’s rights. For Furey, the issue of abortion has been an issue of respect.
“As a woman who would be dead without a medically necessary abortion three years ago, I feel disgusted. Disgusted that had certain factors been different in my life, the fetus and I would both be dead, leaving behind my toddler and my husband to be a single father at 26 years old. As a woman, I feel the fire to fight for change in this country,” she said. “We deserve respect. At the absolute least, we deserve bodily autonomy.”
People across America feel the collective anger, and some believe that this anger will ignite a fight for aborion rights, as well as women’s rights as a whole. 
“This is just a little setback for women because I know that a lot of women won’t go down without a fight,” Battista said.
