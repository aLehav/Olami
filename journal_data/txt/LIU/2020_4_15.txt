As COVID-19 cases accumulate in New York, it’s evident that residents may be disregarding orders to social-distance, making the state an epicenter within the United States. Although the number of new cases in Manhattan has recently plateaued, cases on Long Island still continue to grow.
While the world is consumed by the new coronavirus, new practices such as social-distancing, and new phrases such as “flatten the curve,” have become part of everyday life. New York has over 220,000 confirmed cases as of April 17—more cases than any other country in the world, according to the New York Times.
Within the state of New York, Long Island, along with Westchester and Rockland Counties, are the only areas not flattening their curve. With the amount of confirmed cases increasing daily, Long Island has become the new epicenter of New York state.
Suffolk County’s Department of Information Technology recorded 25,462 confirmed cases  as of April 17 in Suffolk County alone. Cases in Nassau County rocketed above 27,000 on April 16, according to NassauCountyNY.gov. This steady rise in cases can be due to many things, but the freedom that many residents continue to enjoy, can easily be the cause.
Although a stay-at-home order is currently in place, some people have been flocking from the city to head out to their summer homes on eastern Long Island as a way to escape. But a mass influx of people from a heavily populated area raises the risk for smaller communities in a fairly unaffected area.
“I don’t mean to place the blame, but when corona really started to get serious in New York City, the residents there immediately came out here, and then did not self quarantine,” said Shelter Island resident Julia Labrozzi, who is a junior adolescent Spanish education major at SUNY Geneseo. “I really think that this is a big reason why Long Island has taken such a big hit.” 
With the influx of city residents to their vacation homes, Suffolk’s numbers are sure to rise.
“I would do the same thing to protect my family,” Shelter Island resident Olivia Yeaman, a junior social work major, said. “However, coming out here and demanding services, buying up food, and not properly following quarantine or coming here when they know they are already sick is not okay.”
What some escaping the city may not consider is the lack of resources on Long Island. In Suffolk County specifically, medical facilities in towns with smaller populations are only prepared to take in a few patients, and they lack the materials and equipment needed to fight this virus in comparison to hospitals elsewhere.
“I think there are a lot of poor towns on Long Island that people aren’t aware of that have people living on top of each other and people that aren’t healthy. Also, a lot of older people live on Long Island,” Kristen Morgan, a senior film major, said.
If medical facilities in smaller towns are only prepared to handle the regular population, they likely will lack the man-power and equipment needed to care for vacationers too. Supplies such as daily essentials and groceries are limited as is, especially during the months leading up to summer break when the population is expected to grow, leaving some east-end natives a bit on edge.
Long Island is an unexpected epicenter for this virus, but Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said the increased number of testing sites may have played a large role in the spike of positive cases, according to Newsday. But Southold, an eastern Long Island town, reported a rate of 6.4 infections per thousand residents, and that’s greater than New York City’s rate of 5.2 cases per thousand residents.
“A new trend is taking place that puts our local residents at even further risk—people seeking refuge from the metropolitan areas,” Southold Town Supervisor Russell said in a statement.
While everyone is expected to follow stay-at-home orders, the number of positive cases continue to increase, and some of those who have left the city early to move into their summer homes, are avoiding mandated regulations, according to Newsday.
“I think social distancing is the best thing we can probably do right now and a lot of people aren’t listening to that precaution,” Morgan said.

Some states across the country, which anticipated an end to social-distancing in early April, extended their stay-at-home orders to further flatten their curve of cases and minimize the spread of the new coronavirus.
New York was set to end its stay-at-home order April 15; however, due to the spike in new cases and deaths, the order was extended to last until April 29. This continues with the closure of non-essential businesses and fines of $500 to $1000 for not following social-distancing rules.
Heather Felix, senior public relations major, said, “As much as it sucks to stay in quarantine, I think it is important for states to extend stay at home orders until the CDC says otherwise. If we are released too early, it could have catastrophic effects. Always better to be safe than sorry.”
Illinois’ stay-at-home order was put in place on March 21, and was supposed to end April 7; but, on March 31, Governor Jay Robert Pritzker extended the order until April 30. This includes suspension of face-to-face learning, and the continuation of the state’s disaster proclamation, which declares all of Illinois a disaster area.
“The extension of stay-at-home orders is frustrating but necessary to stop the spread,” Alexander Price, sophomore business major, said.
Massachusetts issued a stay-at-home order that was set to expire on April 7, but on March 31, Governor Charlie Baker extended it to May 4. Similarly, Pennsylvania enacted a stay-at-home order from March 23 through April 6 for counties with a high number of cases. On April 30, the expiration of this order was pushed to April 30 and placed the whole state on a stay-at-home order.
“I feel like it is in the best interest of everyone’s safety but it’s negatively affecting the economy and people’s mental health,” Alyssa Cappello, senior psychology major, said.
Colorado announced an extension to its stay-at-home order on April 6 through April 26. According to Governor Jared Polis, the extension is the only way “to avoid a catastrophic loss of life.” Similarly, Indiana’s stay-at-home order was initially set to expire on April 3; however, on April 6, the order was pushed back to April 20. As the number of coronavirus cases increased, on March 30, Louisiana also moved to extend its stay-at-home order from April 13 to April 30.
Isabella Ceravolo, junior psychology major, believes extending mitigation is a wise decision.
“I think that extending home orders, although it’s tough on everyone, is something we just all need to get through and stick to if they’re necessary. We all must be safe until we can go back to our normal lives,” she said.
Ohio’s mandate was initially scheduled to end on April 6 as well, but now will end on May 1. Georgia also extended its shelter-in-place expiration from April 13 to April 30, and Governor Mike DeWine extended the state’s Public State of Emergency until May 13.
Joseph Campisi, sophomore biology major, said extending the stay at home order is necessary but he thinks the government should be doing more to enforce social-distancing.
“People continue to not respect the orders, and are thus, risking the continued spread of the virus,” he said.

Love Beyond Walls is a movement becoming more popular by the day. Terence Lester, the organization’s founder, started a new campaign in which he is placing portable sinks around Atlanta so the homeless can also fight the COVID-19 virus.
Lester and his organization were concerned for those who have limited or zero access to items that would protect them during Atlanta’s shutdown. Their solution to the problem—self-contained hand washing stations that can be filled with soap for those experiencing homelessness.
“Every single day for the last eight days, we have thought of ways to get water to people living on the streets during this crisis, and we found a way to build and assemble portable handwashing stations that hold up to 10 gallons of water,” the foundation wrote in an Instagram post on March 18.
NataleeAnn Taylor, a sophomore acting major, mentioned how fortunate humans are, and was fascinated that people are generous enough with their time to develop a technology such as portable sinks for the homeless.
“It makes a real difference to bring supplies to the homeless in the Atlanta downtown area,” she said. “It’s awesome how these sinks have both soap and water and are portable.”
Originating in Atlanta, Love Beyond Walls is a non-profit organization that Lester established with his wife Cecilia Lester in 2013. They are committed to sharing the stories of the voiceless by focusing on exposing their realities to increase awareness.
Terence Lester was meeting with a friend one day who brought up the question “Why don’t you become homeless?” Terence Lester thought about this question and after discussing the idea with his wife, he took on the challenge and made himself homeless for a month. His wife took him downtown where he found a place under a bridge with a couple of other people. He explained that after a while, he got used to people just passing by, according to a video on Lester’s website.
Three months after the Lester’s started their organization, they opened up a building that is recognized by the federal government. The couple calls this building the Love Center where people from all around Atlanta walk miles to visit.
People, many of them homeless, stop by the center for many reasons. Some come to get a complete, on-the-spot makeover inside the Mobile Makeover Bus. People can also get haircuts and new clothes for different events such as interviews and church.
Families with the need for necessities such as groceries can do so at the center, along with washing their clothes if they can’t afford a laundromat. There are even opportunities to get an education. Some come to attend an educational workshop so they can learn skill sets and have a better chance at finding employment.
One of the most important reasons that people visit is to get a fulfillment of community, opportunity and hope. Some people show up simply because they have no other place to go. The Lester’s and all of the volunteers are committed to serve them exactly as they are, filled with love.
“Love Beyond Walls has helped me tremendously. They have helped me with clothing and a place to stay. They have been a major part of me transitioning out of homelessness,” Mark Moore, an Atlanta citizen, said.
Terence Lester’s real dream is to obtain a warehouse where he can grow a larger or second Love Center, according to his website. He explains how this initiative would extend to all aspects of poverty: housing, facials, an employment center and a medical clinic are just a few examples. He wishes for a warehouse because it would be a large place where the community can complete a bunch of tasks in a short period of time. He said he wants to take love into places where love doesn’t exist.
For now, Love Beyond Walls has sinks set up in Atlanta only, but their goal is to raise enough money over the next two to three months to expand. They are actively working on partnering with cities across the United States to “plant” sinks in high-trafficked areas.
“This sheds the biggest glance of light on such a tough time,” Tori Gaffey, a sophomore musical theatre major, said. She believes that it is important to help those who are less fortunate in a time of crisis because they need it the most. She said that often, it’s the homeless that are forgotten.

Post has extended the deadline to opt for a pass or fail grade to April 15 for students whose grades may have been affected by the school’s decision to move classes online due to COVID-19.
Students can take a maximum of two elective courses on the pass or fail basis per academic year. Core courses are not eligible for this option unless the department chair or program director gives the student written permission.
Students who opt to take any pass or fail courses are ineligible to be on the dean’s or honor’s list for that semester, according to the LIU Post Pass/Fail (P/F) Option policy.
In order to pass on the pass or fail grading scale, the student must earn a “D” or better in the course.
Students in the early childhood and childhood education degree programs are not allowed to take any courses in their academic concentration as a pass or fail course.
Randy Bird, senior vice president for academic affairs, sent out an email on April 3 that stated: “LIU Academic Affairs is not recommending students exercise Pass/Fail as it could affect future graduate program applications, and/or job positions/employers.”
Fourteen percent of students who participated in a poll on the Instagram account @liu_postpioneer said that they will opt to complete at least one eligible course with the pass or fail option.
Andrew Press, sophomore health science major, is planning to use this option for the first time this semester.
“By using the pass or fail option, I will be maximizing my GPA,” Press said. “I’m sure many other students across campus will benefit from this option due to the sudden changes in classes due to the coronavirus.”
Press is using the pass or fail option for his honors philosophy class.
“Since it is an elective, I am going to use the pass/fail option [rather] than to risk getting a lower grade,” he said. “I take pride in my GPA and I’m using this option to keep it up in this time of uncertainty.”
Press believes that online classes have dramatically changed the syllabi of many courses across campus.
“In many cases, professors have begun to expect more from their students to make up for the lack of real face-to-face lectures,” he said. “The pass/fail option has the ability to help students with varying circumstances. It is definitely a good look for LIU to offer this as many other schools across the northeast have followed suit in offering this to students.”
BrayLynn Willis, a freshman musical theatre major, agreed with Press.
“I think that the pass or fail option is a great option for students that might not have the same access to materials for courses during this time,” she said. “I can imagine it makes classes more manageable for students who struggle to work from home or are going through a hard time right now.”
Any questions about the pass or fail option should be sent to Beth Wilkow at registrar@liu.edu.

On Tuesday, April 7, Campus Speaks held a Zoom event for LGBTQ students and allies called “Queering in Quarantine: Support and Allyship for LGBTQ community.”
Tara Fuller, the host of the event, came up with the idea when the stay-at-home orders started. 
“I thought how can I help and contribute, thinking about my experience and the coming out process, I wanted to help and be there for anyone who has to go home and face where some damage might have been done or people who don’t accept you,” she said.  
Fuller wanted to create a virtual community to help LGBTQ students who may be going through a tough time, so she reached out to Campus Speaks, a service that helps connect guest lecturers to college campuses.
“I really asked myself what do LGBTQ folks need to hear right now  so I just started making a list of things,” she said.
The event started with an open chat feature where everyone was invited to introduce themselves and say where they are from and what their preferred pronouns are. Participants from around the country participated, including people from Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington and Connecticut. 
The livestream started with Fuller introducing herself and asking the audience, “What do LGBTQ individuals need to hear right now?” She opened the question up via menti.com and shared the results with the livestream. Responses such as family, community support, confidence and connection were the most popular. 
The event was broken down into four sections: “You Matter,” “You’re Deserving,” “You Belong,” and “Trust Yourself.” Each section was created as a wellness approach to LGBTQ allyship and inclusion. 
“Those sections were just things people might need to hear right now.” Fuller said. 
In the first section, “You Matter,” Fuller asked the group to look inward and reflect on how they are feeling. She also encouraged creativity and said, “Everyone has creativity, it is within us but somewhere it gets lost, we just have to find it again.” 
Fuller also spoke on the importance of learning LGBTQ history, as well as unlearning the idea of heteronormativity—the belief that heterosexual romance and sexual attraction is the only normal sexual orientation. She closed this section speaking on educating or sharing the history of each attendee’s community with friends and family or even a pet. 
The second section, “You’re Deserving,” revolved around the idea of how LGBTQ members receive the space and time that people give them and how they can speak up. 
“We are not here to make others comfortable,” Fuller said, and encouraged the audience to raise awareness, even if it’s in small ways like wearing a rainbow sticker. 
“It still gives people more of an option to support you,” she said. 
While Fuller understood that not everyone will be accepting, she reminded community members of an affirmation to remember, “I am deserving of your respect and dignity.” 
In the third section, “You Belong,” Fuller spoke on representation of all LGBTQ identities in the media, by politicians and athletes, and regular acquaintances. She opened up the discussion and invited all the stream members to a shared google document where they could add art forms that have representation of the LGBTQ community, such as tv shows and books. She reminded everyone of the importance of community and allies, and encouraged mentorship with someone in the community that they may look up to. 
The last section, “Trust Yourself,” came from a wellness perspective and asked members how they can be the most well within themselves and to be true to who they are. She stressed the importance of understanding what a person wants and who they want to matter to. She wrapped this section up by asking the audience, “What does allyship mean to you?” The most popular responses being support, safety, pride, unity, and feeling normal. 
Fuller expressed the importance of allies and said the best way to support your LGBTQ friend is to just check in and be there. Sending helpful quotes, funny video clips, or anything else they might enjoy could help them during a difficult time, but warned against possibly being overbearing.
At the end of the session, Fuller shared support tools in which she wrote some affirmations for everyone to meditate, journal and reflect, reminding everyone they have support.

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, student extra-curricular activities continue to be canceled or changed to a virtual format. A major event held on campus that was impacted is Relay For Life. This is the first time in 25 years that Relay For Life will not occur on campus. This year the event will be held virtually on April 16. 
Since May 1985, Relay For Life has been an important part of campus. Relay For Life is a community-based fundraising event in honor of the American Cancer Society. It is usually held right outside of the Pratt Recreation Center in April or May when the weather gets nicer. Most campus clubs and organizations make teams in an effort to raise money and show up during the night, as well as students, staff, and family. 
Those involved with the event still hope to raise awareness and show their support for the cause so they are still hopeful that the turnout this year will be a decently sized one. 
“We still have a lot of prizes and games and ways to get people involved over video, along with guest speakers and awards,” said Ashely Herkommer, a digital art and design major, and a social media representative for Relay For Life. 
Herkommer said that having the event virtually is definitely a challenge that they were not expecting to face, but so much time and effort was already put in so they didn’t want to let everyone down.
“I think it is difficult to spread awareness about the event with so much else going on in the world,” Herkommer said. “We’re not going to divert the importance of COVID-19 so Relay For Life became less of a fundraising event and more of an event to gather people together and a fun way to pass the time during quarantine.” 
Herkommer and the whole Relay For Life team would like to thank Anthony White who is in charge of organizing the event. 
“He has been working his butt off making sure that all of this is possible under the circumstances,”  Herkommer said. “He is amazing and deserves a lot of credit.”

During the current stay-at-home orders most of the country is spending their time indoors. Many students have found this time to be useful for discovering new hobbies or exploring further into current hobbies. 
Beth Hillman, a junior nursing major, has devoted some of her time to learning new interests in addition to her current ones. 
“Since I’ve had time to learn some guitar, I started learning some songs that I’ve loved singing and always wanted to add instrumental to, and now I’ve learned to do that,” she said. “I am continuing learning new songs; especially worship songs which I can connect with and find peace in.” 
Hillman also said that this time has helped her further connect to what’s important to her. 
“Another thing [social-distancing] has done is allowed me to connect more with my religion, which music has helped me do,” she said.
Some students have found that the time spent by themselves has led them into discovering more about themselves. 
Michael Decristo, a senior photography major, said, “I’ve been spending a lot of time with myself, as everyone should, and as a photographer, [I] see it as a good time to delve into self portraits. It’s been a fun way to explore identity and self during this time of kind of forced inflection.”
Other students have utilized this time, to fine tune their already existing skills and passions, rather than learning a new hobby.  
“I didn’t pick up any new interests, but the [stay-at-home order] has given me time to sharpen my drumming and guitar skills,” Lewis Eldridge, a senior film major, said. “I’m also a huge car enthusiast, so I have more time to watch car videos and learn more about specific cars.”

The Promise Office hosted a virtual event to discuss leadership skills. The event had two seatings on Zoom, Tuesday, March 31 and Friday, April 3, and was led by student Daylen Orlick. Five participants attended the event which was open to students on the Post and Brooklyn campus’. 
After taking the time to get to know each student in attendance, Orlick sent all the students a personality quiz on high5test.com. 
High5test.com is a personality test site where it shows your top five strengths after taking a short quiz. After taking the test, the website generates where it believes the taker’s career path will land them in the future. 
After taking the test, each of the students explained the results they received, and Orlick assisted them by explaining how to use these personality strength results to develop leadership strengths. He also explained how most of the results usually connect to a student’s major and what they like to do.
More information about these sites and help with leadership skills can be found in the Promise Office on the third floor of Hillwood Commons, by phone at (516)299-3737, or by email at LIUPromise@liu.edu.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, people on all social media platforms have been participating in social media challenges as a way to keep themselves entertained. These challenges consist of people who took part in a task, posted a video of themselves doing it, and tagged other people to do the same thing to keep the chain going. 
Amanda Petrillo, a sophomore nursing major, said that she has only participated in one challenge which also happens to be her favorite one. This dare is called the “see a strike, send a strike” challenge. This challenge is when people post a video of themselves bowling and making a strike. 
Kaela Steinbrenner, a sophomore musical theatre major, expressed that she had taken part in multiple challenges and her favorite ones were the ones that take place on snapchat, specifically the “yolo questions” challenge. This challenge is when people post a picture with a link where you can swipe up and leave that person an honest, genuine message. These messages are left anonymously. 
Steinbrenner’s least favorite is the “until tomorrow” challenge. This challenge asks users to find an embarrassing or crazy picture of themselves and post it on their Instagram page, leaving it there for 24 hours. Once the 24 hours is up, the photo(s) must be deleted.
Petrillo explained that she probably increased her time on social media by two hours per day but felt like social media was starting to frighten her. Seeing people post about their experience with the virus made her worry for her family, friends, and herself.
Petrillo clearly said that the majority of people that she follows have made multiple posts for these challenges but it’s sometimes inconvenient by how much she sees them. 
“I do feel like they are a way for people to interact with each other and try to remain positive during these times,” Petrillo said. She also said that for some people, these challenges may be a distraction from everything that is currently going on. 
“I think the challenges are fun; it’s a nice way to be able to express more of the goofier, more genuine parts of ourselves on the internet where we typically spend our time crafting a specific image of ourselves,” Steinbrenner said. She also thinks that the challenges are a nice way to share activities with people who are miles apart from each other.

With all professional sports postponed, one industry is powering through the world’s uncertain time and making the best of it: professional wrestling.
On April 5 and 6, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) put on “WrestleMania,” their biggest show of the year, in an empty training facility with no audience for the first time ever. The event was pre-recorded and cost fans 60 dollars on pay-per-view. In addition, WWE’s competition All Elite Wrestling (AEW) has aired free weekly live shows every Wednesday from their empty training facility.
World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has maintained a prominent position in pop culture since the late 1980’s because the company travels the world to broadcast its shows. However, with restrictions from COVID-19 stopping mass gatherings of more than 250 people, as well as travel restrictions across the world, the company, as well as AEW, have not been able to go on tour.
WWE continues to run all of their shows including “WrestleMania” from training facilities in Florida. Both companies have allowed international performers, and performers with underlying health conditions, to return home without facing penalty. Nonessential staff members have been sent home as well.
Matt Weinstein, host of the wrestling podcast “The Phenomenal Forum” is a dedicated fan who supports the companies putting on their shows despite the backlash from the local government. Some fans including Daniel Casazza, junior history major, are not as supportive of the sentiment.
“I feel like it is unjust and wrong that a multi-million-dollar company is running shows and putting their performers’ lives at risk just to keep shows running,” Casazza said.
“I feel like the companies probably shouldn’t be running strictly for the safety of their employees; however, they have made it clear that anyone who is uncomfortable working won’t be penalized,” Weinstein said. “I’ve enjoyed the empty arena shows as they have freshened up WWE’s weekly programing a bit. I thought they handled WrestleMania very well, the stuff in the ring was solid, and the cinematic matches opens up a whole new door for professional wrestling. I think that AEW has knocked it out of the park on all of their no-fan shows so far.”
Even though this was the first time WWE hosted “WrestleMania” with no live fans, viewers at home were still happy to watch the program, including Nick Paniagua, junior broadcasting major.
“I think that the companies have done an outstanding job keeping their shows going while they don’t have any fans in the venue. I believe it’s just something that people can watch to not only entertain them but also to help them get their mind off of what’s going on just for a little bit of their days,” Paniagua said.
With all the uncertainty in the world there is still a place for some body slams and fun in the world of wrestling.

Super Bowl LIV kicked off with singer Demi Lovato singing the national anthem on Sunday, Feb. 2.
Lovato wore all-white attire for the performance, and one student who watched the performance commented on the outfit. “I thought she looked great and very confident,” they said.
In 2010, Lovato took to social media and tweeted her desire to sing the national anthem during the annual Super Bowl game. She posted on her Instagram captioning the post, “Dreams really do come true y’all.”
Demi Lovato turned that dream into a reality when she belted “The Star-Spangled Banner” before the San Francisco 49ers faced off against the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LIV in Florida. Ryan Miller, Post alum, said that it was a “great” and “thrilling” performance that left him with chills due to how well the artist performed.
Some students were thrilled with her performance, especially considering that this was a comeback from her drug overdose in 2018. Fans enjoyed hearing Lovato sing, and she received a great amount of positive feedback on social media. Alyssa Curzio (19), posted several Instagram stories regarding Lovato’s opening performance.
Lovato announced the performance in January, only days after she revealed that she would perform at the 2020 Grammy Awards in an Instagram post that read “I told you the next time you’d hear from me I’d be singing.”
Her first major comeback was her performance of her song “Anyone” at the Grammys. Lovato was so overwhelmed that she had to restart the song at one point.
Jennifer Lopez and Shakira performed during halftime in the Super Bowl game. The two artists got positive feedback all on several social media platforms from fans who thought they were both great picks for the game’s halftime.
Overall, some students considered Demi Lovato’s performance at the Super Bowl LIV to be an outstanding comeback. Lovato has sung the National Anthem multiple times, but this was her first time singing it at this event. Because of her recent reemergence, some fans believe Lovato wants to make all good changes in her life for herself, her family, and her fans.

After two years of keeping fans waiting for new music, Halsey, otherwise known as Ashley Frangipane, dropped her third and latest studio album, “Manic,” on Jan. 17. Halsey performs music in the pop, electropop, synth-pop, art pop, alternative pop, R&B, and indie pop styles.
“She’s basically the new Avril Lavigne of this decade,” Ryan Miller, Post alum, said. “I don’t usually listen to female artists, yet alone pop music, but Halsey did a great job this time.”
Prior to the album’s full release, Halsey dropped four singles. “Without Me” became her first Billboard Hot 100 chart topper, detailing a toxic, draining relationship. “Nightmare” is an angsty girl anthem.
“Graveyard” paints a picture of “being in love with someone who is in a bad place and loving them so much that their lover doesn’t realize that they’re going to that bad place with them,” as Halsey explained during a seven-hour YouTube live stream. “Clementine” was released on Halsey’s birthday, along with a touching video of Halsey and one of her younger brothers Sevian Frangipane dancing through a dimly lit aquarium.
Each and every one of her 16 songs in her latest album all have deep meaning for the artist and can be relatable to listeners. “Manic” was written in Halsey’s first-person perspective. It flips lonely self-awareness into strength. Some of its most captivating bits are overpowered by the dullness of modern pop.
Student Michele Strocchia’s favorite song on the album is “You Should be Sad.” “The song starts with Halsey saying she wants to get a few things off her chest. She isn’t the type of person to live life with resentment, and I found myself relating to that message portrayed in this song,” Strocchia said.
Photographs of Halsey show how deeply she cares for her music. Her fame is constantly growing. One student who preferred not to be named does not listen to Halsey or her genre of music, but they commented on why the artist might be growing in popularity. “I guess that people are just able to relate to her on a whole new level that a lot of other pop artists don’t have in common with her,” they said.

Major League Baseball (MLB) is one of the sports organizations affected by the new coronavirus outbreak. Unlike many other professional sports leagues, the MLB has yet to begin their season, and no one knows if there will be a season at all at. The MLB and Major League Baseball Players Association(MLBPA) negotiated a deal on Tuesday, March 31, for different season scenarios.
One option is a shortened season, in which players will be paid the portion of their salary for the percentage of games that are played. Meaning, if the season is cut down in half from 162 games to 81, all players will get half of their original salary. If the entire season is canceled, the MLB and all 30 team owners will put together a lump sum in advance of $170 million, which will be divided up and disbursed accordingly by the MLBPA.
Players will also have one year of service time removed on their contract no matter what. Players with one year left on their contract will automatically become free agents, and players who have multiple years left, will have their service time count for this season. In other words, players do not have to wait an additional year to either become a free agent or reach the next level of arbitration.
Ryan Kraut, a senior broadcasting major, agrees with the way the MLB is handing players monetary compensation, but disagrees with their stance regarding service time.
“The one thing I don’t agree with is if the season is canceled, everyone still receives a year of service time,” Kraut said. “Players shouldn’t receive a year of service time if they didn’t play.”
The group hit the hardest by the new agreement will be prospects looking for a chance to play professional baseball. The MLB Draft, which typically holds 40 rounds, will only carry five rounds this year. This will lead to over a thousand high school and college-level athletes missing out on the chance to be signed by an MLB team.
It was announced on Tuesday, April 7, that the MLB was working on a deal with the MLBPA and federal health officials including the CDC to get baseball back as early as May.The plan would include all 30 teams flying out to Phoenix, Arizona, and using the facilities there to play the entire season, or as long as needed. These facilities include the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Chase field, as well as all the spring training stadiums, and possibly college fields if necessary.
If this proposal is accepted by all parties, there will be many stipulations in place to ensure everyone’s safety and health. To minimize contact as much as possible, an electronic strike zone will be implemented, so umpires that may be older can be six feet behind the batter and catcher. The games will be played without fans in the crowd, and players will be seated in the stands six feet apart, rather than together in the dugout, and mound visits will not be allowed mid-game.
The most crucial element of the plan is that players will not be able to see their families, or go home through the duration of the Phoenix play. Players will only be allowed to go from their respective hotels to the fields to limit contact with anyone outside their organizations.
While the MLB and every team will be losing so much revenue from loss of ticket sales, various news outlets have brought up the possibility that they will gain revenue from extra TV deals. Currently in place, the MLB has national game coverage partnerships with ESPN and Fox, but several sports media sources say it is plausible that other major networks will be eager to display Major League Baseball games, as it will be the only sport broadcasted live.
Kraut is also worried about the broadcasting of the games from different time zones across the country, as well as how some teams will make up the revenue from playing at neutral sites.
“Some negatives are that it could impact TV ratings for those watching on the east coast,” Kraut said. “All the teams would take a hit financially due to no ticket, concession or merchandise sales.”
Kevin DeLeonardo, junior business administration major, is very optimistic about the future of baseball if the proposal is implemented.
“They would probably broadcast more games than they usually do, so that would be good for baseball fans like me that normally could only watch two or three different games every day,” DeLeonardo said. “If this plan does get implemented, baseball would most likely be the first sport to return, so it would provide an extra incentive for new fans to watch and it would bring more attention to baseball.”
A higher risk of player injuries is one scenario DeLeonardo believes could become a possibility.
“The biggest negative would be for the pitchers because they won’t have the normal warmup period they usually have to prepare for the season,” DeLeonardo said. “That could lead to more injuries if they push too hard too fast.”

The Baseball team’s 2020 season was cut short due to the new coronavirus. They went 5-7 in non-conference action before the NCAA announced all remaining winter and spring sports were canceled on Thursday, March 12.
The team’s first conference game was set to be against Wagner on Friday, March 20. The Sharks struggled early on in the season, losing six of their first eight games, including three out of four from Nicholls State, but they went on to sweep St.Peter’s University in their first home series.
NCAA athletes took a devastating hit due to the cancellation, particularly seniors who were left to decide what their future holds. The NCAA rightfully granted an extra year of eligibility to all spring athletes, but many on the baseball team are unsure about the logistics of their situation around this extra year.
Jackson Svete is a starting pitcher who played for the Blackbirds in the last three seasons. Svete believed there was a ton of potential with the Sharks early on.
“Talking to my teammates from Brooklyn, I knew it would be a big leadership opportunity,” he said. “I knew we would be very successful, Post and Brooklyn players got along very well.”
Svete was disappointed to hear the season was cut short, right as the Sharks were coming off a sweep against St.Peters.
“I think that was the worst part when we played Nicholls State. Two of those three losses we were right in the game,” Svete said. “That weekend after St.Peters, we were playing great baseball. I thought we were a contender in the NEC.
Svete will be coming back to play his final season with the Sharks next year, and knows he will need to work hard to continue his performance after a long offseason.
“Individually I have to work as hard as I was leading up to this year,” he said. “We all must maximize this time off and be just as strong as were this year.”
Rob Griswold is a relief pitcher. He spent his last three seasons on the Blackbirds as a two-way player, both pitching and playing the infield. He decided to focus on his pitching only this year so he could improve his game on the mound.”
Going into his final collegiate season as a Shark, Griswold was looking to repeat what he achieved in Brooklyn two seasons back.
“I was looking to win another conference championship,” he said. “I think we had the potential to do so and we were all willing to do what it takes to get there.”
Griswold said the worst part about a canceled season is that there were guys on the team that they played with for the last time without even knowing it; however, despite all of this, there are things to take advantage of going forward.
“I think this situation gives us a unique opportunity to prepare for next season and appreciate any time we get on the field,” Griswold said. “It makes us realize what we have been taking for granted and helps us also realize that it can be taken away at any time.”
Anthony Warneke is a graduate student and the starting shortstop for the Sharks. He transferred to LIU Brooklyn for the 2018 season, and immediately became a starter. He redshirted in 2019 after having a season-ending injury only three games in.
“It was a tough pill to swallow, but when things get tough you just have to push through and do the things necessary to get back on track,” Warneke said.
Knowing he would play his final collegiate season as a Shark, Warneke said he aspired to win the NEC championship, and then continue his baseball career at the professional level. He was off to a great offensive start this season, leading the NEC in batting average with .438, and on-base percentage with .491. He was also seventh in the NCAA, averaging .75 stolen bases per game.
Warneke never expected his collegiate career to end this way, especially after he was having an outstanding offensive season, and when the Sharks were putting together great team performances.
“It’s not what I had envisioned for my final collegiate season, but I think I was at a great spot,” Warneke said. “I think it’s something that I can build off and take into my next season.”

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, Easter Sunday and Passover were celebrated in rare form. Some students made the trip home after spring break to social-distance with their families and loved ones, but large gatherings and celebrations like Sunday Mass and Seders were off-limits.
Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and for some, is the most important Christian festival. With the new coronavirus looming, Christians were unable to celebrate the holiday as they would every year.
Alexis Ruiz, freshman special education major, said she was dorming on campus before going home for spring break and decided to stay there when the university moved classes online due to COVID-19.
“For Easter 2020, my family and I will be spending time at home. During this time, we spend a lot of time over the phone talking to friends and family and we watch our church service online every Friday and Sunday,” Ruiz said.
Some students also participated in an online church service with Todd Bishop who is the Pastor at Church Unleashed. He invited students to join his Sunday Zoom service online.
In years before, sophomore sports management major Michaela Zabicki lived in Garden City Park, New York, where her family usually gathered and participated in a community parade for the holiday.
“We are making all the food we usually make and opening our baskets like always,” Zabicki said. “My sister and her boyfriend are coming over because they have also been social-distancing.”
Some made alternative plans to adjust according to their state’s stay-at-home orders. Some joined group chats like Zoom to try their best at making a bad situation into something tolerable.
Although some students were looking forward to celebrating as usual, unfortunately, some had to work, or their family members were required to return to work.
Derick Eugene, senior broadcasting major, said his family didn’t have any plans for the holidays, as they’re still adjusting to the current changes.
“My parents are essential workers and luckily are not being laid off,” Eugene said. “I’m excited to get back out and workout with my teammates and start running again.”

Students on campus enjoy video games in a variety of different ways. Some compete professionally in our campus’ eSports program, some play to experience interactive stories, and some play just to relax and get their mind off schoolwork.
Senior game design major Georgia Angeli enjoys playing Role Playing Games (RPG’s) because of their stories. She finds them “engaging” and the gameplay “relaxing.”
Sophomore business management major Brian Chang plays games to help destress from the responsibilities of being a student. “[They] help me not think about all the different tests or homework that I have upcoming,” he said.
Video games also give students opportunities to interact with friends that they are unable to spend time with in person. Chang and his friends use their shared interest in gaming as a way to spend time together.
“[Video games] are the main way we still hang out because we’re all pretty busy and we all live in different areas, but video games allow us to still keep in contact,” Chang said.
For students in the game design major, playing games can be more than just a hobby and actually tie into their studies.
“I think I’d have a problem not playing games since I’m making games; it’s my major,” Angeli said. “If I don’t play games, I’m not really learning and I’m not really understanding what I’ve been studying for four years; that would be a problem.”
Students also see video games as an art form, allowing creative people to express themselves in ways that were impossible before.
“Gaming is the next big expressive medium out there,” Chang said. “I think it might be up there with movies and books, and other forms of media that we as a society might consume.”
Some students, such as junior game design major Nicholas Frank, enjoy the active that engagement video games provide over the passive entertainment that traditional media provides.
“With TV I’m not really contributing to the entertainment,” he said. “I’m just watching and sitting down, looking at a screen, while things are happening in front of me, but with this I’m interacting with it.”
Video games have had a positive impact on students, leading some of them to discover their passion for game design, and giving others a way to relax and have fun.
“I met some of my best friends through video games and it’s really helping me decide what I want to do with my life,” Chang said. “It’s had a tremendous positive impact on my life personally.”

Some students gathered their belongings and headed home to fight off the new coronavirus, while some students decided it was best to stay in their campus dorms or housing, as some areas on campus remain open.
Winnick Dining Hall, Starbucks and B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library are currently open for student use. The academic buildings, Pratt Recreation Center, Winnick Honors House, and any other building on campus that isn’t a residence hall are closed until further notice.
University officials are in constant communication with all appropriate health authorities and continue to follow their recommendations to take necessary precautions for the safety of the community.
“It definitely helps with the stress that the university keeps us updated and reminds us to be safe,” Ryan Meierdierks, a senior accounting major, said. He went back home for the rest of the semester since all classes were moved online for the remainder of the semester.
Michael Zabicki, a sophomore sports management major, said he’s definitely heading home and plans to commute if he needs to return to campus for any reason. “There’s not much to do here anyway,” he said.
Deciding what to do during a crisis such as COVID-19 can be hard, especially for students weighing out the decision to stay or go home. Without many areas open on campus, the choice was easy for some.
Samantha Bell, a junior psychology major from Scotland, and Emma Braeckmans, a freshman business administration major from Belgium, felt it was in their best interest to return home. They agreed they both don’t miss the dorms or the school food but indeed miss their friends and field hockey teammates.
“It’s nice to have a break, I just miss being at school and having practice, but everything was closed so I had to come home,” Bell said.
Braeckmans is concerned it may be worse in Belgium than at school. “This situation really sucks, being from Belgium and going to school in America. I felt forced to come back which isn’t right with all the cases here,” she said.
With not much action on campus to keep resident students occupied, taking online classes in the interim has helped junior criminal justice major Ben Perez pass the time while social distancing in his dorm room.
“I mostly go get food from Winnick and come back to my dorm room and watch Netflix or Hulu and try my best to get some work done for school, but so far I’m having a horrible time in this self-quarantine thing,” Perez said.
