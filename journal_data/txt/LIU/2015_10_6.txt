The Pioneers rebounded after back-to- back losses on Wednesday, Sept. 30, with a 2-0 win against Dowling College, but their winning ways came to a halt there as they suffered a 2-0 loss to Saint Anselm College on Saturday, Oct. 3.
Saint Anselm got on the board in the 22nd minute and was able to hold the Pioneers without a shot for 35 minutes. Later in the match, senior forward, Colleen Sears, added a goal to double the lead for the hosts and give Saint Anselm the 2-0 victory.
The Pioneers returned to action the next day against Southern New Hampshire University and again saw a game with very little scoring opportunities.
After a scoreless first half, the Pioneers got on the board with a goal from sophomore defender Grace Ilias. Less than four minutes later, the Pioneers struck again. This time it was senior forward, Keliann Margiotta, off a feed from freshman forward Emily Miller.
The 2-0 lead for LIU stood until the final whistle blew and the Pioneers earned their fifth win of the season. The team is back in action on Friday, Oct. 9, when it welcomes Lindenwood University to Pioneer Country. The game is scheduled to begin at 2:30 p.m.

The green and gold proved to be too much for Molloy College to handle on Friday, Oct. 2, as the team earned an 8-1 victory.
Seniors Didi Fatchikova and Lucie Chrastecka led the way with a victory at the first doubles flight and the Pioneers dominated from there on.
The Pioneers earned two more doubles victories and even more in singles play. Freshman, Shanice Arthur, and junior, Heena Kewalramani, allowed only two games each at the no. one and two flights in singles play respectively.
The next day, the Pioneers took the court against Queens College and took a 6-3 loss at the indoor tennis center in Queens. N.Y. Queens College was able to rattle off four straight match wins when trailing 3-2, which gave them the hard-fought 6-3 victory.
The Pioneers serve up their next match on Thursday, Oct. 8, against Concordia College in Bronxville, N.Y. First serve is set for 3:30 p.m.

Brandon Cheney, a senior Public Relations major from Hewlett, N.Y., is a starting linebacker for the football team. Cheney is one of the team captains and leads the squad with 33 tackles through the first
four games of the 2015 campaign. As one of the leaders on the defense, Cheney and the Pioneers hope to win their second straight NE-Conference title and get back to the NCAA Tournament.
Q: As a senior, how do the younger players look up to you?
A: I try to lead by example both on and off the field. I’m a hard worker and that’s one of the biggest things they look up to.
Q: What is your biggest goal this season?
A: We want to repeat as Northeast-10 conference champions and make a deeper run into the playoffs.
Q: Through four games, do you think this team has the ability to win the NE-10 conference and make it back to the NCAA Tournament?
A: I think we definitely have what it takes. We need to get prepared and we’re a little banged up with injuries, but we have the right guys and the proper mindset.
Q: What is the strongest part of your game?
A: I’m experienced and I’ve been on the field for four years. My knowledge of the game is another one of my strongest assets.
Q: What goes through your mind when you’re on the field late in a close game?
A: The work and training I put into the off-season. I look back on the simple things I did to prepare for the season and I’m always hoping to make a big play.
Q: Have you ever played any other positions besides linebacker?
A: I’ve played interior defensive lineman, defensive end and I’ve been a linebacker for the past two years.
Q: How can the team improve and start stringing more wins together down the stretch?
A: Staying healthy and confident is key. We know how good we are and we need to keep the foot on the pedal and not allow teams to hang around late in games.

With Homecoming just a few days away, here’s what’s on tap for this weekend at LIU Post. Starting Thursday night, there is the 10th Annual Athletic Hall of Fame Induction as well as the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the radio station.
The next evening, there is a barbeque for alumni and friends and then a reception with President Cline. After those festivities, the attention is turned to the pep rally, which takes place at 7 p.m.
There will be plenty of alumni on hand, but one who will definitely be there is the 2015 recipient of the Distinguished Alumnus Award, Joe Gatto. Gatto is famous for being one of the four stars on the smash hit television show, Impractical Jokers. After the pep rally, the attention of many turns to the matchup on the football field; but not before some tailgating.
In the much anticipated football game, LIU Post welcomes Merrimack College to Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. The matchup should be very intense and tightly contested.
The Pioneers will look to rebound after a tough loss against American International College, but they will have a lot of friends on their side. Plenty of alumni and students are expected to attend and see a great game.

Fallen leaves, hooded sweatshirts, and pumpkin spice lattes can only mean one thing: homecoming season! Homecoming will be held on Saturday, Oct. 10, hosted by Campus Life, Alumni Relations, and the Student Activities Board. The football team will be going head to head with Merrimack College at the Bethpage Federal Stadium at 12 p.m.
“I’m looking forward to some of my old friends who are now alumni, like Patrick Bell, to come back and enjoy homecoming weekend and all its events along with SDA (Student Dance Association) performing and everyone just coming together and enjoying themselves while repping LIU Post!” said Kevin Jordan Guardia, a senior Health Science major.
All who attend can expect carnival festivities, food trucks, tailgating and, of course, the anticipated football game. The “family friendly event,” as described by LIU Post’s website, commences at 11 a.m. and ends at 5 p.m.
Similarly to years past, homecoming is the same weekend as alumni, parent, and family weekend. However, this year’s homecoming will be different because the 60th anniversary of LIU’s Post campus will be celebrated. This weekend is also the 25th reunion of C.W. Post’s class of 1990.
The homecoming celebration begins with Spirit Week, which started on Sunday, Oct. 4, with the Entourage showings in the Gold Coast Cinema. Wednesday, Oct. 7, events consist of the Jurassic World showing at 9 p.m. in the cinema and Black Light Night at 9 p.m. in Riggs Park.
Thursday, Oct. 8, is free T-shirt day, when students can pick up their “Bleed Green & Gold” shirts at the new Pioneer Nation store in Hillwood Commons. Additionally, at 9 p.m. is a Dave and Busters trip with transportation, open to all students.
Friday, Oct. 9, is the Great Lawn BBQ at 1 p.m. The fall pep rally begins at 7 p.m. at BPFCU Stadium. Two hours later, Seth Meyers LIVE will be at the Tilles Concert Hall. Tickets for Seth Meyers are $15 each.
Saturday, Oct. 10, is the carnival with large rides and tailgate, beginning at 11 a.m. at the Pratt Recreation Center. The football game begins at noon at the BPFCU Stadium.
“I look forward to homecoming because it’s a lighthearted way of officially kicking off the new semester,” said junior Criminal Justice major, Leah Fischman. “It brings everyone together, and gives the students something to look forward to amidst all our assignments.”
“I am certain that students are going to love Homecoming and Spirit Week this year.” Campus Life, Alumni Relations, and the Student Activities Board, who organized homecoming, are expecting thousands of visitors on campus throughout the week.” Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, said. “Homecoming is the largest event of the year and this year will certainly not disappoint,” Berthel added.

The Office of Campus Life and the Student Activities Board have arranged a series off-campus trips for this fall semester, consisting of various expeditions all around Long Island, as well as New York City.
“LIU Post enjoys a great location close to New York City and this series provides opportunities for students to take advantage of the city at an affordable price and a convenient way,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life.
A total of 8 trips were planned this semester. These trips are very popular and often sell out. So far this semester, the trips have included a visit to Bounce! on Sept. 17, and all 30 tickets were sold. This was the first trip of the semester. There was also an outing to a Yankee vs. Red Sox game on Sept. 29, which was another hit.
Some upcoming trips include the Broadway show “Book of Mormon”, on Oct. 14, Six Flags on Oct. 24, Dave and Busters on Oct. 8, and there is more in the works. “Book of Mormon” tickets sold out on the first day of sale. Tickets for a Broadway show are usually through the roof, but the ones being sold through LIU Post were just $35.
This semester’s series also includes two other Broadway shows, “Matilda” and “Something Rotten.” The “Matilda” trip will be on Nov. 3, and “Something Rotten” will be on Nov. 18, both priced at $35 per ticket.
“We try really hard to coordinate trips that will be affordable and memorable to students. Broadway shows and sporting events are typically the most popular,” Berthel said.
Campus Life is able to get these affordable tickets through a group discount.
The Six Flags trip was a success last year, so Campus Life decided to bring it back this year. Transportation on a bus to and from the location is included with each trip.
Akeem Victor, a senior Broadcasting major and President of the Student Activities Board, thinks these trips are great for students, especially for resident students. “Many students complain about being stuck on campus. If they don’t have cars, these off campus events are a perfect opportunity to have a great time with peers,” he said.
Most of the tickets are between $10 and $35 and are on sale between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday through Friday at the Campus Concierge in Hillwood Commons.

Members of the Economics Student Organization of Long Island (ESOLI), have entered the College Fed Challenge for the first time. The group of students who are now registered in the Fed Challenge course, ECO 46, attended the first leg of the challenge on Friday, Sept. 18. The semi-finals won’t occur until Oct. 29, but in the meantime, the group of nine students is preparing to move further ahead and make it into the final round.
According to Economics Professor, Veronika Dolar, the Fed Challenge is a competition constructed to bring real-world economics into the classroom. Teams play the role of monetary policymakers by investigating economic conditions and their very own monetary policies for hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, students establish and apply their economic analysis skills, more thoroughly understand monetary policy decision-making, and hone their public speaking and teamwork skills.
Students who participate in the challenge sharpen prior skills, such as the ability to think analytically, to make effective presentations, and to think on their feet; skills which become valuable in both their academic and professional careers. By participating, students get a hands on experience on the role of the Federal Reserve in U.S. monetary policy making and how it ensures financial stability. The participating students also get the advantage of learning more about the internship opportunities such research assistant opportunities at the Fed.
Professor Dolar first introduced the competition to the ESOLI during the Spring 2015 semester. From the enthusiastic response she received, she organized a group of students to enter into the competition this fall. It wasn’t until summer that the students participating discovered that joining also meant registering for this credit course. “This is a new, but a very active student group and they really wanted to participate in this event. So, the motivation for offering this course really came from all the enthusiasm that students expressed for this competition,” said Dolar.
The Fed traces back to the earliest attempts at central banking in this country, which was the creation of the New York Fed in 1914, and has been running ever since. On the first leg of the competition, Dolar took the group of nine students to a workshop, which is known as the Macro Boot camp, at the NY Federal Reserve Bank on Liberty Street. This part of the program allows college students in the greater NYC area to provide advice to the central bank on monetary policy.
Dolar described this section of the competition as the “easy part.” “We were given a boot camp in macroeconomics and monetary policy. Students who attended this event asked a lot of great questions and also answered some of the questions posed by the economists working at the Fed,” she said.
Senior Economics major, Mijail Quintín Mariano, who is also a tutor in the Economics department, said he was sold on the idea of the challenge based on Dolar’s eagerness to have Post involved with the competition. “She explained to us how other colleges in the area, like our neighbors at NYIT, had been participating in the challenge,” he said. “Her enthusiasm sold me on the idea that we could actually apply what our professors and studies have taught us.’
The participating students have been meeting weekly with Professor Dolar as they prepare for the semi-finals. “We’ve been really focusing on going over Macroeconomic principles to where we have it down pact,” said Mariano. “There is a question and answer portion of the competition and we’ve been practicing how to answer how the Fed should react in the outcome of a hypothetical economic scenario.”
He also said that the group has just received their case file sent by the Fed, which they have to study, work on, and present for the semi-finals. Mariano said that the class and the overall experience has been new and exciting. “Aside from visiting the Federal Reserve Bank in the city, which is great, we actually get the opportunity to meet and network with many of the bank staff members,” he explained.
Dolar hopes that this is the beginning of a new tradition at Post and that there will be a team to represent the university every year. Students that are interested in participating in this competition are required to take Intro to Microeconomics.
If you are interested in learning more about the challenge and the club, ESOLI’s next meeting will be on Oct. 12. Meetings are held every other Monday during common hour in Humanities 109.

After several semesters of constant demands from students, the university has introduced a new off-campus shuttle bus this semester. Due to consistent conflicts with pick-ups and the shuttle’s small capacity, students remained persistent with their complaints as they waited for results. Along with the new shuttle bus, the schedule and on-campus pickup locations have also changed this semester.
The off-campus shuttle is commonly used by students who need to get to or from Broadway Mall or the Hicksville LIRR station. The previous shuttle had a capacity of 25 seats, which, during peak times, was often insufficient for the number of users.
Prior to the introduction of the new shuttle bus this semester, due to the small capacity, users were often left behind and either had to wait for the following pickup or pay for an alternative source of transportation. There were also times when the shuttle simply wouldn’t show up for its pickups.
“I ended up being 40 minutes late for class. My friends decided not to go to class at all because they were too embarrassed,” said Rebecca Tigerholm, a senior Finance major, said.
This fall, not only has a new bus been introduced, but the shuttle has also added pick-up times for students. The Chapel pick-up location has been eliminated and two new pick up locations have been added at Hillwood Commons and Brookville Hall to allow for more centralized access to the shuttle. With these two new locations, students can now access the shuttle at a more convenient spot for them.
The new shuttle is larger than last year. During the first three weeks of the semester, the shuttle capacity was 33, but on Sept. 28, a 40-passenger shuttle began servicing the campus for the remainder of the year.
In addition, the Office of Campus Life has changed the times of the other off-campus shuttle, which travels on the Greenvale loop, to accommodate more afternoon hours. This shuttle drives through Post, to NYIT Medical, Pathmark, Moe’s, Wendy’s, and back. It runs from noon to 2:30 pm, with new extended hours from 5:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Campus Life Director Michael Berthel believes that although there have been complications with the shuttle service in the past, he is hopeful that students will be more satisfied with the improvements made this year. “We are continuing to address issues when they arise and will keep listening to students about how to improve the experience,” he said.
Berthel said that the new shuttle bus addresses several concerns that have been raised by students. According to Berthel, the demand has increased over the years and this new shuttle allows Campus Life to service more students. The shuttle has increased the capacity by 15 seats on the Hicksville Loop.
Christoffer Løvik, a senior International Business major, said that his initial reaction to the new shuttle and its service changes was a sense of satisfaction. “Coming back for the fall semester to a shuttle with more seats and more departures told us that the administration responsible for the school shuttle really listened to us,” he said.
However, Løvik believes there are still some issues that need to be dealt with regarding the schedule and location pickups. “The 9:00 a.m. shuttle that arrives at the LIRR station doesn’t get into Hillwood until 9:30 p.m. at the earliest, which means that every student who has a 9:30 class is late.”
Last semester, it stopped behind the library, a stop that is close to 90 percent of all of the classrooms. “This semester, we have to go through Hillwood to get to class. The difference isn’t very big between the stops, but a couple of minutes is vital in the morning,” he said. Lovik suggested that to accommodate the popular 9:30 a.m. class time, the morning shuttle departures should be pushed back 10-15 minutes so all students would make it to class in time and a stop should be made at the library again.
Berthel said that the new schedule and shuttle is in effect for the academic year, however, he said that Campus Life is always willing to make changes that will improve shuttle operations and student satisfaction with the service.

Tuesday, Oct. 6, Post’s Study Abroad Department hosted its annual study abroad fair in Hillwood Commons from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
“The Study Abroad fair is a great opportunity for students to find out more information about all their options for studying abroad,” said Patricia Seamen, Director of the Study Abroad Program.
Seamen, expressed a profound sense of optimism for this year’s fair. “I am particularly excited this year for the fair, as we have three new affiliate schools that our students can attend in France, Turkey, and Sweden, in addition to our programs in England, Italy, Spain, Costa Rica, Australia, and China.”
Courses are held at select universities within the country (In which students will be studying in). For example, students choosing London as their study abroad destination, will take up classes at Regent’s American College, located right in the heart of London.
“I studied at Regent’s American University in London,” said Kalli Mamounas, a junior Photography major. “I followed through with the study abroad experience because I just wanted to see more. I wanted
to see what life elsewhere was all about, particularly in London, a place that’s always peaked my interest.”
Stephanie Athanasopoulos, who also is a junior Photography major, joined Mamounas for the chance to study in London. “I personally think it’s what college is all about,” Athanasopoulos said. “You’re thousands of miles away, and that’s the beauty of it. Living on your own, getting an education overseas, and the education truly goes beyond the classroom. For example, photographing Big Ben at night was amazing, and taking seminar classes about London culture was just as great.”
Students who study abroad are obligated to take classes premised upon the culture in which students are staying at. For example, for students who decide to take a 10 day study abroad course in South Korea, an Art and Culture of South Korea is a required course. The same can be said for students taking their studies to Tanzania, where a Wildlife Conservation & Sustainable Eco-tourism course is required as well.
Both Athanasopoulos and Mamounas recently became ambassadors to the study abroad program at Post, which is a huge commitment. As ambassadors for the program, Athanasopoulos and Mamounas will now act as ‘recruiters’ for the program and were obligated to take part in events such as this Tuesday’s fair.
Studying abroad has its skeptics, but Seaman has an answer for them. “The largest misconception that prevents students from participating in study abroad is its perceived inaccessibility,” she said. “Students who do study abroad are often amazed at how easy it was to put the whole thing together. Financial aid is often available, every major field of study can partake, and study abroad is an experience available for every student.”
Seaman later added that an individual can study anywhere from 10 days to an academic year. There is no set cost for studying abroad, due to the fact that cost varies from country to country. LIU Post tuition will cover tuition abroad; however, room and board fees will vary according to the program. Standard credit rates are applied to all courses taken by students who study abroad.
Post sends off nearly a hundred students abroad annually, in part because the study abroad program offers courses for every major field offered at Post. The program experiences trends in terms of which destinations are most popular amongst students.
Destinations such as London and Italy remain the programs rank amongst the most popular options. However, with new locations such as France, Turkey, and Sweden now being offered, look for these destinations to become some of Post’s more popular destinations to study abroad.

This fall semester, LIU Post has introduced a brand new undergraduate major: Sustainability. Dr. Scott Carlin and Dr. Margaret Boorstein, both from the Earth and Environmental Science department, are leading the classes of this new undergraduate major. They also teach in the existing master’s program as well.
The difference between the major and the minor is that the major requires you to take more credits, and you can focus more on learning about sustainability rather than having to push through core courses. Additionally, the master’s program includes an internship.
The master’s program in Sustainability has been offered for four years. What is now being added is a bachelor’s degree and a minor.
The undergraduate program is interdisciplinary, meaning it involves many different subjects, such as English, different types of sciences, and math.
For the undergraduate major, students are required to take a total of 30 credits in courses such as General Biology, Earth Science, Introduction to Economics, and Math with a strong focus on Geology and Geography. Sustainability can be fulfilled with a variety of different subjects, from Biology, to Economics.
After students complete all required classes, they will choose a certain track for their degree. The tracks include biology, geography, earth science, social sciences, arts and humanities. This includes things like how literature and the environment interact, U.S environmental history, or environmental philosophy.
Dr. Scott Carlin said that he is confident that a degree in Sustainability can open up many doors for a student. A degree in sustainability could land jobs in the government, teaching, or working for private sectors. He also said that many companies need environmental consultants for the work they do. The more aware the public becomes to climate change, the more jobs will open up for those familiar with sustainability.
In addition to the new degrees, the campus has a committee dedicated to sustainability on campus. They are responsible for most of the green additions to the campus, like the new water fountains and the rain garden.
“The goal all of this is to create a new relationship between the economy and the environment, to allow the economy and the environment is to live in harmony,” Carlin said.
Boorstein said that she believes this new degree program will help to “succeed in the world but respect the environment.” This means that you can go far and do great things, but you can also help the environment along the way.
After contacting Dr. Boorstein, she wasn’t aware of the reason why the information regarding the bachelors degree for sustainability wasn’t up on the website for Post yet, but confirmed that it is being offered this current fall semester.

E-mail is commonly used among college students and faculty to exchange information. This medium of exchange was compromised recently when LIU Post students and faculty began to receive computer viruses by opening certain pieces of mail.
LIU Post alumna Dorianna Valerio, started to receive the e-mails. According to Valerio, nothing about the e-mails were particularly suspicious; “It was just a simple link,” she said. Upon opening one of the infected e-mails, however, a “junk folder” was created on Valerio’s e-mail account. The only way to erase this unwanted folder was to log in from a web browser, not a mobile app.
Although it may seem that the creation of a folder is a minor annoyance –the virus does not stop there. Once the folder is created, multiple spam e-mails are sent to the e-mail account, causing a very messy inbox. “[Within] the first couple of days, I received something like 100 e-mails” said Valerio. In addition to a messy inbox, spam e-mails can hinder a student’s organization. For Valerio, organization is something that is very important to her. “I pride myself, which seems silly, on having a spam-free e-mail,” she said.
Another LIU graduate that received suspicious e-mails recently was Olivia Wicik. According to Wicik, she started to receive multiple e-mails on the evening of Sept. 6. Erring on the side of caution, she did not open the mail. Instead, she contacted friends and former professors to see if they were experiencing the same issues as she was. They were, but Wicik said that, “no one knows why.”
The LIU Post Information Technology (IT) department sent out an e-mail to LIU students and faculty with some instructions on how to increase security.
