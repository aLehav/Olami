 Freshman accounting major Jake Gillis had great success in his first season as an attackman for the men’s lacrosse team. With 56 points and five East Coast Conference (ECC) player of the week recognitions after 11 games, he is one of the team’s most distinguished players.
Gillis began his lacrosse career when he was three years old in his hometown of Calgary, Canada by playing box lacrosse, which is a form of lacrosse played indoors. When he was 12 years old, he played field lacrosse with a club team. 
Gillis decided to go to college in America to combine education with his passion for lacrosse. “We don’t have school lacrosse in Canada other than on the east coast, and it’s not as good as it is down here, so I ultimately chose to come here because of the option to play lacrosse and possibly get a scholarship,” Gillis said. 
While searching for colleges in America, Post’s reputation for the lacrosse team and the business program attracted Gillis. “The lacrosse team is known [for] being very good, and I really like the coach,” he said. Head coach Eric Wolf was the deciding factor for Gillis to choose to attend Post. 
After 11 games, the men’s lacrosse team is 9-2 for the season and retained their No. 5  ranking in the U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association poll, and ranked No. 6 in the Nike/U.S. Lacrosse magazine. Gillis expected the team to do well, but he never anticipated having such a successful start in his freshman year. 
“I tend to be quite hard on myself. I look at all the bad things I did during a game, but I know that I have done some pretty good things this year. I know I’m putting the ball in the net, which is what I was brought here to do,” he said. 
Gillis said his individual achievements are a result of great teamwork. “All of the guys have been doing a really good job of giving me the opportunities to do as well as I have been,” he said. 
Gillis’s teammates mean a lot to him. He has never lived outside of Canada before and it has been hard for him to be away from his family, friends and dog, but the team helped him transition. “The team has been so good. They are like another family to me and they have made this my second home,” he said. 
Gillis and his second family have three games left in the regular season. If everything goes as planned, they will move on to the ECC championships and the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. Gillis biggest dream is to win it all. “A big reason why I came here was to get a ring at the end of the year,” he said. 
Gillis wants to continue to improve his performance, but his own success is not his main focus. “The championship is the biggest deal to me right now. It doesn’t matter how many points everybody has on the field; the outcome at the end of the season is the biggest thing for me,” Gillis said.

 On a chilly afternoon, the baseball team played St. Thomas Aquinas Spartans at home in their final game of a series dominated by Pioneers on Monday, April 1. In the two prior games of the series, the Pioneers won skillfully, earning a 25-5 win in their first matchup in series. 
The Pioneers dominated in the outfield. Freshman pitcher Joshua Loeschhorn, who tied his strike record with six in this game, was a key to the team’s success. “I thought Josh was outstanding on the mound,” Mike Gaffney, head coach, said. “He gave us the performance we needed.” 
The Pioneers scored the two runs in the first couple of innings, including two runs by senior Anthony Vaglica in the second inning and again in the fourth with a line drive to left field by junior Zack Fritz. The Spartans scored their first run in the fifth but were quickly answered by a run batted in from senior Dave Brehm. The Pioneers walked away with their third victory of the series. 
“After such a successful weekend, we could have come out a little too relaxed, but we didn’t.” Coach Gaffney said, “The team came out with the urgency of getting a sweep, not being content with just winning three out of four.”
In their next matchup, The Pioneers will take on Mercy College as the team comes from a two-game loss to Bridgeport. “We need to have the urgency we had this weekend offensively, have a good weekend on the mound, and I’m confident we’ll be successful,” Gaffney said.

Danielle Burman, a freshman a musical theater major from Rockville, Maryland, is busy rehearsing for the First Year Showcase, “Ovations and Odysseys,” which will be held from April 11-14 in the Little Theater. The First Year Showcase is a series of 10-minute plays with the inclusion of opening and closing movement pieces with the entire ensemble. “All of us have really bonded throughout the process of developing the show,” Burman said. 
Burman is anxious about the opportunity. “For the First Year Showcase, I was a little nervous to audition because it was the first audition I was doing for the faculty since starting school here, but small nerves are really helpful because you can use them to fuel you into the work; I was mostly excited,” Burman said. 
After final exams, Burman will also be
heading to Plymouth, Massachusetts to start
rehearsals for “Heathers: The Musical” at the
Priscilla Beach Theatre, a summer job she is
going to do in the small regional theater.

“Heathers: The Musical” is based on the film of the same name. “For Heathers, I also auditioned to be in the production; this was actually an audition via video consisting of dance combination, song, and monologue,” Burman said. Burman was offered a role in the ensemble and as an understudy for two supporting roles. She starts rehearsals on May 9. 
When she isn’t on campus, Burman enjoys going to the city. “I like going into New York
City and take dance classes at Broadway Dance
Center or just exploring the city with friends,”
she said.

Burman is pursuing what she is passionate about. “Getting to train in what I love to do every day is the most fulfilling thing; this is only my first year and I have grown so much in all aspects of the performing arts,” Burman said. Some of Burman’s favorite classes are Acting, Beginning Suzuki Technique, and Ballet. 
“My favorite part about attending LIU Post is the community within the theater and dance department; it’s a family that pushes each other to grow and supports one another along the way. I’ve never been happier in my life,” Burman said. 
Burman’s advice to students is to “find the
joy in what you’re doing; pursuing my passion
for theater and dance is where I find that and it
fuels me every day.”

Though there are many who people choose to consume a vegetarian or vegan diet for its physiological benefits, there are a few downfalls that may accompany it that should be considered before delving in. 
First off, it’d be helpful to know the difference between the two diets. A vegan diet eliminates any and all animal products whatsoever, including butter, milk, fish and gelatin, while a vegetarian diet removes meat in general. 
According to the Registered Dieticians Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina in their book “Becoming Vegan,” people who avoid consuming meat, white or red, have a 200 percent reduced rate of colon cancer when compared to those who eat meat two to three times per week. They explain that this is due to the inflammation produced in the colon from the byproducts of meat digestion. Meat eaters also have a 54 percent increased rate of prostate
cancer and a 57 percent increased rate of breast
cancer over a lifetime. These numbers are
shocking considering meat is a staple food in
America.

While vegans and vegetarians can experience a decreased rate of certain cancers, they often experience deficiencies of a few vital nutrients. Most notably is vitamin B12. This vitamin is solely produced by bacteria and is naturally found in meat. This poses a problem for vegans who do not supplement their diet with B12 or consume fortified foods. In fact, within days of not consuming B12, blood levels decrease. Not too long after, cells begin to starve and symptoms arise. The most common deficiency symptoms include exhaustion, inability to concentrate, confusion, and tingling, however some experience extreme symptoms such as the inability to move. B12 is essential for ATP production, for DNA construction, and nerve protection. Without it, our bodies will certainly struggle.
If you or a loved one is a vegan or vegetarian, it is wise to consult a physician and look into getting your serum levels tested to ensure that your B12 levels are sufficient. Davis and Melina found that prolonged B12 deficiency is proven to potentially cause irreparable nerve damage and severe cellular stress.

 Movies have a way of bringing a community together through a shared culture, or love of certain celebrities. Many of the films released this year were remakes of beloved films, and that trend continues for the upcoming films of 2019. These films are a mixture of nostalgia and the hard work established by years of connected films from various studios. 
Marvel Studios is celebrating its 10 year anniversary; Disney continues to make live action remakes of classics like “Dumbo” and “Aladdin.” Meanwhile in animation, “Frozen” will be getting a sequel.
With the acquisition of Marvel by Disney, along with their purchase of Fox and Lucasfilm, new merchandise and films for franchises like Star Wars, the Marvel films and so on are being released.
Comic book fans have much to look forward this spring with releases like “Hellboy” on April 12, 2019, alongside “Avengers: Endgame” and a reboot for “Men in Black” called “Men In Black: International.” 
Most popular films are connected to other movies, mostly due to audiences already invested in the world and characters. For instance, Iron Man and Luke Skywalker were set up through years of films so the audiences’ connection to them is more personal.
The long awaited “Avengers: Endgame” comes out April 26, 2019. It offers a conclusion to the cliffhanger at the end of “Avengers: Infinity War,” giving Marvel fans closure and a satisfying ending to Thanos’ story as the remaining heroes go to confront him with the trailer’s tagline of “Whatever it takes.”
Following the inevitable triumph of heroes in “Avengers: Endgame” comes the sequel to Marvel’s “Spiderman: Homecoming” with “Spiderman: Far From Home,” coming out July 5, 2019. Tom Holland and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles as Spiderman and Nick Fury in the new setting of London.
”Frozen II” premieres on Nov. 22, 2019, continuing the adventures of Anna, Kristoff and Elsa for younger audiences who were enchanted by the trio’s debut in Frozen. The film features a new setting and characters. With a darker tone and grander scope, the sequel is more of a fantasy epic.
After the live action release of “Dumbo” on March 29, Disney will release another live action film, “Aladdin” on May 24, 2019. The film will feature memorable songs from the original release, with Will Smith in the role of Genie and Guy Ritchie in the director’s chair.
“Men In Black: International,” the reboot of the MIB film franchise, releases this summer on June 14, 2019, offering past and potential fans a new duo of laser shooting spies with Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson.

James Bednarz, professor of English, attended a three-day conference called “The Marston Effect,” at the Lincoln College of Oxford University from March 29-31, at which he gave one of two keynote addresses. His lecture, “John Marston and the Revolution at Paul’s Playhouse,” was an example of Bednarz’s interest in what he calls “historical intertextuality,” a critical approach to Shakespeare’s connection to early modern work in literature and theater. 
“One of the responsibilities that university teaching involves is a dedication to extending the boundaries of knowledge through research. Participating in scholarly conferences creates knowledge that informs classroom teaching with cutting-edge theories and new information,” he said. 
“The Marston Effect” included two keynote lectures, four lecture panels, a formal dinner, a performance of “The Malcontent” by Edward’s Boys, classical actors, in the Hall of Trinity College, and an extended Q&A period with Perry Mills, their artistic manager and deputy headmaster at King Edward VI School (Shakespeare’s school) in Stratford-upon-Avon. 
Patrick Cheney, professor of English and comparative literature at Pennsylvania State University, the other keynote speaker, discussed “Marston’s Elysian Authorship.” Two panels covered “Marston’s poetry” and “Audiences, plays, and playhouses,” while the other two panels covered Marston’s plays “The Dutch Courtesan,” “The Malcontent,” and “Sophonisba.” 
John Marston (1576-1634) was a late Elizabethan/early Jacobean playwright whose plays and poems were known for their exotic vocabulary, self-conscious style, and satiric bite. A contemporary of William Shakespeare, Marston’s reputation has shifted between appreciation and criticism. “The beginning of Marston’s career took a jarring turn when his first collections of poetry were banned and burned by a public executioner in June of 1599,” Bednarz said. “Yet he continued to protest, covertly through his writing, against all forms of political tyranny and censorship.” 
Bednarz’s lecture examined the change in Marston’s writing when he transitioned from verse satire to composing drama for a company of child actors called Paul’s Boys. “I examined how Paul’s Playhouse encouraged Marston to develop a self-consciously hybrid poetics that absorbed, blended, and opposed conventional generic categories, producing a kind of drama that continually called attention to the theoretical and material conditions of its realization,” Bednarz said. “Here, a beard would fall off the face of a character without sufficient time for make-up; child actors would flaunt their identities as singers and actors; and the playwright would repeatedly refer to himself and even position his portrait, for scrutiny, onstage.” 
Bednarz spent time with other prominent scholars, including Richard Dutton and Martin Butler at the conference. “I was glad to learn that Dutton, one of the giants in the field, was updating ‘Mastering the Revels,’ his classic study of theater censorship. He was also pleased to meet Colin Burrow, Senior Research Fellow at All Soul’s College, Oxford, “one of the most brilliant scholars in the field of Renaissance literary studies today.” “Seeing Edward’s Boys perform Marston’s ‘Malcontent,’” he added, “was also extraordinary. It proved the power that this masterpiece still possesses in performance.” 
Bednarz reflected on the continuing importance of Shakespeare and of his contemporaries. “The plays and poems written by Shakespeare and his contemporaries are one of the greatest achievements of world literature. They bring to life the earliest reflections on the making of the world we inhabit,” he said. “So much of our contemporary experience, our way of conceiving of ourselves, is reflected in the culture of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson, Donne, and Marston. Their insight into our world remains fresh.” 
This semester, Bednarz is currently teaching
“Shakespeare: Tragedies and Romances” and
an honors college seminar on “Hamlet.”

 The Pioneers flushed out Queens College at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium on Wednesday, April 3 with a landslide victory of 19-1.
Less than 10 minutes into the first half, the Pioneers took a 9-0 lead, with two goals from junior midfielder Alyssa Mallery.  Mallery went on to score a total of four goals in the game.
“I wouldn’t have been able to score without my teammates opening up space; I was also getting great feeds from my teammates,” Mallery said.
While it was a big day for Mallery, it was a day to remember for adolescent education graduate student Abbey Sollecito as she scored her first career goal as a Pioneer. 
“It was really exciting, but today was a great conference win for us,” Sollecito said. “We had a lot of great goals and great stops on defense. Overall, it was a team effort and I’m super proud of all my teammates.”
 Junior marketing and management major, Kendall Purdy was on the other side of the field on defense, watching her teammates shine on offense.
“It was hard to not see much action during the game, but I enjoyed watching my teammates do amazing things on attack,” Purdy said.
The Pioneers expected to win against Queens.“It was nice to have a big win, but I enjoy the close, competitive games,” Purdy said.
Prior to the game against Queens College, the Pioneers won by a slim margin with a score of 10-9 against Adelphi University on Saturday, March 30. The feelings from that win against their rivals followed them into Wednesday’s game. “It felt good to have a great win today; the feeling from winning on Saturday [Adelphi] was unforgettable though,” Sollecito said.
 The Pioneers will face off against the New York Institute of Technology, (NYIT) on Saturday, April 13 at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium at noon.

 WARNING: SPOILERS!
In a trailer released on March 28 for season six of the sci-fi fantasy TV show “The 100,” we find Clarke Griffin [Eliza Taylor] aboard a spaceship called the Ring with her crew, waking up from 125-year-long rest in cryosleep. What was only supposed to be a 10-year-long wait until the Earth they burned down healed itself, turned into a journey through space to find another planet to call home. 
The season five finale, “Damocles: Part 2,” left viewers with many questions. Monty Green [Christopher Larkin] and Harper McIntyre [Chelsey Reist], who were tasked with staying out of cryosleep to wake the crew in 10 years, have grown old and died in a span of 125 years. In a heartbreaking farewell video message delivered to Bellamy Blake [Bob Morley] and Clarke, Monty and Harper chronicled their years in space, growing old together to their eventual death, and revealed that the Earth they once knew was dead and gone forever. 
They left an even bigger surprise behind: an 18-year-old son named Jordan Jasper Green [Shannon Kook] who is a tribute to Monty’s best friend Jasper Jordan [Devon Bostick], who died in season four. Jordan was tasked with waking the crew from cryosleep once they reached a new planet Monty set coordinates for. 
Season six picks up the story from there. Bellamy and Clarke must process Monty and Harper’s passing, take Jordan in and decide the next steps for their crew. What awaits them on this new planet? Will they finally find peace and have their happy ending that they’ve sacri-ficed so much to achieve?
The answer, of course, isn’t as black and white. The trailer takes us into a whole new world known as Sanctum, a large planet with two suns. There is an advanced civilization here, well beyond the years of progression they’ve seen on Earth. Sanctum gives off a “Hunger Games” capitol vibe with its intriguing colors, technologies and people, different than what we’ve seen in previous seasons.
Clarke, Bellamy and the rest of the survivors find Sanctum to be a paradise. But it may be too good to be true. Something dark lies within Sanctum, and our survivors are faced with a new enemy they’ve never encountered before: themselves.
In an interview at the 2018 New York Comic Con, creator and executive director of “The 100” said this new season will have a different theme from past seasons; not the “whatever it takes to survive” mind set, but to fulfill Monty’s wishes for them of “doing better and being better.”
In the trailer we see Octavia “Blodreina” Blake [Marie Avgeropoulos] in an intense sword fight with herself. This battle seems symbolic of the theme of this next season; two versions of Octavia are in battle: the strong-willed Octavia from the first four seasons when she found herself among the Grounders (people who survived on Earth) versus Blodreina, the ruthless and vicious Octavia that lead her people to cannibalism in order to survive as they were trapped in an underground bunker in season five. 
Octavia lost her brother Bellamy’s trust by becoming a “monster.” In the trailer we see the two talking, and Bellamy says, “My sister died a long time ago,” a call back to season three when Octavia disowned Bellamy because she blamed him for her grounder-lover Lincoln’s death. The relationship between the siblings is strained throughout the series. Perhaps we will see the two reconcile their differences in season six.
More conflicts are to come to the survivors; Clarke faces new challenges of being a mother to Madi, Madi starts seeing visions of a past commander of the grounders, and Bellamy and Clarke finally talk about the radio calls Clarke left him for six years while they were separated by the nuclear “death wave” Praimfaya at the end of season four.
The trailer leads to much anticipation about what lies ahead for Clarke and her crew. The beginning of book two in season six of “The 100” premieres on Tuesday, April 30 on The CW.

The Long Island Authors Group, a group of local book authors that promote the writing community, hosted its first author’s fair in the atrium of the Tilles Center on April 6, giving local authors the opportunity to display their work and connect with members of the community. The fair was organized by the president of Long Island Authors Group, Roland Allnach. 
Allnach said that organizing the event was
the most rewarding part of his work, and that
outreach events greatly help the authors in his
organization.

“We’re really trying to get the word out for people [in the community] to realize who lives
among them,” he said.

The event included an opportunity to chat with authors, to view and purchase their books, and to listen to educational panels, and a keynote address by former member of Congress Steve Israel, the author of two books. 
Local authors Dan Mariani and Mike Mattel
participated in the event.

Mariani’s table was set with copies of his post-apocalyptic novel, “The Road to Chapultepec Park,” which he wrote around two and a half years ago. 
“[The book] is also classified as “cli-fi,” climate change science fiction,” Mariani said. “It’s a story about a man and a dog and how they survive a global cooling event: an ice age in the near future.” 
Mariani said that promotional events like
the author’s fair are an integral part of how he
promotes his work.

“Events like this help us get the word out.
In my case, it’s a paperback and an e-book,” he
said. “We get to network with other authors…
and we get an opportunity to talk directly to the
public. It’s always good to get feedback, both
positive and negative.”

Mattel, who was promoting his book of short stories, poetry, and song lyrics called “What Was I Thinking?,” echoed Mariani’s sentiments. 
“We get to network with people, we meet people,” he said, “and by word of mouth, [our work] can spread.” 
Vickie Maxey, a friend of one of the authors featured at the event, said she came to the event to explore the genres displayed at each table. 
Lauren Artus, a friend of Maxey, said that
this is not her first time at an event sponsored
by Long Island Authors Group.

“We’ve been to other book fairs and we really enjoyed it, so we wanted to check this out again,” she said. 
Long Island Author’s Group can be reached online at www.longislandauthorsgroup.org.

Dr. Kamal Boukerrou has taken over as the director of the HEOP program on both the LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn campuses, after the departure of William Clyde, who previously served as HEOP Director at Post. “It feels great to know that I can be of some help to the HEOP community at Post,” Boukerrou said. “It is also a good opportunity for me to get to know other administrators and students at Post, and to learn about students needs, passions, and the resources available at Post,” he added. 
Boukerrou said that members of the Post campus have been welcoming to him so far. “It is not a problem to manage all the paperwork and profiles of students on both campuses,” he said. 
“It is no problem at all, the Enrollment Services folks at Post have been very welcoming and cooperative, and they are helping a lot. The HEOP Brooklyn counselors have also stepped in and adopted Post students; they are contacting them via email and phone calls,” he said. 
Boukerrou started his work with HEOP in 1986 and was chosen as director at LIU Brooklyn in September 2015. He will miss Clyde, who he has worked with for many years. “William is a great colleague, whom I have known for over two decades; he misses his students and often he asks me about them; we are still in touch and he is missed,” Boukerrou said. Clyde left Post on Jan. 18 to take a position as Director of Special Programs, EOP Director, at Nassau Community College. 
Boukerrou will be available to advise HEOP students on both campuses, working to ensure that HEOP students succeed academically and reach their highest peak. 
The Pioneer reported on Feb. 6 that no new students will
be admitted into the HEOP program at Post. The Pioneer also
reported that there are currently 60 students in the program.

The student government association will hold its first annual networking event on Tuesday, April 16, to inform clubs and Greek organizations on the ways they can help each other with philanthropic and campus events. 
“A lot of clubs assume that they can’t work
with Greek Life and vice versa,” Adam Pilzer,
the SGA parliamentarian for this academic
year, said. “The event is for the executive board
officers of the clubs and executive officers of
fraternities and sororities on campus.”

The event was created to address an issue that SGA representatives have noticed throughout this academic year. According to Pilzer, many clubs had issues filing paperwork and meeting minimum requirements for the events they wanted to hold on campus. 
“We want them to know that we are here,” Pilzer said. “We want to work with them, and we want all the clubs and organizations and Greek life to meet each other so that there can be more collaboration events next year.”
The event, which is open to executive members of their respective organizations, will be held in the Patron’s Lounge in the Tilles Center during common hour. 
In addition to the networking event, SGA
elections will be held at the end of April for the
2019-2020 academic year. Students who would
like to get involved in student government
need to apply online or stop by the SGA Office
in Hillwood Commons on the second floor for
more details.

Dr. Shareen Rasheed and Dr. Joseph M. Piro have been appointed the co-directors of the doctoral program in interdisciplinary educational studies. 
Rasheed and Piro replaced Dr. Red Owl and Dr. Paula Lester as the directors of the program in fall 2018. The program is for students pursuing an Ed.D. in the College of Education, Information and Technology. The research-based graduate program is offered on campus as well as at satellite campuses in Brooklyn and Hudson. 
The program attracts students from various backgrounds interested in pursuing a doctoral degree with the intention of gaining a leadership position in public or private schools. The program also helps those who would like to enter a variety of other fields, such as health & science education, business, and technology. There are approximately 70-80 students in the program. 
The program began, Piro said, in 2009 and has a robust student body doing innovative and cutting edge research. “The program just celebrated its 10th anniversary since its 2009 beginning. It operates on a cohort model where doctoral students from the metropolitan area work together in a cohort or group model. Students from a variety of fields bring their backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences to the program resulting in as dynamic blend of ideas and approaches which are then applied to issues such as teaching and learning, and school reform,” Piro said. 
Piro is a professor of education in the College of Education, Information and Technology. He previously taught and was an administrator in the New York City Public Schools. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University, where his dissertation was focused on cerebral asymmetries for music perception in gifted adolescents. He earned a B.A. from St. Francis College, an M.A. from City University of New York, Queens College, and an M.S. from Fordham University. 
Piro’s research interests include psychology of giftedness and special ability. Piro is also interested in topics that involve brain and behavior, music perception, and sleep and cognition. His articles have appeared in numerous research journals and his book, “The Primacy of PISA: The World’s Most Important
Test and how it is Changing Education Across
the Globe,” will be published in 2019. Piro has
received three Fulbright grants for his research
projects in the Middle East, India, and the
European Union.

Rasheed is also a professor of education in the College of Education, Information, and Technology. Rasheed earned her B.A. from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, her M.A. in Philosophy from the New School for Social Research, and an M.Phil. and Ph.D. in Philosophy from Columbia University. She is on sabbatical this semester as a visiting scholar in the philosophy department at Columbia University, working on research on the role of right wing populism and race. She is also currently a visiting lecturer at the University of Lisbon in Portugal and is the recipient of a second Fulbright to Pakistan. Rasheed was a Fulbright visiting Professor at the University of Salzburg during the 2017-2018 academic year. 
Rasheed is excited about her new role and the opportunity to align the doctoral program
with the demands of a changing time in higher
education. Rasheed hopes to make the program
competitive during her tenure as co-director,
attracting the best and the brightest students
nationally and internationally.

 Fans have waited two long years to return to Hawkins, Indiana and travel to the Upside Down. The trailer for season three of “Stranger Things” was released on March 20. Fans rejoiced when the trailer released because it meant they are just a few months away from rejoining the “Stranger Things” gang on July 4.
“I’m very excited to see the next installment in the “Stranger Things” series. But I’m also interested to see where they will be taking the series,” Nick Mattina, a junior broadcasting major, said. 
Two weeks after it was released, the trailer already had more the 24 million views on YouTube. “I thought the trailer was really good. It showed us a lot, but not too much to give anything away,” Connor Lambert, a sophomore broadcasting major, said. In the trailer viewers see that the characters have grown up a little.
“It is a fun twist to have it around the Fourth of July. I love the mall setting,” Anthony Cavarretta, a sophomore public relations major, said. In one of the scenes in the trailer, viewers see Eleven, played by Millie Bobby Brown, and Max, played by Sadie Sink, in a mall and Eleven was blown away by the excitement of everything. 
In the first two seasons, the “Stranger Things” gang dealt with a monster called a Demogorgon, which is from the Upside Down. “You get a quick look at a new monster that they will have to deal with,” Lambert said about the trailer. Viewers see what is either a new monster or a more evolved version a Demogorgon. 
When it comes to watching “Stranger Things,” fans have all different sorts of theories. “I believe Hopper is going die and Eleven will have a breakdown and turn Hawkins upside,” Caveretta said. “This show is so unpredictable, that I don’t even want to make any predictions,” Mattina said. 
Fans are just months away from the July 4 Netflix release of the show. So, get your Eggo waffles ready because “Stranger Things” season three is just around the corner.

 People crowded into the S.A.L. Gallery on the main floor of the library April 3 as the digital art and design program presented the BFA Senior Exhibition. The exhibition ran from April 3-10 and is the culminating event for the show’s six students: Daniel Puntormo, Tyler Maher, Rebecca Kane, Nicole Comito, Lauren Palumbo and Andi Silverman; as they displayed the products of their four years in the program. 
An array of pieces lined the walls, from digital illustrations to hand-cut and crafted chocolate boxes. The work displayed highlighted the depth of skills that the seniors had the opportunity to learn. “We did everything from 3D to video, to web, to print to app design,” Silverman said. 
Puntormo shared his work with his friends and family, reflecting on his years at Post. “It [the art displayed] shows the end of my college career, what I’ve become,” he said, “I’ve started from garbage, and now I have all of this work that I can get out and get a job with.”
Maher (18’) decided to come back to show his work alongside his peers. Currently working in real estate, Maher plans on using his art work to delve further into the world of advertising. “Right now I’ve been focusing on my real estate job, but I do have a couple of interviews lined up, I’m hoping to get a job in the city somewhere in advertising or packaging,” he said. 
This is the first time all six of the seniors have displayed their work in a gallery setting. The room buzzed with proud parents, professors and friends. The artists spoke of how incredible it was sharing the gallery with their classmates. 
“It was really exciting because I get to do it with a lot of people I came in with, we all came in together, and so we all get to hang our stuff up together,” Palumbo said. “It’s really cool to see it all together, and see how far everyone’s come.” 
Palumbo agreed that her best memories of her time on campus have been alongside her classmates. “We’re like a family. The professors are so nice and helpful with everything, so I’ve had a great experience in this program overall, it’s really been so amazing,” she said.
As for the artists’ future goals, they look forward to furthering their craft and getting hired within the field. Puntormo summarized the feeling of seniors across all departments as graduation looms, “I don’t wanna be broke,” he said

 Video game studio Gearbox announced the long awaited latest entry in the Borderland series, “Borderlands 3” on March 28. It has been seven years since “Borderlands 2” originally re-leased, and fans have been desperate for more. 
“Borderlands” is an open world shooter game where players explore the post apocalyptic world of Pandora and fight the monsters that inhabit it. The series is known for it’s off the wall humor, something rare in the genre that it resides in.
“Borderlands 3” picked up right where its predecessor left off and with up to four players to adventure in the world of Pandora together. Gearbox released one trailer of the game so far, and in terms of style and game play, it looks similar to previous entries. The game hosts a few improvements, such as new abilities and more than one billion guns to use.
Many gamers on campus are excited for “Borderlands 3.” Michael Khan, a senior digital game design major, is looking forward to the chance to try new guns, including a gun that can run around on it’s own legs. “The game looks amazing, even though it still has the cell shaded look from the originals, it looks a lot more HD and polished,” Khan said.

 Upon entering Winnick Student Center on weekday mornings, students are greeted by a familiar and smiling face. Jacqueline Martis, affectionately known as “Jackie” to students who frequent the dining hall, takes extra steps as a cashier to ensure every student she encounters is greeted warmly and feels welcome.“
That’s what makes it [the job] enjoyable: the students,” Martis said. “They’re young, youth is very important.” When they come in to greet her, students often talk to Martis about things ranging from the sports they play to their relationships.
“Jackie always makes sure she knows every student by their first name and always asks how their classes are, [and] if they’re in athletics how their team’s doing. She makes my morning every time I come in here,” Alexis Smith, sophomore education major, said. “She’s the only reason why I come to Winnick. I don’t necessarily like coming and eating here, so it makes it a little bit better when you come in and have a friendly face sitting at the door,” she added.
Martis considers it her job to get to know the students who visit. “If I see someone two or three times a day and I don’t know them, know who they are, that’s shame on me,” she said. “That means I’m not doing my job.
”By saying nice things to greet students when they come in, Martis feels confident in the relationships she’s been able to establish with them. “I have to be positive. If they have a pretty dress on, [I] say ‘Oh, you look so nice today,” Martis said. She takes it upon herself to perform a motherly role for students. 
“They don’t have a mother here anymore, they’re away from their home environment,” she said. If a student seems to be feeling down, Martis makes sure to ask if they’re okay and offer words of encouragement.
Her duties include making coffee for those who visit for breakfast and lunch, checking in students with their ID’s, counting money, and ensuring visitors follow proper procedures for taking out food. Martis has worked as a cashier for five years and previously worked for Aramark for seven years as kitchen staff preparing food.
Marits has had several different careers over the years. “I was a graphic designer for years. I worked in publishing for 20 years, I was an art director, I went into advertising for about 20 years,” she said. Martis helped publish college textbooks from various companies including Hawthorne-Rowe and Macmillan. She directed art for advertisements for corporate accounts including Haagen-Dazs, Mercedes-Benz and Rolls Royce. 
The incorporation of computers and newer technologies had a large impact on Martis’ work as an art director. “When I worked in a studio and [supervised] 20 people and had 15 freelancers, it got narrowed down,” she said. “We used Photoshop; we didn’t need delivery guys for the New York Times newspapers. We got smaller and smaller.” Eventually, she found herself working for one person. Martis left the position after being instructed to collect ac-counts. “I would have made my own company if I was going to go out and get accounts,” she said. Afterwards, she was hired to work on campus. 
“When I was growing up, since I was 16, my mother was in the food line, my family used to do catering, so it was a natural progression,” Martis said about working in food service. She finds the position to be much less stressful than her previous jobs. 
Having spent two years studying abroad in Nice, France, Martis makes a point to ensure international students feel welcomed by greeting them in their native languages. “Since I studied in a foreign country, I know lots of times if someone would speak to me in English and say good morning to me, it opened me up more, I felt more relaxed,” Martis said. 
Though she enjoys her job, Martis hopes to retire soon and relocate abroad from Long Island with her husband. “We’ll have a better quality of life, to be able to spend our money traveling more and doing things we want.”

Assistant News Editor
 A feeling of intimidation rushed over me as I looked up at the 52-story New York Times building early Friday morning. Knowing I was about to attend their Student Newspaper Editor’s Workshop was a surreal moment; it’s every aspiring journalist’s dream. I expected to acquire the skills and tools necessary to succeed in the business, but I never anticipated leaving on the whim that the most prestigious newspaper in the world is preparing to digress from its institutional language and format in an effort to save itself – from itself, and the ever-evolving media landscape. And who better to help guide them than the demographic they’re trying to reach: Generation Z. 
The stress gradually dissipated as I realized we weren’t just there to learn from world renowned editors and reporters; this was a discussion about the future of journalism; we were all there as equals; students and mentors alike, together as one unit, to protect and save the fourth estate. 
Lindsey Underwood, editor of The Edit, a newsletter created by The Times for college students and recent grads, helped generate a campaign called “Gen Z: In Their Own Words.” 
Gen Z is the most diverse generation yet, and they’re the first to never know a world without the internet or smart phones. Underwood’s project tapped into the minds of teens and young adults by asking 995 of them what it is that makes them different from their friends. The newsletter published their answers, along with their photos, their hometown, their age, and the pronoun they identify with. The work is a reflection of feedback from young readers, according to Underwood. The Times is attempting to rescue the next generation from tribal echo-chambers generating “fake news” consisting of “alternative facts.”
The Times has been printing “all the news that’s fit to print” since 1851, and since then, it has remained committed to an authoritative voice and an avoidance of sensationalism to preserve its traditional values and reputation. But the speed of information is picking up quickly, according to Sam Dolnick, who over-sees The Times’ audio report, as well as its work in film, television and other digital products. The news no longer has the time to wait for cold language and long print; it’s been alienated for a more conversational tone and platform. Readers want transparency. They’re in search of that human element from whoever is speaking to them. After all, we’re living in a time where everyone is a micro-blogger with a desire to be heard.
During Dolnick’s workshop, he introduced us to what he considers to be modern journalism. “Reading a quote is one thing,” he said, “but to hear and see it is a whole other experience.” He helped launch The Daily – a twenty-minute podcast that delivers the news before 6 a.m., Monday through Friday. The show’s host Michael Barbaro, represents the human factor, asking the questions the readers want the answers to. 
Dolnick stresses though, that while the paper is trying to import digital values into its print work, it must also include its tradition of rigorous reporting in its visual and audio formats. 
“It’s a thrilling time to be a journalist….it’s liberating,” Dolnick said. “People care about journalism a lot more now than they did five or six years ago.” 
But keeping the attention of readers is a conundrum that institutional news outlets face. It requires careful tweaking of conventional journalism. Editors and reporters must steer clear of headlines that may be mistaken for clickbait, while also giving readers and subscribers a reason to come back more often. 
Megan Louttit, deputy editor at The Times’ metro desk, believes the answer is a balance between photos and texts that work together to tell a story. She’s currently experimenting with Snapchat’s stories section, in which she incorporates reader’s tweets to reinforce the reported information. If The New York Times wants to reach Gen Z, platforms such as Snapchat are the key.
Now, the journalist in me must offer this disclaimer: I’m not a member of Gen Z. I guess I land somewhere between Generation Y and being a millennial. I’m a pro at Facebook and Instagram, but I too struggle at times to understand my classmates and how they think – but as time goes on, I get better at it. 
I recall dreaming about one day seeing a story of mine featured in the New York Times. I can remember being stuck on the side of the road without a cellphone; I remember needing a newspaper to find out what time a movie starts at the cineplex; and I remember waiting in front of the stereo for my favorite song to play so I could record it on a cassette tape. 
Traditional journalism has been undermined by the virtual-social world that changes so fast, us older folk can’t keep up. Gen Z is compiled of technologically savvy, young adults with media stamina. I hope they understand the importance of newspapers such as The New York Times, which include verifiable, thorough, “boots on the ground” reporting – because without it, the truth will become something we all remember.

Such a great article!
Print news is so important!
That is great that the New York Times felt it so important to include GenX!

Alpha Xi Delta is hosting its AmaXIng Challenge on April 28 to support Autism Speaks, autism advocacy organization. This is the third year the event has been held. Although last year’s event was held in Eisenhower Park, this year, it will be on campus. 
“We really had to fight for approval to do it
[on campus], but it will be a lot more
successful and a lot more accommodating for
the students,” philanthropy vice president of
Alpha Xi Delta, Elizabeth Pavese, said. Pavese
and her sisters have been hard at work setting
up the 5K.

“Everything will be held on the Great Lawn.
The trail for the 5K is in the Hillwood
Commons and Pell Hall vicinity,” Pavese said.
The event is open to anyone and is autism
friendly. Participants can walk or run.

“We will be having face painting, popcorn,
crafts, refreshments, and sensory rooms, areas
that serve as safe environments for people
using them to explore and interact without
risk, inside Hillwood Commons,” Pavese said.

With this year’s 5K being on-campus, the
sisters of Alpha Xi Delta encourage students to
come out and support Autism Speaks and
participate in the 5K. “We’ve been reaching out
to all the clubs and organizations on campus
and urging them to make teams and if they
don’t want to make teams, then they can sign
up as individuals,” Pavese said.

“I plan on being there and I’ve been spreading the word to my brothers in Sigma Alpha Epsilon about it and have been telling them to sign-up as well,” Justin Romano, secretary chair of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said. “We’re Greek Week partners with Alpha Xi Delta. So, as a fraternity, we’re going to show our support to not only Alpha Xi Delta, but for their partner Autism Speaks and do everything we can to help out the ladies of Alpha Xi Delta,” Romano said. 
“We’re very excited for this 5K. Everyone’s
been working hard and we can’t wait to see
how it turns out,” sophomore theatre major,
Leigh Dillon, a member of the sorority, said.
The event is open to the entire community. All
proceeds go to Autism Speaks. Participants
can register for the 5K at 9 a.m. on April 28 on
the Great Lawn or contact one of the sisters in
Alpha Xi Delta to register in advance. The run
will begin at 10 a.m. rain or shine.

Adjunct theater professors Lauren Reinhard and David Apichell directed the theater department’s Freshman Showcase. After auditions in December, they divided the freshman class of 50 students into two groups for the show. Reinhard is responsible for 26 students while Apichell for 24 students.
Reinhard is an alumna of the theatre department who has been an acting teacher for three years on campus. She has directed over 50 shows, and this is the eighth Freshman Showcase she directed. Aside from the Freshman Showcase, she teaches both Basic Acting and Devised Theatre.
Reinhard has been passionate about theatre since elementary school, when she started participating in school plays. She chose theatre because all of the different professions, or anything she wanted to be in life, can be done on a stage through her art, she said.
Reinhard’s portion of the Freshman Showcase is called “Ovations and Odysseys,” which is a collection of 10 minute single-act plays. Having two showcases as well as having 10-minute portions was “the best way that we can accommodate the class sizes and it is the best way to give everyone a substantive part,” Reinhard said. 
Reinhard described the overarching theme for “Ovations and Odysseys” as fear. The theme was chosen based on what the students are going through or feeling, and fear was a common theme Reinhard saw among the freshman class this year. 
Reinhard discussed fear and the journey of moving away from their fears with the freshmen. “We discussed how they live their most authentic lives because that is the only way that you really can make real art, out of a place of truth,” Reinhard said, 
Apichell attended Penn State for his undergraduate degree, and he attended Post for graduate school. He has taught and directed on campus for the past two years. This is Apichell’s second year directing the Freshmen Showcase, and his third year as part of the directing team. 
“I think I got involved with theatre because it is a place you can just be yourself, with no judgment. Theatre is a very accepting and inclusive group,” Apichell said. 
Apichell’s show, “Clinging on Closely,” is based on “the end of the world” with a theme that “darkness can lead you to light,” he said. Apichell came up with these themes by discussing with his students what it was like to be freshmen in college, and to be away from home for the first time. 
“As I talked to the freshmen, I realized they have this anxiety and fear put upon them with no fault to themselves, but because of things they see in the news and the system in general, they’re carrying this burden; in the theatre all they have is each other,” he said. Apichell said a lot of his 10-minute-plays in the Freshmen Showcase have death in them, but not all of them are sad; some are comedic. 
The Freshman Showcase opens April 11 at 7:30 p.m. with Reinhard’s production, and Apichell’s production on April 12 at 7:30 p.m. Each show is about two hours long, with a 15 minute intermission. Tickets can be purchased for free online at www.tix55.com/ptc700, or at the Little Theatre Box office.

The Student Activities Board (SAB) hosted the 6th annual Relay for Life event in the Pratt Recreation Center on April 4. Julia Pagano, residence director and coordinator, helped set-up and organize this event with help from some volunteers staff and some students. 
Relay for Life is the signature fundraiser for the American Cancer Society. It is a team fundraising event at which team members take turns walking around a track to signify that cancer never sleeps. The money raised through Relay for Life events help strengthen the American Cancer Society’s mission; to save lives and celebrate life. Donations are used to fund cancer research, patient support programs, prevention education, and treatment programs. 
“All students from Greek Organizations and student clubs, several different departments on campus like Enrollment Services, Center For Healthy Living, Athletics, and LIU Promise, and numerous students from the LIU Post student body, participated this year,” Pagano said. 
During the event, speakers came up and talked to the people in attendance about how cancer has somehow impacted their lives. James Sinclair, LIU Post alumnus and cancer survivor, told his story of how he was diagnosed with cancer and is now a cancer survivor. 
“When you hear everyone’s story of how they were impacted by cancer, really makes you want to do more, to try and beat this disease,” Sigma Alpha Epsilon treasurer, Joe Sear, a sophomore accounting major, said. 
Participants made their way to the track in the Pratt Recreation Center for their walk in support of the American Cancer Society. After that, the people were able to walk the smaller track in the middle of the Pratt, play different games, and visit the different clubs and organizations that had tables to help raise money for Relay for Life. 
This year’s event raised just over $40,000 for the American Cancer Society,” Pagano said. “Every year the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon do all they can to help out, donate, and support the American Cancer Society,” said Sear. 
“It was a great turn out. Over 500 students
attended the event,” Pagano said.
