Students at Post began the school year with updated walkways and multiple areas undergoing renovations. Students welcome these additions, but with the lengthy construction times, the beauty of campus is seemingly tainted by piles of bricks and caution tape. 
Despite the hindrances there’s still areas to be appreciated. Senior art education major Loredana Citizen has noticed various improvements with the pavers around campus. 
“The first renovation I noticed was with the brick paths outside of Hillwood Commons. There used to be a hole in the concrete by the side doors of Hillwood. I would have to take a big step to avoid it, but now the hole is gone,” Citizen says. 
Although this is a welcome change, there are other areas Citizen would prefer to see improved. Her main concern being the lack of sidewalks across Gold Coast Road.
As an art student, Citizen has multiple classes in the sculpture building located on the other side of campus. Like many other dormers, Citizen does not have a car and she can not always rely on the Shark Shuttle to bring her to class on time.
Her only option is taking the strenuous walk along the streets of Gold Coast Road. 
“If I have to walk to the sculpture building I have to walk half on the street, half on this little patch of grass,”Citizen says. I wish the school put its funding towards a sidewalk instead of bricks around campus.”
Although the updated brickwork enhances campus beauty, there are still many areas being renovated. Some students feel this is inconvenient. This is evident by the Pell Hall Life Science building, which has been under construction for multiple semesters. 
“It’s ugly. I don’t know how long it takes to make a building but it seems like it’s taking a long time,” Citizen says.
Citizen recounts the Pell Hall construction interfering with her film photography class during her fall semester of 2021. 
“They destroyed the photography dark room last year, meaning my film photography class switched to regular photography,” Citizen says.
This change came after many students already bought film cameras and other materials for the course. 
The film professor was not made aware of the dark room demolition. 
“[Campus construction] also messed with the ceramic buildings’ water for a while. We couldn’t get water- which is something you need for ceramics,” Citizen states.
The water issue has since been resolved but the area surrounding the ceramics building remains fenced off as construction continues. 
The construction of the Pell Hall building has taken a while to make noticeable progress. However this semester the construction workers seem to be ramping up production. 
Freshman nursing major Antonina Carollo believes the construction is getting done really fast, and these changes are enhancing campus beauty.
“It looks really good. I feel like once [Pell Hall] is done it’s going to be completely gorgeous,” Carollo says.
Carollo has a three hour lab class in Pell Hall. Although she doesn’t mind the appearance of the building, the noise is hard to ignore. 
“It could be a little bit distracting with the noise. In class especially you can hear the outside construction going on. It is what it is,” Carollo says. 
Despite this issue, Carollo is pleased with the efforts being made to improve campus. This may be the year Pell Hall is finally completed.

Rapper PnB Rock died after he was shot while eating at Roscoe’s Chicken & Waffles in Los Angeles, Calif. with his girlfriend.
The Philadelphia rapper was pronounced dead in Los Angeles. area hospital Monday, where he was rushed just minutes after the shooting.
A lot of sources from social media and news articles tells us the shooter appeared to have targeted PnB in a robbery. PnB supposedly posted a video of himself wearing expensive jewelry earlier in the day.
LIU football player Caleb Nartey was devastated by this news as PnB was from around his area. 
“It’s crazy because a day before his shooting I was watching his snippets from a few songs he posted on Instagram,” Nartey said. “Then when I heard he got shot I thought it was trolls on the internet that were being immature. But it popped up literally everywhere and caught me in shock.”
The girlfriend of late rapper, Sibounheuang was on the receiving end of a mountain of hatred after news broke of her boyfriend’s shooting death on Monday. The two had been dining at a Roscoe’s Chicken & Waffles at the time, and Sibounheuang had tagged the restaurant’s location in a since-deleted Instagram picture of her meal.
After receiving backlash for the post because a lot of people believe that she “set” PnB Rock for his death, Sibounheuang deactivated her personal Instagram account, which reportedly had nearly 700,000 followers.
“There have been multiple posts that I have seen on the internet of messages that she sent the killer details and was paying him like he was a hit man.” LIU Gymnast Alana Ricketts explained. “I don’t know if the messages were from her or if it was fake but I saw it everywhere on my feed, and the fact she never posted where the location was until that day and instantly deleted it just makes it more suspicious.”  
Even New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) talked about the rapper’s death.
“Saddened by the passing of rapper PnB Rock, who died earlier today due to a senseless act of gun violence,” the governor tweeted. “PnB Rock was a star in the industry. Sending our condolences to his friends and family during this time.”
PnB Rock moved to L.A. from Philadelphia after signing a record deal with Atlantic Records following his 2014 debut mixtape. His stage name refers to a street corner in the Philly neighborhood where he grew up, Pastorius and Baynton.
Over the years, PnB Rock has collaborated with artists including Ed Sheeran, Chance the Rapper, Wiz Khalifa, 2 Chainz, Kodak Black, Young Thug and A Boogie wit da Hoodie.
In addition to his numerous mixtapes, PnB Rock released two studio albums: 2017’s “Catch These Vibes” and 2019’s “TrapStar Turnt PopStar.”
PnB Rock has two daughters, Milan and Xuri, who he shared with Steph, his girlfriend. They are all devastated and heartbroken about the horrible news about their father. 
Supposedly the suspect that robbed and killed PnB is still on the loose, but there are sources that say they have some evidence to trace the suspect down and find him.

The Student Body Collective (SBC) on campus, formerly known as the Student Body Boutique, has had a massive rebrand. 
Marketing Director, junior marketing major Gina Symes, gave some insight into the work that went into the rebrand. Symes assumed her role at the start of the fall 2022 semester.
“Our rebrand was the transition from The Student Body Boutique to The Student Body Collective. Since starting the boutique, it has blossomed into something more diverse. Our name had to change to fit this diversity, as we now offer our students far more than just clothes. We felt “boutique” no longer represented our brand, as it sounds expensive, old and overly sophisticated,” Symes said.
Symes went on to define the central message of SBC.
“The Student Body Collective is, at its core, “by students, for students.” It is the collective effort, creativity, and passion of its members, brought to fruition. Additionally, The Student Body Collective is ever-changing, just like our students,” Symes said.
The SBC store, which is a student-run business, is located in Hillwood Commons. Symes shared more information about what is sold in the store and what students can expect.
“Our store is made up of our clothing, dorm decor, accessories, and our “re-threads collection” (thrifted clothing). We have recently incorporated some exciting sustainable products as well,” Symes explained.
Along with the rebrand, SBC now has a new CEO: junior fashion merchandising major Anna Johnson. Johnson has big aspirations for the future of SBC while she’s in the role, and long after.
“We’re really moving towards the message of inclusivity. We want everyone to feel welcome here; to feel like they have something they could buy here, and to feel comfortable in the store. I think it’s for a new generation. We want this store to be relevant for all the future classes to come at LIU and to continue progressing our image,” Johnson said.
Johnson further described the core values of SBC and how she intends to further actualize them while she inhabits the role of CEO.
“Our three pillars are sustainability, affordability and inclusivity. And, I really want to work on the inclusivity piece. We have a lot left to do in terms of size, bringing in curvy clothing, and being representative of all different body shapes and sizes in our marketing. And eventually, I would love to have menswear in the store and unisex clothing, gender neutral clothing as well,” Johnson said.
However, Johnson explained that balancing the three pillars of the organization is not always an easy task.
“It is really hard but that’s my goal in my position. Eventually, I’d love to create something that’s for everyone and priced reasonably, but it’s tricky,” Johnson said.
In line with their sustainability pillar, the SBC makes a conscious effort to source the products sold in the store from brands that value sustainability and ethical sourcing of materials. Moreover, the “re-threads” collection at the store which is made up entirely of second-hand clothing also furthers the SBC’s drive towards sustainability.
Johnson shed more light on the work that goes into buying clothing for the store and how the SBC board navigates trends and personal taste.
“I think that each CEO that comes into the store has their influence on the overall vibe of the store. But in terms of trends, we–our buying team–do trend research before we buy clothing. We have a lot of fashion students on our e-board and we’re always doing our own experimentation with fashion based upon what we see on TikTok and what we see other people wearing. So, it’s kind of a collection of our general knowledge, as well as online information,” Johnson said.
The SBC store is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.. They can also be found on Instagram (@thestudentbody_liu) for more information about their projects.

On Saturday, Sept. 10, the LIU Sharks football team witnessed one of the best individual performances in program history. 
Victor Nelson Jr., a redshirt sophomore from Gainesville, Fla., picked up three interceptions versus FCS’ fifth-ranked Villanova University. This is the first time in Division I history that a Sharks’ player has recorded the tally and the first time since 2018 the feat was accomplished for LIU. 
The 6-foot-4, 209-pound defensive back had four interceptions through the first two games of the Sharks season, which happened to be his first two starts in his college career. 
In an interview with WCWP, LIU sharks head coach Ron Cooper talked about what separates Nelson Jr. from everyone else. 
“Vick is a very talented guy, you know. I saw it probably from day two or three in spring practice when he didn’t even play last year. He’s been on the team, special teams, but he’s tall, he’s long, he’s got range,” Cooper said. “Most importantly, [Nelson Jr.] is a smart kid, smart athlete and understands the scheme and those formations.”
Nelson Jr. committed to the LIU football program after former Sharks quarterback Camden Orth suggested he come to New York and join the up-and-coming first group of Division I Sharks. 
As Nelson Jr. described in his interview with WCWP, coming to LIU wasn’t his first option. 
“I actually was a transfer from the Air Force Academy assigned to the Air Force out of high school, and I ended up parting ways with the Academy because I couldn’t be a chiropractor there,” he said. “So I wanted to be a chiropractor and aspired to be a chiropractor at first, so I decided to move elsewhere and play college ball somewhere else.”
Victor Nelson Jr., who is now studying to take the MCAT and pursue a career as a doctor, is tied first in interceptions in the FCS and is looking forward to reaching bigger goals as a football player. 
“I have small intermittent goals and bigger goals upon that, but I guess right now it’s being all NEC, is what I can say off the top of my head,” the star defensive back said. “I mean, I want more picks. I got an interception, I want more, so I wanna lead the NEC in interceptions this year. Ultimately, the goal of any college football player is to go to the league.” 
Not only has Nelson Jr. been confident in himself, but others around him have noticed his development throughout the season so far. Defensive Coordinator Kevin Cosgrove spoke to WCWP about his pride in seeing players like Nelson Jr. develop under his coaching. 
“You like to see the kids improve. It’s probably one of the best things in coaching. When you can watch a kid develop and become a player, you see what he can be,” Cosgrove said. “It just makes you feel good as a coach because that’s what our job is. Whatever talent of a player you have, you have to try and get them to become the best player they can be.” 
Headed by Victor Nelson Jr.’s hot start to the season, the Sharks are looking to make their first NEC playoff tournament in Division I history with conference games beginning on Oct. 1. 
Though the Sharks are winless on the season, head coach Ron Cooper detailed what Nelson Jr. and the rest of the Sharks’ mentality are going into conference action. 
“Well, the guys are getting better; they’re working hard. I don’t have complaints about their attitudes, and they definitely want to win and get better. It’s time now, these games are very important.”
Victor Nelson Jr. and the Sharks will look to get their first win of the season when they travel to North Andover, MA, to face the Merrimack Warriors on Saturday, Oct. 1, at 1 p.m. Listen to a live broadcast on 88.1 FM WCWP.org or The Wave.

As expected from the rollercoaster of the NFL offseason, Week 1 consisted of familiar faces on new teams, such as Tyreek Hill on the Miami Dolphins, Davante Adams on the Las Vegas Raiders, Russel Wilson on the Denver Broncos and many more finally playing for their new squads with the common goal of raising the Lombardi Trophy next February. 
After one week of play, more questions were raised for teams instead of answers due to NFL Week 1 giving football fans upsets, incredible comebacks, missed field goals and of course, ties. 
The NFL started with a huge amount of great games. The first game on Thursday, Sept. 8, to open the season was a game between a Super Bowl contender for this year, the Buffalo Bills, vs. the previous Super Bowl winners, the Los Angeles Rams. 
Buffalo put up a great fight. Josh Allen passed for 297 yards while accounting for four touchdowns, Von Miller had two of Buffalo’s seven sacks, and the Bills stamped themselves as a clear contender for the Super Bowl with a 31-10 victory over Los Angeles.
Von Miller spoke to the media after the game and reassured how important of a victory this was, despite it only being the first game of the year.
“We’re going to make the plane do backflips on the way home tonight,” Miller said. “We’re going to celebrate this win because you have to, but then we’re going to go back to the lab.” 
Another Week 1 matchup fans were anticipating was the Steelers and Bengals. The Steelers’ defense was phenomenal against the 2021 Super Bowl contenders Cincinnati Bengals.
Steelers’ safety Minkah Fitzpatrick had different plans for Bengals’ quarterback Joe Burrow’s first time back on the field. An interception on the first play from scrimmage resulted in Pittsburgh’s first score of the season. Turnovers continued to haunt Cincinnati’s franchise quarterback. T.J Watt, Cameron Sutton, and Ahkello Witherspoon contributed to the Steelers’ interception total. 
If it wasn’t Joe Borrow throwing turnovers, it was pressure from the Pittsburgh defense. They accumulated seven sacks and a forced fumble from Alex Highsmith, which increased the takeaway total to five. Unfortunately, Star linebacker TJ Watt suffered a pectoral injury in that game that has him out 6-7 weeks for the Steelers.
Die-hard Steelers fans such as Youtuber Steve Linkowski was shocked at the outcome.
 “I’m at a loss for words. I still don’t know how we won that game,” Linkowski said. 
After a previously missed field goal by Chris Boswell, he was able to redeem himself and make a 53 yard field goal to win the game for Pittsburg. 
A bunch of primetime players started their first week of the season off on the right foot with their new NFL teams. Von Miller recorded two sacks and four tackles in his debut for the Bills. Davante Adams had 141 yards receiving and a touchdown in his debut for the Raiders. A.J. Brown had 10 receptions for 155 yards in his debut for the Eagles and Matt Ryan had 352 yards passing and a touchdown in his debut for the Colts. 
The New York Giants shocked the NFL with their performance in their 21-20 victory against the Tennessee Titans. Saquon Barkley returned back into form with 165 yards and a touchdown. Big Blue was down 13-0 at halftime, with things looking bleak due to quarterback Daniel Jones’ fumble that led to a field goal after. Then Barkley starts the half with a 68 yard run and follows up with a four-yard touchdown. Next drive Daniel Jones hit Sterling Sheppard for a 65-yard touchdown pass to tie the game up 13-13. After allowing a touchdown to fall behind, the Giants converted on their next drive with a touchdown, and then a two-point conversion sealed the deal. 
Lifelong Giants fan and sports Youtuber was ecstatic about the victory.
” What the Giants did was really encouraging. They pulled out a win that they really had no business doing, the game was over several times, but they still somehow pulled it out,” Jaxson said. “Brian Daboll (Giants Head Coach) is really gutsy.” 
The New York Giants are off to a very hot start, winning their first two games of the season. Running back Saquan Barkley is looking like his rookie self and producing big-time stats around as he is the leading rusher with 39 attempts, 236 rushing yards and a touchdown over the first two games.
The New York Jets are opening eyes as well, as they picked up two rookies that are showing their talents and making a name for themselves, Breece Hall and Garret Wilson. Quarterback Joe Flacco threw for 307 yards and 4 touchdowns, with Wilson acquiring 102 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns in their 31-30 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Breece Hall led the team in rushes for 7 carries and 50 rushing yards.

On Wednesday, Sep. 23, one of the most prolific baseball players in history, Albert Pujols, hit his 700th career home run cementing his Hall Of Fame legacy in the MLB. 
 Following his two home runs against the Dodgers’ pitchers Andrew Heaney and Phil Bickford, Pujols became just the fourth player in MLB history to hit the 700 homer mark, only behind Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, and Babe Ruth.
At age 42, there was some doubt from MLB fans that Albert Pujols would even have a chance to hit the magic number due to COVID-19 eliminating 100+ games from the 2020 season. 
Pujols had a tremendous career with the St. Louis Cardinals from 2001-2011 before signing with the Los Angeles Angels, where he played for the next decade. 
The 3-time MVP, 11-time all-star, and 2-time World Series champion stated earlier in the season at a press conference that upon signing a one-year deal worth $2,500,000, he would be retiring at the end of the season with the original team that drafted him, the Cardinals.
Junior adolescent education major specializing in history, Ryan Kaim, even had his doubts when it came to Albert’s chase for 700. 
“At the beginning of the year, I’d have to say I didn’t expect Albert to reach his 700th. He hadn’t hit over 20 homers since 2019 and 30 or more since 2016, so to expect him to his 21 in about half as many at-bats as he usually would get as an everyday player isn’t anything but miraculous,” Kaim said. 
Pujols’ chase for MLB history was fueled by one of the best two-month stretches for a designated hitter/bench player in recent memory. In August and September, following the MLB All-star game, Pujols hit a whopping .304 batting avg (BA) and had an on-base + slugging (OPS) over 1.000, including 14 home runs. 
The future hall of fame righty is also batting an insane .354 with 13 home runs and an OPS over 1.150 versus left-handed pitching this season, which allowed him to get regular at-bats. 
Senior digital arts and design major Anthony Hines, who has watched MLB baseball religiously since 2014, thinks that Albert Pujols has certain qualities that set him apart from the rest of the MLB. Hines stated that Pujols’ love of the game, his drive, and overall dependability, alongside his track record, kept his longevity and lasting success in the MLB. 
Pujols has played for 22 years in the major leagues and is now looking for his third World Series Victory with the Cardinals. Paired alongside Starting Pitcher Adam Wainwright and Catcher Yadier Molina, who made history this season as well, when they became the MLB record holder for starts made as a battery with 325, the Cardinals clinched a postseason birth when they won the National League Central Division. 
Now, as a final playoff run as a trio, Pujols, Wainwright and Molina are looking to make a splash in the playoffs. Kaim believes these three veterans paired up with other superstar talent is a team to watch in October.
“With Wainwright, Molina, and Pujols all heading into their last season, I expect the Cards to play with a ferocity and energy not seen for a while,” Kaim said. “They have heated up as of late and can clearly be a threat. Pujols will probably hit around a .300 clip and may send a bomb or two.” 
Albert Pujols may be one of the last few members of the 700 home run club for many years. Anthony Hines’ reaction to Pujols’ moment best describes the general reaction to one of baseball’s best. 
“My honest reaction was absolute disbelief and pure joy seeing one of the greatest hitters of all time reaching one of the most impressive feats in all of baseball,” Hines said.

As the Major League Baseball (MLB) season enters its last few weeks, most eyes are on the playoff race, but there is another thing that has been getting a lot of attention, and that is who will become MVP of the American League (AL) in the 2022 season. 
Currently, the players competing for the award are Shohei Ohtani, the two-way player for Los Angeles Angels, and Aaron Judge, the star outfielder for the New York Yankees.
As of now, Shohei Ohtani has 34 home runs, which is 4th in the AL. He also has 93 runs batted in (RBI), a .271 batting average (AVG), and a .358 on-base percentage (OBP).
In addition to his impressive hitting statistics, he has 14 wins as a pitcher as well. 
If he wins the MVP award, it would be the second consecutive year he has won, which would make him the first player to do so since Miguel Cabrera in 2012 and 2013. This would be a great accomplishment for the 28-year-old Japanese phenom.
On the other hand, Aaron Judge has 60 home runs, which is first place in AL. He also has 128 RBI, .314 AVG, and .422 OBP. Judge is on pace to break the all-time record for home runs in the AL, which is currently 61, a record held by Yankees legend Roger Maris, who accomplished this in 1961. If he were to win the MVP this year, it would be his first time winning the award. Judge is currently on pace to win the Triple Crown in the AL. To do this, a player must finish first in BA, home runs and RBIs. Judge would be the first to win the Triple Crown since Miguel Cabrera’s MVP in 2012. Ted Williams was the last player who achieved the Triple Crown but was not voted MVP, all the way back in 1947.
Both of their historic seasons are worthy of the MVP award, and both are accomplishing unprecedented feats.
Senior business management major at the University of Hawaii, Erick Shinjou,  who has been a fan of Ohtani since he was in Japan, believes there shouldn’t be a debate about who is the AL MVP. 
“Now, Shohei is both pitching and hitting. On the other hand, Aaron Judge is just hitting,” Shinjou said. “For these facts, it is clear that Shohei is more deserving of the MVP than Aaron Judge.”
On the other hand, junior business management at California State University, Takuto Kataoka, who is a fan of the New York Yankees, expressed a different opinion. 
“I understand what Shohei is doing now is certainly amazing and unreal, and I know it is not easy to do. However, what Aaron Judge is doing now is an event that will change history,” Kataoka said. “If he continues to hit home runs, he will break a league record and make a new history in the MLB. Thus, the MVP of this year is Judge.”
In these ways, there are various opinions about the MVP, as it is one of the closest races we have seen in many years. Both Ohtani and Judge are having historic seasons, which will go down in MLB history as memories for the next generation to hear about.

Nathan Fielder is a Canadian born comedian and performance artist. He’s been making a name for himself with surreal and anti humor based comedy since 2006. However, it was his Comedy Central series “Nathan for You,” which ran from 2013 to 2017, that put him on the map with comedy fans.
Viewers of the show identify the originality of “Nathan for You” as the major factor that made them fans of Fielder.
 “There aren’t many shows that really make you laugh, Nathan for You really found that niche and stuck to it,” said super fan and local man Tim Riordan. 
The comedian’s new show, “The Rehearsal”, on HBO MAX, feels like a natural expansion of his previous work. The premise is that he and his staff “help”” people with their problems by making them rehearse whatever life event  is the most anxiety inducing for them. The main narrative arc, for example, involves a woman fake aising a fake child and this takes up many of the episodes.
  Watching the show, it’s not just the host Fielder we observe, the guests he has on are incredibly absorbing. Seeing a small window into these eccentric individuals is fascinating as the audience quietly judge their lives.
The term “Un-reality TV” has been thrown around to describe this program and others such as “Borat”. Despite the unscripted nature of the show, much of the humor comes from pushing boundaries to create an uncomfortable reaction. This can make the show hard to watch at points but it also invites speculation by blurring the lines between what is planned by Fielderand what is completely unprompted. Watching the bleed in between Nathan Fielder, the TV persona and Nathan Fielder the human can keep viewers invested. 
There are a few moments where you can see him on the edge of breaking character, scenes of vulnerability where he is uncomfortable or even scared. The socially awkward Fielder is occasionally injected with more directed sarcastic and blunt humor, this brings into question his intentions, is he really in for the benefit of others or his own selfish desires? 
Fans of the show speculated on Fielder’s motives while viewing the show: questioning whether or not he had good intentions or was manipulating the participants.
“I fully respect the hypothesis that Nathan is the Devil. There’s just so much that he does throughout the show that supports the theory. He looks so unassuming and so kind, but reins chaos everywhere he goes in the most subtle and passively aggressive way,” Riodrian stated.
There are many candid moments spread out, wacky conversations, and violent arguments are caught on tape here, even moments of genuine tenderness unfold on screen. 
Despite helping others with their problems, Fielder is someone who is shown to suffer from his own self doubt and has to rehearse many scenes before he enacts them. The joke is not just on the people Nathan brings in, the joke is also on the audience. There are many bizarre and surreal scenes without authentic people where the viewer is left with the uncomfortableness.
Not everyone is a fan of this genre bending work however, Christine Lake who enjoyed Nathan For You had issues with the Rehearsal’s approach. 
“The first episode, I was totally on board, it was self aware and inventive […] After that, they manipulated it a little too much, almost too manufactured,” Lake stated. 
While the program is certainly unique, it’s certainly not for everyone, with many bizarre and uncomfortable moments. Some viewers find it hard to fully immerse themselves in it.
   “I didn’t get it in some ways,” Lake said. 
But in the end, the value of the show is determined by each viewer and something as offbeat as this comes around so rarely that it is worth checking out with an open mind.

On Sept. 16, it was announced that the Broadway play, “Phantom of the Opera” will be closing on Feb. 18 shortly after its 35th anniversary, making it the longest running show in Broadway history. 
Andrew Lloyd Weber’s iconic adaptation based on the 1909 French novel of the same name has been a staple of theater and New York culture for decades and many are shocked to see it go.
 “I didn’t expect it, Phantom was one of those things that was always there and [seemed as though] it would always be there,” said senior theater major, Alia Gonzalez.
  The show was wildly successful during its initial start in 1988 and has run for 13,525 shows in the Majestic Theater as of Sept. 27. It has won 7 Tony Awards, including best musical and its official soundtrack has sold over 4 million copies.
The story follows a 19th century Opera House in Paris tormented by a mysterious menace who is fixated on one of the cast members and will stop at nothing to have her.
   The musical also popularized the villainous Erik’s half-faced mask, whereas previous adaptations, including the 1925 and 1943 theatrical adaptations of the book, had a mask that covered his entire face. 
It’s been clarified that disappointing ticket sales after the COVID-19 pandemic has been the main factor in finally pulling the plug on the decades old show. 
The current run of The Phantom of The Opera is also notable for having one of the protagonists, Christine Daee, be played by Emilie Kouatchou, the first woman of color to take on the role.
While the musical will no longer be performed in the Majestic theater, there are still other possible ways to see it such as its London and Australian productions. It’s not too late to get tickets in New York either, but sales have skyrocketed since the announcement.
“I think it’s something that you should see once if you are interested in learning about theater since it defined Broadway, so you might regret it if you don’t see it,” Gonzalez said.
Not everyone in the theater community was shaken by this news, however.  
“I didn’t even realize it was still running,” sophomore theater major Teddy Brock said.
Brock firmly believes there are better plays to see in the city this year.
 “Honestly, I don’t think it was that great of a show, it’s definitely iconic, it’s one of those things where they had a great run, godspeed,” he stated. 
There has been worry that Phantom’s closing could overshadow other new productions or set a grim tone for Broadway’s future after the pandemic.
Even fans of the show admit that the play may be challenging to absorb for newcomers.  
“It’s also not a production I’d recommend to everyone since there are other pieces on Broadway that are more entertaining than Phantom, but if you are looking for a classic theater experience, see Phantom, I really enjoyed the older production techniques utilized, which aren’t seen as frequently,” Gonzalez said.
It is currently unknown what will replace the Phantom of the Opera at the Majestic theater.

The Broadway production of “Funny Girl” first opened its doors at the Winter Garden Theater on March 26, 1964. The musical, starring Barbra Steisand as Fanny Brice, played 1,348 shows until it closed on July 1, 1967. 
Years later, a revival of the show starring Beanie Feldstein opened on Broadway on April 24, 2022. Many fans were excited for Feldstein, but Lea Michele’s name quickly became trending on Twitter due to fans expecting the Glee star to be the frontrunner of the show. 
Once Feldstein was casted, Michele supported her by writing in the comments saying, “Yes! YOU are the greatest star! This is going to be epic!!”
During an interview with Feldstein and Andy Cohen on SiriusXM, they briefly spoke about Michele’s name trending when she announced her role as Fanny Brice. 
“She very sweetly wrote on my Instagram. I don’t know the woman whatsoever,” she said. 
Feldstein performed for a month and a half until she tested positive for Covid in June and was unable to perform. A few days later,  she announced she would be leaving the production and her final performance would be September 25. 
Nearly a month after her announcement, on July 10, Feldstein announced she would be leaving the production much earlier.
“Playing Fanny Brice on Broadway has been a lifelong dream of mine and doing so for the last few months has been a great joy and true honor,” Feldstein wrote. “Once the production decided to take the show in a different direction, I made the extremely difficult decision to step away sooner than anticipated,” Feldstein posted on Instagram. 
Fans of Feldstein were a little disappointed that she didn’t perform a lot of shows.
“I was really looking forward to seeing Beanie on broadway. It felt like she was just getting started until she decided no more. I wish we were able to see more of her,” sophomore musical theatre major Victoria Koechert said.
Jane Lynch, who played Fanny Brices’ mother, annouced she would be leaving the show as well on August 14. Many fans speculated it was because Michele would be taking over and thought the two would not get along after their show Glee. Many co-stars shared that Michele was intolerable to work with, but Lynch shut down those rumors. 
“You know, it was just a really strong idea to have Feldshuh and Michele premiere together. That’s the only reason we won’t appear together. I adore her. She’s just going to take this show and make it her own. I’m so glad she’s getting the opportunity in real life to do the show and not just on Glee,” Lynch said.
Only July 11, Funny Girl confirmed that Lea Michele would be stepping into the role of Fanny Brice with her first performance set for Sept. 6. 
“A dream come true is an understatement. I’m so incredibly honored to join this amazing cast and production and return to the stage playing Fanny Brice on Broadway,” Michele wrote on Instagram. 
Fans of the show and Michele shared in this excitement.
“Finding out Lea Michele was going to be the new Fanny Brice was like a fever dream. I’ve watched Glee growing up so the fact that the show was coming true was insane. Once tickets went on sale, I immediately bought them,” sophomore musical theatre major Grace McNally. 
Since Michele’s announcement, ticket prices have rocketed. Tickets for her opening night were selling in the range of $750 to $2,500. 
“As soon as tickets went on sale, I bought them to see Lea Michele the day after her opening night. I was absolutely mesmerized by her acting and her singing, of course. I hope I’m able to see her perform again soon,”  sophomore Polly Moore said. 
Michele’s opening night was a success. Michele received a total of six standing ovations.
The aisles were packed with audience members raving about Michele’s vocals, acting and the way she carried herself in the performance.

The new trailer for the live action Disney movie “The Little Mermaid” was released on Sept. 9 and there was an outpouring of positive and negative feedback from viewers.
 Halle Bailey, 22, is a Black singer and actress who will be starring as Ariel in the upcoming film. Melissa McCarthy will be playing Ursula, Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric, Javier Bardem as King Triton, Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, Jacob Tremblay as Flounder and Awkwafina as Scuttle.
Although Bailey adapted the green tail, red hair and purple shell bra for the role, there have been complaints directed at Disney for not casting a white actress to match the original 1989 film. The hashtag #NotMyAriel began trending on twitter within 48 hours of the trailer being released. In the trailer, Bailey is seen singing “Part of Your World” and thousands of viewers on YouTube left hateful comments due to the color of her skin.
Many critics of the remake are now falsely using science to justify their reasoning on why Ariel is not Black and Bailey should not have been cast for the role. One critic took to twitter to explain the science behind it. 
“Mermaids live in the ocean. Underwater = limited sunlight. Limited sunlight = less melanin. Less melanin = lighter skin color. Because they live underwater, which has no access to light beyond a certain depth, Ariel and every other mermaid in existence would be albino.” 
Out of the 12 official Disney princesses, seven of them are represented as white, while only one of them is Black. Fans of Disney share their thoughts on how this lack of representation affected them during their childhood.
“Growing up with a darker skin tone, I never felt like I fit in with all the Disney Princesses, beside Princess Tiana. Now, seeing Halle represent all the little girls with colored skin means so much to me! She’s really making a difference in the role with this movie and I’m so excited to watch it when it comes out,” said Kaylah Rivera, Biology major at Hofstra University. 
Trevor Noah responded to the racist backlash on his show, “The Daily Show,” saying, “Once again, a bunch of internet racists are upset that a fictional character is being played by a Black person, and honestly I don’t know what the big deal is.”
Other people that watched the trailer shared this sentiment, questioning why the race of a fictional character in a children’s film is causing such an uproar.
“I find it ridiculous that people are arguing over whether Ariel is white or Black. She’s a fish. Her best friend is a Jamaican crab. Why does it matter? It’s a kids movie and somehow the adults are mad about it,” said senior education major at Queens College Nicole Reyes.
Despite the criticism, there is a lot of positive support for the movie and Bailey especially from children who are typically unrepresented on screen. Parents began to start posting their children’s positive reaction to seeing Bailey perform as Ariel. With many of them saying “She looks like me!” These excited reactions to the new Ariel show the importance of diverse representations. 
Bailey is ignoring the hate comments and is  instead reposting and commenting on the positive responses and videos. 
Fans of the trailer share their delight at seeing the positive reaction from children.
“It’s so heartwarming to see kids get so excited for the new Ariel. They don’t care about the color of her skin, just the fact that she’s a real princess. Adults should learn to react like the kids,” senior education major at Queens College Lauren Hernando said. 
In a recent interview, Bailey discussed her audition process and what it was like to be the new Ariel. 
“I’m so grateful that I kind of get to reinvent Ariel and show other young, beautiful Black and brown children that hey, you can be this too,” she said.
The Little Mermaid is set to be released in theaters May 26, 2023.

The Center for Healthy Living hosted a mental wellness resource fair in Hillwood Commons on Sept. 14, 2022. 
Junior social work major Katelyn Jordan believes the fair was a very helpful resource for students, particularly for those in her major. 
“I loved it. I got a lot of resources and information from a lot of different counseling centers,” Jordan said. “A lot of people were very nice and gave me their contact information to ask questions. I have a lot of flyers to look at.”  
The Director of the Center for Healthy Living, Dawn Loshigian, was pleasantly surprised at the turn out for the mental wellness resource fair. She wasn’t expecting to see so many people interested in mental health.
“It’s amazing,” Loshigian said. “It kinda teaches me that mental health is important to the students, so I’m grateful for that.”
Loshigian hopes that the resource fair will increase the presence of The Center for Healthy Living and make students aware of the resources available to them. The goal of the clinic is to help students not only manage their mental health issues here at school but afterwards when they enter the community. 
“We want to help students to become helpers,” Loshigian said. “We want to help students who have mental health needs and we want to help staff who want to help their students.” 
Although people have become more aware of mental health issues, Loshigian believes there’s still a strong stigma that prevents people from reaching out for help, and acknowledges that this problem is especially prevalent for certain student populations. 
“Here at school we are finding that the typical client would be Caucasian female, but we know our men are suffering. We know our male students need some support sometimes, but they might not be as comfortable coming in. We want to make sure that we as a group practice diversity equity and inclusion within our clinic,” Loshigian said.
Loshigian has faith that with time, people will become more used to the idea of counseling and mental health conditions will become more normalized. She notes that overtime she’s noticed diversification of people entering these fields and it’s an exciting change.
“Some students from certain cultures may feel they want to come in for consoling, if their form of diversity is represented there maybe they’ll feel more comfortable and encouraged,” she said.
The Center for Healthy Living wants people to feel supported on campus and Loshigian is excited for the future of the clinic. 
“We have more people helping out this year than we’ve ever had,” Loshigian remarked.
The Center for Healthy Living staff includes licensed mental health professionals, graduate student therapists, and nutritionists who are offering counseling services.

Jewish students at Post celebrated Rosh Hashanah, or Jewish New Year, this past week. Post’s newest club, the Jewish Leadership Association (JLA), held an event in Hillwood Commons that every student on campus was encouraged to attend to learn about the holiday on Tuesday, Sept. 20.
JLA’s event coordinator, junior marketing major Daniel Tellerman, was proud of how the event turned out. 
“[The JLA e-board has] all worked so hard over the last year to find our footing and create a space for all students, Jewish or not, that can be as entertaining as it can be educational and spiritual,” he said. “Over 40 students showed up to our Rosh Hashanah dinner, and hearing how much everyone enjoyed the event afterwards really showed me what an opportunity we have to do more things like that in the future.”
Tellerman believes that the best part of the Rosh Hashanah dinner was the community coming together.
“To see people bond over traditions they did growing up, foods they shared, and pieces of Jewish culture that they found interesting put the biggest smile on my face,” Tellerman said. “The Jewish people have been oppressed for thousands of years and kicked out of almost every nation at some point in time, so by our very nature, we are more than just a monotheistic religion. We are a people; we are a culture; and we will continue to prove that we are a community.”
JLA President, junior art therapy major Renee Haimov, has been passionate about the club since starting it in spring 2022. 
“Growing up, I was always in Jewish programs … And it always gave me a sense of my identity. So, going into college and not having that program, I kind of felt alone not knowing if there were other Jews on campus. A lot of my friends were not Jewish, and sometimes I felt left out since my friends don’t practice Judaism,” Haimov said. “It was great to find a group that understands me, so we can have that sense of community. I know a lot of people in JLA are happy to have this community.”
Rosh Hashanah is the first of the Jewish High Holy Days, and signifies the “head of the year.” Common practices for those that celebrate Rosh Hashanah include praying in synagogue, personal reflection and hearing or blowing the shofar. 
Haimov further expounded on some of the traditional practices.
“In most of the [Jewish] holidays, you eat salt. On Passover, you dip greens and herbs in salt water. But, Rosh Hashanah is very important because you dip everything in honey, not in salt. This is so that you can have a blessed year,” Haimov said. “It’s a holiday of being happy and enjoying the new year. On Rosh Hashanah, you’re supposed to wear white so that you can start new and bring light into your life.”
Rosh Hashanah began the evening of Sunday, Sept. 25 and ended the evening of Tuesday, Sept. 27. 
Tellerman reflected on his experience celebrating Rosh Hashanah with his family.  
“I grew up in a very reform community, so my family has always been fairly loose with the hyper-religious aspects of Judaism,” Tellerman said. “However, the community and family aspects of my culture are incredibly important to me. On Rosh Hashanah, my parents host our extended family and we all cook traditional Jewish foods for dinner, including my dad’s matzah ball soup that I look forward to having all year. We start by going around the table and reciting a few prayers, explaining the significance of the foods and what they symbolize, and what we can do to make our new year sweeter than the last. After that, we go into the multi course meal and engage in the types of conversations that you’d see in an episode of Seinfeld. Even without its religious foundation, Rosh Hashanah is a beautiful holiday that encourages positivity and kindness for a new year.”
As Rosh Hashanah ends, there are more Jewish holidays and traditions that the JLA looks forward to introducing the Post campus to.
“In the future, we plan to have events that are inclusive for all religious backgrounds, while promoting the values and traditions of Judaism. Here’s some spoilers for future JLA events: Jewish arts and crafts night, Hanukkah party, Matzah-bread house competition, Dave and Busters night, Passover Seder, and our 2nd annual Afikomen hunt,” Tellerman said.
Students interested in joining JLA or attending their bi-weekly meetings are encouraged to join their next general meeting on Oct. 3 at 12:45 p.m. in Hillwood Commons room 108. More information about JLA and upcoming events can be found on their Instagram page @liupostjla.

During this past week, owner of the premium outerwear brand, Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard and family donated 98 percent of the shares from the $3 billion dollar company into a trust and 501(c)(4) not for profit organization called the Holdfast Collective. The Holdfast Collective is an organization whose main goal is ​​“to fight the environmental crisis, protect nature and biodiversity, and support thriving communities.” The organization achieves this by making grants and investments to people, organizations and other companies that help fight for the protection of global environments and natural spaces. 
The remaining 2 percent of the company’s profits are being put into a separate trust called, The Patagonia Purpose Trust, whose main goal is to take the 2 percent and reinvest it back into Patagonia. The Patagonia Purpose Trust is focused on making the company as successful as possible and continuing to make the highest quality products and outerwear, so that they can ensure the company can continue giving back the 98 percent of the excess profits to the environment. 
The Holdfast Collective will have no power of decision making over Patagonia and the company’s direction or main mission. The Collective is strictly there to give back to the environment and help fight for environmental causes. The Patagonia Purpose Trust which is made up of the owning family and their advisors, will be incharge of who sits on the board of the trust, what direction the company wants to go in the future, and key decisions to protect the values and main goals of Patagonia. 
Fans of the brand praised Patagonia’s changes and hope to see other brands follow in their footsteps.
“I think what Yvon Chouinard and his family are doing is a great step forward not only for the environment but for business as well. Patagonia is setting a great example to other major corporations and organizations on how large well off companies can give back to the community and the World, while still maintaining their position in a competitive environment. It’s great to see a company whose main goal is exactly as stated unlike other companies who say one thing and do another. We see time and time again billionaires donating tiny fractions of wealth while maintaining the majority and basically doing nothing for the cause in which they so righteously boast about helping. Patagonia is paving the way for how business is done and what it means to be a socially responsible and competitive organization,” said alumni business major Chase Diliberto.
Yvon Chouinard in the past has been known to have a blasé approche business and has in the past given back to the environment and the outdoor community in many ways. This new direction for Patagonia has created a buzz all around the world and many people are tuned in to see what happens to Patagonia in the coming months after this major step forward. 
“Patagonia’s new direction has definitely gotten the attention of the outdoor and business communities across the globe, and will be in the spotlight for some time while this new and monumental move for not only the environment but big business plays out. Patagonia is at the forefront of Organizations taking causes into their own hands to help innovate and make outstanding long lasting changes in areas that need attention and funding. These billion dollar companies have the ability to change the world and make it a better place for everyone, and it’s great to see a company like Patagonia get the ball rolling in such a tremendous way,” said Diliberto.
In an exclusive interview with the New York Times, Chouinard had this to say about the company’s new direction.
 “Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people. We are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.”

It’s been seven months since the commencement of the Russo-Ukrainian War, an operation which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Russian forces invaded the eastern front of Ukraine in an overwhelming offensive strike, leading countless amounts of Ukranians to attempt to leave the now invaded country. 
Since the retaking of Kyiv, Ukraine hasn’t had any large offensive against the Russian front, until recently. Ukrainian forces have successfully taken back over a thousand square kilometers since the month of September began, causing russian forces to retreat to likely regroup incase of another Ukrainian strike. 
Junior art education major Stephanie Veitsman commented on the events occuring in the Russo-Ukrainian war on how it may affect her and the possible future outcomes.
“The situation in Ukraine does affect me directly. I have relatives that live in Ukraine currently who hide out in shelters to avoid bombs,” Veitsman said. “leaving work early, having to schedule when they go out to get groceries, when to pick up their kids from school. Everything is scheduled around when they are going to start bombing.”
Veitsman also spoke about the threat of nuclear warfare, as well as the security of bordering countries.
“I think Russia, given the chance, can be a risk to other bordering countries. They also want to keep allies, but you can never be sure. Assuming it could affect certain Russian cities that border Ukraine, I don’t know if it makes it less likely to use nuclear warfare, but maybe as a last resort,” she commented.
As the war continues to escalate, many Russian government officials have come out suggesting Vladimir Putin resign. 
“Many people want Putin to resign, but the elections in Russia are all kind of driven in his favor and it doesn’t seem like he will be resigning since he already has so much power,” Veitsman said. “The reason for starting the war on Ukraine is because of so much paranoia in losing that power. Very small chance that he will relinquish his power and it’s not something to expect.”
Sophomore medical imaging major James Vicente commented on the initial reasoning for Putin’s commencement of the war.
“Making up the reason of Nazism and genocide in Ukraine was unfounded. I think that he had alternative motives for control. Ultimately, coming up with an arbitrary reason to invade,” Vicente said.
Recently, Ukrainian forces have been able to push into Kharkiv, the second largest city in the country.
“I think it truly is incredible that Ukraine is able to fight back against Russia. Simply because of Russia having a stockpile of military weaponry, some considered it an international concern. The other reason is Ukraine being severely outnumbered by the number of soldiers.”
Many people feel remorse for the events that are taking place across the world.
“It is really unfortunate that Russia felt the need to invade one of their former “colonies” and cause so much destruction to their livelihood, families, and cities.” Vicente said. “This war should never have happened in the first place.”

Queen Elizabeth II peacefully passed away in her sleep at her Scottish estate on Thursday, Sept. 8, 2022.  
The Queen came to the throne in 1952 at the age of 25 due to her father passing away from coronary artery disease. Queen Elizabeth has been the leader of the royal family for 70 years, making her the longest reigning British monarch ever.
“The Queen’s legacy will live on forever. At 25 years old, you are just starting your life. Then imagine being told you will be the next ruler…The Queen. I think it’s really admirable,” junior SUNY Oneonta psychology major Caeley Curran said.  
Queen Elizabeth II has lived through the many major events that occurred in the world. She had met with the last 13 U.S. Presidents, appointed 15 U.K. prime ministers, witnessed women receiving the right to vote, the second World War and the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Queen Elizabeth II’s son, Charles, will become king and will be known as King Charles III. The entire royal family is in mourning of their mother, grandmother, and great grandmother and the country is in mourning of their powerful leader. 
“The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,” the king said in a recent statement. “We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.” 
Camilla, his second wife, will be known as queen consort.
Now with Charles as King, this is the last time many of us will see a Queen of the U.K. The family line after King Charles, is his first born son Prince William. After him it would go to his first son, Prince George. It is not until after Prince George where we would have a queen again, Princess Charlotte, the second child of Prince William. However, if and when Prince George has children, those children will be ahead of Princess Charlotte in the line of succession.
“Since forever this was always a man’s world! Queen Elizabeth proved that a woman in power can be an amazing leader. I hope that one day we’ll have a woman for president. We’re moving in the right direction since we have a woman vice president,” said Catherine Torres, Junior at Molloy College. 
A lot of Britons don’t love King Charles but they don’t dislike him either. Many of them are still holding a grudge against him due to him cheating on Princess Diana of Wales. This is making Britons question his ruling. He is already doing things differently than his mother. Queen Elizabeth II never gave a press interview in her life, but King Charles has spent multiple hours speaking to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1990. 
“I don’t know much about Prince Charles except for the fact that he cheated on Princess Diana. She truly deserved better. It’s always going to be hard to trust someone again after committing adultery so who knows if he’ll pull a stunt like this again or something even worse,” sophomore psychology major Olivia Nawara said.
The Queen’s funeral will take place on Sept. 19, at 11 a.m. BST and 6 a.m. EST. The ceremony will last about an hour followed by a two minute national silence. Although she is gone, her legacy will live on forever.
