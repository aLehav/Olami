The men’s lacrosse team is coming off a very successful 2015 campaign where it finished the season 14-3. The Pioneers season culminated with a painful loss to Le Moyne College in the NCAA Division II National Quarter finals.
John Jez will be the man trying to lead the Pioneers to the promise land, a place they want to be again. So how can this year’s team be like those great Pioneer teams that won National Championships in 2009 and 2010 respectively? Jez believes the key is knowing what it takes in order to win. “They [our players] know the dedication and commitment needed to accomplish our goal,” Jez said. “We have a strong and committed group that is focused with strong team leaders to guide them.”
Jez is not the only one with high hopes and aspirations for his team though. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association/ Nike Preseason Top-20 Poll ranked the Pioneers third in the nation for Division II. “It’s good to see we are pre-season ranked so high,” Jez said. “But we have a lot of work to do to stay there and reach our goals.”
It is clear that Jez speaks a lot about goals. Of course, he likes when his team is scoring them, but he also sets them for his team at the beginning of the season. First and foremost, the Pioneers hope to maintain the rich tradition of winning lacrosse at Post. “Our team goals are to be competitive in all our games. Our main focus is to take each game as it comes,” Jez said. The hope is that by doing this, the Pioneers can compete for the conference title, and hopefully get an invitation to the NCAA tournament.
In order to get better this season, take that next step and perhaps win a national championship, Jez believes that there are some areas that need improvement. “We have a new group of guys on defense that will have to come together quickly,” Jez said. A number of key starters like Daniel Jeannotte and Chris Caiazza have graduated and finding replacements has “been difficult.”
Jez may have a strong reputation for breeding winning teams on the eld, but he also has a passion for getting his students to thrive off the field. “Over 30 team members had a 3.0 [GPA] or higher during the fall 2015 semester. We hope to continue our strong working in the classroom,” he said.
The men’s lacrosse team gets its season underway on Saturday, Feb. 20, on the road facing Merrimack College. Game-time is set for noon.

Students who have engaged in research projects will have the chance to showcase them at the annual Post and Beyond symposium on April 20. The symposium will take place during common hour in the Tilles Center atrium and is open to students who have conducted some form of research, internship or experiential learning.
Glynis Pereyra, assistant dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, estimated that participation has been evenly balanced between undergraduate and graduate students in past years. However, science was a strong theme at last year’s symposium. She suggested that this is a result of the poster board format being very familiar to science professors. As a result, the professors encourage their students to participate.
This was the case with mentor Azad Gucwa, assistant professor of biomedical sciences, and Sabino Curcio, a clinical lavatory science graduate student, who is currently the lone participant. According to Pereyra, this is not unusual at this time, due to the fact that most students apply closer to the deadline, which is March 9 this year.
Curcio is deriving the content for his poster from his thesis experiment. He is concerned with how diseases, other than Lyme disease, can be transmitted from a tic bite, specifically babesia microti. He conducted an experiment in which he took samples of people with Lyme disease and tested them for the lesser known parasite. He ultimately plans on possibly developing an FDA approved screen for babesia microti.
Although Curcio is going to take his research to the next level, the university could serve as a good practice run.“In some cases we are giving students a taste of what it’s like to present a poster at a professional conference, especially in the case of the research posters,” Pereyra said.
Students can apply to showcase their work at Post and Beyond by going to http://tinyurl.com/postandbeyond2016. Along with basic information, a 250-word abstract that describes the student’s work is required. A five-person faculty committee will review it and make suggestions for the student. In addition, a mentor is required as well who will most likely be a faculty member in the area of study that the student is intending to present about.
On March 16, Pereyra will be holding a workshop for participating students. They will learn how to make a poster, such as dimensions, fonts and how to get it printed for free through the school.
This is the fifth Post and Beyond event at LIU. Last year, there were over 40 participants. The goal this year is to top that with 50 participants, according to Pereyra.

Kadir Wisdom, a junior marketing major, was the campus Cupid last week. He didn’t shoot any arrows, but instead sang tunes to fellow students. Throughout the week leading up to Valentine’s Day, Wisdom served as an on-call singer for whichever couple requested his services. (Anyone could have signed up by going to the concierge desk in Hillwood Commons). Wisdom’s first performance was on Feb. 11, and ran through Valentine’s Day.
Wisdom doesn’t have any experience as a singer, but used this experience to help build his confidence to ultimately give it a go as a singer. Antonette Dauré, a senior forensic science major and fellow club member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), approached him with the idea.
This was the first time this has ever been done at the university and was a completely free service. A student has a choice of seven songs and the location. Some song choices included “With You” by Chris Brown, “Love” by Keisha Cole, “Love” by Musiq Soulchild. Wisdom would also perform at the residence halls in addition to Hillwood Commons and Humanities Hall. If the student wanted, a Valentine’s Day card could also have been delivered at the time of the performance.
The idea was spawned at an NAACP meeting. The club knew they wanted to do something for Valentine’s Day, but wanted to do something that was inclusive to everyone, not just members of the club.
Wisdom said he would definitely do this again next year. In regards to his future as a singer, he said, “I’m taking it one step at a time. I just started now singing in front of people; I’m using this to gain confidence.” He also added that he may possibly have used this experience to help push himself into a campus talent show.

With increasing popularity in online sites and apps for dating and finding relationships, one would think that the ‘looks’ and personality of a person would matter most to their potential lover. However, to some, those qualities aren’t the only ones that are considered. Sometimes, the make-or-break decision that one has to make, revolves around how well their lover can spell simple words.
Surprising? Maybe. But equally as important for realistic situations that can happen during sessions of online dating.
According to a Wall Street Journal article by Georgia Wells entitled, “What’s Really Hot on Dating Sites? Proper Grammar” (Oct. 1, 2015), various relationships fell through due to poor and improper use of grammar and incorrect spelling.
“Learning a potential mate doesn’t know the difference between ‘there,’ ‘they’re,’ and ‘their’ is like discovering she loves cats,” said ‘OkCupid’ user, Jeff Cohen, when recounting on how he felt when he received a text from his date that night, that read: “I will see you their.”
As the article progressed, John McWhorter, a linguistics professor at Columbia University, said, “Grammar snobbery is one of the last permissible prejudices.”
One reason grammar and spelling is judged under the spotlight, is because it reflects and mirrors one’s level of effort, or lack thereof. In light of this, how do students feel about grammar-correctness in ongoing relationships?
In the mind of senior electronic media major, Eric Goodmark, shortened phrases and abbreviations pass, but not complete, grammatical incorrectness. “If it’s an accident, it’s fine, just correct it. I’m not the grammar police but if someone legitimately doesn’t know the rules of grammar, I think that’s ridiculous, especially at our age,” Goodmark said.
Cara Grogilo, a senior art education major, thinks that it could be a turnoff, depending on how ‘bad’ their spelling is, and whether it’s on purpose or not. “I wouldn’t say that it would be a deal-breaker. People make mistakes all the time and I’m not going to pretend that I’ve never misspelled something before,” Grogilo said. “I don’t mind if people use abbreviations for words in texts, as long as these same people don’t formally write the same way they text.”
For senior broadcast major, Akeem Victor, he believes that if it’s accidental use, it can be considered acceptable, but if it’s on purpose, the opposite applies. “I believe it’s okay to misspell words through text, sometimes. Most people correct themselves when making an error in text by using an astericks. Mistakes do happen, however, how frequently they happen can display childish or lazy behavior,” Victor said.
In my opinion, I share a similar, personal view on this subject as Grogilo, Victor and Goodmark. I believe it’s important to know the clear difference between ‘text’ language, ‘formal’ language and ‘casual’ language and the times that are acceptable to use the three and switch between them. All things, including language, begin at a foundation and I don’t think people should start using variations and shortcuts of it until after they know its rules and fundamentals.
In the words of author, Jeffrey Gitomer, “Your grammar is a reflection of your image. Good or bad, you have made an impression. And like all impressions, you are in total control.”

Remember those toy helicopters you used to see flying through the mall? You always told your mom you wanted one, but she never did buy you one because you “would break it within an hour.” Fast-forward ten years and the remote controlled helicopter concept has become a drone, and this drone isn’t just for kids; it’s for adults.
The least expensive drone model, the DJI-Phantom 3 Standard Quadcopter, goes for $499.99 at your local Best Buy. Once your drone purchase is made, let the games begin.
The Phantom 3’s payload features a state of the art high-definition camera. When modified, it can record precise video/imaging from nearly 100 feet above the ‘target.’
Over the past two years, drones have been spotted across the nation recording activity above Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters, major intersections in both New York City and Los Angeles and have been the subject of over 1,000 calls to law enforcement nationwide, according to mercurynews.com.
Now, don’t for a second think that law enforcement isn’t looking into stopping drones. (Coupled with the fact that the federal government and Federal Aviation Administration have already placed altitude regulations on drones). According to mercurynews.com, police in San Jose, California, have created their own ‘police drone.’ Not to mention the syndicated news blog, RT.com, reported that U.S. Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor has voiced concerns that without sufficient protections, the age of unmanned drones and ubiquitous surveillance will usher in an “Orwellian world.”
“That type of technology has to stimulate us to think about what is it that we cherish in privacy and how far we want to protect it and from whom,” Sotomayor said, as she spoke before a group of faculty members and students at Oklahoma City University’s law school in September 2015. “Because people think that it should be protected just against government intrusion, but I don’t like the fact that someone I don’t know…can pick up, if they’re a private citizen, one of these drones and fly it over my property.”
At first glance, drones seem harmless indeed, but like many things in today’s world, they can be used as a weapon that can inflict serious damage. Think I’m being a little overly critical? Okay, but first, please be aware of this, the blueprint of the modern day drone was devised so U.S. and other advanced military forces can fly unmanned aircrafts over a target for either reconnaissance or to take a ‘target’ out.
We’ve seen what happened in San Bernardino, California, where two rogue terrorists killed over a dozen people. Yes, it was with assault rifles, but what happens if one rouge individual decides to fly a drone, with an explosive device attached to it, over a gas station, parking lot, school, you name it.
I am anti-drone. I believe if used correctly, drones can accommodate us in ways that will drastically make our lives easier. However, drones cross the proverbial ‘gray area’ every time one flies over another person’s property. It’s tough to legislate and keep control of our streets, let alone our skies. Drones open up a Pandora’s Box, and I for one, am not for that box being opened; at least not yet.

I vividly remember my grandfather telling me when I was eight years old, “Joey, you’re a good boy and I love you very much…but please, please promise me you’ll never get a tattoo.” Mind you, at just eight years old, I had yet to receive my first timeout at school, coupled with the fact that I could barely grasp the concept of what this man called a ‘tattoo.’ So, out of pure curiosity, I looked at my grandfather and asked him what most eight-year-olds ask, “Why?”
My grandfather, who was, and still is, a man of many words, responded; “Because Joseph, you won’t get a job, you won’t get married to a good girl, you won’t make Jesus proud and you’ll make Popop (slang for grandfather) very sad.” Those words stuck with me. They stuck with me until Oct. 30, 2015, the day I got my first tattoo. Ever since that moment, I’ve been particularly hard pressed to discover the answer to why tattoos are so polarizing.
“Tattoos are polarizing because they reveal a person’s level of consciousness,” said Jake Sandsberg, owner of a landscaping company in Queens. “If you have a star tattooed onto your elbow, you probably watched way too much ‘Jersey Shore’; you’re living in the now and you’re probably not too forward thinking. Now let’s say you have actual art on, like a cross that somehow intertwines with your life, etc. That doesn’t tell me you’re Bill Gates, but it tells me there’s something there, and it makes you much more ‘hireable’ than want to-be Pauly D (star tattooed elbow guy).”
Now, was my grandfather onto something? I asked senior chemistry major, Adine Abrams, about her tattoo and if she consulted with any loved ones before getting it. “All my father said to me was, ‘Do you know what you want to be?’ I said yes, either a scientist or a teacher,” she said. “My father accepted my response, but stressed that visible tattoos can affect future employment, and that tattoos are permanent.”
Abrams, who sports a scroll-like design up and down her back, doesn’t regret her decision yet, but says she’ll really know how she feels about her tattoo when her children one day ask her, ‘Do you like your tattoo, Mommy?’ or ‘Can I get a tattoo, one day?’
As a 20-year-old junior in college, who hopefully has about 60 years ahead of him in terms of how long I’ll live, aside from the fact that I have a tattoo (which is not visible because of preference), I have zero issues with tattoos. In my opinion, tattoos are forms of art, and self expression. Second, who am I to judge someone by their tattoos? We’re taught not to treat anyone differently because of the color of their skin, or which god they pray to. Therefore, doesn’t judging someone by his or her body art seem juvenile? Prejudicial?
Tattoos, like other things, are becoming more and more part of, and accepted in our culture. There is one truth that has withstood the test of time. The truth that there’s more to what meets the eye, so if you judge someone by a tattoo, or lack thereof, you’re probably wasting your time.
It’s the content of one’s character, not the features of one’s skin, that define who someone truly is.
