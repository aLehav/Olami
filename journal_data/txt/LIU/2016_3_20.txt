A lot of us might know Kesha as the fun and quirky pop star who performed on campus during Spring Fling last year. Some may not know about the amount of abuse that she says she has gone through throughout her career.
 
Kesha Rose Sebert, who is known for her catchy hit singles like “Tik Tok” or “Timber,” has worked with Lukasz Gottwald, better known as Dr. Luke, on both of her albums. Dr. Luke had an arrangement with Sony Music since November 2011 to run Kemosabe Records, for which he writes and produces music exclusively for the conglomerate, according to Rolling Stone.
In October 2014, Kesha filed a lawsuit against Dr. Luke in a California state court, seeking to void her contract with him and allowing her to work with other labels. In this suit, according to Rolling Stone, Kesha claimed that during her 10 years working with Dr. Luke she had been “sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally abused,” by him. Kesha claimed that she was afraid that with the power and money Dr. Luke has, he would carry out his threats and therefore she was too scared to speak up about the abuse he had done to her.
Dr. Luke vehemently denied Kesha’s allegations. He countersued Kesha for defamation and breach of contract, claiming that her accusations were “false and shocking,” according to Rolling Stone. The injunction case was brought to the New York Supreme Court in June because the Los Angeles superior court judge held that any legal disputes arising from Kesha’s contract had to be resolved in New York. New York State Supreme Court Justice, Shirley Werner Kornreich, denied an injunction that would have allowed Kesha to record new music for a label that wasn’t Kemosabe on February 19. Justice Kornreich found that there was no showing of irreparable harm.
After reading the injunction request, I can conclude that although there aren’t enough facts or proof of the abuse Kesha faced working with Dr. Luke. There is very little consideration as to what it would mean for her to continue working under the contract. Yes, Kesha does not have to see Dr. Luke or record with him around, but she still must record under his name. Generally, it’s saying that Kesha doesn’t have to live with him, but he still owns her. He still has control over what she is recording and he is the one that decides what to do with it.
Kesha’s lawyer focused a lot on the fact that Dr. Luke could potentially ruin her future recordings by not promoting her future work, which is something that could be labeled as financial abuse. According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, this is a tactic that many abusers use to gain control and power over the victim in approximately 98 percent of abusive relationships.
The court’s decision came as a shock to many Kesha fans. Even big celebrities were surprised and showed their support for the artist. Taylor Swift donated $250,000 to her cause while Lady Gaga claimed she didn’t want to live in a country where the government decides if a victim was actually raped or not. Even Adele spoke out and dedicated her Brit Award for Best Female Solo Artist to Kesha.
I personally agree with Lady Gaga’s words. It shouldn’t have to be the case that someone else gets to decide whether you, as an individual, were abused or not. In Kesha’s case, the judge claims that since there wasn’t valid evidence that she would do the commercially reasonable thing, meaning declaring in favor of what was written in the contract. Although I do understand why the judge would declare in favor of the contract, since it’s a legal contract, unfortunately the reasonable thing to do in this case turns out to be the requirement that this woman sticks to a contract she made when she was simply a teenager and remain under the control of a man who she claims abused her, because she physically doesn’t have to see him.
Yes, I do understand there wasn’t enough evidence, but the biggest problem with sexual abuse cases is that they are very hard to prove, because most of the time there are no witnesses. Because of this, a lot of victims refrain from speaking up. Kesha will never be able to physically show proof, not by video, not by having a witness. It should be enough coming from her mouth.
By rejecting Kesha’s injunction, this decision could potentially create the impression that her feelings of fear are invalid, that she has no reason whatsoever to feel like she is not safe, which can in return scare many other victims to come forward in the future. Editorial Director at MTV, Jessica Hopper, tweeted on the day of the case, saying: “To be in the courtroom for Kesha hearing today was to see the machinations of rape culture in high gear.”
Seeing the pictures of Kesha sobbing in court, at the thought of her career still in the hands of this man really makes one think that this is something that should be taken seriously. How can someone express such emotions and yet still be looked in the face by many and claim that her feelings are invalid in comparison to a commercial contract.
Kesha might have agreed to this heavily negotiated contract, but does that mean she agreed to, potentially, being abused physically and mentally by this man? I don’t believe so. As actress Lena Dunham said in an article she wrote in response to the case: “The part of not hurting one another as human beings is so obvious that it’s usually not added into corporate documents.”
When did a business transaction become more important than someone’s own health? If someone claims that they are afraid for their life if they continue working with another person, I think it’s important to take that seriously.
Thankfully this case has brought a lot of attention to the injustice that is happening not only to Kesha, but to victims of sexual abuse around the world who may feel their claims are less significant than their abuser’s point of view. People are tired of seeing things like this happen and they are speaking up, not afraid to lose all they have worked for. It’s time for a change. It’s time to care more about the well being of human beings rather than the business behind them.

“A Girl in The River: The Price of Forgiveness” recently won the Oscar for short documentaries. However, this film holds way more significance than the act of winning a gold statue. For many women, this documentary is said to be a life saver since it tells the real-life story of Saba Quaiser, a 19-year-old Pakistani woman who survived what is known as “honor killing,” an act that is carried out by family members when a female has brought dishonor upon the family.
In 2014, Quaiser was beaten and shot in the head by her own father and uncle, according to the New York Times. Why? Simply because she fell in love with someone her family did not approve of, ran off with him and got married. Just hours after her marriage, her father and uncle drove her by the riverbank and attempted to murder her as an act of “honor killing.” This act is more likely to happen in Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities although, according to an ethics guide written by the BBC in 2014, acts of honor violence can happen worldwide from South America to Asia but no all countries keep official statistics. It’s also important to clarify that “honor killing” isn’t justified by any of the world’s major religions, rather that it is seen more like a tradition with very patriarchal families.
Amazingly, Quaiser survived. The bullet tore through the left side of her face and left her unconscious as the men threw her body in the river. Quaiser managed to come out from the river and find help, eventually leading her to star in this documentary to tell her story in hopes of bringing light to this issue of “honor killing.”
Unfortunately, Quaiser is not alone. According to the United Nation’s population fund, a UN agency that addresses reproductive health and population issues, 5,000 women annually are killed for what they call “honor.” Many are not as lucky as Quaiser in surviving.
There are a lot of factors connected to the honor a woman holds to her family in a patriarchal culture. In the Islamic religion, there is the term “sharaf,” which is related to the honor that a family unit holds and this can fluctuate up or down; in other words, it’s the dignity a family name has. The Islamic term “‘ird” is the individual honor of women, and this value can only decrease; this is basically what we know as the purity a woman holds.
In patriarchal countries women are considered objects to men; this perception of whether women should be killed or not does not go through court of law. Word of mouth, how she is perceived, and rumors about her could potentially bring shame to her family. Even in North America, “Honor Violence Measurement Methods,” a 2015 study released by the research corporation Westat and commissioned by the U.S. Department of Justice, estimated that there are 23 to 27 honor killings per year in the U.S.; 91 percent of these cases are believed to be because of the women acting too “western.” The report also states that it’s very hard to know whether these numbers are exact since honor killings and violence go highly unreported and unidentified in the U.S. and are usually committed by those that follow the same way of thinking of patriarchal societies. Believe it or not, in some Muslim countries, if a woman is raped she must either marry her rapist or be killed due to the dishonor she caused her family.
The Frontline documentary “Outlawed in Pakistan,” tells the story of 13-year-old Kainat Soomro, who in 2007 accused four men of gang rape and, as a result, her village ordered her family to kill her and consider her an outlaw. When her family refused to do so, they went to court for justice but she did not get the justice she deserved, since it took two years for the hearing to actually begin. Instead, her family lost everything, having to take refuge in a small apartment in a rundown neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan. As if that wasn’t enough, in 2010 her brother was killed because of the whole court process. Soomro is still fighting for her justice today.
It’s 2016; Quaiser’s incident just happened two years ago. Is it really necessary to kill your daughter because you believe she has dishonored your family? Isn’t there a better way to go about this? How is it possible that in the 20th century women in parts of the world ruled by patriarchal societies, are still being treated with such great injustice?
Should such a cruel act really be named “honor killing?” I don’t know about you, but I don’t see much honor in the act of killing a family member. It’s important to discuss issues like this, not only because it’s wrong, but also because we need to stand with those that can’t speak up for themselves.
Thankfully, this documentary is being recognized by the Academy, and has shined light on the situation. So much so that the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, has promised to change the country’s laws to help diminish the act of “honor killing”.

The 2015-2016 academic year has hit its middle mark, and it’s almost time for current seniors to graduate from the place that has been their institutional home for four years. What will they do after graduation? How will they transition from college to the real world? Are they ready to move on?
For senior broadcasting major, Courtney Cox, she’s nervous about the uncertain future, but optimistic that things will turn out all right. “I feel nervous to graduate because so many people tell this generation that you’re not going to get a job, no matter what field you’re in… but, I am excited as well because I love what I do and I’m not sure if I would have gotten the same experience at another university,” Cox expressed.
Although Cox was unsure of what she wanted to do with her career for a while, her later experiences during her penultimate year triggered a change for the better, and one she will never forget. “My fondest memory of attending Post is joining PTV. I went from being shy and unsure about what I wanted to do in life to being super confident and feeling like an involved college student. I made great friends and it helped me see what exactly I want to do in broadcasting,” Cox stated.
As for senior broadcasting major, Charlie Moerler, he shares similar feelings surrounding his future as Cox. “I’m nervous because I’m about to enter the real world but I’m excited because I have my whole life ahead of me,” Moerler stated. What about his fondest memory at Post? Moerler couldn’t pick just one. For him, everyone who he’s met over the course of his enrollment, were his cherished moments. “For me, it was all of the amazing people that I’ve met,” said Moerler.
I am currently a senior as well, and the last four years here at Post have certainly been eventful, spanning from all directions. However, my experiences here have been positive and filled with optimism when it comes to expanding my creative horizons and overall, being confident in my ability to progress and grow. I thank Post for all the handson opportunities it provided for me to learn from.
As a personal note, and a message to all whom I leave behind, my advice to you is to never give up, and keep striving for the best that you can be. There will be times when it seems too rough to try, but trust me, there is always a light at the end and you will overcome the obstacles.
If you’re unsure of what to do, Moerler and Cox have more to say to help you out. “Do as many internships as you possibly can. Do ones in the summer, fall and spring if you can. They give you real life experience and it can help you determine what you like and what you don’t. This way when it comes to job searching, you don’t have to wonder as much,” says Cox.
Lastly, Moerler states, “Every year of college flies by but especially senior year. Don’t be afraid to take it all in. Live in the moment and cherish it. You’d be happy you did.”

Prioritizing your health in college can be difficult. Once you balance your exams, assignments, and social time, eating healthy and staying physically active aren’t easy tasks. However, focusing on your nutrition and fitness can improve your body, mood, and college experience overall.
Intuitive eating is an approach that fosters a healthy relationship with food and your body. Instead of focusing on rigid diet rules and stigmas, intuitive eating individualizes good nutrition and health to your personal needs. When you follow the principles of intuitive eating, you’ll find that a healthy lifestyle becomes second nature and simple to manage.
These are the intuitive eating guidelines and simple tips on how you can implement them into your everyday life:
1. Reject The Diet Mentality
Most diets result in failure and disappointment. Intuitive eating is not a diet, but rather it is a lifestyle. The principles of intuitive eating focus on listening to your body and eating for nourishment.
2. Honor Your Hunger 
Your body knows when it’s hungry and needs intake for energy. Additionally, your body knows when it’s full. Honor these hunger signals and listen to your biological cues.
3. Make Peace With Food 
Give yourself unconditional permission to eat, and avoid depriving yourself of certain foods. Eating sensibly and in moderation is key to living a healthy lifestyle.
4. Challenge The Food Police 
Do you have certain food rules about what you can and cannot eat? Reject this mentality, as it leads to negative thoughts and connotations. Most of the time, these rules are based on fads and not backed by research.
5. Respect Your Fullness 
Similarly to honoring your hunger, your body knows when it’s full. Trust your fullness signals and give yourself time to digest after eating.
6. Discover The Satisfaction Factor 
Eating should be enjoyable and satisfying. Eat foods you love and savor the flavors. Sit down and portion out your meal, and enjoy every bite.
7. Honor Your Feelings Without Using Food 
College brings stress from your academic responsibilities and new environment. Coping with food is only a short-term fix. Address the true issues, and make time to relax during your hectic day.
8. Respect Your Body 
Accept your genetic blueprint. Every body is unique and special; embrace your natural figure so you can feel better about who you are.
9. Exercise – Feel The Difference 
Exercise shouldn’t be just about calorie burning; fitness improves your mood and overall health. Get moving and find what type of exercise you appreciate most.
10. Honor Your Health- Gentle Nutrition 
Make food choices that make you feel good, both in the short-term and long-term. What you eat consistently matters; balance your plate and find a place for all foods you enjoy.

“REBEL” is the new film by Maria Agui Carter; a faculty member of Emerson College and writer/director/producer of the documentary mini-series “Culture Shock” and multiple films for PBS, including “Tango Duel Dance” and “The Devil’s Music.” “REBEL” was screened at the Tilles Center on March 15 as part of the On Screen/In Person film series, to “bring some of the best new independent American films and their respective filmmakers to communities across the mid-Atlantic region,” according to tillescenter.org.
“REBEL” is a documentary about a Cuban immigrant named Loreta Velazquez, one of the 1,000 women who fought in the American Civil War disguised as a man. According to RebelDocumentary.com, Loreta Velazquez served as Harry T. Buford and fought at First Bull Run before being wounded at Shiloh. After working for the Confederacy as a spy, she revealed her true identity in her memoir, the Woman in Battle. According to TexasEscapes.com, it was discovered that Loreta was impersonating as a man after receiving medical care from her wound at Shiloh.
Maria Agui Carter, the writer and director of “REBEL,” described her inspiration behind the film. “I came across Loreta Velazquez’ story in 2000 and read her memoir. But in many of the references to her over the years, there had been accusations that she was a liar, a prostitute, or the figment of her white editor’s imagination. It wasn’t until I read a series of articles about the over 1,000 women soldiers of the American Civil War by a senior military archivist, who wrote about Loreta as a real person, that I began to dig deeper into her story: She had been deliberately erased.”
When audiences view this documentary, Agui Carter hopes they have a greater understanding of themes revolving around identity. “I want people to come away with a deeper understanding of the politics of nation-building and the way our history is crafted and constructed by those in power. There are many themes running through this film – the politics of identity including gender, sexuality, ethnicity in a sweeping adventure tale that is a great way to invite deeper conversations about all these themes through a film about this one woman.”
Agui Carter decided to focus her film on Loreta Velazquez because she is an immigrant herself. “I arrived in the U.S. from my native Ecuador and felt I could tell that immigrant story. Loreta deeply identified with this country and she wanted to prove her loyalty and citizenry through her involvement in the Civil War – we see generation after generation of immigrants doing that.” Agui Carter added, “I also felt her story would resonate deeply with women. She was also an incredibly daring and brave woman who dared to go beyond the restrictive boundaries of her time, and I was fascinated by her personality and drive, and felt others would be too.”
To compile research for “REBEL,” Agui Carter was able to join the Harvard History Department by winning a Warren Center Fellowship. According to the website warrencenter.fas.harvard.edu, “Since its found ing in 1965, the Warren Center has annually hosted 6-12 visiting scholars, thus enriching Harvard’s Americanist community, and benefiting the fellows with access to Harvard’s resources at a critical point in their scholarship.” Agui Carter also conducted research in New Orleans at Tulane’s Latin American Studies Department by winning a Rockefeller Fellowship. During the 12 years she spent to complete the film and acquire funding, Agui Carter was able to complete 10 other films.
Besides being shown at the Tilles Center, “REBEL” will be shown at the Paramount Theater in Boston when Agui Carter returns to teaching in the media arts department at Emerson College. Agui Carter has been screening “REBEL” on a tour since 2013 and the film has played at venues like the Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington D.C. and the Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in California.
As for the future, Agui Carter is involved in a number of projects. Besides being a producer on the upcoming PBS series “Latina SciGirls” and writing a script for a video for the American Museum of Natural History, she is also working on a new film called “Secret Life of La Mariposa.” “It has received support from a number of screenwriter’s labs and I am now polishing the script, it is about an undocumented Mexican teen girl who escapes abuse through magic realism, until the fantasy threatens her life,” Agui Carter said.
Sharon Marier-Kennelly, the General Manager and Director of Programming Initiatives at the Tilles Center, stated that all students should see “REBEL,” because “It is a remarkable portrayal of an individual completely modifying her own identity, which is a story that will resonate for anyone interested in gender and identity issues. The film’s Director, Maria Agui Carter is a very accomplished, having won the Erik Barnouw Award (Best Historical Film in America) for the film. Women’s Fund of Long Island is a programming partner on the performance.”
For more information about “REBEL,” go to rebeldocumentary. com and check out the Facebook page at facebook.com/REBEL.documentary. Tickets for “REBEL” can be purchased at the Tilles Center Box Office for $8 each. The box office is open from 1-6 p.m.

The Great Hall in the Winnick House is a relatively busy place. During the day, it’s nice and quiet, but come nightfall, the hall gets filled with song and melody. “Music majors are required to have two recitals through their time at post,” said Veronica Nguyen, a sophomore music major. She is currently preparing for her second recital; one that is not required. “I’m having a sophomore recital as well. It’s nice to get the experience, and when it matters more, I know what I’m doing,” she said.
There are about four recitals going on in the Great Hall every week, with students ranging from Nguyen- a mezzo soprano classical singer, to jazz guitarists and trumpeters. “Usually, there are collaborations between the students,” Nguyen said. “We help each other out a lot.” Nguyen also explained that the students, at the start of their career at Post, gets a professor/mentor that follows the student throughout their studies. “We get familiar with each other,” she said. That professor usually ends up accompanying and helping out on the recitals.
The point of the recitals, which range between 30 minutes to an hour, is to get experience. Not just the performance itself, but what goes into a longer performance in terms of preparation, logistics etc. “We usually start preparing for the recitals as soon as the academic year starts,” Nguyen said. “But of course, we use stuff that we already know, so it’s not just new stuff specifically for that one performance.” The students are responsible for gathering an ensemble, getting together and practicing in their spare time to be prepared in time for their performance.
At the end of the day, the performance is not graded. It is, however, an important piece of the musical career puzzle. It’s a part of being a musician.
Follow the CACD Calendar of events for the list of performances each week. Catch Veronica Nguyen and her performance on April 8 at 5:30 p.m. in the Interfaith Chapel.

Freshman midfielder Ryan McKinney had a break-out game as she scored three goals to propel the fifth ranked women’s lacrosse team (3-1) to a 7-5 win over fourth ranked University of New Haven (2-1), on Saturday, March 12, at Panther Stadium in New Haven, CT.
McKinney punched in two of her three markers in the opening stanza. Senior attacker Emily Delaney and junior attacker Stefani Vagelatos scored 55 seconds apart, giving the Pioneers a 4-1 cushion at halftime.
In the early moments of the latter stanza, junior attacker Corinne Fisher of New Haven scored back-to-back free-position goals to open the second half, closing the gap to 4-3 with 26:43 remaining. It was all Post from that point on though; as the Pioneers answered every goal the Chargers scored the remainder of the game.
In addition to McKinney’s three point effort, Delaney logged one goal and two assists for three points in the win. Vagelatos also pitched in recording two points (1 G, 1 A). Junior defender/midfielder Cara Douglas had a solid outing tallying a goal, four ground balls, four caused turnovers and won two draw controls.
Defensively, the Pioneers held New Haven without a shot and forced four turnovers in the last eight minutes of action, which was enough to claw out the victory. Sophomore goalie Olivia Kirk had a career-high 12 saves for the Pioneers. Her counterpart, junior net-minder Alyssa Gionatti, denied 11 shots for the Chargers.
Head Coach Meghan McNamara and the Pioneers return to the field on Wednesday, March 16, when they make the trip down to Philadelphia, PA. for a matchup with Philadelphia University. Opening draw is slated for 4 p.m.

The fourth-seeded men’s basketball team came out on top on Wednesday, March 2, against fifth-seeded University of Bridgeport in the first round of the East Coast Conference Championship (ECC) at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y. The 73-68 overtime victory sent the Pioneers to the ECC semi-finals where they met up with St. Thomas Aquinas College in Washington D.C.
The Pioneers trailed 59-51 with less than three minutes in regulation, but a 9-1 run tied the game at 60. Junior guard Jared Hall had the clutch shot of the run and of the night; knocking down a game-tying trey with a minute and a half left. Hall had a chance to win the game for the Pioneers in regulation, but his walk-off attempt did not fall.
In the overtime session, the Pioneers fell behind early, but were brought back to life when senior guard Dillon Burns hit a go-ahead three pointer to kick start an 11-2 burst. After Burns’ field goal, junior forward Barrington Alston brought the house down with a powerful two-handed dunk over a Bridgeport defender that helped propel the Green and Gold to the win.
For the match, junior forward Greg Dotson had a team-high 22 points on 50 percent shooting from the field and also grabbed nine rebounds. In addition to Hall’s clutch shooting, he poured in 17 points and also inhaled five rebounds and dished out two assists. Burns racked up 11 points, five boards and four assists while Alston added seven points and seven rebounds to his stat line.
As a team, the Pioneers got extra possessions with their work on the offensive glass. As a result, they outscored Bridgeport 15-4 in second chance points. The Pioneers dominance down low didn’t stop on the offensive glass either; they scored 32 of their 73 points from the paint and limited Bridgeport to 10 such points.
Bridgeport was led by junior guard Devon Elliot who scored 18 points on 18 shots. He also contributed five rebounds and three steals. Bridgeport shot just 33 percent from the floor, but kept themselves in the game because of their efficiency from behind the arc and their ability to force turnovers on the defensive end. Unfortunately for Bridgeport, it wasn’t enough to upend the Pioneers.
In their matchup against St. Thomas Aquinas College on Saturday, March 5, the Pioneers suffered an 85-58 loss. With the victory, the Spartans from St. Thomas won their nineteenth consecutive game while the Pioneers finish their season with an 18-12 record.
Early on, the Pioneers held their own, mainly because of the efforts from Dotson who scored six straight points in the game’s opening minutes. With the Pioneers trailing 16-13, senior guard Akosa Maduebugnum nailed a triple to even up the score, but that was the last time the Pioneers held a share of the lead. A 7-2 run after that three pointer shook the confidence of the Pioneers and a later 9-0 run led to the Spartan lead ballooning to 13 at the break.
In the second half, the Pioneers couldn’t right the ship and the Spartans took advantage; extending their lead to as much as 20. The Spartans were led by a quartet of double-digit scorers; the high man being junior guard Chaz Watler who poured in 15. For the Pioneers, Dotson was the top dog in the scoring department with a team-high 19 points while Hall added 13 of his own.
As a team, the Pioneers don’t have to look far to see why they lost this game. They lost the turnover battle by a wide margin and failed to stop the Spartans from getting out in transition. The Pioneers committed 24 turnovers and allowed 26 fast break points.
This is the third consecutive year that St. Thomas Aquinas College has knocked out LIU Post in the ECC Tournament and subsequently ended their season.

On Monday, March 7, the baseball team opened a series of five games in the Sunshine State against Nyack College. Powered by a pair of juniors, the Pioneers won their opening game by a score of 3-1. Starting pitcher, junior Jake DeCarli went the distance allowing just one run and striking out 12 while his battery mate, junior Thomas Asbaty, launched a two-run homer to kick start the offense.
In their next game on Tuesday, March 8, it was more of the same from the Pioneer pitching staff. Senior hurler Joey Arena struck out 11 members of Post University in an 8-1 rout. The Pioneers, who were kept off the board through the first three innings, broke through in the fourth with run scoring hits from sophomore outfielder Rob Andreoli, junior outfielder Kenny Daley and freshman infielder Jimmy Mendyk. With a 3-0 lead, Asbaty corked his second home run in as many games and the Pioneers were well on their way to another victory.
Nyack College, just one day removed from a loss to the Pioneers, returned to the diamond against the Green and Gold and suffered the same result; a loss. Junior pitcher Dan Jagiello labored through six tough innings and allowed five earned runs, but did earn his first win of the season. Jagiello and junior reliever Brian Tinney punched out a combined 13 opponents and held the fort down for the Pioneer offense which went off for nine runs. Andreoli and Asbaty continued their hot hitting, each collecting two RBIs and multi-hit games.
The Pioneers lone loss on the road trip came to Lynn College on Wednesday, March 9. The Pioneers were outhit 12-7 and outscored 12-8. The turning point came in the fifth inning when Lynn College battled back from a three run deficit. One inning later, Lynn College plated two more runs and then plated an additional two runs in the seventh inning on a two-run bomb down the left field line. Andreoli and senior first baseman David Groeneveld each had two RBIs and went 1-3 with a walk, but the Pioneers couldn’t scratch enough runs together to beat Lynn College.
In their final game in Florida, the Pioneers scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning and walked off Bloomfield College in an 8-7 victory. In the ninth inning, the Pioneers loaded the bases with nobody out. After a walk, Groeneveld tied the score with a sacrifice fly and two batters later, freshman outfielder Dave Brehm singled to win the game for the Pioneers. Andreoli, Groeneveld, sophomore shortstop Joe Spitaleri and junior catcher Kyle Fagan all had multi-hit efforts in the win.
The Pioneers return to the field on Thursday, March 17, when they travel to Bloomfield, N.J. to play Bloomfield College. First pitch is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.

Paige Swantek, senior speech-language pathology major from Smithtown, N.Y., is the captain of the softball team and is a very versatile player. Swantek plays multiple positions for the Pioneers including, catcher, first basemen and designated player. Entering her fourth year with the Pioneers, Swantek has earned All-East Coast Conference honors in each of her first three years. In addition, she has also been recognized twice as a Division II Conference Commissioners Association All-Region Player and achieved Academic All-America third-team accolades last year.
Q: As a senior with a lot of experience, how do the younger players look up to you? 
A: As a senior that has been through the program, I know what it is like to be a freshman. I lead by example and show the younger players what our program here at Post is all about. It is not only what is done on the field, but off the field as well. I make sure that the younger players know that I am there for them and will help and support them with whatever they need.
Q: How did you first become interested in playing softball? 
A: As a kid, I always loved playing sports as well as watching them on TV. When I was five years old, I started playing tee-ball, and from there on out I continued through little league. In fifth grade, I started playing summer travel ball and fell in love with the game even more.
Q: What’s the strongest asset to your game? 
A: I would say the strongest asset to my game is my offense. It has always been my strong point ever since I was young.
Q: How have these spring games helped your team grow and prepare yourselves for conference play?
A: The trip down to Florida is always an awesome way to kick-off our season and also helps build our team’s confidence. Besides just getting to know each other on the field, we bond a lot off the field as well. We also stay in houses, which helps strengthen our team camaraderie and it is very fun.
Q: Do you usually play more at first base or as a designated player? Which position do you enjoy more and why?
A: In my previous years, I spent majority of my time as the team’s designated player. I have worked very hard to try and earn a position on the field, and getting the opportunity to play first base has been incredible. I enjoy every aspect of the game and will embrace whatever it is that I need to do in order to help the team be successful.
Q: What other positions have you played throughout the course of your career? Which proved to be the most difficult for you?
A: My entire softball career I have been a catcher, even entering college. I have been a catcher since I was nine. Being a catcher on the hot summer days in all the gear during travel ball was definitely a lot of work, but I loved it. There were days that I would catch three to four games, and looking back I don’t know how I was able to do that. It’s hard to say what the most difficult position for me is because they each have such different responsibilities and require different skills.
Q: Can you describe the relationship between you, your teammates and your coaching staff, and how those bonds translate into your performance on and off the field?
A: Being a member of the softball team means being a member of a whole new family. As a unit, we treat each other as we would treat our families. We care for each other and are always looking out for one another. Our coaching staff is incredible. They are not just coaches of the game, but they are coaches of life. They have taught me so many lessons both on and off the field. Having a coaching staff that treats the team not only as a team, but as their own family means so much to me, and I know I can speak for the rest of my team as well.
Q: Describe being a four year starter here at Post and what has been your biggest challenge to date. 
A: It has been an amazing experience thus far, and I want to finish my softball career with no regrets. I want to give everything I have in order to be the best I can be and have the most successful season as a team that we can possibly have. I would say the biggest challenge to date has to do with classes during the traditional softball season. It’s hard to miss classes, especially because of weather related issues that may change the game schedule around. The professors are very understanding here, but it is still difficult to miss class and have to work on your own and make up what you may have missed. Hearing the professor teach about the subject is a lot different than reading about it and doing extra assignments.
Q: What influenced your decision to come to Post?
A: My goal as a student-athlete was to be a part of something special and an extremely competitive and successful collegiate softball team. I heard many great things about Post. When I visited the school, I fell in love with the campus and I also loved the coaching staff. Post also has great academics which was pivotal for my decision. When I visited Post, I knew it was where I belonged.
Q: You’ve had a lot of success as a Pioneer, but what would you say was your biggest accomplishment so far? 
A: My biggest accomplishment by far was attending the Division II Women’s College World Series. It is every softball player’s dream to be able to participate in a World Series, and I am extremely fortunate to have had this opportunity. Making it to the World Series required a 13 inning win over Southern New Hampshire University. Being down 4-2 in the bottom of the seventh inning with two outs, and ending up winning the game and advancing to the World Series is a memory I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
Q: Do you think this year’s team has what it takes to make another run at the NCAA Tournament and Division II World Series? 
A: I do not just think this team has what it takes to make the Division II World Series; I know this team has what it takes. We are a unit of 17 girls that grind day in and day out to better ourselves. Whenever we are not practicing, you can find girls on the team putting in extra work to get better. This team has a lot of talent and depth, and I know we have what it takes to make another appearance in the World Series. We have to take things one day at a time, and give 150 percent effort into each and every game we play. In the end, the results will show for themselves. I am looking forward to a great season.
Q: You currently rank third on the team in hits and runs batted in and fifth in batting average and runs scored. You also led the team in homeruns last year. What’s the key to having success at the plate? 
A: It’s important to have a positive mindset when entering the batter’s box. We talk about zone hitting here at Post, and I feel that this approach has helped me tremendously in my years here. It is also very important to believe in yourself and your teammates. Softball is a team sport, so being successful is not just because of you doing a good job, but it’s also your teammates who are helping you and giving you the opportunity to excel. Softball is a complete mental game, so being mentally tough is a huge factor when playing this game. A prime example of the craziness of this game is that hall of fame players have averages around .300. This equates to three hits in every ten at bats. This is saying that the most successful players in baseball are only successful three out of every ten times. Crazy, isn’t it?
Q: Who is your favorite athlete and why? 
A: My favorite athlete is David Wright. I love watching him play because he has such a great approach to the game. He is always giving every ounce of effort that he has. No matter if he is doing phenomenal or is striking out every at bat, he stays composed and shows no emotions.
Q: Any plans after graduating? 
A: My plan is to attend graduate school in the fall for speech-language pathology.

On Thursday, March 10, the softball team wrapped up their regional play at the PFX Spring Games in sunny Clermont, FL. In game one against American International College, the Pioneers pounded the opposing pitchers for 15 hits and 12 runs in a 12-5 victory.
Junior pitcher Ashley Martin earned her second win of the season, going five innings, scattering eight baserunners and striking out six. At the dish, senior infielder Maria Palmeri drove in two runs in four at-bats while sophomore catcher Emily DeVito, fresh off the bench, came through with a big two-run base-knock in the late innings to put the Pioneers up for good.
Later that same day, the Pioneers showed their ability to win games in different ways. Coming off an offensive explosion just hours earlier, the Pioneers battled Assumption College and won by a score of 1-0.
The lone run came curtesy of senior pitcher Isabella Corrao who knocked in freshman infielder Leah Mele in the first inning on a little old single. Both teams totaled just six hits, but the Pioneers got the most out of those hits, scratching the only run across home plate.
In the circle, freshman hurler Hannah Olshevski went the distance, allowing seven total baserunners and striking out a pair. The Pioneer defense was stellar as well; committing zero errors on a day where Assumption put the ball in play more times than not. Olshevski improved her record to 4-0 while her counterpart, Roy Kendal, dropped to 2-2 on the season.
In their penultimate matchup in Florida, the Pioneer bats were stifled by Minot State University’s Alyssa Cornejo. The junior improved to 5-1, going eight shutout innings, allowing three hits and striking out eight. For the Pioneers, Martin also went eight innings, but got zero run support and suffered the loss when Minot State pushed three runs across in the eighth inning.
The Pioneer bats were shut down again during the nightcap when senior pitcher Sarah Appold of Saginaw Valley State struck out nine over seven innings and allowed zero runs. Saginaw Valley handled their business at the plate too, scoring a run in the first and three more in the second thanks to a three run home run off the bat of senior infielder Jessica Wood.
The Pioneers have now been shutout in two straight games and have put together a combined six hits during that span. Head Coach Jamie Apicella will try and right the ship on Wednesday, March 16, when they return to Long Island to face-off against Adelphi University in a double-dip from Garden City, N.Y. First pitch is scheduled for 2 p.m.

On Saturday, March 12, the 10th-ranked men’s lacrosse team (3-2) secured its third-straight victory, defeating 13th-ranked Molloy College (5- 1), 9-7, in an East Coast Conference tilt at John A. Darcy Field in Rockville Centre, N.Y.
The Pioneers got off to a hot start; scoring four goals in the second period, giving themselves a 6-2 advantage heading into halftime. Senior attacker/midfielder Ryan Slane, sophomore midfielder Dylan Harned, senior attacker Matt Bellando and graduate midfielder Jeremy Morgan all found the back of the cage for the Green and Gold during that span.
In the latter stanza, the hosts continued to dominate as Slane and Harned teamed up for a pair of goals scored just 48 seconds apart extending the lead to 8-2.
As the Pioneers brought a six goal lead into the final period, all seemed to be said and done. However, the Lions kept fighting and slowly chipped away at the lead scoring five out of the next six goals. With just 1:35 to go in the contest, the Lions chopped the deficit down to 9-7.
With a comeback stirring, junior goalie Matthew Liantonio and the Pioneers buckled down and held on for the win as the Lions only had one shot on goal the rest of the way. Liantonio made seven saves for his Pioneer squad as his counterpart, Ryan Toomey, stopped 13 shots. Slane paved the way for the Green and Gold with four points (3 G, 1 A) while Harned and Morgan each tallied two goals apiece for the Pioneers.
Overall, Post held the advantage in nearly every category; leading 34-30 in shots, 22-13 in ground balls, 13-of-17 (76.5 percent) on clears and 2-of-4 (50.0 percent) with the man-up opportunity. The Pioneers also won 12 face-offs and caused 11 turnovers. Morgan and sophomore midfielder Kris Alvarado led the Pioneers, causing two miscues each. Junior midfielder Anthony Galeotafiore finished 12-of-20 on face-offs.
Head Coach John Jez and the Pioneers look to improve to 4-2 on Saturday, March 19, when they square-off against Chestnut Hill College, in an ECC showdown, in Philadelphia, Pa. Opening draw is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.
