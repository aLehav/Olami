Entering preseason, knowing it’s their last one as Pioneers, the softball team has its goal set on success. With a team led by upperclassmen, their final destination on their last ride is a spot in the World Series.
Last year, the team made it to the East Super Regional and finished as one of the top 16 teams in the country. They were two games away from the World Series, which is the last portion of the NCAA national championship where the last eight teams meet. This year, entering his 21st and last season as LIU Post head softball coach, Jamie Apicella wants to make it further. “Our goal is to get into the NCAA’s to have a chance to play for the regional championship and then also the national championship,” he said.
Senior pitcher Hannah Olshevski, a health science major, is also determined to make it all the way to the World Series. “That has been our goal since we got here,” she said.
To make it to the NCAA’s, the team has to be successful in their conference. “What is unique about softball is that you play so many games. We play 56 games and we play each conference opponent four times,” Apicella said. “We try to win the regular season to be able to host the East Coast Conference tournament.” Apicella hopes those achievements will lead the team to the national tournament.
Heading the team is an experienced group of players who will chase the championship titles. “We have pretty much our whole team returning. We only lost one starting player from last year,” Olshevski said.
Apicella sees this as one of the team’s biggest strengths. “Our strength is our upperclassmen who have experience. We have a returning senior class that has been instrumental not just going into this year, but the last three seasons,” he said.
In company with the returning seniors, junior pitcher Katie Humhej and junior outfield player Abbey Fortin return. Humhej and Fortin were recently named ECC preseason pitcher and player of the year, respectively. “We have a very talented junior class,” Apicella said. “Then we have the sophomores that are obviously complementing that and some impactful freshmen. We have a very strong team.”
With a clear goal and a strong roster, the softball team is ready for their last first game. The announcement of a merger between the LIU Post and Brooklyn athletic teams will make this upcoming season the softball program’s last. After dealing with a lot of emotions, they decided to stay focused on softball and stick together. A new hashtag was created, #onelastride, and the team gained motivation. “I feel like this brought everyone together,” senior catcher Julia Seader, sociology major, said. “It’s one last time for the Post softball team.”
Apicella believes the merger announcement gave the team a new purpose. “I think there is a little bit more motivation for us to get to that pinnacle, which is the national championship. Not only for themselves and the coaching staff but also for all the alumni and the history of the program,” he said. “I know that they are playing for them too.”

The players rarely talk about the merger. “As we start to get towards the end of the season maybe those emotions might creep in again, but hopefully we are playing for a conference championship game and a regional championship game and we are still excited about the possibilities we have,” Apicella said.
After the season, non-graduating players will either transfer to continue their softball collegiate careers elsewhere or stay at Post without playing. According to Apicella, the opportunity to stay and play after the merge was not offered to his players.
The team opens the season on March 3 in Florida against one of their biggest rivals in the region: Saint Anselm College. “They have the best pitcher in the region right now, so I think that’s our strongest opponent we will face all season,” Apicella said.
Their first home game is March 14, against Adelphi University.

“You,” a television thriller that originally premiered on Lifetime, came to Netflix Dec. 26, and has since gained great popularity. The television show is based on the novel “You” by Caroline Kepnes.

The show follows Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) as he obsesses over Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), a smart, attractive blonde he meets by chance at the bookstore where he works. Goldberg quickly begins stalking Beck, and uses her social media to gain a deeper view into her life. The show leaves viewers questioning how easily accessible one’s life is on social media, and when exactly ‘love’ begins to become unhealthy obsession.
“You” sparked controversy on many social media platforms for its portrayal of love. On Twitter, some women tweeted that they were looking past Goldbergs’s acts of lurking in Beck’s window and breaking into her apartment, saying they were simply acts of love, and that they would want a potential boyfriend to ‘love’ them that much.
Junior public relations major Alex Cordova expressed her concerns with the attention the show has gained. “The problem is they’re using an attractive actor and from putting it in his perspective and how he feels he’s bettering her life. It makes it seem endearing and lovable,” Cordova said. “How obsessed he is about her is worrying.”
Others students said that the show’s widening fan base is a good thing, as it informs viewers of the dangers of an unhealthy relationship.
“[The show makes] people aware of what to look for in a relationship, to suggest it isn’t healthy,” Britney Caprio, a sophomore business major, said. “Obviously it is open to interpretation, but I feel it spreads awareness for both men and women who could be facing a similar situation.”
Some viewers feel the show’s message fails to support current events such as the “Me Too” movement, which advocates against sexual assault and harassment. “I think it harms the Me Too movement, as it blurs the line between what’s appropriate and what should be illegal behavior,” Cordova said.
The show is in the romance category on Netflix, whereas the book is listed as a thriller. Cordova described her confusion about the genre and blames it on the casting and presentation of the character. “You [the audience] are convinced as the audience that he is doing it out of love, and they romanticize his acts,” Cordova said. Caprio agreed, saying that due to the choice of attractive lead actors, the stalking may be seen as endearing.
Some viewers failed to finish the show because it made them feel uneasy. “I found the show made me so uncomfortable that I stopped watching after the second episode,” Caitlin Johnstone, senior health science major, said.
Netflix announced that “You” has been renewed for a second season, based on Kepnes’ second book “Hidden Bodies.” No premiere date has been released, but Netflix released information on the second season, tweeting that “Haunting of Hill House” star Victoria Pedretti will be starring as Badgley’s new love interest, and the show will be set in Los Angeles.

Dr. Joan Digby, dean of the Honors College and a professor of English, won the Founders Award from the National College Honors Council (NCHC) during the 53rd annual NCHC Conference in Boston, from Nov. 7-11, 2018. Digby won the award for her work with Partners in the Parks, which grew out of “Partners in the Parks: Field Guide to an Experiential Program in the National Parks,” a monograph co-written with Heather Thiessen-Reilly and published in the NCHC Monographs series, now in its second edition.
“The Partners in the Park is a partnership with the National Park Service and what we do is we take honors students on one-week camping trips in the backcountry of parks like Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, all over the country,” Digby said. “The idea is for them to understand the value of preserving natural environments in this country, so students camp, they hike, they cook, canoe, everything you can do in a park setting.” Students also see wildlife, work with park rangers, and pay attention to the natural environments contained within America’s national parks.
Since Digby started the program in 2008, more than 1,500 honors students have participated. It is for this that the Council awarded Digby. “[T]hey felt that my leadership in this signature program (I originated it and got it started) was really important to the organization and especially to the students who went on these trips,” she said.
When Digby won the award, she felt “overwhelmed.” “The award has been only given out three times before, and it’s the highest award that they gave. I know the other people who have received it, and they were all big influences on my career in honors,” she said.
Digby gave an address after she won the award. Expressing gratitude towards Sam Schulman and Ron Brandolini for their friendship and influence in her life, she encouraged other honors educators to continue their work in the field. “After 40 years at LIU, I am still having fun. I write for our journals and serve on an editorial board. I am teaching a new course on drones and finding new ways to teach, invent, and enjoy working with honors students. Don’t leave. Change the model and stick with honors. Students—you too should think about professions that will bring you back to honors education as faculty or administrators,” she said.
“If honors education in some sense celebrates a Renaissance vision of humankind, Joan Digby is that image incarnate,” said Dr. Jeff Portnoy, co-chair of the NCHC Publications Board and editor of the NCHC Monograph series. “She is a scholar, an essayist, an editor, a poet, an adventurer in nature, a protector of wild camels, a woman of the horse, a publisher, a film producer, a provider of food and lodging for generations of cats, and a Founder of initiatives central to the heart of honors education and NCHC.”
John Lutz, chairman of the English, philosophy, and foreign languages department, sees this honor as a testimony to the power of a liberal education. “Dr. Digby’s testifies to the standards of excellence that she has pursued throughout her academic career. It underscores her commitment to the enduring ideals of the Liberal Arts and Sciences and points to the countless number of students who have benefitted from her nurturing spirit and care. It’s a reminder of the importance of the Humanities and the central role of dynamic and creative teachers like her in the success of the University,” he said.
Digby wants to empower students through education. “I want [my students] to come away with the idea that education empowers them to go out and do whatever they want to do and succeed at it. I especially want them to be able to speak, to write well, and know how to do research so that if people give them projects to work on, they’re very comfortable and self-assured,” she said. “I want to help them find their voice and their matured selves. To do that you have to be able to talk to people, you have to be knowledgeable and to be able to express the knowledge that you have, and to be self-confident, and that’s what I want them to take away.”
Digby finds the central feature of honors education to be its undergraduate research component. Every honors student writes an undergraduate thesis under the guidance of a faculty member.
“[T]hat whole process is the final step towards the rest of their lives,” she said. Digby feels that the research component allows for honors students to present some of their best work.
“I’ve got some fabulous theses coming up, and every student in the program presents the research to other students and faculty members in a colloquium, and when they do that and I hear the research that they’re doing, I’m sometimes awestruck by how brilliant they are and how terrific their work is. We’ve had many students publish their undergraduate work with their professors. Imagine what a leg-up that gives them,” she said.
Digby finds inspiration in Samuel Johnson as a figurehead of the 18th century, her field of interest, and as a human being. “[H]e was a powerhouse of publication in the 18th century in London which is my field, 18th century British [literature]. This guy single-handedly wrote a history and biography of all the poets who had ever written in English up to yesterday,” she said.
Digby did her Ph.D. work on Johnson at NYU. “I think the man is great; he’s just a great inspiration to anybody who wants to say ‘I can do that no matter what it is’ because that’s what he did, he did everything.”
“The other great thing about Samuel Johnson was that he had a cat whose name was Hodge. In his will, he left enough money for the cat to get oysters every day until the cat died. And the cat was taken care of by a servant of his who was black, who was a freed slave, and Johnson left him enough money to get his own house. So to me this is a human being. Everything about the man was compassion, everything about him appeals to me as a person that I admire.”
This semester Digby is teaching ENG 304-011: World Literature II, an honors core course, as well as ENG 2-015 Writing II: Research and Argumentation. Her interest in the 18th century, which she is teaching in ENG 304, stems from its focus on satire and comedy.
“[A] lot of the work written in that period was very biting and very comical, but I would not be still teaching if I did not have fun and if I could not play games in class. I really appreciate comedy and satire, and as you look at what is going on in this country right now, you can tell why cartoons and “Saturday Night Live” are popular, because they’re in the spirit of the 18th century,” she said.
“If Samuel Johnson were here right now, he would get rid of Trump really fast. And I just think we need to look around us and just see the corruption and the craziness, the complete craziness of it all, and learn how to take it on as satirists.”

Health Column: The Blood Type Diet, Science or Speculation
By Alecia Sexton
Staff Writer
Some people say that people can biologically benefit from eating certain foods based on their blood type. But is this just a way for people to steer others towards specific food items based on agricultural availability, or is this concept potentially revolutionary?
The blood type diet states that in order for the body to function at maximum efficiency, people should eat and avoid certain foods, and even activities, based on their blood type.
Type A people should consume a vegetarian diet free of dairy and wheat. Type B people should focus meals around vegetables, eggs and uncured meats while avoiding most grains and lentils. Type AB people should focus on seafood, greens and dairy while avoiding caffeine and chicken. Type O people should consume lots of animal protein while avoiding dairy and beans.
The “founding father” of the blood type diet is Peter J D’Adamo, a registered natural doctor (ND). In 1990 D’Adamo was awarded the title “Physician of the Year” by The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians for the years of his medical career spent creating and studying blood diet concept. Since then D’Adamo has written books such as “Eat Right 4 Your Type” and “Live Right 4 Your Type,” that aim to help people achieve health and wellness through diet and lifestyle changes. According to D’Adamo’s website, critics have praised him for conducting research that delineates the “simple logic that is the diet’s foundation.”
Since D’Adamo’s studies and claims, there have been many physicians who ventured to find the truth. One 2018 study done by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition stands out when assessing the validity of the theory. The study closely monitored the cardiovascular status, waistline and overall health of 1,000 individuals with all blood types who strictly ate the specific diets outlines by D’Adamo and followed specific activity regimens.
The study found that each person, regardless of blood type, benefited from switching to A and B diets, most likely because they place emphasis on fruits and vegetables rather than high fat meals. It further concluded that there was no pattern based on blood type and improvement in biomarkers, disproving D’Adamo’s claims.
While it may seem comforting to think that simply adjusting your diet to align with predetermined “blood type” foods will allow your body to function better, it’s not so black and white. There are many other factors to consider when adjusting your lifestyle.

William Clyde, the director of the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP), which has provided academic opportunities for university students who would otherwise not have the economic opportunity or educational criteria to attend classes, left campus on Friday, Jan. 18 to work as Director of Special Programs- EOP Director at Nassau Community College.
HEOP, which provides three programs for students, has been co-sponsored by the New York State Education Department throughout its years’ operating on campus. The program provides tutoring, advisement, financial aid, and counseling to students.
According to Clyde, students currently enrolled in HEOP at Post will not lose their scholarships. However, Clyde also said that the programs offered to them will be changed, and no new HEOP students will be accepted.
“The [HEOP] program will phase out, but current students will still maintain their eligibility and be supported,” Clyde said. “The HEOP director from LIU Brooklyn, my friend and colleague Kamel Boukerrou, who has been director there for a number of years, will be on [the Post] campus at least one day a week.”
Clyde said there are currently 60 students enrolled in the HEOP program. Some of these students worry about what the end of the program will mean for their educational careers on campus.
Jackie Escobar, a sophomore adolescent education major in HEOP, said the announcement of the program’s end was unexpected.
“I’ll be transferring out [of Post],” she said. “One of the reasons is because I thought LIU would keep their promise. I don’t find it fair. Now that Clyde is gone, I feel that the one support I had from a faculty member is gone. I don’t have the motivation to stay at Post.”
Escobar said that while she was told she would still receive financial support, all other forms of HEOP support would no longer be accessible to students. According to Escobar, HEOP students received counseling and tutoring through the program.
“It’s grandfathered in that [the school] would continue to commit [financially] to you,” she said. “When it comes to the academic support, it’s not there anymore.”
Of having a temporary director on campus, Escobar said she does not feel it will help HEOP students.
“For [the program] to just have someone temporarily is not right. It’s not fair,” she said. “We were supposed to have counseling with the advisor. With Clyde, he tried to help us in every way.”
While Clyde is no longer on campus, he shared a final word on what he wants for HEOP students.
“I encourage them to continue to do well- they have the wherewithal to be successful,” he said. “Do not be afraid to ask for help still. As long as they are accountable, good things will happen.”
Despite the program’s end, Clyde said he is happy with the successes that he has seen come from it in his 34 years working for HEOP.
“It is about what the students have done. That’s the bottom line,” he said. “That’s the legacy of the program.”

In order to keep the student body aware of occurrences on campus, the Pioneer compiles and publishes crime reports. The reports are public and are available to view at the Public Safety office. All names have been redacted for privacy purposes.
Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019
At 3:45 p.m., Public Safety received a call reporting an issue with a resident in Kings Hall. When a Public Safety officer arrived, a complainant explained that a resident student had forced the ground window open to gain access to his room. Public Safety spoke to the resident, who stated that he was no longer going to attend LIU, he was going to another school and was moving all of his belongings out. The student was accompanied by his mother. The student and mother left campus, and the room was re-secured.
Tuesday, Jan. 8, 2019

Students visiting the financial aid, registrar, and advisement departments located in Kumble Hall can discover the interior renovations made to abridge the process of enrollment services.
New flooring was installed throughout the building, and fresh paint was applied to the walls. The advisement and financial aid staff were relocated from the second floor to the first, allowing students to walk in to a more accessible and open floor plan. “The move to the first floor of Kumble Hall was about creating a cohesive department that was easy for students to navigate,” said Michael Berthel, dean of students.
Changes were necessary according to Joanne Graziano, executive director of enrollment services, “to make a student-centered, friendly, and open area for students to quickly seek help. This new area allows students to easily locate their advisor or ask a question,” she said.
A sign-in desk is now a few steps away from the building’s entrance, where a receptionist is available to assist students with their questions. If advisors are unavailable, a new seating area awaits, furnished with couches and tables for students to work.
In addition to the hall’s upgrades, enrollment services is working on improving the customer service experience, according to Berthel. “All of our changes have one goal in mind… we want enrollment services to be a place that is welcoming and energetic for students,” he said.
Kayla Parker, a senior criminal justice and psychology major, works at the sign-in desk, assisting students looking to meet with their adviser or financial aid officer. She’s first to witness students’ reactions as they walk into the building. “They all go upstairs, and then come back downstairs, but other than that, they like it. It’s more open, and it’s easier than walking upstairs,” she said.
For some students, the confusion goes beyond the hall’s new layout. Allie Wise, a senior marketing major who dorms in the campus suites, remains uncertain if the renovations were necessary. “It looks nice, but I just don’t really see the point of it. I feel like it’s kind of useless. There’s still a lot of people waiting; they’re just waiting in a different area,” she said. Wise observed other areas on campus that need upgrading more than Kumble Hall. “The residence halls by far [are] a top priority,” she said, adding that “compared to other schools, they’re just not as modern.”
Marcello Tripoli, senior biology major, is pleased with the Kumble Hall renovations. He worked in the enrollment services department during the previous two semesters and was pleasantly surprised during his first visit after the remodel. “It’s really nice. I just feel like upstairs is less useful now. It used to be spread out, and now it’s a little cramped in here,” he said.
Future use of the second floor by the university has yet to be determined. However, last week, HBO utilized the space for film production of the first two episodes of new television series, “Mrs. Fletcher,” about a divorced woman who jumpstarts her love life, according to Theresa Duggan, director of conference services.
The university staff will discuss different ideas on how they can utilize the second floor space. Berthel suggests, “If a student has an idea on something they think would benefit them, I would encourage them to contact me at post-dos@liu.edu.”

This week’s Athlete of the Week is Mike Manzione, a senior criminal justice major and infielder for the baseball team.
Manzione is a returning starter for the team. After seeing little action his freshman and sophomore seasons, he made 38 starts as a designated hitter and at first base his junior year. At the end of the 2018 season, Manzione was named Second Team All-East Coast Conference for the first time in his collegiate career. He led the team’s home run statistics with seven home runs, tied for third on the team in runs, batted in with 28, and finished third on the team in batting average, batting .323.
The baseball team made the East Coast Conference playoffs last season with the help of Manzione’s strong presence in the line-up. In May last year, Manzione had his best game of the season. Hitting two home runs and knocking in four runs against St. Thomas Aquinas.
During the offseason, Manzione spent a lot of time in the batting cage, trying to get as many swings as possible to be ready for the start of the season. “I’m very excited to begin the new season and get back out there,” he said. Being a returning starter and senior on the team, many of the players see Manzione as one of the leaders. That applies, both on and off the field. “Mike Manzione is a great teammate. He’s a guy who cares about his teammates on and off the field and is hardworking,” sophomore pitcher Antonio Deodato said.
Although it has always been Manzione’s dream to play professional baseball, after college he is “looking to pursue a career in law enforcement.”
Manzione is looking forward to this season. “We have a lot of expectations and potential this season. Since this is our last year in Division II, we really want to end it being a championship team,” he said. He hopes to improve on his play from last season and to help lead the team to a conference championship. The team is currently ranked ninth in the East Region of Division II baseball and second in the East Coast Conference behind St. Thomas Aquinas College.
The baseball team’s first game is on Feb. 15 against Tampa University, in Tampa, Florida.

The first productions for the Post Theater Company (PTC) spring 2019 season are a part of the Building Bridges: The 2019 Virgil J. Lee New Play Festival. PTC will perform stage readings of the plays “Oak,” written by PTC alumnus Ryan Hudak (’12), and “This Can’t Happen Here,” written by PTC alumna Sarah E. Taylor (’15).
This is the first time these two plays will be publicly read. Most new works in their early stages will go through stage reading performances in order to give the playwright a sense of how the play could be performed. Two separate casts prepared for the festival with only three weeks of rehearsals, which included many rewrites by the playwrights on set.
“Oaks” is the story of a family in power in post-apocalyptic America, and what happens when the people of the town, tired of being ruled by fear, call for change. Family dynamics overlap with political discourse in the small town in the midst of a two year drought.
Jason Jacobs, a director from New York City, is directing “Oaks.” He described the play as a modern myth. “It’s a new play but it feels like it could be sort of an ancient tale,” he said. “It takes place in a futuristic America that is very much kind of like a past America – almost like a modern myth.”
“Oaks” takes place in a small town with a ruling family, the Oaks family. “They’re the muscle and power of the town,” Jacobs said.
Throughout the play, we watch Oak, played by William Pope, a junior theater major, defend his position as head of the family and town leader, and maintain his power while figuring out how to fix a drought that may have been caused because of his family. Oak’s sister, Penelope, played by Thea Kraus, junior musical theater major, is a seer, and returns to her hometown after 20 years to share a vision with her brother that could help save the town, but it comes at a cost.
“Oak comes to realize that it’s somehow on him and his family to fix it, but someone’s blood will have to be spilled,” Jacobs said.
All of this on top of a new government trying to take control of the town takes a toll on Oak. “The whole Oak family created this town, and once people try to take that away from them, and once they start trying to break apart the family, it starts to crumble the town and Oak personally,” Pope said.
The character dynamic is intense, and the actors must work hard to portray their characters, since this performance will take the form of a stage reading rather than a traditional play.
“A stage reading is always a tricky thing,” Jacobs said, especially when the cast is given too much rehearsal time and a large stage to work with. The cast must fight the temptation to explore movement. “We walk a fine line to keep it as a reading, but give the audience a feeling of what it might look like if we had sets, costumes, props and objects. It’s a delicate process,” Jacobs said.
What the stage reading lacks in movement, it makes up for in the delivery of the lines and the depth of the characters.
“We spent a lot of time on the script. It’s important we really give the playwright’s words their full due,” Jacobs said. He also stressed the importance of the actors’ “actions” or intentions behind their delivery. “It’s important the actors feel strongly that they are under- standing and committing to those choices,” he said.
Pearl Emerson, a sophomore musical theater major, plays Oak’s mother, Judy. “She’s experiencing a lot of change in their little town.
She is on her way out as the matriarch and a new government is being formed that she’s not so sure she is going to be a part of,” Emerson said. Judy’s uncertainty causes more tension in the family.
“Oaks” is the first stage reading Emerson worked on. “It’s interesting because we do a lot of work we’d do with a normal play, but it will manifest in different ways,” she said.
The cast hopes the audience takes much away from the play. Stephanie Jeker, stage manager and sophomore musical theater major, believes the audience will be satisfied. “They are really going to get a sense of the story and the depth of the characters,” she said.
Pope hopes the audience can see past the stage reading. “I want them to see it as a play. I want them to forget that we’re reading scripts and that there [are] music stands and blocks. I want them to get into the world of Oak and really live in it,” he said.
The second play, “This Can’t Happen Here” takes on a form of social justice theater, revolving around gun violence and mass shootings, specifically school shootings. The playwright, Taylor, said her motivation for the story began after the Parkland school shooting, though she didn’t begin writing the play until late November 2018.
“I wanna explore how as a society we deal with these things,” Taylor said. She expressed how the media tends to “perpetuate the problem.” Many times throughout the play, reporters who cover the shootings portray various “faces” of the media: compassionate, exaggerated, offensive, and desensitized.
“This Can’t Happen Here” takes the unique perspective of the parent of the shooter. “[They] are vilified and ostracized – is it their fault, or is it not,” Taylor said. “Parents are always trying to do the best thing, so I wanted to explore that.” This nine person cast is a strong ensemble piece, with many of the actors taking on multiple roles throughout the play.
Michaela Fox, junior musical theater major, plays Madge Redburn, a mother of two, a wife, a businesswoman, and the parent of gun violence victims. Madge works as the director of marketing and promotions for a gun manufacturing company in her town. She is in the best position to make real change after the shooting.
When a tragedy hits, Madge’s whole life flips upside down. “We watch Madge go through the motions of how the strong, independent woman suddenly is shattering from the inside out, and how it takes over every decision she makes,” Fox said.
Paul J. Bakey, senior musical theater major, plays Aaron Redburn, one of Madge’s sons. He is a victim of gun violence, and his death is what leads Madge to make change.
Though it is script-in-hand, the cast utilizes minimal blocking, lights, and vocal sound effects to bring the story to life.
“The issue with stage readings is sometimes the play is written to be performed full out. Sometimes it’s difficult to get that in a reading,” Bakey said.
Julia Rivera, sophomore theater major, plays several roles, including Detective Byron, Michael the intern, and various students. This is Rivera’s second stage reading with PTC.
“With violence happening as often as it does, I think people often forget that these are real people,” Rivera said. Multiple times throughout the rehearsal process, her cast members would come in and inform them of another shooting that took place. “I think we can get so desensitized by violence. It’s not always covered in the news. These are real people that are being affected, real people that are dying, and that needs to change,” she said.
Claire Main, senior theater major, is the assistant director for the show. She works with Luke Leonard, a director from New York City. This is the first time Main is assistant directing, as she can usually be found on the stage.
“It’s been really fun working with Luke, because he’ll give me opportunities to speak my thoughts and add on to what he’s saying,” Main said. Leonard’s direction style, she said, is focused, but also very laid back and comfortable, which brings light to such a “dark” play.
Main wants the audience to realize the call for immediate action.
“There’s a line that says, ‘my thoughts and prayers are with you,’ but in the situation of gun violence, thoughts and prayers aren’t enough. It’s about policy, it’s about change, it’s about taking action,” she said.
“I want audiences to think about that middle point, the gray areas” between anti-gun and pro-gun positions, Taylor said. “If we thought more about the gray, then we’d be closer to finding a solution, rather than being so black and white about it.”
The New Play Festival will be held at the Rifle Range Theater at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 8 and Saturday, Feb. 9, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 10. Tickets, which are $15, or $12 for senior citizens and $10 for students with valid ID, can be purchased at the box office or at tix55.com.

Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, the Hillwood Commons Cafe has a variety of meals for students. This semester, several new options are being added to the menu.
The campus food service, Aramark, announced that it will offer a wider variety of meals in the spring 2019 semester, including limited time offer meals, according to Rob Reinhard, Aramark’s resident assistant director.
“The Hillwood entrée station will feature trending food options,” Reinhard said. “Menus will change daily, Monday through Thursday, with Wednesdays offering a Fresh Fish Market. A selection of fresh fish will be available and grilled to order. Other rotating concepts will include a wing bar, build your own nachos, regional barbecue, baked potato bar, and loaded fries. And new for spring 2019, our sushi provider has introduced a new Ramen Noodle Bar in addition to his freshly prepared sushi,” Reinhard said.
Students are pleased with the new options. “The current menu is definitely, to me, bland,” Hunter Fenollol, a senior public relations major, said. “It could use more variety, more spice, more different types of food. If they were to add more options on the menu, I would absolutely go there more often. I bring lunch most of the time just because I want to change it up,” she said.
Sophomore game design major Brandon Kay agreed that the current menu that Hillwood offers is minimal. “One thing that I think that they can improve on is that they can probably cover more basics, bring in some more food from other cultures. The current menu is serviceable, but I think they can definitely do better,” Kay said.
“We are committed to delivering an innovative dining program that is also driven by the changing trends in the food industry,” Reinhard said. “With the introduction of a new management team including Campus Chef Romel Velasquez, Aramark took a fresh eyes approach to the current dining program which resulted in changes at both Hillwood Retail, and Winnick Residential Dining Halls,” he said.

Dr. Harvey W. Kushner, professor of criminal justice, director of the Homeland Security and Terrorism Institute at LIU Riverhead, and the former president of the LIU Post faculty union, was appointed to the newly created position of vice president for faculty affairs, according to an email to faculty sent by Dr. Randy Burd, senior vice president for academic affairs, on Jan. 28.
This appointment came after “much consideration,” Burd wrote in the email. It is also several months after faculty members voted Kushner out of the presidency of the faculty union, a position he held for over a decade. Kushner was replaced by Dr. Michael Soupios, professor of political science, as union president.
“Dr. Kushner will focus on forging improved communication with faculty departments and individuals to ensure that our forward progress continues at a steady rate. He will Chair the Campus Leadership Group and report to me directly on faculty matters,” Burd wrote in the Jan. 28 email.
Kushner agreed to speak with the Pioneer about his new position, provided that Burd was also present, but he cancelled the scheduled Feb. 1 interview by email, 15 minutes prior to the appointed time. Kushner did not reschedule the interview, nor did he or Burd respond to the Pioneer’s specific questions about the newly created position. Instead, they both provided statements via email.
“I am honored to assume these additional responsibilities as the Vice President for Faculty Affairs at LIU Post. Serving as a liaison between the faculty and the administration, it is my aim to strengthen and deepen conversations among LIU Post communities. Establishing a culture of open dialogue and engagement is especially important as the University continues to make strides forward in academics and research across our many campuses and programs,” Kushner wrote. Kushner did not confirm whether or not he will continue teaching alongside his new administrative responsibilities. He did not explain how his role will combat or compliment the faculty union and faculty council, the two already existing faculty governing bodies.
“Dr. Kushner is uniquely qualified for this role, given his skills and experience, his long standing tenure with the University, and his relationships with other faculty and staff members. Given its focus on internal communications, it was clear that the best match for this role would be an internal candidate, and we are fortunate that Dr. Kushner agreed to assume these additional responsibilities. We look forward to sharing with the LIU Post community our developing plans for deeper engagement, in partnership with Dr. Kushner and the Campus Leadership Committee,” Burd wrote.
Burd did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about which administrators and faculty members made up the search committee or what other candidates were considered for the new position. He did not provide a job description for the position, nor did he explain what the Campus Leadership Committee was, who was on the committee, or its function. Information on the campus leader- ship committee cannot be found on liu.edu.
The roles of faculty union president and faculty council co-chairs held by Soupios, Dr. Heather Parrott, professor of sociology, and Katherine Hill-Miller, professor of English, respectively, are to bridge communication between faculty and the administration.
Soupios believes the creation of VPFA was a political gesture, that Kushner was given a position to “counter” his own. He has no intention of reporting to Kushner, other than as a professor who is a member of the union. While he is still president of the faculty union, he will “continue to represent and protect the faculty. Period.”
“I can’t be bought, and I can’t be silenced. So when they play games with the faculty, I grieve, and I bring arbitrations and I make it difficult. Harvey did none of that,” Soupios said.
The position of VPFA did not exist at the university before, according to Soupios. “For you to be removed as the head of the faculty union by recall vote by your colleagues, I mean, you must have been doing some really egregious stuff. And that’s the reason why he’s no longer president because he was in bed with the administration, and the faculty knew it and they had enough of it,” he said.
Because Kushner cancelled his interview with The Pioneer, The Pioneer was unable to ask Kushner to respond about his former position.
Parrott believes creating a role to “improve faculty-administration relations,” and then filling that role with the recently recalled faculty union president is an odd decision. “Faculty democratically decided that we do not want/trust Dr. Kushner to represent us in communication with administration, and then the administration unilaterally appoints him to be a liaison between faculty and administration? I hope they recognize what a potentially divisive decision this is,” she wrote in an email to The Pioneer.
Withholding the specifics, Soupios detailed improprieties that Kushner engaged in his role as president of the union. “He’s representing Harvey, not us,” Soupios said.
The Pioneer made multiple attempts to contact Kushner, Burd, and Gordon Tepper, director of university public relations after they canceled the initial meeting. Kushner and Burd did not respond to the specific allegations, and Tepper refused to comment.
Soupios believes this appointment will have a negative impact on the faculty. “It’s further isolating the faculty from the administration. It’s going to be received in the manner in which it was sent, which is essentially the administration telling the faculty union ‘go screw yourself,’” he said.
Faculty members contacted by The Pioneer know very little about the VPFA position, other than what was in the email announcement, according to Parrott. “We don’t know what the job description includes, how the VP of Faculty Affairs differs from the VP of Academic Affairs, how much of our communication with administration will go through this new position, etc. Faculty were never consulted about the position or who would fill it,” she said.

Gordon Tepper is no longer employed by LIU and has returned to his hometown to spin PR in the City of Long Beach as of the 2nd week in February.
