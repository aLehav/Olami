The 2023 March Madness tournaments came to their triumphant conclusions, with UConn and LSU winning the men’s and women’s tournaments respectively. 
This year’s tournaments were historic for a number of reasons. 
In the men’s bracket, a conference rival of LIU in the Northeast Conference (NEC) made history when Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU) became the second 16-seed to defeat a 1-seed when they defeated Purdue 63-58 in the first round. Upsets were a theme in this year’s tournament, as it was the first time in history that there was not a 1-seed in the Elite Eight. 
Junior Adelphi University history major Michael Serrao had a plethora of takeaways from this year’s tournament. 
“I was shocked but not surprised to see Purdue go down in the first round. They are an absolute joke of a program right now. They have came up way too short in the past few tournaments for it to be acceptable for their level of prestige amongst the rest of the NCAA. I knew national player of the year, Zach Edey, was a fraud, but I didn’t expect him to choke that early in the tournament,” he said. “Florida Atlantic’s story was a great one to watch as a 9-seed making it to the Final Four. I wish Kansas State made it farther, as they were a major sleeper pick for me. [Markquis] Nowell is insanely talented for such an undersized guard. I think he will make a great backup point guard in the NBA. The University of Miami and San Diego State had great tournaments too. I feel bad for SDSU because they were the best team in the country in 2020 when the tournament was canceled due to COVID. They made it all the way to the championship game and lost, which has got to hurt.”
These unexpected outcomes weren’t exclusive to the men’s tournament, however, as the women’s bracket featured many surprising results. While the first few rounds went as anticipated, Iowa’s Caitlyn Clark led her team to a shocking 77-73 victory when she scored 41 points against the undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks in the Final Four. This performance would not be enough to win the tournament, as the 3-seed LSU cruised to a 102-85 victory against Iowa in the Championship. 
LSU’s victory garnished plenty of media attention, but not for the reasons that either team intended. Following the win, First Lady Jill Biden tweeted that she wanted both LSU and Iowa to visit the White House, which is extremely uncommon across both college and professional sports. Associated Press All-America First Teamer Angel Reese received criticism for both her on-court taunting and her comments regarding the First Lady’s tweets, in which she showed clear disapproval of the remarks.
Serrao sided with Reese on this issue. 
“Why would both teams from a championship visit the White House? The point is that the championship winner gets to go to the White House, not the loser too. If both teams get to go, then what is the incentive to win the game?” Serrao said. “LSU’s celebrations were mimicking that of Caitlyn Clark from Iowa. She had a signature you can’t see me celebration that she did throughout the tournament. What’s the big deal if someone does it back to her? That’s part of the game. That’s part of sports. That’s part of trash-talking. If you are going to trash talk, showboat, and celebrate when you’re winning, you better be able to take that same behavior being done back to you when you are losing. Why are people so soft? Clark even said herself that it’s part of the game, and if you are gonna talk trash, you better be able to get it back. If this is her stance, then why are we defending her?”
Outside of the on-court action and off-court controversy, this year’s tournament marked the last for one of the most iconic voices in all of sports. After spending 32 years covering March Madness, broadcaster Jim Nantz called his last game on Monday, when 4-seed University of Connecticut (UCONN) defeated 5-seed San Diego State University (SDSU) 76-59 to win their fifth national championship. 
Serrao recognizes that this tournament marked the end of an era. 
“Obviously, Jim Nantz is an all-time great. So, it’s really sad to see him go. As a sports fan, we become attached to certain announcers, usually the good ones. Nantz has some legendary calls that will go down in history along with the moments themselves,” he said. “Jim Nantz retiring only signals to me that I am getting old because I remember hearing his voice watching games as far back as I can remember. He should be remembered as one of the best announcers in sports history, and aspiring broadcasting majors should look up to him.”
Nantz, who will continue to call the Masters and NFL games for CBS, concluded his final college basketball broadcast by alluding to his infamous opening, “Hello friends.”
“Can I tell you one other thing? I mean this, not to try to play off ‘Hello friends,’ but to you, everyone in the college game, my CBS family, my family, all the viewers, thank you for being my friend,” Nantz said. 
St. Joseph’s Brooklyn alumni George Garyfallos felt the unprecedented number of upsets in this year’s tournament was to be anticipated. 
“March Madness is great. Every year a lot of teams with number-one seeds lose. It’s just a matter of getting hot at the right time,” he said. “The number one seeds were overhyped this year. Purdue always loses in the first round, and Alabama is a football school. I was a real believer in Gonzaga this year.”
Portledge Senior and Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse commit Daniel Shalam had high expectations for the UConn Huskies heading into the tournament. 
“My prediction for March Madness this year was either UCLA or UConn winning it all. From broadcasting UConn, I had a good feeling about them. But, at the same, UCLA was a sneaky pick as they had lots of experience from the past few years to guide them to winning the Final Four,” he said. “One thing I should’ve considered was that no team west of Dallas has won the national championship since 1999. Another pick I considered was Creighton. They were top 40 in all KenPom stats. I had them going to the Final Four, but they bowed out to SDSU in the elite eight.”
Despite no #1 seeds making it to the Elite 8 for the first time ever, Shalam believes this year’s tournament was the best he has ever seen. 
“This year’s March Madness was the most fun by far. Once we saw a #1 seed got knocked off for only the second time in history, it was bound to be a weird one. I felt as if some of these upsets were bound to happen, #3 Virginia is always a fluke team in the big dance and Arizona as a #2 seed was just too high,” he said. 
Shalam speaks on the business aspect of having teams with less recognition making a deep run. 
“While we as fans of March Madness liked the upsets, CBS sports was not a fan as they saw the lowest ever recorded viewership for a March Madness final,” he said. “Personally, I think it’s a good thing for the game as more mid-major schools get the spotlight, but it definitely is not the same without Duke, UNC, or Gonzaga making an appearance.”
Shalam, who interns at WCWP, got to see the UConn Huskies play live when they competed against the Sharks, calling the game for LIU Sports Radio. 
“Being able to call the UConn-LIU game was unlike anything I’ve ever done before. For one, it was my second time calling a Division One game, and on top of that, the Sharks were on the road, meaning that we got to travel with the team to Storrs, CT. The anticipation was building. At that point in time, UConn was ranked #5 nationally. With that in mind, we didn’t expect the Sharks to come out victors in the game but tried to soak up every part of the experience,” he said. “Waking up on Saturday morning, we traveled with the team to the Gampel Pavilion, home of the Huskies. Walking into the arena was astonishing. The 10,000-person arena was empty, and I could imagine what it would be like in two hours’ time. UConn couldn’t have been more accommodating to us, as they had game notes, all access press passes, and more than 10 outlets.”
Shalam claimed the atmosphere of this game is unlike anything for a broadcast he has ever worked. 
 “As we started to set up about 45 minutes from tip-off, I saw a rush of UConn students flooding the stadium. Every one of them rushed to get a seat for the prized student on the right of the UConn midcourt logo, located right behind the basket. Even though this was an out-of-conference game, it seemed as if UConn were taking it like it was the National Championship.” he said. “As the game was about to begin, UConn had their players intros, and the crowd got deafening. It felt like I was screaming for the entire broadcast just due to the sheer noise of the UConn faithful. It will always be one of my favorite memories. To be able to say I broadcasted one of UConn’s games during their national championship season will stick with me forever.”
After watching them play, Shalam was sure this team was bound for greatness. 
“When you have a starting five of Joey Calcterra, Adama Sanogo, Jordan Hawkins, Andre Jackson Jr and Tristan Newton, good things are bound to happen. What we saw in the game against the Sharks was depth. UConn didn’t even start 7-foot-2-inch Donovan Clingan or, as they like to call him in Storrs, ‘Kling Kon.’ UConn had two elite shooters in Calcaterra and Hawkins, paired with Newton and Jackson Jr. as the guards. It makes it really hard to limit scoring against this team,” he said. “Even when you force a bad shot, Clingan and Sanogo are there for the rebound, making it hard for any team to score and defend efficiently against the Huskies. After seeing them play, I had a gut feeling they were championship bound. On top of that, head coach Dan Hurley was the perfect piece to complete this UConn team and make them champions.”
Shalam was certain this team was bound to win it all by the time they made the Final Four. 
“I thought that once UConn blew out Gonzaga in the Elite Eight, they were bound to win it all. Nobody just glides past Gonzaga like that. UConn was getting lots of doubt coming into the tournament. They didn’t play amazing down the stretch in Big East play, finishing 13-7 in conference,” he said. “It was a surprise to all of us that UConn dominated, but the coaching of Dan Hurley would put any team with that type of talent in the finals.”
Following this National Championship, Shalam would love to see these UConn players make it to the league. 
“Every member of this UConn starting five could go to the NBA. Every one of these players was in the spotlight in the final, and there is no doubt the NBA scouts are ready and waiting for each one of these players to graduate,” he said.

The LIU women’s lacrosse team is just starting to get a foot into their Northeast Conference (NEC) games. They currently hold a record of 5-7 overall but are 3-1 in the NEC.
On Saturday, March 18, the Sharks won their first conference game. They blew out the Saint Francis University Red Flash with a score of 16-7. Four sharks scored a hat trick in that game, including freshman midfielder Julia Trainer, who received NEC Rookie of the Week for the fourth time this season. Along with Trainer, junior goalkeeper Lily Bilello received NEC Defensive Player of the Week after her 11-save performance. 
With many conference games still ahead of them, senior defender Caroline Person reflected on how their season is going so far. 
“[It’s going] really great. Every season has its highs and lows. We just started our conference games, and so far, I think the spirits are really high, and our team atmosphere feels very positive and uplifting all the time,” she said.
Sophomore attacker Pierson Schuchart also said that the season is going well and believes there is more success to come. 
“I think we’ve learned a lot from each and every single game we’ve played. After our first conference game and winning, I think we feel really confident going in, and our energy is super high right now,” she said. “Practices are competitive, so I think for the next couple of games, there are going to be some good outcomes.” 
Schuchart discussed the biggest challenge that the team has seen so far and touched on a very prevalent subject that has been on the rise in college athletics.
“One of our biggest challenges that affect us sometimes during our games and practices is our mental state. We go through challenges where we just feel stuck in the mud and don’t really know how to get out of it, and sometimes in our games, you can really tell on the field that we’re all going through something mentally,” Schuchart stated. “We’ve really worked on it,and we have been working with a mental coach, and overall our mental stability has been going up over the season.” 
Person said that the team has seen a lot of positive progress in their mental health since working with a mental health coach. 
“Our mental game has been getting stronger. I would say now that is becoming one of our strengths, so I think we’ve really played off and learned from the days where we’re really low, and we have gotten a mental health and mindset coach who’s really helped us a lot and has helped us cope through those tough days and those hard games, so I think that’s helped a lot,” she said.
Person believed that the growth of the team’s huge freshmen class ended up being a huge strength of theirs. 
“We have a big freshmen class, so we have a young team but that helped us. It seems kind of daunting at first to bring in such a big class and have such a young team, but they are so fun, and I feel like they just mesh so well with the team so our team culture is great,”  she said.
Although beneficial that a team gets along well, Person commented on how they need to work on staying focused as their season progresses.
“We have such a big team, and we can get very giddy and excited and almost lose focus a little bit, so I think if we can translate the energy of giddy, funny, and goofy and just translate that into focus and do the work, that’ll help us a lot,” Person said. “We have such an energetic team, and we can’t lose that because that is so much of who we are, but if we can just figure out a way on those days where we seem like we don’t have a lot of focus to just really narrow in those two hours of practice.”   
Schuchart shared a different area of focus that the team can continue to work on moving forward. 
“Because we have such a large team and a large bench, we need to continue to support each other throughout these games and practices and obviously push each other cause everybody has a role on this team whether you’re on the field playing or not,” Schuchart said.
The Sharks still have quite a few games ahead of them, and both Person and Schuchart believe the team is headed in a good direction.
“We are really excited for the NEC and what’s to come. There are definitely going to be bigger games that are going to be tough to play, but we are excited, and the energy is high.I think we are going to do good,” Person commented.
Schuchart felt similarly.
“I think the season is headed very positively. I think if we keep pushing each other in practice and pushing each other to get better, be competitive, and go in with no fear, I think each game we’ll take [one] by one, and I think it will go very well for us and hopefully [lead to a] NEC championship,” she said.
The Sharks play Howard Saturday, April 8, in Washington, D.C.

On Monday, March 13, the new fitness center in Riggs Hall became available to use. 
The fitness center is located in the lower level of Riggs Hall, accessible to all students with their LIU mobile ID.
The gym is open from  
Monday – Wednesday: 8 A.M. – 8 P.M.
Thursday: 8 A.M. – 11 P.M.
Friday: 8 A.M. – 8 P.M.
Saturday – Sunday: 10 A.M. – 6 P.M.
Following the closing of the residential gym in Brookville Hall, Vice President of the Student Government Association, Ailer Thomas, sought to reopen another gym with support from Associate Dean of Students Joseph Vernace, Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management Michael Berthel and University Dean of Students & Chief Diversity Officer Ashley John. 
Students felt that the BlueFit Cycling Studio in Hillwood Commons and the Pratt Recreation Center did not provide all students the opportunities to focus on their personal health and wellness. 
“Athletics kind of dominated Pratt and it is an athletics gym, but a lot of students just felt they didn’t have a place where they could go. The times were really awful for non athletes and a lot of students voiced they didn’t really feel super comfortable going to work out surrounded by the entire football team,” Thomas said. 
After the numerous requests for another gym, Thomas knew he wanted to bring back a residence gym.
“We had the idea, we wanted to bring back the residence life gym and we tried a little bit last year, but it was just everything got really chaotic with COVID regulations so at the beginning of this year, in the fall semester, I sat down with Michael Berthel, Joseph Vernace and Ashley John and I said ‘look, the students really need this.’ We worked together to build it. It was hopefully going to be open by this semester. We ran into a couple of complications with the space, but we were able to open it after the spring break,” Thomas said.  
While not all of the equipment has arrived, the basics are now available. Treadmills, dumbbells, ellipticals, Peloton bikes and a yoga space are among the equipment ready to use in the new facility.
“We didn’t want to wait anymore. We didn’t want to keep the space from students while it was usable. Over the next week, more equipment’s gonna arrive,” Thomas said. 
The goal of the residence life gym is to provide a workout center for students that do not want to use Pratt.
“It’s still for working out, but the focus is a little different. We have more cardio and we don’t have as much as the big heavy weights. It’s more of like a daily workout center,” Thomas said. 
While there are currently no plans for workout classes, students can use the BlueFit Fitness app to connect to the Apple TV and try new workouts, such as yoga.
There are no restrictions on the hours that are open. When the gym is open, any student that wants to work out can do so.
As the semester continues, more equipment and services will become available. 
“We want the space to be as great as it possibly can be. If any student has any requests about the space, any suggestions, please reach out. I would love to hear it. I want that space to be perfect,” Thomas said. “I’ve been taking full advantage of it. I love to have it around.”

Being an athlete comes with dedication and loads of physical work, which comes with the risks of injury that can occur. 
About 30 million children and teens participate in a sport in the U.S. Of these people, 3.5 million receive injuries each year. According to John Hopkins Medicine, the recreational sports we play account for one-third of the injuries we experienced as children. 
CNN has reported that the NFL saw a jump in the number of injuries since the end of the 2020 season. It’s also reported that the MLB saw their injuries double after the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only is this trend happening in the U.S., but professional leagues in other countries, such as England and Germany, have seen similar trends.
There are many reasons why injuries in professional sports are on the rise. The main reason will always be that these athletes do not get enough rest in order to heal. During the pandemic, seasons started later, bringing on a chaotic schedule with little time in between games. According to CNN, the NBA is a prime example, as they only played ten fewer games than their  usual season squeezed into just five months instead of seven. This left no time for players to take the time off that their bodies needed. 
Resuming physical activity suddenly after a long time off due to the pandemic can also cause injuries to happen more easily. The tissues and muscles in our bodies tend to soften with this time off.
Athletes believe that because money is on the line, their time off must be chosen very wisely. This mindset also doesn’t allow the body to heal when needed.
“I’ve received an injury before from dance which took a long time to heal. It was definitely due to the fact that I continued to push myself when it happened and ignored the pain. The only time we really have off is the few months of summer,” sophomore early education major Dale Console shares. 
Aside from the pandemic setting athletes up for injury, another reason players experience so much damage is because of the pressure put on by coaches and trainers to get back on the field or court as quickly as possible, ignoring the state of the injury and the potential for re-injury.
Unfortunately, there have been times in history when coaches risk a player’s health for a win. A former student-athlete from the University of Illinois named Simon Cvijanovic experienced this first-hand, tweeting multiple times about the team’s staff forcing injured players to keep playing during his time on the Illinois football team. 
Along with the pressure from mentors, comes the pressure from parents. When athletes receive an injury, it’s possible their parents have trouble understanding the severity of it. Families push players to be their best sometimes without taking their pain tolerance into consideration. 
“Whenever I get hurt dancing, I try not to show it on my face, and I’ll put pressure on myself to keep going. The last thing I want to do is let my team and family down,” Console adds. 
When strains go untreated, it’s possible that the discomfort and pain can keep building up, leading to the injury being re-aggravated. Cleveland Clinic states that it can lead to other things like stress fractures, cysts, nerve compression syndromes, herniated disks, and more. 
The media highlights these moments in sports very often, exposing the risks of some sports. This could be discouraging for upcoming athletes and worry a lot of parents. 
There are mental effects of these sports injuries as well. Athletes are often used to a certain routine and way of living. When this routine suddenly gets put on hold, players can experience boredom, depression, frustration, and tension with a negative mindset. 
“I have had to take time off from my sport before. I felt lonely without my team and hopeless without being able to do what I love. I almost felt lost without dance and wanted to force my body to fight through the pain,” Console said. 
While it is unfortunate to see such talented people cut their seasons short due to something out of their control, taking time to make sure they come back strong next season needs to be taken into consideration.

Taylor Swift kicked off her much anticipated “Eras Tour” on Friday, March 17 at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. This is Swift’s first return to the stage in five years with a three hour concert and a 44 song setlist. Swift made sure she carefully honored each era of her career by not only singing old songs but also costumes, set designs and overall feel of each time period. 
“The Eras Tour” made headlines long before Swift even hit the stage for opening night at State Farm Stadium. The demand for tickets to the tour was so high that Ticketmaster crashed when the shows went on sale, leaving a large number of fans without access to seats despite the concert giant’s prior assurances to Swift’s team that they could handle the on-sale. This prompted a national outcry that led to a Congressional investigation into Ticketmaster and Live Nation, and whether their merger and business practices constitute a monopoly. 
Fans of Swift on campus shared their thoughts on the Ticketmaster situation.
“I like to call the ticket sales the trenches,” sophomore musical theater major Grace McNally said. “I got verified presale codes meaning I was able to buy tickets before it went on public sale but even then I was stressed out. Every single time I hit buy an error would come up saying, ‘Oops! Another fan beat you to it. Find other seats’ like ugh it was so stressful but it’s okay it all worked out in the end and I got my tickets.” 
Swift started her concert with her “Lover” era by opening with “Miss Americana” and “Heartbreak Prince,” both tracks off the 2019 album. She then performed “Cruel Summer” for the very first time in concert. She then performed “Willow” and “Champagne Problems” from her pandemic-era album “Evermore.” Swift also performed hits from “Reputation” like, “Delicate” and “Don’t Blame Me.” The “Red” era was, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “I Knew You Were Trouble.” and the ten-minute version of “All Too Well.”
She next performed songs from her 2020 album “Folklore” for the first time in a live concert. She sang “Invisible String,” “Cardigan” and “Betty,” among others. She later played an acoustic rendition of “Mirrorball”. The “1989” album was one big dance party. She sang “Blank Space,” “Shake it Off” and “Wildest Dreams.” She also sang through her “Fearless” era with “You Belong with Me” and “Love Story.” She also sang “Tim McGraw” at the piano, a song from her earliest era in 2006.
As the concert came to its final and current era, Swift played various songs from her new album “Midnights” like “Anti-Hero,” “Lavender Haze,” “Mastermind” and “Bejeweled,” and closed out the show with the high energy hit “Karma.”
McNally shared her excitement for the tour.
“I have been a fan of Taylor Swift for as long as I could remember. She was the first artist I listened to and loved! The way she is with her music and how every song is just a different story is so amazing! I love when she writes songs about her ex-boyfriends and subtly tells the world how badly they treated her, literally just exposing them, it’s so awesome. I’m proud I can say I’ve been a Taylor Swift fan since day one,” McNally said.
Leading up to the first show, her fans have been tirelessly dying fabric, pasting rhinestones, and fashioning handmade fringe, showing off their sewing and hot glue gun skills. Since it is “The Eras Tour,” most of their looks take inspiration from past phases of Swift’s career. Many fans dressed up as song titles, specific lyrics, inspired by outfits Swift has worn, or Swiftie inside jokes. 
Her fans are called ‘Swifities’ and they are notorious for their fierce support and dedication to Swift. 
“I’m not a die hard Swiftie but oh my god they can be scary. If you say one bad thing about Taylor they’ll say a whole speech about how you’re wrong or just tell you all the information about her,” freshman education major Ava Saper said. 
Taylor Swift is one the first artists to have six opening acts for different parts of her tour. Her first opening act for the first two nights of the tour is Paramore. Her second opening is Beabadoobee, she will perform for 12 shows. The third opener is Phoebe Bridgers, she will also be performing for 12 shows. Swift’s fourth opener is Girl in Red who will be performing for eight shows. The fifth opener is MUNA. They will be performing for nine shows. Swift’s sixth opener is HAIM. This girl group will be the next openers for nine shows. Gayle is the seventh opener on tour and she will be performing for 15 shows. The eighth opener is Gracie Abrams. Abrams is a longtime fan of Taylor and she will be performing for 30 shows. Swift’s ninth and final opener is OWEN. Christian Owens, was a backup dancer for Taylor and is now her final opener. He will be performing for seven shows. 
Although Swift will be touring for 27 days, her tour is a journey through the musical eras. Swift will be traveling across the U.S to 20 cities starting on March 17, 2023 in Arizona and ending on August 9, 2023 in California.

RISE and the Student Government Association will host Take Back the Night (TBTN), an event focused on sexual assault and domestic violence awareness on Monday, April 17 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.. TBTN will take place on the first floor of Hillwood Commons, and have many activities for students to participate in, including tabling from nonprofit organizations and students organizations, food, raffles, a poetry slam and a candlelit march against sexual violence. The goals for the event are to empower survivors and educate the campus on various topics. 
“Events like Take Back the Night are important because they are a way to bring the community together and empower students by showing them that their voices and rights matter as well as educating them on the resources at their disposal,” senior health sciences major and Historian of RISE Ruiz said. “There is a community there to support them and stand by them. I am very proud of all the things this organization [RISE] has and will accomplish. I hope this organization will become a pillar of support on campus that students can rely on. I look forward to seeing everyone at Take Back the Night on the 17th.” 
RISE is a student-run organization at Post centered around social advocacy and philanthropy. It was established during the fall 2022 semester. RISE emphasizes sexual assault education, prevention and awareness. The organization aims to increase the distribution of essential resources on campus. RISE membership is open to all students at Post. Past meetings have involved themes of self-care, mental health, mindfulness and creativity. 
Ruiz spoke on the organization’s importance and goals. 
“RISE’s core purpose is to promote safety, knowledge and resources for our students on our campus. Being informed and aware is very important to protect oneself. I think that having quick responses from public safety, access to counseling, and easy access to knowledge about Title IX and the LIU Sexual Misconduct Policy can benefit the students on the LIU Post campus,” Ruiz said. “Attending RISE meetings and events like Take Back the Night can benefit many students at LIU by helping them gain knowledge of their rights as students, resources available to them on and off campus, education on healthy relationships, and exercises and skills that can aid in mindfulness and self-insight.”
The Take Back the Night Foundation (TBTNF) has been spreading awareness and preventing sexual assault globally for over 40 years. The organization grew in the 70s during the spike in violence against women in America. Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles were heavily involved in the organization’s earlier protests. As a result, advocates in these states received an accumulation of media coverage. The initial objective of the organization was to increase women’s sense of safety when walking alone at night. This initiative was prompted by the fatal stabbing of microbiologist Susan Alexander Speeth as she commuted home from work late at night. She was 37 years old and only a block away from her home when she was attacked. After Speeth was attacked, Philadelphia residents mobilized and a Women’s Tribunal Council was formed in 40 countries to discuss women’s and intimate partner violence. As time progressed, the TBTNF tackled more intersectional women’s issues through protests, rallies and marches. 
Today, In addition to women’s violence, the organization advocates for male and gender non-conforming individuals who have experienced sexual assault. Many cases of adolescent sexual assault occur on college campuses. A high incidence of sexual assault can be attributed to drugs, alcohol, binge drinking and party culture. 
In a study conducted by the Journal of Studies on Alcohol (Mohler-Kuo, M., Dowdall, G., Koss, M., & Wechsler, H.), 1 in 20 women reported being raped in college 7 months after they started their first year. Three-quarters of those cases involved the victim being intoxicated. Therefore, they were not able to consent or refuse any sexual activities or intercourse. It was revealed that students who lived on campus in sorority or fraternity houses were more likely to be assaulted than students living off campus. Women from colleges with medium and high binge-drinking rates had an increased chance of being raped while intoxicated than those from colleges with low binge-drinking rates. Women who had experience with binge drinking in high school had an increased likelihood of rape while intoxicated.
According to an estimation made by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (Fisher, B.S., Cullen, F.T., & Turner, M.G.), for every 1,000 women attending a college or university yearly, 35 incidents of rape occur. Less than 5 percent of sexual assaults or attempted rape is reported to law enforcement after. 
Junior international business and finance major Emma Thibodeau is the current vice president of RISE. She spoke on what to expect at Take Back the Night. 
“Take Back the Night is going to be our biggest event of the year. It’s essentially a resource fair where different organizations from off-campus, as well as on-campus clubs, are going to table. There will be hand-outs and various activities to do. You have the option to meet people, gather valuable resources, play games, eat food, watch a movie, experience a poetry slam, learn about different topics, donate to charity, and win an awesome raffle all in one place,” Thibodeau said. “In the end, we will be doing a candle-lit march around campus to celebrate survivors which will be really impactful. It’s an event everybody should experience, and nobody will want to miss it. Students will receive various resources from off-campus organizations that offer services like free counseling and other valuable mental health resources. There will be on-site counseling from the Center of Healthy Living available for students who want it. Most importantly, students will be able to experience an impactful event that may help them to feel heard and seen in a way they might never have before.”
Many campus organizations, including the Black Student Union, Phi Sigma Kappa, Alpha Xi Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Inclusion and Equity Council, will be attending and participating in TBTN.
Junior social work major and RISE President Elect Kaitlyn Jordan also talked about the upcoming event. 
“We have worked very hard on creating Take Back the Night and many different activities will be going on. The Center for Healthy Living will also be providing free on-site counseling. We want to ensure everyone feels safe and if they are struggling, they will have someone to talk to,” Jordan said “All RISE executive board members are also a resource. We believe victims of sexual assault, it is never their fault, and we are here to support them.”
Take Back the Night encourages victims to speak up, and promotes a supportive environment for embracing and listening to others instead of marginalizing them.

In the 2022 spring semester, students collaborated to restart the Black Student Union (BSU) at Post. BSU is a student-run organization that ensures Black students have a vessel for resources, opportunities, and inclusion. In its pursuit to diversify Post, BSU welcomes all students to join and participate in meetings and events. Every Thursday during common hour, the club hosts a meeting in the multicultural lounge in room 206 of Hillwood Commons. 
BSU has an active Instagram and Twitter account. They also have an up-to-date page on the Post presence website. On Presence, it says, 
“Black Student Union (BSU) promotes a welcoming and united space for students of color to have an effective partnership between our members and the LIU Post Campus Community. We will ensure our members will receive motivating and empowering personal development skills. BSU strives to provide educational, political, cultural, and social programs to the LIU Community. Our mission is to empower our members to realize their potential in an ever-changing society and to be life-long learners and leaders.” 
The first Black Student Union was established in 1960 to relieve college students of racial discrimination. Now, universities nationwide are rapidly introducing Black Student Unions as a community for students to advocate and uphold racially diverse incentives and opportunities. It emphasizes the importance of catering to students’ intersectional identities. The organization makes sure Black students feel safe and welcome on campus through events and general meetings. The main goal is to unify black students as well as others on campus. All students are eligible to join BSU. The organization is open to involvement from all ethnicities, gender identities, sexualities, religions and economic backgrounds. 
Senior sports marketing major Noah Anderson spoke on his relation to BSU as on of the co-presidents. Anderson attended BSU’s Wildin Out event at the start of his freshman year. From then on, he has been heavily involved in the organization.
Anderson assists the executive board with responsibilities and duties. He strategizes and controls the BSU budget in coordination with the treasurer, discusses and reviews business matters with the advisor, and acts as a BSU spokesperson. 
“I noticed early on how much of a minority I was at Post. I’ve taken multiple courses where I am the only Black person in the class and in my senior year, I’ve maybe had two Black professors over the course of my four years. With all that being said, I found my community and sense of belonging through athletics and BSU. Getting involved with BSU early has had a profound impact on my overall college experience and I encourage other Black students to do the same,” Anderson said. “Having a BSU on campus is vital because we attend a predominantly white institution (PWI). As minority students, BSU allows us the opportunity to come together and create a safe and fun environment through interactive, entertaining and festive programming. BSU also acts as the chief liaison between Black students and the university’s administration to take active measures toward fostering and enriching the university’s environment.” 
During his earlier years at Post, Anderson maintained a position on the executive board while being on the football team. 
“There are many micro aggressions and subliminal undertones that I’ve faced as a Black student-athlete here at post. Being on the football team specifically comes with a certain perception and assumptions of character from other students. Unfortunately, other students miss out on some good, genuine people. I hope that BSU will better integrate student-athletes with the other student body and knock down the stereotypes and stigmas we face”, Anderson said. “Now that BSU is back, future students of color have a student organization and community to join on campus. BSU affords students leadership opportunities within our executive board where you develop and implement skills that can be used in life outside of school and build your resume. Moreover, BSU in collaboration with LIU’s IEC, the Inclusion and Equity Council, hopes to revive different fraternities and sororities that were on campus in years past.” 
Sophomore criminal justice major Shaylin Martinez is the co-president of BSU. Martinez started as the secretary for BSU during her freshman year. She discussed how she feels about the club’s presence. 
“I was secretary for BSU my freshman year under a different presidency position
and truly fell in love with our values and the community we had built. I’m a Bronx native. Moving to a predominantly white suburban town, Northport Long Island, was a complete utter culture shock. I live in a predominantly white suburban town. This experience made it important that if I had the opportunity to be a part of an organization like BSU, I’d be involved. When I arrived at Post in the fall, this organization was the first I spotted at student involvement day; seeing people that looked like me and made me feel comfortable was a breath of fresh air.”
Martinez spoke about her close relationships with the members of BSU. 
“I’ve been lucky to have professors that care and listen, they have truly been a blessing and made my experience here at Post easier. When you feel valued in a classroom, it just pushes you to strive for more. Many professors during my freshman year have made a great impact on me,” Martinez said. “They allowed me to see potential in myself for a leadership role in an organization like BSU. Although I didn’t have professors of color, that did not diminish my experience at a PWI. However, I do hope we can challenge Post to hire more faculty of color so students feel seen and heard. BSU is a business that represents POC at Post. We really hope to build connections with faculty here in order to create the best events that will build our reputation as the new BSU.”
Freshman health-sciences major Britney Merlain is the co-secretary of BSU. She is a part of BSU so that Black students like herself can be heard and included in more academic settings and events. 
“I got involved in BSU by signing up during common hour,” she said. “Princess Henderson and Noah Anderson were promoting the group, and I joined because I wanted to be more involved on campus and find a place of belonging. Through the first meeting alone, I was inspired to join the board because I wanted to be a part of making a difference for Black students on this campus who feel as if their voices are not considered.” 
“The weekly BSU meetings are a safe place for students on campus because they allow free expression. Through the informal format, we encourage students to get to know each other better and voice their concerns. Not constricting on what they’re allowed to express, we try to make it a place in which no one is shy to express their opinions and we can have fun together as a group,” Merlain said. “Making it inclusive, we aim to host events such as the taste of the world and rep your flag to encourage the members to become cognizant of other cultures and create a newfound appreciation for everyone’s background and heritage. With BSU I want to connect with alumni and help them reach out to our members. Speaking on their careers and how they thrive as black leaders, I want BSU to be something that extends outside LIU Post. With the climate that we’re in right now it’s pivotal to build a lasting community and giving students mentors will help them tremendously.” 
Sophomore healthcare administration major Synnovea Narine is the vice president of BSU. She spoke on the organization’s importance and growth. 
“l hope that LIU can slowly start becoming an institution that is safe for people of color. BSU shares the multicultural lounge(MCL) with IEC. It’s a safe space for meetings because the lounge is furnished along with having a tv,snacks, and air conditioning. This makes students feel more comfortable when they step in. I love the MCL but after seeing our meeting attendance go up I think we need a bigger multicultural space. God willing, we are hoping to get merch in so we can sell them along with having a goodbye party for our current president graduating and also a family bbq before we go on summer vacation. Do watch out for the flyers and buy tickets.”

On March 26, officials in Miami Beach declared a state of emergency as massive crowds of spring breakers descended on the Florida city causing chaos, including the shooting deaths of two people. 
Alina Hudak, the city manager, signed the emergency declaration on Wednesday. This has allowed officials to impose measures to protect the health and safety of persons and property. The emergency declaration is in effect through Monday, March 27. This declaration came after Miami Beach issued a weekend long curfew earlier this month which the city chose not to extend. Miami has a population of 90,000 residents, but it has become an international tourist destination. 
Since spring break season started in the beginning of March, Miami Beach has already recorded four arrests for assault and three arrests for battery. There have also been seven arrests for robbery, 20 arrests for carrying a concealed firearm and 37 felony drug arrests. 
“I live in Florida, and 10 out of the 12 months of living there it is truly the best, but those two months of spring break are dreadful,” senior Florida Atlantic University nursing major Adrianna Ruiz said. “Florida is beautiful and I understand why people travel here. It’s warm weather all around, but it’s my home and seeing strangers trash it is so sad. I wouldn’t come to your house and trash the place. It’s just respect.”
Not only have there been arrests but there have been two deadly shootings. The friday night shooting had one male victim killed and another seriously injured, sending crowds scrambling in fear from restaurants and clubs into the streets as gunshots rang out. Police detained one person at the scene and found four firearms. 
This led to the city of Miami mandating a curfew. The curfew would be from 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, March 13 until 6 a.m. on Monday, March 20, with an additional curfew of Thursday, March 23 through Monday, March 27. The curfew mainly affects South Beach, the most popular party location for spring breakers.
Under the curfew, people must leave businesses before midnight. Hotels can operate only in service to their guests. The city said restaurants can stay open only for delivery and the curfew won’t apply to residents, people going to and from work, emergency services and hotel guests. Some roads will be closed off and arriving hotel guests may have to show proof of their reservations.
The city of Miami is considering ending Spring Break after all the chaos occurring.
 “Later in the night and people are drinking and maybe getting high there’s another whole set of issues, and I don’t know that we could program that. We just have to close up businesses. If we really want to end spring break you have to have a curfew so people will go somewhere else,” Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said.
“This Spring Break, I was debating if I wanted to go back to Miami or go up north to Orlando and I’m very glad I went to Orando instead,” senior finance major Elijah Scout said. “I wanted to go to Miami because it’s Miami, it’s beautiful, but after seeing what was happening on the news, it’s just too rowdy for me. I don’t think I would have been able to enjoy it as much as I would’ve liked to.”
The Miami Beach City Council has come up with safety proposals for next year so no one will see or go through another mayhem. Some of the proposals are, securing the perimeter on ocean drive, having private ticketed events, closing the causeway and ending spring break entirely. 
Spring breakers travel to the sunshine to spend days on the beach and party the night away, but officials are wondering when it will not lead to violence, and become fun and safe for residents again.

On Sunday, March 26, hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens took over the streets revolting against Israel’s newly re-elected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s attempts to change the way the country’s judicial system works.
In response to Netanyahu’s dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday, a political mobilization took place, including a countrywide strike and widespread shutdowns around the country. Even Gallant had spoken out against the judicial reform. Israeli cities were paralyzed by demonstrations. In a show of discontent, people stopped leaving airports, campuses and malls. Now the question is whether Netanyahu’s coalition can hold and whether the delay would affect the chances of the judicial overhaul passing.
Back in November 2022, he was re-elected for a record setting fifth time. He leads the most right-wing coalition in Israel’s history, and he promised to govern for all Israelis, no matter how he felt about politics. But instead, his planned changes have led to large-scale protests that haven’t been seen since the country was founded 75 years ago.
The Israeli government has been trying to weaken the High Court’s ability to act as a check on the Knesset by making major structural changes to the institution. A number of measures have been proposed that would make it easier for the Knesset to overturn the Supreme Court’s decisions by a simple majority vote. Moreover, it would strip the attorney general of critical authorities while vesting them in a committee of nine government appointees responsible for selecting judges. Protestors feel that these, and similar reforms, would undermine the independence of the court in a legislative system with few additional safeguards
In response, verklempt natives of the country took defiance toward his illiberal, ultranationalist regime, following the two months of widespread protests in Israel over a proposed package of judicial reforms by the Netanyahu government that would undermine the independence of the country’s highest court and pave the way for unfettered majoritarian control.
Other former leaders of Israel have warned that fascism could take over, and now their voices are getting louder. Former prime minister and one of the country’s most decorated military leaders Ehud Barak, has been joining the protests, as have Yair Lapid, a former prime minister and leader of the opposition, and Tzipi Livni, a former minister of justice. “In Israel, nobody, not even the prime minister, will be above the law,” Livni said back in January.
However, Netanyahu and his allies have been against the protesters for months and have not changed their minds.
“The extreme and dangerous group that plans [the protests] just wants to burn down the house and make chaos in the country,”  Netanyahu said in early March. 
Netanyahu is currently on trial for alleged corruption. He denies the charges, but they have been a problem for him in politics for the past few years. People have thought that these accusations are why he has been trying to change the Israeli judiciary in a big way, which would weaken its stance on independence.
Junior economics major Paula Espinosa stated that she has been following along with news on the protests in Israel since 2021. 
“I’ve been an activist basically my whole life, I come from a family of immigrants, and my parents have always taught me to stand up for my rights and independence,” Espinosa said.“It’s devastating to hear what their prime minister has planned, it’s almost like he betrayed his own country and their beliefs, many of these citizens have fought for what is right, and for him to get power hungry and decide to stick his neck out and say I hold the power over everyone, I’m the one who gets a final say isn’t right at all. You’re citizens, the people who voted for your re-election, that’s who gets a final say.”
Sophomore international relations major Kendall Morris, also shared opinions on the situation.
“No, quite frankly I think Israel government is corrupt. How do you preach about equality when you discriminate against your Palestinian citizens and force them to move to the West Bank region? Especially when their population is almost half of your country, yet they live in horrible conditions and Israeli authorities have unlawfully killed over a hundred palestinians. Israel’s whole government system is messy and I believe filled with propaganda.”
Morris refers to the killing of 151 Palestinians in West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022 after protesting past incursions in the region.
Junior communications major Marleigh Colson chimed into the discussion on Prime Minister Netanyahu’s attempts to overhaul the judiciary system.
“There is no way, no matter how important or powerful you are, you can go against basically your whole country and threaten to take away their independence, and successfully get away with it, like that just can’t happen. It’s the same situation with our country with the attempts to overturn Roe vs. Wade. You can’t really assume a collective of women are gonna allow you to take away their feminine rights, after tirelessly fighting for it, you’re gonna face an overwhelming amount of backlash, and that’s the same thing Israel’s prime minister is facing,” Colson said.
Colson feels that the protests show solidarity and resistance among the people of Israel.
“No citizen that enjoys their freedom will allow that, especially since you have 600,000 people shutting down the streets, my mind can’t even wrap around the thought of that many people shouting at the top of their lungs for justice, sorry but not sorry Prime Minister, it’s never gonna happen, even if you fire every single official in office,” Colson added.
Colson spoke about the social and political issues facing the U.S., and how the state of our nation compares with Israel. 
“The U.S. has some tough issues to crack down on. Our country urgently needs to address the ongoing problems many of us sadly face. Officials in both Israel and in the U.S. are often ignorant to our complaints and both countries suffer in their own way, tragically, because no one wants to answer us, but both countries are seriously corrupt and need to take culpability. It’s insane to think that we voted for these people to be in office and they’re handling the critical issues like customer service. No one has the patience to wait anymore, and citizens in each country are tired of the injustice and won’t rest until it’s accounted for,” Colson said.
The vote to overhaul the judiciary won’t happen until at least April 30, or even later. What this means for protests in the meantime is not clear. Even if Israel’s internal problems get better, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is extremely hostile, and Palestinian resistance has led officials to warn of a third uprising or intifada.

On March 3, four South Carolinians made the trip down to Mexico, one of which was getting a medical procedure done south of the border. As they made the trip past Texas and into Matamoros, Mexico, none of them were prepared for the horror that would follow. 
Just before noon, the van that they were taking to the procedure was intercepted by five members of the Gulf Cartel, and immediately fired upon. 
As the Americans were dragged into the cartel’s truck and captured, bystander Arely Pablo was struck and killed by a stray bullet in the ambush. U.S. officials believe that the Americans were not the intended targets, and that the cartel made a mistake in thinking they were an enemy. 
“I think that it was more of a wrong place at the wrong time situation for them,” junior broadcasting major Brendan Kaufman said. “It could have been any of those things. It could have been targeted, or it could have been coincidental and these people were unfortunately in the crossfire.” 
Mexican authorities found the victims on the morning of March 7. Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were found dead while Eric James Williams and Latavia McGee were rescued, although Williams was wounded. They were found in a wooden house just outside of Matamoros while the five attackers were arrested. Cheryl Orange, the fifth member on their trip, stayed behind in Texas and contacted police on March 4 when she could not reach them. 
Junior fashion merchandising major Grace Catanese thinks that the quick response by authorities and the fact that they were tourists helped with the rescue of the two survivors. 
“I feel like there are a lot of tourists and it makes it easier to find those who are not familiar with the area. The swift action taken by the authorities also may have saved the two that were still alive,” Catanese said.
Kaufman agrees with this sentiment, saying “I think the reason they got it so efficiently is because they care about stopping the cartel because cartel violence is one of the biggest issues in Mexico.”
The Gulf Cartel took responsibility for the kidnapping and turned over the members that were involved to the authorities. They also left a note stating that the members acted on their own and against the Gulf Cartel. 
Catanese believes that this incident will create some tension between the United States and Mexico. 
“I feel like now Americans are going to be more weary about going on vacation to Mexico. I think that maybe having the governments talking things out can relieve some of the tension but I don’t know if that is a possibility right now,” she added.
Some American leaders were pushing for U.S. military intervention to fight cartels, but Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador does not want any foreign interference in this issue.  
Kaufman does not think the American government will retaliate in any way. 
“I don’t think they are going to do anything drastic because they got it quick and the cartel itself apologized. I feel like that doesn’t happen most of the time and I think the cartel realized they messed up and tried to avoid conflict,” he said.
Over the last few years, disappearances of tourists in Mexico have become an unfortunate occurrence. Certain parts of Mexico have become too dangerous for tourists and this has made more people traveling there concerned. 
When asked if she would travel to Mexico or abroad after this incident, Catanese does not think that this attack will have an effect on other countries. 
“For Mexico, since this is so recent, I would probably be a little bit hesitant about going. I would definitely still travel abroad. It could depend on the area, but I want to visit Europe and while every country has their issues, I don’t think that this incident will make me change my mind about that. For Mexico though, I would wait a few years,” Catanese said.

On Monday, March 27, a school shooting at private elementary school, The Covenant Presbyterian Church, occurred in Nashville Tennessee leaving three adults and three nine-year-olds dead.
Police identified the shooter to be a former student, Audrey Hale, 28. Hale was carrying three weapons, two assault rifles and a pistol. Hale had also legally purchased seven weapons from five different local gun stores. There has been no motive as to why Hale did this, but Hale had been receiving treatment for an emotional disorder. Hale was living with their parents and they hid the guns from them and their parents had felt that they shouldn’t own weapons. 
Surveillance video shows the shooter entering the school by shooting the side door. Hale then moved upstairs to the second floor firing multiple shots. The shooter was killed within 14 minutes of entering, but within those few minutes, Hale killed three adults and three children. 
The three children who were killed are Evelyn Dieckhaus, Haillie Scruggs and William Kinney all who were 9-years-old. Hallie was the daughter of Chad Scruggs, the senior pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church. The adults killed are head of the school Katherin Koonce, substitute teacher Cynthia Peak and custodian Mike Hill. 
“My heart is absolutely broken. three of the victims are literally babies. They had their whole lives and it was cut short by someone who they didn’t even know. One of the police officers’ body cams was released and while they were running up to the shooter you see a blurred out little body of one of the victims just lying there. It’s just so wrong a little baby didn’t deserve that, no one does,” senior Queens college major Lauren Hernando said.
Police reported that the shooter prepared for the killings with a manifesto and a booklet; they found out exactly what Hale had planned to do. They found a map that shows entry points in the entire school, the weapons that were going to be used and the clothes Hale was going to wear, which were exactly what Hale wore the day of the shooting. There is also reason to believe this wasn’t the only target for the shooter. Police found another map of a local mall. 
This shooting took place 10 months after the Uvalde Elementary school shooting in Texas in May. A Texas lawmaker points out the complete difference in police response. 
“Nashville PD neutralized the killer in 14 minutes. Then in less than 24 hours they release body cam footage. Meanwhile Texas PD let the Uvalde killer wreak havoc for 77 minutes and made legislators sign NDAs to view footage. Ten months later, they have YET to be transparent about what happened on May 24,” state Rep. Roland Gutierrez (R-Texas) said in a tweet.
“It’s cowardly. Both police departments, not just one, are in the wrong. Yes Nashville PD went in asap and killed the shooter before they could do more damage but they should have never released the body cam footage because what does that give us? We saw a 9-year-olds lifeless body on the floor and then showed us when they took the killer down. The Uvalde PD shouldn’t have taken 77 minutes to enter the school, 21 people were murdered because they took too long to intervene. They need to do better,” freshman education major Ava Saper said.
There have been 130 mass shootings across the U.S. so far this year and many states have been calling for new gun restrictions, but many Republican-led states moved in the other direction. 
“We can’t control what they do,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) said.
“It’s so absurd that they can’t enforce harder gun laws but they can take away a woman’s right entirely. Make it make sense. Children are being killed in schools and they expect me to have a child just to be murdered? Yeah no thanks I’m good,” sophomore criminal justice major Sabrina Kuvykin said.
States led by Democrats have been pursuing more stringent gun control measures. In Connecticut, after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, state lawmakers made an assault weapons ban, banned high-capacity magazines and implemented universal background checks. Last year, Oregon voters approved a sweeping gun control measure, which requires gun purchasers to get a permit and take a gun safety course.
On Friday, dozens of people poured into the Woodmont Christian church’s main sanctuary for the first funeral service of the six victims.
