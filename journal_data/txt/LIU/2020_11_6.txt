On Thursday, Oct. 29, Nassau Hall hosted a virtual costume contest for its residents. Contestants were competing to win gift card prizes and enjoy the spirit of Halloween.
The event was hosted by resident assistant (RA) Francesco Diflora, who has been working hard to keep his resident’s spirits high in spite of the global pandemic. “The most challenging thing about maintaining morale is the fact that a lot of residents are coming and going because of  quarantining and online classes,” Diflora said. “It has created a real funk in the hall due to the lack of people.”
Still, events like the Halloween costume contest have managed to keep residents engaged and entertained in Nassau Hall. 
“I truly love the RAs and the group of students we have here. We find ways to make every day feel like an adventure,” musical theatre major and resident of Nassau Hall Thomas Rowell said. Rowell was also a participant in the Halloween costume contest.
“My girlfriend and I dressed as WALL-E and EVE from ‘WALL-E.’ We got the inspiration from scrolling through Disney Plus,” said Rowell. 
With residents dressed up in their various costumes, RA Francesco acted as host of the virtual event.
“So I acted as host but not judge, the winners were decided by a vote from the residents. The people got who the people wanted” said Diflora. 
The winners of the contest were students Sloan Huber and Cassidy Lennick, who dressed as RA Francesco and RA Julian, which proved to be an absolute hit. “One of the residents dressed up as me, and it was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. She even got my mannerisms” said Diflora.
Even students who didn’t get first place still had fun during the virtual event.
“I loved all the different costumes and the creativity. It shows that we all have our own parts of us and it was great to show that off,” Rowell said.
With the costume contest over with, students and residence hall staff are now looking forward to whatever events the rest of the semester might have to offer. “There are always events in the making,” Diflora said. “One that I am very excited to be starting up soon is a campus-wide scavenger hunt.”
Nassau Hall’s residents are just as excited to be participating in all upcoming events. 
“I always suggest for my friends to come if they can. All the RAs are working hard to help us find some sense of normalcy in our COVID world,” Rowell said.

Long Island University is helping and advocating for student-athletes to vote in the Nov. 3 election by launching the LIU Votes initiative. The program is LIU’s portion of a Northeast Conference initiative called #NECVotes that encourages “all members of  the Athletics community to register to vote, learn about the issues, and become a part of an engaged citizenry.” 
The goal of LIU Votes is to have 100% of eligible student-athletes to be registered to vote before  voter registration deadlines, and teams such as Women’s Bowling and Women’s  Field Hockey met this goal. Francesca Rossi, a junior on the Women’s Bowling team, sent her absentee ballot a few days ago. “This is actually my first time voting, and I think it is important to vote because even though you are just one person, your vote does matter,” she said. Madison McCarthy, a sophomore on the Women’s Swimming Team is one of the students  working behind the scenes of the LIU Votes initiative. “I think it’s important to vote because voting is one way you can use your voice in our government system. Many people around the world don’t have this privilege, so I think it’s important to use the power we do have to make changes,” McCarthy said. 
This is the first year of the LIU Votes initiative, and Assistant Director of Athletics/Director of Media Relations Casey Snedecor helped  bring the program to life. “It was something I had been thinking about all summer and discussing with other members of the department  and administration, but came to fruition through our Diversity and Inclusion Task Force.The student-athletes there supported the idea and were willing to help make it a reality,” she said. “I couldn’t have made it work without their help! Particularly Madison McCarthy, she did a ton of research to help us make the site the best it could be.” While  LIU Athletics Runs LIU votes, the page has posted resources to help anyone, regardless of what state they’re from, to learn more about the candidates and issues that are represented in this election. To encourage athletes to vote, the NCAA Division 1 council passed legislation stating that student-athletes can’t practice, compete, or participate in other countable athletically related activities (CARA) on the first Tuesday after Nov. 1 every year, including this year’s Election Day on November 3rd. Sarah Hafely, a freshman on the Women’s Field Hockey team, believes that everyone should vote in this election to help fight for others. “All U.S. citizens that can vote should vote every time because it is our civic duty and responsibility. As a young, queer, white woman, I need to use my ability to vote to fight for my rights and the rights of others, like people of color and other minority groups. #BlackLivesMatter”

Jake Bofshever, Broward County native and former wide receiver to the LIU Sharks has made his name in LIU ranks. On Oct 24, Bofshever was signed as a wide receiver to the Jousters of the Spring League.  The Spring league is a professional football league that houses many former NFL players, and players eventually looking to reach the NFL.  
Bofshever is a talented athlete who crafted his athletic ability to garner the recognition from coaches, teammates, and professional football opportunities.  
​Head Football Coach and Defensive Coordinator Bryan Collins has worked with Bofshever through his college career and has witnessed his dedication to his athletic development firsthand. 
“He came to New York as a quarterback, then stayed in that position for a while.  Bofshever waited, worked, and worked, and perfected his abilities, but along that journey to doing so, he showed us his full talent,” he said. “What he wanted to be was a wide receiver.  He worked towards it and got it. 
He’s always been courageous, a great teammate, and always worked harder year after year to make his way up the ladder.  Bofshever deserves it, he worked hard, stuck through it, and preserved to the end.”
​As the head coach, Collins has directly overseen Bofshever’s growth in his athletic ability during his time on the LIU Sharks.  Bofshever carefully watched his leaders closely so he could do what they did to make him successful. The process of preparing himself to become a leader wasn’t easy.
The chances to showcase his ability became slim, but just as Collins said, Bofshever preserved.  “Jake’s position came with very strong leadership roles.  You have to condition yourself to be a leader.  He fit in naturally as a leader for the team. 
He took a backseat to the earlier leaders and watched what they did to garner the same amount of success, or more,” Collins said.  He did exactly that and opened himself a door of opportunity for more scholarship money and playing time.
 He followed the process.  He was a program kid, kids that come in and develop that force to push through and stay on the field.”
​The athletic development that Bofshever gained has launched him into the sites of professional playing opportunities. 
The desire to play football and the brotherhood of his teammates fueled his inhibitions to go to the top.  Coach Collins believes that Bofshever’s extra attention in the off-season and still engaging in his sports activities helped him earn his top spot.  “Jake attended pro games, workouts, and is playing in the spring league.
He is still chasing his dream even during the pandemic”, he said.  “Still working out, still going to practice, staying on his regimen.  He worked hard; he knew he could make it.”  
Due to his work in college, a bright future is in the stars ahead for Jake Bofshever.  Whether on or off the field, Jake will definitely work in football.
​“I can see Jake having a lifetime involvement in sports.  He has a great personality, he’s talented, and works hard. If he wanted, he would be an amazing sports agent if he doesn’t want to take football professionally,” Collins said.  “He can open plenty of doors for himself, he’s a fun guy, has a great personality, and is a great athlete.”  The road to growth wasn’t an easy one in Bofshever’s case. Football is a quick-thinking high-collision sport. Injuries aren’t foreign to the sport of football.  Many great players receive injuries and take games or even seasons off.
​“Injuries are all part of the game, but that’s where your personal skill and the chemistry you have with your teammates help you prevail.  You have to be aware of every side of you on the field,” Bofshever said.  I know my teammates will do the best they can for me when it’s time for them to.  But when it comes down to me catching a ball and going for a touchdown, I’ve got to think fast and play smart before I make a wrong move.”
Bofshever’s passion for football will never waiver, as it continues to be one of his favorite activities throughout his college life.  
​“I’ve always loved football. It’s literally my favorite thing to do.  When I was a child, my father and I used to play catch with my football and watch the game a lot.  I think that’s what got me into the game. Since then, I’ve been on school teams, summer leagues, park teams, you name it. Wherever there was a chance to play football, I was there. I did whatever I could to make sure I stayed on the field. It was my dream to be quarterback in high school, and I got that. After high school and with all the progress I made, I felt like there was more I could do, more to play. Here at LIU I went to workouts, participated in off-season workouts, found summer leagues and I can’t emphasize enough on the number of workouts I’ve attended,” Bofshever said
​Growth in athletic ability is nothing foreign to Bofshever. His latest feat of wide receiver was a testament to his growth.  Bofshever had to take a step back to watch and learn again.  He had to continue to hone his abilities to incorporate his new position.
​“Becoming a wide receiver was almost like a stepping stone for me. I feel like it’s the first time I was able to see the progress of my work. Seeing how I transitioned from quarterback to wide receiver was amazing to me.  All I’ve known was quarterback and thinking it’s the top place of leadership,” he said. 
“Being a wide receiver showed me the importance of teamwork and the split leadership roles. Of course, the physical work was strenuous, but the mental work is exhilarating, looking back on catches is the best, and there’s no other feeling like scoring a touchdown.”

The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have leaked into the sports seasons  at LIU. The impacts of the pandemic have devastated both students and coaches.
Men’s Basketball head coach Derek Kellogg is excited for the day the season can get back underway. “I feel like we’re all anxious to get going and have a college basketball season and get back to some normalcy. Not only in athletics, but in our everyday life. So I think those two things go hand in hand.” Kellogg said .
The sense of community and togetherness displayed by all players throughout the COVID pandemic, is telling of how much of a strong family they have made for each other, both on and off the court. “I would say, to be honest with you I’m not really looking forward to anything specific, but just playing on the court with my brothers. Like, pretty much, I just want to lace my shoes up, you feel me? And get the season going, nothing really special that I’m looking forward to. Just trying to be a leader on this team and hopefully we can do big things to start our season” said Cotton. 
Many students and coaches shared similar experiences and opinions when discussing their emotional state surrounding the delays and cancellations of games. Due to these setbacks, some students were concerned that the  season would not be held at all.  Men’s Guard, Virshon Cotton understands the severity of the situation, but is also hopeful for the season’s return. “ I think that the season won’t come. Just because of the whole University and the effects of COVID. This is bigger than just basketball,” he said “But do I want the seasons to come? Yes, and we’re gonna keep doing everything the right way, so if we finally get the chance to have the season, we’ll be ready.” 
Ty Flowers, a Redshirt Senior, wants the opportunity to give it his all in his final season.  “I’m ready to go out there and win a championship. That’s it,” he said.  “I’m ready to go out there and win a championship. That’s it.”  
The phenomenal sense of community and togetherness that is displayed by all players throughout the COVID pandemic, is telling of how much of a strong family they have made for each other, both on and off the court. “I would say, I’m not really looking forward to anything specific, but just playing on the court with my brothers,” Cotton said. “I just want to lace my shoes up, and get the season going, nothing really special that I’m looking forward to. Just trying to be a leader on this team and hopefully we can do big things to start our season.”
On the women’s basketball team, players voiced similar responses about their outlook for the next season. Mia Perkins, Senior Forward, is optimistic for the season’s outlook. “I’m actually excited to get things going back to normal, as long as we follow all rules and protocols and make sure we have a safe environment, I think we should be good.”she said.,
Brandy Thomas, Junior Guard, is excited to get back on the court. “I am definitely anticipating the experience and rush of adrenaline just being on the court with my team and gaining some wins with them,” Thomas said.
The team’s coaches are concerned not just with getting the sport’s back on track, but also the safety for everyone involved. Coach Kellogg feels the administration is putting them in the best situation to play this season, while keeping students safe at the same time. “ I’m eventually optimistic about sports, obviously returning. What the new normal is, I think is the question mark for everybody,” he said. “I believe all the administration, the coaches and the players are doing the best they can to put themselves in a position to have some sort of normalcy and season with the future, obviously being a little bit brighter.”  Kellogg said. 
Women’s head coach Rene Haynes is taking things one step at a time, but ultimately feels the season will be played.“I am very optimistic about everything returning back to normal this season. If things don’t, I believe that we are all doing our best to make sure our students are safe, while they enjoy playing the sport they love,” Haynes said“Adversity comes in different shapes and sizes. We just have to stay focused and understand that we have to keep looking forward and working together towards our goals.”
Overall all basketball teams have been impacted greatly by this sudden shift in schedule for their athletic lives. Looking forward, many remain optimistic yet realistic at the same time.

Editors Note – Zach Taber is a writer for The Pioneer
The great white way is at a standstill, with no new shows going up, and no long running shows being able to continue their legacy, Broadway is dark. During this difficult time, many theatre artists are out of a job and are attempting to find new ways to create. 
Junior musical theatre major Zach Taber, attended “Jagged Little Pill” on Broadway during its last performance before the COVID- 19 pandemic caused Broadway to shut down. It wasn’t until the curtain closed that Taber learned that this was the last performance. 
The uneasiness in their stomach started to rise.
“Normally there’s a kind of buzz in New York, but the entire city felt a little bit more dismal, people were worried,” Taber said.
Though the show helped to distract from the uneasiness of the air around them, it was still a bittersweet experience for Taber. 
Broadway itself may not be able to continue throughout the pandemic, but that does not mean theatre artists around the country cannot continue to create. For many, theatre is their income, their way of life and a source of joy. 
Directors and actors are adapting to a new way of performing, but it does not come without challenges. Hannah Ryan, the Resident Director of “Hamilton” on Broadway, is currently directing a production of “Roe” at Post. “Roe”  is based on the 1973 Roe V. Wade case legalizing abortion.
“These students and this subject matter, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity,” Ryan said. 
Ryan came into this rehearsal process prepared to undergo challenges. She expected the pandemic to make in person rehearsals difficult as acting relies heavily on physical connection. Upon receiving the news that no audience members could be present during the performance, Ryan had to adjust her plans.
Ryan recounted her idea as a bookend approach to the play. She is excited to have a combination of in-person filmed segments wearing masks, and solo monologues filmed without masks.
 “[We are using a] combination of Zoom, fully remote filming, getting filmed on your own, and in person, and the highest of quality studio filming,” Ryan said.
Sophomore musical theatre major Quinn Doyle is excited to be a part of “Roe.” He is playing Man 2, which is a combination of many characters that will appear throughout the play. Doyle has also been struggling with virtual rehearsals. “If I can do this, the rest will be a cakewalk,” Doyle said.
Doyle has chosen to have a positive outlook on the impact coronavirus has brought on theatre.
“[Masks and social distancing are] really cool in a way, and it’s becoming a challenge for all of us that we’ve never really had to face before,” Doyle said. 
Ryan and Doyle agree that the show they are working on is rich in history and relevant right now. With the upcoming presidential election, and the recent passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, women’s rights are at the forefront of the discussion. 
Due to social distancing, more time is allotted in rehearsals for dramaturgy work. This is when the director and actors sit down and talk about their characters, their history, and the historical background of the play. 
Ryan uses the added time as much as she can. “[The cast] delves into the specificity of character, especially because so many of these characters are actual human beings from our history,” she said.
Usually, Ryan would only spend a day or two with her cast doing this type of work, but with her cast of “Roe,” she spent over a week. 
On the West Coast, in Washington state Erin Murray directed a production of “Men On Boats” with social distancing guidelines as well. Murray dubbs herself a Femme Forward Theatre Maker and has created different types of theatre, from Shakespeare to new works, with people from all walks of life. 
Murray has been acting since she was seven. “You start to get addicted to the collaboration and the creativity,” Murray said. When she was 20, Murray began to fall in love with directing, and she has been doing it ever since. 
This past August, Murray directed a student production of “Men on Boats” written by Jaclyn Backhaus. A production not normally fit for social distancing, “Men On Boats” tells the story of ten explorers in four boats charting the course of the Colorado River in 1869.
She worked with Youth Theatre Northwest, a children’s theatre on Mercer Island, Washington. “There are two large fields on either side of the theatre, and the building itself has 5 large double doors that can remain open,” Murray said, describing how well the space works for social distancing. Although some may jump to suggest a digital performance, Murray said “There’s too much lag time and confusion with Zoom, it really is an ensemble piece.” 
An in-person rehearsal process did not come without complications though. Murray recounted the numerous panic attacks she faced. “Even small complications seemed to be amplified into massive problems because of the stress everyone was under,” Murray said. 
“Every 50 to 60 minutes I would need at least seven minutes to go outside to sit, relax and breathe,” Murrary said, and she would implore each of her cast members to do the exact same, hoping no one was too far in over their heads.
All of the trouble wasn’t for nothing though. Murray found beautiful moments with her cast members that she likely would never have experienced without the restrictions of the pandemic. 
“The young actors had to learn how to take up more space on stage, it was asked of them from the characters,” Murray said. She was able to watch these young actors grow in ways that would not have occurred had there not been a pandemic. Much like Ryan and Doyle, Murray has chosen to find the silver lining during this time. 
As for the future of theatre, all three agree that this pandemic will have a permanent impact on the art as they know it. 
However Ryan is okay with that and finds it thrilling. She is aware of the new ways this pandemic has forced her to think. Ryan added animation to a piece she had been working on for a year, which is something that she never would have thought to add before.
Doyle sees a future where there won’t be a packed house which scares him but is something he’s coming to terms with. Murray agrees and hopes that these changes will lead to more inclusivity and a more diverse film lineup, with more Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) and women artists dabbling in Zoom theatre. 
With every day an opening date being pushed back, or a show being closed forever, it is important for artists to remind themselves why they do what they love, and why, truly, all of the struggles are worth it.
