Moa Golster (’16), the Pioneer’s Online Editor from 2014-2016, who redesigned and relaunched the Pioneer’s website, is a researcher and reporter for Sveriges Television (SVT), Sweden’s equivalent to Britain’s BBC or PBS in the U.S.
“What I love about my job is I learn new things everyday about the world, as well as how to be a better journalist,” Moa says. “It’s also very exciting to be working for such a resourceful news organization, and with programs that I could only have dreamed of to be working for only a few years ago.”
