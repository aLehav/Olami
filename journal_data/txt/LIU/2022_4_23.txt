Have you ever set your mind on one thing and had your entire plan upended?
Senior communications and theatre arts major Shelley Dean came to Post for one thing: the musical theatre program. Dean got her start in theatre as a child growing up in Seattle, Wash.
Dean began pursuing a career in theatre in the third grade, when she was in her first production.
“Theatre was what I always planned on doing since I was in my first production in third grade. I played a wolf in Beauty and the Beast. My only line was ‘peanut butter,’” she said.
After that show, she was hooked. Dean was in different school productions in her later years. When college came around, she decided to continue her theatre career. She traveled to Chicago, Ill. for an audition with LIU. After being accepted, Dean made a move not made by many college students. She traveled 2,800 miles from home for school.
Dean began as a musical theatre major in the fall of 2018, and furthered her theatre career with voice lessons and acting classes on campus.
“I never planned on pursuing anything else. I ended up being a musical theatre major for my freshman and sophomore years,” she said
However, like many of us, Dean hit a fork in the road in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic forced her back to Washington, where she attended her theatre classes remotely.
In the middle of all of this, Dean became interested in another passion that she had: writing.
“During the quarantine when I was back home, I realized that there were a lot of different subjects that I wanted to explore and different hobbies that I never got the chance to pursue. I knew that I had a passion for writing and journalism and I knew that I would regret it if I didn’t explore that,” she said.
Dean became so passionate about writing that she declared a second major in communications. She took her first journalism course with The Tide’s faculty advisor, Zaina Arafat, and fell in love. 
“I fell in love with writing and editing in that class. We also made videos,” she said.
Her favorite project she made was in Arafat’s class. It was a documentary about loneliness during the pandemic, starring her cats, Zoose and Goose. 
This was the beginning of a second career for Dean, one that would later be fused with theatre. During her junior year, Shelley joined The Tide as a staff writer. She became co-editor of arts & entertainment in the fall of her senior year, later taking over as arts & entertainment editor, as well as the managing editor. 
Dean has taken mostly journalism and broadcasting classes for her communications major, and feels that these classes will complement her theatre classes in a useful way.
“Being a communications major has been great. I feel that I have picked up a lot of really useful skills in a short amount of time. I also feel like my communications major mixed with my theatre major is going to set me up really well with what I want to do with my life,” Dean told me.
Dean has taken her writing skills and fused them with her theatre knowledge, creating an exciting new opportunity for herself. Dean will be moving to New York City after graduation, and hopes to get involved in the theatre industry.
“At the moment, I am planning on moving to New York City. I have a couple of really exciting jobs and internships lined up. I recently started writing for BroadwayWorld.com as a theatre critic,” she said.
While Dean was always passionate about working in theatre, she has realized that writing about it is the route she wanted to take.
“In the long run, my biggest goal is to write about art and theatre, whether that be as a theatre critic or an arts & entertainment reporter. I would just like to make a career out of the two things I love,” she said.
Dean’s advice for current students speaks volumes. She urges students to remain open minded and keep broad horizons.
“My advice for students is to always keep an open mind and keep your options open because that worked out really well for me. You never know what will happen,” she said.

The department of communications & film held an event featuring an array of journalists on Monday, April 18 from 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.. The event, which took place at Lorber Hall, featured a panel of four journalists coming from a variety of diverse backgrounds. 
Each of the journalists on the panel has years of experience in the field of journalism, starting with David Giambusso, who was a former staff writer for Politico that currently works as an editor for WNYC and the Gothamist. Katie Jennings also had experience working for Politico as a healthcare reporter, and now works for Forbes as a staff writer. Ruben Davis has experience producing in Spotify and VICE News, and is now working on a primetime special for ABC News. Garance Franke-Ruta most recently worked as the executive editor of GEN by Medium, and had experience editing for the Atlatic and Washington Post as well. 
This discussion was organized by the Department Chair of communications Susan Zeig, with senior communications and theatre major Shelley Dean and sophomore communications major Alexander Mousa helping lead the conversation. The event featured both Zoom and in-person speakers, as Davis and Giambusso were unable to attend in-person. 
When discussing the motivations of these journalists, Franke-Ruta recalled what she found appealing about being a journalist. 
“If you are curious, kind of noisy, and sociable, [journalism] allows you to make that into a profession,” Franke-Ruta said. “The thing [that is unique] about journalism is the life you get to have as you work. You get to really be there and talk to people and ask questions that are important, impertinent, and things that you are wondering about and I think that is really cool.”
As the conversation progressed, the challenges that journalists face became a prevalent theme.While Jennings and Franke-Ruta cited time management and the rapidly changing business models as some of the biggest challenges they face, Davis and Giambusso agreed that getting access is a hurdle that all journalists have to overcome.
“The central challenge for any journalist is really getting information from people who don’t want you to have it. It is the most important part of the job,” Giambusso said. “It takes a lot of making sources and making sure you are open to stories wherever you can find them. The primary role of journalists is to uncover stuff that people don’t want to uncover, which leads to the constant tension.”
In conjunction with Giambusso’s belief that sources can be difficult to find, Ruben Davis also noted the issues that the current landscape of media presents today.
“I think that the story of the media today is one of change and instability. When you get a group of journalists together, especially people who are just coming up, it sounds very scary,” Giambusso said. “I think that defining characteristic in journalism is not all that different than the key skills you need today to operate in a workplace; which is the ability to change and adapt. I think people today are more suited to that.”
When discussing the current climate of journalism and media as a whole, a recurring talking point was the subscription model that many news organizations have adopted for their online publications. For Jennings, a staff writer at Forbes specializing in healthcare and business, the appeal for the reader remains the same.
“At the end of the day, whether you are in front of a paywall or behind a paywall, whether you are writing for a local news site or a national publication, people want to read unique [stories],” Jennings said. “People still want those scoops and news they are not gonna get anywhere else. There is this constant figuring out what do readers want and how do we use technology to respond to that.” 
Another prevalent topic that emerged from this discussion was objectivity in reporting, and whether journalists are ever truly able to put their bias aside when covering a story. With each of the journalists having their own beliefs on the subject, Franke-Ruta offers prospective journalists advice on how to address this in their reporting. 
“One of the ways I think people can bring perspective into their stories while still being fair and not prejudging anything is to bring your perspective in when you ask the question. The question you chose to explore is where you make the choice. But you don’t know what the answer is. That’s why you are a journalist,” Franke-Ruta said. “The answer may be totally different than what you think and may be contrary to the interests of the people you care about. But you start with a question and you express your personal views through the choice of questions you seek to explore rather than the questions you get along the way.”
While issues such as objectivity, bothsideism and the views on segmented media were up for debate, all of the journalists unanimously agreed on one thing; be wary of what you put on social media. 
“Twitter has been a real problem for journalists because people think ‘oh it’s Twitter, it doesn’t really matter’. This is the conversation happening in newsrooms right now because people are always getting in trouble for posting biased stuff and basically crossing over these lines,” Jennings said. “Anyone that [Forbes] hires, they are looking at their Twitter, Instagram, and all of their social media accounts to see how they behave online … Think about what you are doing online now.”
Throughout the entire hour-long conversation, the journalists addressed many of the pertinent problems surrounding journalism today, and offered important advice to young journalists looking to make it in this highly competitive field. Giambusso reflected on the selfless nature of the journalism profession as a whole.
“Every journalist makes a sacrifice. The pay isn’t that great and the hours can be tough and it is hard to have people consistently shut you down,” Giambusso said. “The folks who are in those warzones and reporting on those oppressive regimes are really the most inspiring.”

The new Marvel movie “Morbius,” hit the big screen on April 1, 2022. “Morbius” is seemingly a Spider-Man spin-off, but fans are very disappointed in how it turned out. 
Dr. Michael Morbius was a renowned chemist with a rare blood disorder, which normally would be treated in real life, but he experimented with dangerous cures. He used vampire bat DNA, which gave him “pseudo-vampirism.” His symptoms were an unquenchable thirst for blood, a bat-like appearance, the ability to fly, and a healing factor that allowed him to survive being injured.
The film was swapped with repetitive, meaningless vampire tropes, such as when multiple characters died and came back to life after tasting Morbius’ blood. 
“Morbius was hard to follow, and I kept asking myself, ‘What is happening, and why does this even matter,” junior finance major Elijah Stout said.
The film has been so widely panned, it sits at a 16 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, which is an audience critic-driven website. Forbes reported that Morbius suffered “a 74 percent drop from its $39 million debut, which is the biggest drop ever for any big comic book superhero movie.”
The movie had a running time of only one hour and 45 minutes, which did not allow Morbius to show character development. If the movie had had a longer running time, it would have had the opportunity for Morbius’ character development. He did not have any moments for him to come to terms with being a vampire. Once he realizes that he is capable of murder, Morbius immediately takes on the role of a man on the run from the law.
Fans are not blaming Jared Leto’s acting for the downfall of the movie, but instead the writers of the film. Critics even began sucking the enthusiasm out of Morbius months before it got released.
Morbius had the opportunity to make a big debut in the Marvel Universe, but because of a poor screenplay, the opportunity was passed by. Regardless, Morbius deserves to be watched by audiences, not because it is a wonderfully made film, but so people can conduct an opinion for themselves.

Many people see celebrity award show culture as something that needs to be spoken about more; especially after the Oscars, in light of the Will Smith and Chris Rock situation. Many believe that celebrities take advantage of their fame and let it take over their professionalism. Many celebrities do things without a care and without thinking about who they are affecting. 
The Oscars 2022 with Will Smith and Chris Rock nearly getting into a fight was a perfect example of this, according to people who are upset with celebrity behavior at award shows. Wanda Sykes, the host of the Oscars this year, went on many interviews with talk show hosts and after viewing them, people feel as though celebrities don’t actually think about the effects of their actions. Many saw it unfair to Sykes that Smith and Rock would be immature at such a prestigious award show and saw the behavior to be unacceptable.
This conflict has caused much controversy on the internet, with many people taking a side or saying that they were both wrong with their behavior. Many people say that Rock should not have made that joke about Jada Smith in the first place and that they can understand Smith’s anger and some think that Smith’s actions were unnecessary and unprofessional and that he should have been removed from the award show. This drew attention to the fact that it is not okay to violently put your hands on others, but since Smith is a celebrity, he didn’t have to deal with the consequences that ordinary people would. 
“I think that the whole situation was unprofessional and while it could have been avoided, Smith was also in the wrong for thinking he can do that. If he was upset, he could’ve communicated that [in] a better way,” sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato said. 
Many people believe that Will Smith’s anger came from Jada having alopecia, which makes it hard for her to grow hair. Smith saw this joke as too far and unfunny. Instead of handling it how many people would’ve liked to see Smith handle it, he lashed out and took it upon himself to walk on stage and slap Rock. Rock handled the situation as best as he could, despite the fact that many people thought that he should not have made that joke in the first place because he doesn’t know the extent of what Jada is going through. 
“I think that celebrities think that they can do whatever they want, even if it isn’t the right thing to do. There are a lot of people that spent a lot of time and energy to make the Oscars a good night and it is a shame that this situation took away from it,” sophomore nursing major Anna Polcini said. 
This was a really significant moment in celebrity award show history and it really made people think about how privileges may come with being a celebrity and how some celebrities don’t hold themselves accountable for their actions at certain times.

Streaming platforms are becoming an increasingly common source for watching television. As they have become more popular, the execution of the service has not always gone smoothly. Despite the massive advancements in streaming technology over the past two decades, there are specific hurdles that the industry continues to face. In particular, bandwidth limitations, latency issues, and device compatibility challenges prevent viewers from experiencing seamless video streaming. Watching live events such as award shows and sports have proven to be difficult, resulting in platforms crashing and upset viewers.
In today’s crowded media landscape, technology challenges must be addressed to retain viewers and increase profits. Viewers know that creating high-quality content is a key differentiator for video streaming providers, but the content is useless if viewers cannot access it or have a smooth viewing experience. Ensuring that big media files can be delivered quickly without lags and viewed on any device is paramount to a streaming provider’s success. The viewers expectations are being able to access the highest quality video on any device, in any location and without waiting.
The recent Grammy Awards struggled with a successful streaming experience for viewers. Paramount+, the streaming host, was hit by technical issues for the audience at the beginning of the show. Several viewers complained of issues on social media throughout the ceremony. 
“I am a frequent user of streaming services and see them in a positive light most of the time,” sophomore biology major Maja Toth said.
Service providers are working to resolve increased traffic in a few ways. They are working to improve broadband capacity by investing in upgraded fiber optic cables, better WiFi equipment and, most famously, the new generation of cellular technology, 5G. Making networks faster and boosting infrastructure will help networks handle more traffic and could improve users’ overall experience.
“I have also experienced technical problems such as lagging or crashing all together. I know this frustrates millions of people, and reasonably so. If a service knows it will be heavily trafficked for a show, they should be proactive and find a way to solve technical issues,” Toth said.
Netflix is viewed as the best streaming platform and shows no signs of dropping its rank. It includes a wide variety of familiar network shows and more original series, films, documentaries and specials than any of its competitors. The world’s first major streaming service remains the favorite choice thanks to its huge library of consistently refreshed content and its easy accessibility across different devices. Netflix won 44 Emmys in 2021, more than the next two media companies combined. Depending on the plan you choose, Netflix costs between $10 and $20 per month, which is at the higher end for a streaming service. Its recent price increase shook up the streaming world and moved Netflix closer to HBO Max in terms of cost. 
The media world is far from resolving all technical issues and being perfect, but there does seem to be hope for the future. As platforms and consumer demand is constantly changing, new problems arise while old ones get fixed.

We all know and love the british boy band who melted our hearts on the X-factor back in 2010. Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson started their X-factor careers as solo contestants but failed to make it through to the live shows individually, and so Simon Cowell put them in a group together and they were able to finish 3rd in the singing competition and Cowell signed them to his Syco Records. This was just the beginning for One Direction. 
The boy band topped the UK charts with their debut single “What Makes You Beautiful” in 2011 and later signed with Columbia Records. Another big band at the time, Big Time Rush, had One Direction join them on tour in 2012 and their first album “Up All Night” became the first British group to top the U.S. charts with a debut album. 
One Direction recorded their second album “Take Me Home” in Stockholm, and it was released in 2012 alongside their number one singles “Live While We’re Young” and “Little Things.”
In 2013 their documentary movie “One Direction: This Is Us” was released, directed by Morgan Spurlock, became the fourth highest concert movie. This was when they also revealed their third studio album “Midnight Memories’.” This featured their lead single “Best Song Ever.” 
In 2014, they released “One Direction: Where We Are – The Concert Film” and an autobiography entitled “Who We Are”. Followed by this, the band released their fourth studio album “Four.”
On March 25,  2015, was the day the world stopped for many teenagers as their hearts broke. It was the day that Zayn Malik announced he would be leaving the band. Fans across the world were distraught as to why. 
“I remember it like it was yesterday. I was home from school and I just broke down in tears. I ran up to my room and put a sign on my door that said, ‘Zayn had just left the band. Please leave me alone. I’m crying.’ It still hurts thinking back to that day. I would blast their music and cry to the posters as if Zayn could hear me, ” junior at St. John’s University Samantha Rooney said.
Later that year in 2015, they released the first single from their fifth album, “Drag Me Down,” and announced that they were planning a hiatus to explore solo career paths starting January in 2016. 
It has been six years since the hiatus, and many students wonder what the band members are all up to. Harry Styles has released two albums, “Harry Styles” and “Fine Line” with one new album “Harry’s Home” being set to be released on May 20. Zayn has released three albums, “Mind of Mine,” “Icarus Falls” and “Nobody is listening.” Niall has released two albums, “Flicker” and “Heartbreak Weather.” Louis has only released one album, “Walls,” and Liam has only released an EP “Liam Payne 1.”
Although all of the boys are successful and still making music, Harry Styles has sold the most albums out of the band members. His first album, “Harry Styles” sold more than 230,000 copies by February 2020. That is 100,000 more copies than Zayn Malik’s first album, “Mind of Mind.”
“I personally don’t like to compare the boys’ success from one another because in my eyes they’re all successful and doing things that make them extremely happy,” senior at Malloy high school Jada Simpson said. “They all make great music that the entire One Direction fandom enjoys listening to.” 
As much as fans may hope for the day that they decide to get the band back together, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Liam Payne all said they want to start making music together again, but Harry Styles and Zayn Malik seem to be enjoying their solo careers.
