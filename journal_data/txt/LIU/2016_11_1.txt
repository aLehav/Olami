After losing all-conference senior quarterback, Jeff Kidd, two weeks ago to a knee injury, and backup quarterback, Matt Brennan, to a similar injury last week, football went into its matchup against Pace University on Saturday, Oct. 29, with third-string quarterback Mike Campbell as the signal caller.
The sophomore was 24-for-30 for 136 yards and touchdown and also ran 13 times for 62 yards to guide the Pioneers to a 35-17 win, their ninth in a row to open up the season and the NE- 10 Conference clincher.
It is the team’s first regular-season conference title since 2011. As a result, the Pioneers will host the NE-10 Championship game on Saturday, Nov. 12.
Similar to the win last week against AIC, the Pioneers leaned heavily on the running game, accumulating a total of 218 yards. Trailing 3-0 late in the first quarter, the Green Machine’s first touchdown drive was capped off by senior running back David White, who scored from 13 yards out. On that drive, White also ran the rock two other times for 18 yards.
Almost a quarter later, just before the half, the Pioneers drove down the field with help from White and sophomore tailback Malik Pierre, who combined for 30 rushing yards. Campbell took it from there; he found red-shirt junior receiver, James Higgins, from six yards out to go ahead 14-3 at the break.
The team’s 11-point advantage only widened in the second half thanks to the running back duo of White and Pierre, who both scored a touchdown. Thanks to key contributions from the special teams group and an 11-play, 81-yard drive, the Pioneers led 28-3.
Although outscored by seven in the final stanza, the outcome was decided by the first three quarters; the Pioneers won 35-17. Red-shirt senior receiver, Shane Hubbard, hauled in seven balls for 46 yards while Higgins had 23 yards and a score. In the rushing department, White ran for 117 yards and two scores while Pierre also found the end zone twice and totaled 41 yards.
Defensively, senior defensive back, Kareem Folkes, and junior linebacker, Kamani Odrick, each had seven tackles while red-shirt junior defensive lineman, Anthony DeNunzio, had six tackles and a pass break up. The duo of junior defensive lineman Kevin Petit-Frere, and freshman defensive back Joshua Flowers, also pitched in with a sack and interception respectively.
The Pioneers will close out their 2016 regular season Saturday, Nov. 5, against Merrimack College in North Andover, Mass.
Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. It is still uncertain who will be under center for the Pioneers in that matchup, but Head Coach Bryan Collins praised the job Campbell did against Pace. “I thought he was poised. He managed the game plan we put in,” Collins said. “He took care of the ball and he made some big plays when he had to.”
Regardless of the outcome against Merrimack, the Pioneers will host a very meaningful game on Saturday, Nov. 12.

This semester, the university launched an initiative, geared towards engaging students and faculty in the election process. This initiative, named LIU Votes, has been active on both the Post and Brooklyn campuses, and has included voter registration drives, absentee balloting, debate viewing parties, and open discussions.
Shuttles will be operating on Nov. 8 to get students and faculty to the local polling location at Jericho High School; those who entered LIU Post as their permanent address when registering to vote are assigned to vote at the Jericho High School in addition to residents who live in the area nearby the campus.
“The goal of LIU Votes is to provide LIU students, faculty, and staff with the opportunity to participate in the election process, register, and vote in the November election,” said Michael Berthel, associate dean of students and director of campus life. “On-campus events are being held throughout the election season to encourage participation and engagement in the process. LIU Votes is a non-partisan initiative on both the LIU Brooklyn and LIU Post campuses.” Berthel added.
The office of Campus Life hosted viewing parties for all three presidential debates and the vice-presidential debate, in the End Zone. Samantha Resnick, a freshman musical theatre major, attended the first viewing party on Sept. 26.
“I went to the first presidential debate in the End Zone, I thought it was an interesting atmosphere. It was a nice communal event,” she said. “In my opinion, it’s important that students educate themselves in order to make a responsible choice.” This election will be Resnick’s first time voting.
Also in attendance at the first debate viewing party was freshman musical theatre major, Anna Gwaltney. “I think it’s great that the campus is having these events. It would be irresponsible if a college campus didn’t hold these types of events.” Gwaltney said.
In addition to hosting the four debate viewing parties, the office of Campus Life collaborated with the Nassau County League of Women Voters to hold voter registration and absentee ballot drives in Hillwood.
“Through our marketing campaign, we were able to register a high number of students and are continuing to encourage submissions of absentee ballots,” Berthel said. Students have been encouraged to submit absentee ballots at the campus concierge desk, so they can be promptly mailed out.
The LIU Votes website features information for would-be voters including the voter registration deadlines for each state, information on how to register, and how to apply for absentee ballots. Absentee ballots are popular among students who cannot make it home to vote. Aracely Garcia, a sophomore physics major, said, “I’m from Texas so voting via absentee ballot is my only option. As a minority and due to how the elections are going so far, I think it’s imperative I vote and absentee ballots allow me to do so.”
Commuters often opt to travel home to cast their vote, including Steven Frank, a sophomore pre-med major. “Exercising your right to vote is important and I think it’s extra important for young people to vote,” Frank said. “I live only 30 minutes away and it’s a nice experience going home to vote. My polling place is right around the corner from my house so it’s convenient.”
The office of Campus Life is planning to cap off this election season by organizing an election night event. Students are encouraged to attend and support their candidate as the final polls come in.

The Pratt Center will be the location of Campus Life’s second annual Move-a-Thon on Thursday, Nov. 4, from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. The event will raise money for the Don Monti Research Foundation, which is focused on finding a cure for cancer. Last year’s event raised over $13,000 for the organization; this year, the goal is to reach $15,000, according to Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life.
According to the official website, the Don Monti organization was founded by Tina and Joseph Monti shortly after their 16-year-old son’s passing in June, 1972. Don Monti fought a tough battle against leukemia. Now his name is known for raising money to help patients and facilities.
“Today, the Foundation raises more than $1 million annually — more than $42 million since its founding — and serves an evergrowing number of patients,” the website reads. “Its commitment remains firm – research, education, fellowship and patient care.” Nearly 500 students, faculty, and staff collectively attended the event last year. Most student organizations, including Greek life, clubs, and athletes showed support for the cause.
Similar to last year, Berthel said there will be an opening ceremony with a University welcome, remarks from the Don Monti Foundation, reflections from student volunteers, and the presentation of fundraising awards. Following the ceremony, there will be activities including raffles, prizes, food, and music.
“The night will celebrate our efforts and highlight the wonderful work that our community has done to benefit the Don Monti Foundation,” he said. “We are pleased to have support from so many faculty, staff, and community partners.”
Along with the Don Monti Foundation, partners include organizations that provide the event with food, activities, and donation. Comments on behalf of the foundation were unavailable.
Senior political science major, PSK president and this year’s homecoming king, Benjamin Brinton, is looking forward to attending the event for the first time with his fraternity members, who will be tabling and supporting through donating to the cause. “I think it’s a great event for a great cause,” Brinton said. “The campus support has been amazing; all of the resident buildings are raising money.”
Students can register for Move-a-Thon in the lobby of Hillwood Commons or online at www.tinyurl.com/MoveAThon-LIUPost.
Registration for Move-a-Thon is $10 for students, $15 for visiting guests and can be paid in person at Campus Life, Hillwood Commons, room 100, or online at www.gofundme.com/moveathon2016.
All proceeds will be donated to the Don Monti Research Foundation.

“We sometimes say it is LIU’s best kept secret,” said Professor Marci Swede, chairperson of the department of health sciences, when referring to the Health Information Management (HIM) program.
The fact that the program has a small number of students backs that assessment. But that is something Professor Swede and Professor Marie Colin, director of the HIM program, hope will change in the near future by trying to reach out to students and explain what the program is about.
“The program is a mix between business, science and information technology and it educates students to handle data in the healthcare system,” Colin said. According to Swede, it is this mix that partially explains the low numbers. “People understand what you mean if you say you will study business or nursing, but not many high school students have heard of Health Information Management.”
But the hybrid nature of the program also makes it possible for students to come from different directions. In addition to the bachelor program in Health Information Management, students from any background can apply for the Certificate in Health Information Management, a 30-credit online program taken during their senior year. There is a list of prerequisites to be found on the HIM’s website, and according to Swede, this is a great opportunity for business students to find a career within healthcare or heath studies.
Colin explained that the certificate enables students to take an exam after graduating, to make them a Registered Health Information Administrator. This exam doesn’t require additional coursework and will, according to Colin, make students very attractive on the job market. She said that all students have the opportunity to do an internship. Swede added that one of the best things about the program is the work experience of the current teaching professors.
The strength of the program, according to both Swede and Colin, apart from the variation about working in an interdisciplinary field, is the job market. Data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics backs their market claim. The projected growth in employment from 2014 to 2024 is 14 percent, which is double the average growth, suggesting the secret program won’t stay secret for long.

Not every student is given the opportunity to work alongside their professor in independent undergraduate research, but Oliver Hollingsaeter, a senior Economics major and member of the men’s soccer team, was among the lucky ones.
In a year-long association with assistant professor of Economics, Veronika Dolar, Hollingsaeter entered the New York State Economics Association undergraduate research competition and made it as a finalist. “I am passionate about undergraduate research and I try to mentor good research projects,” Dolar said.
Hollingsaeter’s paper, titled “Corporate Sustainability and Performance of Norwegian and Swedish Firms Using Dow Jones Sustainability Index” was the only paper submitted by LIU that made it to the finalist position.
All in all there were four papers selected, one was from a students studying at Williams College – the most selective liberal arts college in the nation – and another one from UCLA. “Oliver was really placed in a group of students with very impressive backgrounds,” Dolar said, seeing this feat as “quite an achievement” for Hollingsaeter.
Hollingsaeter was the first to present that day, and was given the opportunity to meet with his discussant before the presentation began.
“I thought I was going to be more nervous,” Hollingsaeter said. With the competition being at Farmingdale State College, beginning at 7 a.m., and Hollingsaeter having a soccer game that same day at 11 a.m., there was much to be nervous about. Hollingsaeter said that meeting with his discussant “calmed his nerves.”
“Oliver is a very hard-working student,” Dolar said. “Given the fact that he is also playing for our soccer team, he had to develop strong skills with his time management as well,” she continued.
Just after presenting, Hollingsaeter had to rush to make it to his soccer game. He was informed the winner was the student from Williams College via email.
Hollingsaeter encourages students to take on the opportunity to do research if it arises. “The opportunity to do undergrad research is amazing,” he shared. “It is the best thing on my resume.”

Dim lighting, stacks of books and absolute silence are just a few characteristics that come to mind when discussing typical libraries.
For students who need to write papers or theses, the library can seem like a daunting place: many students may not even know where to begin, as endless shelves sorted in some foreign code can be overwhelming.
Yet, with the influx of ever-changing technology, libraries, including the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library on campus, have begun to introduce new and effective ways to study, research, and participate in group work to prepare students for the modern world.
The campus’ library has recently introduced high-bench tables and soft seating, “many of which have been powered so students can plug in and/or charge their devices,” said Assistant Professor Eduardo Rivera, head of reference services. Initially implemented about a year and a half ago, additional seating and other amenities have been added periodically. “Responding to student requests, we have [added] scan and fax stations as well.”
However, modified furniture and new machines aren’t all the library has to offer for students doing research; the librarians are more than happy to help with any task, from finding specific articles to reviewing citations.
“There are a number of resources to assist students with their research needs,” Rivera said. “They range from the online databases for finding scholarly articles, as well as magazine and newspaper articles, to the Library Guides, which are research guides that librarians create for focused research help. We also provide digital delivery of print and microform periodicals within our collection and Interlibrary Loan for items not in our collection that we can get from other institutions.”
Through the Interlibrary Loan system, students will be able to find scholarly articles and navigate through various online databases, as well as benefit from assistance with the proper citation of their sources. The service aims to expand the range of publications available to the community, not just for students, but also for administrators, faculty, and staff. Books and articles that are not owned by the campus library are available upon request to be borrowed from other libraries through an online catalog.
In addition to the cross-library exchange, the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is home to The Archives and Special Collections Department, which contains about 60,000 items that include books, manuscripts, correspondence, journals, photographs, posters, maps, original drawings, theatre programs, archival documents, and an abundance of other materials.
The department provides special access to rare and unique collections in order to “support and encourage the research needs and participation in academic programs of undergraduate and graduate students,” according to its mission statement on the website.
“Not only can librarians assist students in finding sources, [but] we can also teach students to properly evaluate the sources they find for their research,” Rivera said. “A popular research service that we provide is our Book-a-Librarian service where a student can schedule an appointment with a librarian for personalized research help. For Book-a-Librarian, we did 12 appointments in September and I expect that to pick up greatly as we get closer to when term papers are due. Toward the middle to end of the semester is when that service is its busiest.”
The B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is filled with resources for students, ranging from updated technology to extensive archives to personal librarian assistance. The school has updated the library’s services in order to provide the campus community with a comfortable environment where students and others can access a multitude of resources.
To further serve students for final exams, the library will be open 24 hours from Dec. 13-21, with the café operating until 12 a.m., and librarian help available until 1 a.m.

As I walk into the End Zone on Halloween day I am greeted with distinct medieval creatures. I’m surrounded by werewolves on the TV screens, melancholic-looking mermaids, green-skinned knights, headless monsters and various other mystical creatures.
It turns out that I was not at Comic Con as I was beginning to think, especially with everyone dressed up in their Halloween costumes; this was a student exhibit on monsters from the middle ages. The exhibit was organized by history professor Jay Diehl, who teaches a first-year seminar on the history and literature of monsters from the Middle Ages.
As I walked around and engaged in conversations with Diehl’s students they all enthusiastically told me about their projects. All six presentations included Melusine the double-tailed mermaid (inspiration for the Starbucks logo), the Green Knight, Blemyae, Werewolves, the Loch Ness Monster, and Beowulf. All the students went into detail about the specific monster they picked including its origin and story.
When asked about the class, all the students gushed about the course and the professor. Casey Dugan, a freshman health science major, said, “Professor Diehl helps make class more interesting. I get excited to come to class.” Dugan, along with her peers Ahmed Timsah, a freshman journalism major, and Renato Aguirre, a freshman business major, had video clips of the different portrayals of werewolves in movies playing on the screens in the End Zone. They also had a small display board with facts on werewolves and their history.
Instead of having a conventional history course, Diehl has created a course full of mystique, monsters, and individuality. “I was trying to develop a topic for a first-year seminar that seemed interesting,” he said. And interesting is what it was, according to his students. Joe Destefano, a freshman business major said “I don’t mind being there,” which seemed like a humorous compliment to the class and professor. When asked if he would have preferred to take a regular history class, he quickly responded with a “no.”
All the students participating were engaged in the work. Alexandra Papageorege, a freshman speech pathology major, said, “I used to not like history whatsoever, but up until my first year in college I started to be more interested in history, especially this class.” Papageorege had a display with a hand-drawn Loch Ness Monster, as well as sour gummy worms for the visitors to take.
Diehl developed the course over the summer taking into consideration that Halloween would fall in the midst of his class on monsters. Aside from discussing the literature and origins of the monsters, Diehl also asks his students to contemplate thinking about what a monster is.

Emmy Award winning actor and comedian, Wayne Brady, will be performing at the Tilles Center on Nov. 5 at 8 p.m.
At the age of 42, Wayne Brady has established himself as a renowned actor, singer, dancer and comedian. While he has been performing as a comedian since 1998, Brady is best known for his role on improv comedy show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” which he appeared on with fellow comedians Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie.
Brady has also hosted his own Emmy Award winning daytime talk show, “The Wayne Brady Show.” He was the original host of Fox’s hit show “Don’t Forget the Lyrics!” and he has hosted “Let’s Make a Deal” since 2009.
Brady’s credentials don’t stop there. This year, he performed as Simon and drag queen Lola in the Tony Award winning Broadway musical “Kinky Boots,” a gig that lasted from Nov. 2015 to March 2016.
All credibilities aside, some students shook their heads at the name when asked if they would go to the show. “Who is Wayne Brady?” said Stephanie Athanasopoulos, a senior digital arts and design major.
But others have already bought their tickets. “I grew up on shows like “Don’t Forget Lyrics” and actually enjoyed Brady as a host,” said Miranda Luparello, a junior digital arts and design major. She bought four tickets and plans to attend the show with her two parents and younger brother.
The folks at ticketmaster.com revere Brady as a “Big-hearted funnyman-jack- of-all-trades—whether he’s singing and dancing on stage or performing stand-up, his jokes always land safely, a testament to his effortless ability to make people laugh.” Ticketmaster’s review system rewards Brady’s shows with four and a half stars out of an available five.
Single ticket prices for the Tilles Center performance range from $45 to $65. According to Stephanie Turner, Tilles Center’s director of Education and Outreach, and William Biddle, executive director of the Tilles Center, LIU students are eligible for discounted tickets, starting at $15. Students may purchase two discounted tickets for each performance.
Tickets for the Wayne Brady show can be purchased at the Tilles Center box office, or online at TillesCenter.org.

The Tony Award winning musical “Rent” is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year with another national tour. One of its stops along the way will be the Tilles Center on Sunday, Nov. 6, at 7 p.m. Even though the show is sold out, a limited number of tickets are being held for students. Tickets can be purchased at the Tilles Center box office, online, or by calling the box office at 516-299-3100.
Jonathan Larson’s rock musical “Rent” first premiered on Broadway on April 29, 1996. Based on the Puccini opera “La Boheme,” the rock musical modernizes the opera’s content. “Rent” is set against the backdrop of the ‘90s AIDS virus as a group of New York musicians struggle to make ends meet while finding love and themselves.
William Biddle, the new executive director of the Tilles Center, has seen numerous productions of “Rent.” “The issues presented in the show are real life issues and the theatre should be a mirror on our society,” he said. Biddle alluded to the idea that not all performances have to be feel-good, fantasy, or romance. The mature themes in this musical challenge audiences “to think and reflect on the themes and not just hum some pretty show tunes in the car on the way home.”
Biddle, who began his job in January 2016, hopes to build a younger audience for the Tilles Center over the course of his career. When asked about the expected audience for the November performance, Biddle said, “The show will draw a much younger audience.”
Aside from the controversial content, the award winning musical score has a wide range of appeal to audiences. Kevin Hansen, an actor at StageLight Entertainment, has a high opinion of Rent. “I think Rent was a theatrical revolution,” he said. “The content of the piece brought so many issues to light in a forum that had previously avoided such dark topics. The score is exciting and bold and beautifully conveys the show’s message.”
According to www.stagelightent.com, StageLight Entertainment is “the off-Broadway theater of Long Island.”
With a completely sold out show, it seems the only place to find tickets now is through online sellers. The tickets available on Vividseats. com are selling for up to $369 each. Stubhub.com is offering its last pair of tickets for $399 per seat.
Students were shocked to hear how high the prices were climbing for the Nov. 6 performance. Junior public relations major, Claire Kennedy, thought that $400 for one ticket “is absurd. I would never pay that much.” Fortunately, LIU students don’t have to. The Tilles Center still has some semi-obstructed view tickets available at the Box Office for $15 with a student discount. According to Biddle, those last few tickets aren’t being advertised so students can have the opportunity to see what he says should be an outstanding performance.
Rent will be performed for one night only on Sunday, Nov. 6. If every performance is sold out, as this one is, the 20th anniversary tour of “Rent” will be a victory.

Like “Arrested Development” and “Longmire,” Netflix has once again produced new episodes of a television series with the British show, “Black Mirror.” Unlike “Longmire” and “Arrested Development,” which were cancelled before Netflix picked them up, “Black Mirror” was simply in a break between seasons when Netflix purchased the rights to the show.
Created by Charlie Brooker, the series was originally broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, but was then picked up by Netflix last September for a third season, the first to be produced in the United States, lasting 12 episodes. Those 12 episodes were then split into two seasons, with the first six released on Oct. 21, and the next six airing in 2017. Before being acquired by Netflix, the first seven episodes aired in England from 2011 to 2014, with three episodes over two seasons and a Christmas special.
“Black Mirror” is structured in an anthology format similar to “The Twilight Zone,” each episode acting as a different story with different characters. This show is for viewers who enjoy drama or suspense. Viewers should be warned that the show includes mature themes and some of the episodes can be very intense for all audiences.
Each episode of “Black Mirror” revolves around a piece of current or near-future technology and how that technology can take over people’s lives in positive and negative ways. While technology is usually portrayed in a positive light in the first half of an episode, the second half shows the darker side, as the characters become more and more enamored with its benefits or suffer from its drawbacks.
In the first two seasons, one of the more memorable episodes was called “The Entire History of You,” and revolved around a memory implant placed behind the character’s ears that recorded all aspects of their lives. The implant allowed the characters to replay their memories over their eyes or on a screen for other people to view.
After a man, played by Toby Kebbell, suspects his wife had an affair, the implant begins to take control over his life. The same quality that made the first two seasons so engrossing thankfully transferred over to the third season and resulted in some great episodes.
“Playtest,” starring Wyatt Russell, was one of the best episodes in season three as it tackled the topic of virtual reality. After Russell runs out of money taking a trip around the world, he volunteers in an experimental video game program in order to buy a ticket home.
Once in a horror game, he begins to lose control of his reality as his nightmares come to life. This episode was very relatable because virtual reality is becoming a popular way to produce video games now. Several systems, such as the Oculus Rift and the Samsung Gear VR are currently available in stores, with the PlayStation VR and the Microsoft Hololens releasing within the next year.
Despite only airing 13 episodes, many popular British actors and actresses have taken part in the series. The first two seasons included appearances by Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Rory Kinnear, and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” actor Domhnall Gleeson. Jon Hamm even played one of the main characters in the episode “White Christmas,” which was the show’s first and only Christmas special. In season three, new cast members include Bryce Dallas Howard, Malachi Kirby, Alice Eve and Wyatt Russell.
All 13 episodes of “Black Mirror” are available to stream on Netflix. New episodes of will air on Netflix in 2017.

What is it that stops us from pursuing a dream or an aspiration? What stops us from travelling to Australia and discovering what the word “wildlife” actually means? What about pursuing a relationship?
Maybe it’s fear. Fear of the unknown. We fear things if they can’t be controlled, but sometimes we just have to let go and follow the path to contentment.
When the idea of moving to America on a soccer scholarship popped into my mind as an 18-year-old, the two things that caused my excitement were FOOTBALL (soccer) and AMERICA! But when the realization hit that this move was going to be a huge commitment, second-guessing sailed through and planted a blackness of fear. I was going to leave my family, my friends, the comfort of my home and, most importantly, English tea… (Lipton’s just doesn’t suffice for this mature British pallet).
The feeling of fear and the feeling of an uncontrolled unknown future nearly stopped me from pursuing something as fantastic as this. Fear led to many absurd excuses, such as “there is too much paperwork,” or “the academics don’t look great…” Yet, three years later, this is the best decision I have made so far in my developing life. I made a massive leap of complete risk, moving thousands of miles away and being completely lost, alone and isolated. But that wasn’t the case, as much as fear tried to tell me otherwise.
I’ve met my best friends, I’ve developed amazingly as a soccer player, but most importantly, my maturation and development as a human being is incomparable and indescribable. Where would I be if I had said “no” to such an opportunity because I was scared? I honestly don’t know.
I’ve met some incredible people along this journey, many who have had such an impact on the way I look at life, that I have completely changed my perspective on pretty much everything I once believed in. Isn’t that unbelievable? Within this big journey, there have been many small journeys that, in their individuality, have provided me something, whether it is a lesson in love or a lesson in sports.
I believe we can all have a similar journey. An adventure can’t be just a robotic, systematic and dogmatic plan where you just stay on the safe road, and walk in a straight line. That isn’t reality. Life is tough and it’s
full of zig-zag roads, which constantly test us. Embrace those complications. Embrace the fact that once you have come out the other end you have learned something, and now you know how to handle that ‘something’ next time around.
We cannot let fear dictate how we live our lives. I’m not talking about going into shark-infested waters just for a swim, because the likelihood of coming out of that situation swimmingly is pretty slim. However, if you want to go abroad to Europe, Australia, or somewhere far, far away from home because you want to “experience,”—and “experience” being the key word here—do it! Don’t lose out on a life-altering experience because of the fear of diving out of your comfort zone.
You may have to substitute your big double bed for a hostel. You may even have to leave your mother, who waits on you hand and foot, for a more self-sufficient lifestyle of cooking your own food and making your own choices. But trust me, it is extraordinarily worth it because you gain an immense amount.
Fear keeps us focused on the past or worried about the future. If we can acknowledge our fear, we can realize that right now we are okay. Right now, today, we are still alive, and our bodies are working marvelously. Our eyes can still see the beautiful sky. Our ears can still hear the voices of our loved ones.
No matter what adventures you go on, no matter what risks you take, make sure that the fear of leaving the comfort of your family, friends and routine doesn’t stop you because that would be completely criminal to the development of YOU. Now, go explore.

Field hockey wrapped up its 2016 regular season with a 3-0 victory over Franklin Pierce University in an NE-10 conference battle at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. Backed by three second half goals, the no. 6-ranked team earned its 13th victory, the fifth in a row. In those five wins, the Pioneers have scored three goals four times and only surrendered a goal in two.
After a scoreless first half, the Pioneers re-grouped and strung three goals together, the first of which came from sophomore forward, Emily Miller, in the first two minutes of the second half. Less than three minutes later, senior midfielder, Steph Mocerino, found the back of the cage and doubled the Green and Gold advantage.
The last Pioneer tally of the day came from junior midfielder, Alyssa Lopresti, who went top-corner against the goalkeeper. In the net, seniors Ericka Parks and Savanah Cummings, combined to keep a clean sheet.
The home side set the tone early with its aggression, and won battle in the shot attempts category handily, 23-6. The Pioneers’ aggression also led to four times as many shots on goal.
After losing three straight one-goal games, two of which went into overtime, the Pioneers have rebounded, winning every game since. “We started off the season extremely strong and hit a few road-bumps along the way on our quest for a championship,” said Head Coach Raenee Savin. “Those losses were definitely tough to swallow, but it helped the team realize that no team can be taken for granted. The team that goes out and plays a full 70-minute game is the one who will be celebrating when the final whistle blows.”
The team’s season will continue, but the regular season has concluded. The Pioneers went 13-3 and outscored its opponents, 41-16. How do they continue to play at a high level? “We take each half and each game at a time; winning each of our small victories will hopefully bring us to the biggest one of them all,” Savin said.

After back-to-back one-goal victories, men’s soccer stepped on its home field for the last time in the regular season on Wednesday, Oct. 26, facing the University of the District of Columbia. The Pioneers upended the Firebirds, 4-1, to go undefeated on the season for the first time in the program’s history.
The no. 2-ranked Pioneers scored the first goal in the 13th minute via senior forward Jason Lampkin. In the 29th minute, sophomore midfielder Charlie Ledula liked the Lampkin goal and decided he’d have one of his own. Both goals were courtesy of passes from junior midfielder Harry Pearse.
Shortly before halftime, the Pioneers extended their lead to 3-0 and took that lead into the break.
In the second half, the Pioneers did surrender a goal but that was all the visitors would get. To avenge the missed shutout opportunity, junior defender David Arvidsson added a fourth of the day for the Green and Gold on a penalty kick.
The team accomplished its goal to remain undefeated on Saturday, Oct. 29, against NYIT in the battle of the boulevard. In doing so, The Pioneers also clinched the East Coast Conference regular-season title,
an honor they have had the luxury of holding seven out of the last eight years.
Junior back Johan Mauritzon is a transfer student from Santa Barbara, Cali., in his first season with the program, and has some high expectations for the team. “We are obviously pleased to have gone undefeated throughout the conference season for the first time in the school’s history, but we’re not done yet as we know that we are capable of winning the national championship.”
The Pioneers were pushed to the limit, however, as they were seemingly outplayed in the first half, surrendering a total of 11 NYIT shots compared to just two for the team. Senior keeper Jesper Malmstrom turned aside all four shots that came in his direction in the first 45 minutes to keep the game scoreless.
The Pioneers broke the tie in the 66th minute when freshman forward Michael Sutton, scored his first collegiate goal with a little help from Pearse who assisted on the tally. The Bears, who were the aggressors in the first half, were stifled by Malmstrom and his defensive unit who allowed zero goals yet again to preserve the victory for the Pioneers.
The Pioneers, led by Head Coach Andreas Lindberg, earned the no. 1 seed in the ECC playoffs. The team will host St. Thomas Aquinas College who holds the fourth-seed slot. In their lone matchup this season, the Pioneers came out victorious with a 1-0 win on Oct. 23. Start time from the Pioneer Soccer Park on Thursday, Nov. 3, is set for 1 p.m.

Women’s soccer is coming off a 3-0 victory over NYIT on Saturday, Oct. 29. With that win, the team has recorded seven straight shutouts and won 12 consecutive games to close out its regular season, 13-2-2. During that span, it has outscored the opposition 24-3.
Although the no. 22-ranked Pioneers can look back at a 2-2-1 record now and see how far they have come, Head Coach Mark Dawson never lacked conviction. “We knew we had a good tea,” he said. “Our confidence didn’t waiver. We just needed to get back to what our program has been about for years, outworking other teams, and that is exactly what we have been doing ever since.”
On the season, the Green Machine averages almost a goal and a half better than its opponents; a large part of that is due to its stifling defense, which allows 0.47 goals per contest. That’s less than half a goal. “Everyone is working hard to make it difficult for the other team to break us down,” Dawson added.
The Pioneers have been led by their center back duo of senior Kristin Brandman and junior Kristen Breihof. “The two of them have led us defensively and have better and better each day.”
With the regular season finished and conference play ahead, the Pioneers know what is at stake. “We know it’s a new season and one bad game could mean your season is over,” Dawson said. “The girls are excited to be home Wednesday and try to win an ECC [East Coast Conference] title. After that, we are hoping to receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament.”
The squad will need to continue its momentum moving forward. Per game, it holds significant advantages in goals, shots, shot percentage, assists and corner kick opportunities.
The Pioneers are hosting Mercy College on Wednesday, Nov. 2. In their lone matchup this season, the Pioneers came out on top 2-1 thanks to a goal in the 89th minute from sophomore forward Andrea Huntzinger. That game was one of the rare outings where the Pioneers were not the aggressors and, instead, were outshot.
Dawson and his no. 2-seeded team welcome third-seeded Mercy College to the Pioneer Soccer Park at 1 p.m. for the semifinal match-up.
