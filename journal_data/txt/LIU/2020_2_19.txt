The new Hope scholarship awarded on campus gives academically successful students who come from households with low financial standing the ability to attend LIU tuition-free.
The Hope scholarship is for New York residents with an SAT score of at least 1100 and an average grade of 90 percent or higher for all classes taken while in high school.
“The scholarship program has people from admissions go out and try to recruit for different high schools,” Deidre Moore, director of Hope Scholars and LIU Promise coach, said. “We always like to have high achieving, high academic students, so we go out and try to get the best.”
Selected students began receiving the scholarship for the fall 2019 semester.The scholarship was created to inspire students by offsetting the cost of tuition, which is currently $36,452 a year.
“It is the idea that it doesn’t matter where you start. It gives you a chance to come to school and follow whatever your dreams are,” Moore said.
The financial aid department on campus considers all New York residents who meet the academic requirements previously mentioned. In addition, the student must have an estimated family contribution of zero to receive the scholarship.
Hope recipient Breanna Shievdayal, a premedical freshman biology major, believes the scholarship is her prime reason for attending LIU.
“It helps me with being able to afford the other costs of college… because living in a dorm on campus is so expensive,” Shievdayal said.
When Shievdayal opened her acceptance letter, she was ecstatic to learn that the scholarship covered the cost of tuition.
“[The scholarship] gives me a reason to stay here,” she said. “It really gaveme hope.”
There are currently 32 Hope scholars on campus, and up to 110 incoming freshman have the chance to receive it for the fall 2020 semester.

Over winter break, with heavy hearts and overwhelming sadness, the campus community mourned the unexpected and tragic death of student, friend and teammate, Clayton Beathard. He was 22 years old.
Described by some as selfless and spiritual, Beathard sacrificed himself in life and on the football field as the Sharks’ starting quarterback. He transferred to LIU as a junior from Iowa Western Community College in spring 2019 and began playing for the Sharks in their inaugural season in fall 2019.
“Clay was a passionate person who wasn’t afraid of a challenge,” fellow teammate and senior broadcasting major, Derick Eugene, said.
Despite his short time at the university, Beathard managed to impact his teammates, coaches, athletes and others in the community in a tremendous way, according to Bryan Collins, head football coach.
“One of the things we often talk about as coaches of athletes is to try to get our athletes to leave their mark, so that people know that you are there, and that you have made a difference,” he said.
When the season got rough, and odds were against them, Beathard made his presence known by lifting the team up. “I have been coaching for 20 years. I also was an athletic director for 10 years here, and in dealing with thousands of athletes and hundreds of coaches, I have never seen anybody make such an impact in such a short period of time here,” Collins said.
Beathard’s loyalty, positive attitude and engaging personality were some of his strongest attributes, according to Collins. He always wanted to stand up for his teammates. He was a man of inclusion, always paying attention to as many players as he could and wanting people to be seen.
Beathard also impacted his teammates through his toughness and commitment to the game which showed Collins, “how committed he was to playing and being a good teammate,” he said. Even though he was injured during the season, he was determined to play and give his all for the team.
Beathard appeared in seven games while playing for the Sharks before being sidelined for a shoulder injury. He completed 52 percent of his pass attempts (94-for-182), throwing for 1,071 yards and four touchdowns, according to LIU Athletics.
“The team will miss the energy and love he brought to the team,” Eugene said. “He sacrificed a lot for us as he battled through tough injuries. He left it all on the field for us.”
But, there was much more to admire about Beathard than his football career. His older brother C.J. Beathard, who is also a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers said he remembered his brother as a loving man of faith.
“He had the biggest heart of anybody I’ve ever known,” C.J. Beathard said in a dedication to his late brother on Instagram. “You could know him for 10 seconds and you would say, ‘This guy is a good guy.’ He just loved everybody. He was a good kid and a good person. He would do anything for the people he loved, his friends, his family. He’s as loyal as it gets.”
Beathard was also a devoted brother to singer/songwriter Tucker Beathard and his two sisters Charly and Tatum Beathard. He was the son of country music songwriter Casey Beathard and mother Susan Beathard, as well as the grandson of Hall of Fame NFL executive Bobby Beathard.
Collins described how Beathard, from what he had gathered, played a special role in his family even though other members of the Beathard family may have been more publicly recognized at the time.
“He was the one that had the special smile and quality, and his brothers who were older, really looked up to him as the motivating force in their careers,” Collins said.
In a statement given to The Tennessean on Dec. 21, his family acknowledged the astounding love and support received from those who loved their son.
“We cannot possibly thank you at the rate they come in texts and phone calls. Clay was an amazing, big and softhearted human being with an undeniable love for the Lord. He had his family’s, friends’ and teammates’ backs even to a fault. I wish he would have been more inclined to take the high road but he hated ‘wrong.’”
Beathard was of strong faith, and the idea of him attending school in New York worried his parents a bit. They were concerned he wouldn’t be able to practice his religion as he did while living at home; however, he maintained his faith, and in fact, deepened his spirituality while at Post.
“Speaking to his dad, it [the move to LIU] really was a blessing; he really embraced New York,” Collins said.
Beathard was heavily involved with a Bible study group that met after the football team practiced on Sundays. He grew his own faith alongside other athletes who practiced their faith too. Pastor Todd Bishop, who according to Collins, became like an adopted pastor to the team, also joined them in prayer.
Beathard became his team’s symbol of faith which is something they will miss.
“I think that really affected his teammates. [They] saw him as a person of faith, and you know, maybe that’s why he was so special, because of his faith. So we sorrow a sense of that as well,” Collins said.
Upon returning home to Tennessee for the holidays, Beathard was fatally stabbed outside a Nashville bar in the early morning of Dec. 21. He was with hometown friends Paul Trapeni lll, 21, who also lost his life, and AJ Bethurum, 21, who survived but sustained injuries to his eye and arm. All three attended high school together.
Beathard’s memorial service was held in Nashville, Tenn. the weekend after Christmas. Coaches from the football team, Athletic Director William Martinov, Pastor Bishop and around 20 Shark athletes attended the candlelit vigil to represent the school and show support to their quarterback’s family.
During the service, a montage dedicated to Beathard was presented while the song “Free Bird” by Lynyrd Skynyrd played in the background.
“It [the song] starts by: ‘If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?’ and that’s an interesting sentence,” Collins said. “He did leave his mark here.”
After Christmas break, the athletic department, coaching staff, Pastor Bishop and The Center of Healthy Living offered their support to grieving students and athletes. The football team held meetings where players and coaches shared their thoughts.
“We spoke about Clay,” Collins said. “We were able to spend time together.”
Usually, coaches and staff within the athletic department get to spend four years with student athletes. Collins expressed sadness in not having the chance to do that with Beathard.
”I wish I would have gotten the chance to get to know him a little bit better,” he said. “It just seems like he was a very special guy, and I would have wanted to spend more time with him.”
Even though Beathard is no longer with his team, he left thoughtful lessons behind for them to hold on to, according to Collins.
Some of the players admired Beathard’s relationship with his younger sisters, and it influenced them to talk with their own siblings more often. Collins was also touched by past conversations with Beathard.
“I learned something new that I’m willing to do differently moving forward.,” he said. “He has left us with little things that are constant reminders of how we should try to live and how to be together.”
To pass along Beathard’s legacy, each year, his jersey number will be given to a player who shows similar attributes as Beathard in terms of attitude and loyalty.
“That will become a tradition for us moving forward, to kind of always leave his mark,” Collins said.

BY ASHLEY BOWDENCO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Degrees in sociology, history, philosophy and several other undergraduate and graduate programs within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences have been “frozen” as of Friday Jan. 24,according to faculty email exchanges. This means that these programs cannot accept new majoring students, but will remain registered with the state of New York so as to possibly “unfreeze” in the future, Dr. Heather Parrott, chair of the social sciences department, said.
Undergraduate degrees cut in recent years include the bachelor of science in geology, geography, and earth sciences, as well as the bachelor of arts in art history and Spanish.
The undergraduate programs currently frozen include the bachelor of arts in chemistry, history, philosophy, physics, and sociology, in addition to the bachelor of fine arts in photography and the bachelor of science in mathematics and physics, and public relations. The bachelor of music in performance is also frozen.
Graduate programs that cannot induct new students include the master of art in history, art and political science, as well as the master of fine arts in fine arts and design, and the master of science in applied mathematics.
“The reason why majors are being closed down in the arts and sciences, and graduate programs are being completely phased out is because of enrollment,” Dr. Michael Soupios, professor of political science, said.
University officials are not making efforts to reverse enrollment patterns for these programs, according to Soupios. He believes their focus on admissions, scholarship and advertisement investments for these programs was rerouted to new additions such as the vet tech program where enrollment has increased.
“One of the contributors to the growth in new enrollment has been the recent addition of successful new academic programs, including nursing, vet tech, and data analytics,” Ed Weis, vice president of academic affairs, said.
Jake Gutowitz (‘19) graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history. “The liberal arts education LIU is supposed to promote is supposed to create well-rounded, culturally aware human beings who are not only talented professionals, but who have a better understanding of their world, their place in it, and how to make it better for future generations,” he said. “There is value in every program and every class at LIU. To cut any of them is doing a disservice to its students.”
Due to declining enrollment patterns in the frozen liberal arts and science programs, some of the cuts would be reasonably justified, according to Soupios.
“Administrators say the goal is to have at least 30 incoming freshmen for each major. Programs with under 10 were cut in the most recent round of cuts and freezes,” Parrott said.
“Us losing numbers is not actually a full explanation of why they would cut our major,” Molly Tambor, associate professor of history, said. “We were told we had something like 36 students from the incoming class say that they were prospective history majors; that’s a lot.” In the fall 2019 semester, freshman enrollment increased by 29.6 percent.
Lower enrollment and cuts to faculty personnel result in smaller class sizes, which in turn can make it difficult for students to find enough courses available in their program that enable them to graduate. When less than 10 students enroll in a course, administrative staff can cancel it.
“The classroom experience is at its best when faculty engage their students in challenging and interesting peer discussions. Classes with fewer than 15-20 students do not allow for this desired level of engagement,” Weis said. “Academic programs with only a handful of majors can result in these students taking their upper level courses as independent studies.”
Erica Ferrara (‘19) graduated with a bachelor’s degree in geology. During her experience on campus, she regularly got required courses waived and filled credits with independent study courses because the classes she needed to finish her degree were not available.
“The majority of my degree was filled through electives that professors had to do with only two of us,” she said. When she enrolled as a freshman, the geology major had five to seven students. By her third year, there were two left including herself.
“It was advertised as ‘top of the line, that everything in terms of a geology degree was provided for you; there was a lot of faculty and classes,’” Ferrara said about the now nonexistent geology program. “Obviously, when I got there, there were two faculty members, and there were half the classes, and they were struggling to fill and run classes. Classes that were on the plan of study that we received were not offered.”
“My classes are actually overflowing full, but I think that’s partially because we’re not able to offer as many classes that students need. And we can’t give them that much variety, so they’re packed into the classes that we can offer,” Tambor said.
Soupios has known students in the political science program to transfer to other schools offering more courses in their desired program. “A lot of students are very angry, disillusioned. Many of these students were in my class, and they stopped in on my office to say goodbye on the way out,” he said.
Weis offered assurance to students in the affected programs that they’ll be able to complete their degrees on time. “The programs that were recently frozen had very low to zero new enrollment, but they may become viable with curriculum changes. For the students currently enrolled in these programs, the university will continue to offer the necessary courses for students to be able to graduate on time,” he said.
On the contrary, Gutowitz advised these students to follow the same plan of action as those who transferred. “If your program is being cut, leave. Any administrator who says that you’ll be able to finish is absolutely misleading you. Sure, they’ll technically allow you to stay at the university, but if no new students are joining your program and older students are graduating, it won’t be long before there aren’t enough students to run your required courses,” he said.
Some faculty members believe that the administration’s shifted focus from liberal arts and sciences to vocational programs is due to a differing perspective on the value of a broader style of education.
“I think that they’re just cutting everywhere they can, and they think that they can cut in liberal arts and sciences because they are programs that are not clearly pre-professional,” Tambor said. Students with liberal arts and sciences degrees tend to have a broader range of skills that makes them more adaptable in the workforce, according to Tambor.
In a meeting on Monday, Feb. 10, Tambor discussed the future of the history program with Weis and Randy Burd, senior vice president of academic affairs. “We are proposing adaptations and innovations that can save students, and the administration does seem open to that,” Tambor said. She hopes to show students how a history degree can lead to jobs broader than education, including business management, journalism and media fields.
Michael Garafalo (‘16) majored in history and minored in political science during his undergraduate years on campus. He was shocked to learn that programs including these were facing cuts.
“I was heartbroken and also just baffled. I really don’t understand how not just the history programs, but all of the programs that I saw… I don’t know how a college goes on without all those programs,” he said.
A common subject broached by alumni of these programs was concern for the faculty members who have shown commitment to their programs and their students. Ferrara reflected fondly of her former professors of geology, Dr. Lillian Hess-Tanguay and Dr. Victor DiVenere.
“I feel like we were not taking care of our incredible faculty, left without a space to grow academically and professionally. The faculty are really suffering as much as the students are,” Ferrara said.
An ample amount of courses for professors to teach their subjects isn’t an unreasonable expectation, according to Soupios. “The institution, it seems to me, has some obligation to see to it that there’s workload available to its faculty,” Soupios said. “You’re talking about some of the faculty in the arts and sciences. This is the senior faculty; these people have invested their entire lives here.”
Garafalo’s experience with his professors at Post was engaging, and he was saddened to know that many are not given the respect they deserve. “It just doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t seem to add up. It’s really unfortunate,” he said.
“People are still being fired here, too,” Soupios said in regard to the increasing faculty cuts that began in spring 2018. “Students come here with an expectation of receiving certain services, and there’s not enough staffing to extend the service.”
After losing three full-time, tenured history faculty members, only three remain, and the university has not allowed them to rehire, according to Tambor.
“For now, we’re doing the best we can, and we’re still teaching and advising them to the best of our abilities and launching them into the world, but I don’t know what this is going to look like at the end of the academic year,” Tambor said.
As for students currently enrolled in the affected programs, Ferrara considered her own experiences and offered advice for students facing similar complications.
“People ultimately make the best out of their degree, but it will hurt you in the end to stay,” she said. “Transferring to a better university that will accommodate and will really create a well-rounded and thorough education is better than staying for the invested credits that won’t end up meaning anything.”

An Instagram account called “@everything_broken_at_post” has grown in popularity since it was created in 2018. Followed by nearly 1,000 people, the page is filled with pictures and videos of things in need of repair or attention on campus.
The 219 posts on the page were submitted by students who send in pictures of things they encounter including leaky ceilings, broken furniture and moldy food. The account’s administrator then posts them anonymously.
Amanda Mahoney, a junior film major, said she never submitted a photo but has “definitely seen things that she could probably send in to the page.”
Some of their more popular photos include a mouse that entered a dorm room through an open ceiling, shattered windows in classrooms, and many broken classroom chairs, all of which were discovered by students.
The school’s facilities department is aware of the page, and they’ve used the account as a tool to help improve the work order system, according to Roy Fergus, executive director of facilities.
“We survail the page, and attach work orders,” Fergus said about items posted to the page that clearly need attention. “When someone says they saw this on Instagram we can ask someone to say ‘Do we have that in the system?’ and if not, why not.”
The account goes through phases of posting, and occasionally taking breaks from providing new content. As of the 2019-2020 academic year, posts appear more often, indicating its growth in popularity and that students are submitting more frequently. While earlier posts from the anonymous account owner used to average around 70 likes, they now receive over 100.
Accounts from various majors and extracurricular interests, including alumni, follow the page. Some comment in agreement with each other about disappointment in the school’s upkeep; however, there is the occasional comment defending the school in which a link to submit a work order is provided.
For example, the account “blu_eyed_baby” left a comment which read, “If only the students would stop deliberately breaking things” followed by the hashtags “#patheticployforattention” and “#growup.”
While work orders are an available solution to all students on campus, many of the problems go straight to Instagram before being reported to the facilities department, according to Fergus. Some students may skip over the work order process because they’re only drawn to the page for its comedic appeal rather than its ability to help them get items repaired more quickly.
With the exception of a few, a number of students take the page seriously, and the cost to attend the school is brought up often in the page’s commentary.
“The overall quality of LIU as a whole isn’t worth the steep price tag,” Jordan Goldsher, a senior business administration major, said.
Mahoney had a similar thought to Goldsher in reaction to the posts, but geared her frustration more toward the school’s administration.
“The page is a big slap in our faces, knowing that all that bad stuff is going on and no one is really doing anything about it,” she said.
The account presents the condition of campus dorms and classrooms as what some may deem as unlivable and dangerous. Students like Mahoney want to take pride in their university.
“I would like for LIU to take some extra steps in finding better ways to make sure these issues get reported to the school and acted on immediately instead of just posted to some social media page,” Mahoney said.
But some students forget to consider that the facilities crew works diligently to maintain campus conditions. Joseph Aberasturi, a senior computer science major, took note of this.
“It is a shame to see all of the mishaps around the school, but I don’t think it should signify that the school doesn’t do a good job to maintain the campus. I always see the [staff] working hard around here,” he said.
Fergus’ outlook on the page wasn’t negative, as he views it as an alternative form of communication from the students. “If something is a real issue of safety or otherwise, it means we need to adjust, or correct our approach to it,” he said.

BY ANISHA JINTOORKAR & SHANNON MILLERSTAFF WRITER, CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
Students and faculty had mixed reactions when the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Feb. 5, clearing him of two impeachment charges set forth by the House of Representatives.
Impeachment hearings began after a whistleblower complaint was made public on Sept. 26, 2019, about a phone call the president made on July 25 to the newly elected Ukrainian leader, President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The questionable interaction led to a House inquiry the following month, eventually leading to President Trump’s impeachment on Dec. 18, 2019, for abuse of power and obstructing Congress’ efforts to investigate him. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi then passed the articles of impeachment over to the Senate.
Joe Campisi, a sophomore biology major, said the whole impeachment process was a waste of time. “Nancy Pelosi knew it would backfire on the Democratic Party which is why she kept delaying moving forward until there was an actual reason to impeach,” he said.
Campisi figured Pelosi caved due to “excessive bullying” by House Democrats who simply didn’t like the president and wanted him removed from office.
Upon reaching the Senate, the majority of Republicans set historical precedence when they voted against the inclusion of documents and witnesses in the trial. Shortly thereafter, in a 52 to 48 vote, Senate Republicans, with the exception of Mitt Romney, voted to acquit the president on abuse of power.
“The U.S. Senate has failed the American people,” Michael Soupios, a professor of political science, said. “Kudos to Mitt Romney, and to him alone.”
As for obstruction of Congress, the vote was straight down party lines, 53 to 47, to acquit the president of any wrongdoing.
“They have allowed political self-interest to triumph over constitutional obligation,” Soupios said. “This is a consequence of public servants who now function as professional politicians and do so under the aegis of a malignant partisanship. I fear for the republic.”
During the House impeachment hearings, 12 government witnesses privately and publicly testified that the Trump administration’s withholding of Ukranian military aid was part of a quid pro quo. The president was hoping Zelensky would agree to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains a potential threat to Trump’s 2020 reelection, and his son Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company previously investigated for corruption.
“This might’ve been the final straw to secure Trump’s reelection for a second term, as this shows just how immature the Democratic Party is and how they act as sore losers,” Campisi said.
According to an online survey conducted by The Pioneer, 80 percent of students polled thought the Senate should have included documents and witnesses in order to fairly acquit the president. Others around campus thought the outcome wouldn’t have changed either way.
“I think it was inevitable,” Heather Felix, a senior public relations major, said. “No matter which side you’re on, it was pretty clear from the beginning that he could never go through a full impeachment process much less beremoved from office…. And Mike Pence? No thank you.”
Throughout the impeachment process, Trump denied any existence of a quid pro quo; however, his administration released Ukraine’s military aid two days after the House announced it was opening an investigation into the president’s motives. And in January, the Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan watchdog, concluded that the White House broke federal law by withholding Congress-approved military aid.
But with a Republican controlled Senate, some students knew the president’s acquittal was inevitable.

The Promise office added four new success coaches to its roster this semester to help students with academic planning and lighten the workload of other coaches.
Each student is assigned a promise coach once they’re accepted to the school. A coach assists students with scheduling, campus life and financial issues. Their office is located on the third floor of Hillwood Commons.
Shawn Washart, a senior promise director, worked in residential life at John Hopkins in Baltimore before working in Promise. He’s excited to work in an office that puts students needs all together in one office.
“The promise model creates a place that allows students to really connect with their coach and understand how to make the best use of their time at LIU, both academically and through campus involvements and connections,” Washart said.
Since joining the team, Washart has enjoyed getting to know the promise staff, and looks forward to meeting more students.
“I’m excited to help build on campus traditions, clubs and organizations, Greek life and overall student engagement,” he said.
One of the four new promise coaches, Anthony White, completed his masters degree at Syracuse University, and went on to work as a success coach at On Point for College, a non-profit organization that helps non-traditional students along their road to success.
At On Point, White worked with students to instill within them the mindset that higher education is important, and that despite their barriers, strive to be the best students they can be.
White said he fell in love with advising students while working at the non-profit, which is why he wanted to take his career further, and he looks forward to making a difference.
“I want students to not see meetings as a burden, but have intrinsic motivation to come to my office,” White said. He also looks forward to being a person that students can come to about any situation, from career choices to student involvement.
Another recruit to the Promise staff, Tracy Reardon, was employed at CollClubSports, a college sports organization which houses five club sports leagues, before coming to Post.
“I believe that LIU has something extremely unique about it in terms of the Promise Office and their customer service centered structure of handling the student body’s wants and needs,” she said.
Since she joined Promise, Reardon noticed how eager her colleagues were to help each other out.
“I feel as though everyone here at Promise is super supportive of one another, and having that kind of assistance and support starting out at a brand new job, doing something completely different than what I was doing previously, has been amazing,” Reardon said.
Breanna Washington, who received her bachelor’s degree in special and childhood education from SUNY Cortland, also joined the Promise team.
“LIU resonated with me,” Washington said. “I like the promise office, as it is a one stop shop for classes, what’s happening around campus, and anything upcoming in the semester.”
Washington also filled a few other positions on campus. She’s the residence director of King’s Hall and liaison for the Black Student Union.
“Working with resident advisors has been a good time; watching them grow and develop throughout the semester is something I look forward to,” she said.
And since Washington is originally from Long Island, she said she’s “happy to be home.”
Kimmy Glasser, nursing major and student worker at the Promise office, described the new coaches as “nice and cordial,” and said that “although they just started working in the office, their presence has not gone unnoticed.”

The men’s lacrosse team’s freshman attacker Sean Boll made a name for himself in his collegiate debut against Siena College on Saturday, Feb. 8.
Despite the team’s loss, Boll put five goals in the back of the net out of eight shots, leaving him with a shooting percentage of 63 percent. “It was a good feeling contributing to the team’s effort. It was a lot of fun,” Boll said after his debut.
Boll came to campus from Seaford, N.Y., and was no stranger to Post prior to his freshman year. His older sister, Alyssa Boll, is a member of the women’s lacrosse team and is currently playing in her junior season.
Boll decided to come play for the Sharks because of “the campus life, the coaching staff, and the way the game was played here.”
Boll began playing lacrosse at seven years old for his town’s team. Growing up, lacrosse wasn’t the only sport Boll excelled in. In high school, he received varsity letters for football and basketball. However, lacrosse was the sport that he was particularly exceptional in and the sport he wanted to continue to play through college. “I chose to play lacrosse because of the style the game is played [in] and the fast pace it’s played at, he said.”
Boll received all-league recognition as a lacrosse player in high school where he played at Kellenburg Memorial High school, a private school in Uniondale, N.Y.
So far, Boll said playing Division I lacrosse as a Shark feels like the right decision.
“My favorite part is being with the team every day and competing at the highest level,” he said.
Next up for Boll and the rest of the men’s lacrosse team is a battle against St. John’s University on Saturday, Feb. 22 at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium at 1 p.m.

The women’s ice hockey team had a solid season, ending with a 10-8 record, and thereby placing themselves as a top seed team in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance, (NEWHA) where their first playoff game will be played at home.
The women’s ice hockey team has played their season quietly. Because their home games have been played in two separate rinks – neither of which are on campus – the team averages around 100 spectators per game, which hinders the awareness of the hockey team among students on campus. However, this has not stopped them as they prepare for playoffs.
The first round of the NEWHA playoffs will be held at the higher seed’s home rink, so the #4 Sharks will be hosting the #5 St. Michael’s College Purple Knights. The Purple Knights come in with four wins, 15 losses and one overtime loss in conference play this season. In previous battles this season the Sharks won three of four games against the Purple Knights, outscoring them 15-9.
Leading the way for the Sharks this season has been the top line consisting of Carrigan Umpherville, Alva Johnsson and team captain Matilda af Bjur, who collectively have generated 62 of the Sharks’ 206 points. Umpherville leads the team in goals scored, with 15 goals. Af Bjur is tied for the team lead in assists with 12 assists together with teammate Megan Bouver. Af Bjur also leads the Sharks statistics in shots on goal (84) and power play points (4).
Behind the bench for the Sharks is Head Coach Rob Morgan. Prior to coming to LIU, Morgan coached five seasons at St. Norbert’s in NCAA Division III. During his five seasons, he earned a 78-49-12 record andwas named NCAA Division III West Region Coach of the Year in the 2012-2013 season. After that, he spent two years as associate head coach of the women’s ice hockey team at Yale University, before spending 2018 in China helping to create a program to develop women’s hockey.
The Sharks first ever playoff game is being played on Wednesday, Feb. 19 at 1 p.m inside Iceworks in Syosset.

The men’s lacrosse team had a turbulent day against Wagner College on Saturday, Feb. 15. Despite a comeback in the fourth quarter, the Sharks lost the non-conference game with a score of 9-8 in overtime.
The Sharks had a rough start to the game and went into halftime with a 1-4 deficit. However, the team managed to turn the game around in the second half, scoring seven goals including a 4-0 run during the final period. The team then took their first lead of the game, making the score 8-7.
Despite having momentum, Wagner forced a turnover and took advantage when attacker Stephen Dwyer found the back of the net with 20 seconds remaining. The Seahawks won the faceoff and appeared to have won the game at the final buzzer, but the goal was disallowed due to a crease violation which shocked members of the crowd in Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. The game was sent to sudden death overtime.
In overtime, Wagner won the opening faceoff and the Seahawks took a timeout after pushing the ball into the attacking zone. Once out of the timeout, Dwyer went behind the goal-line and split two defenders before he scored the game winning goal 43 seconds into overtime, giving Wagner College their first win of the season.
The Sharks had several contributors from the freshman players, such as attacker Richie Lacalandra who scored his first career goal and added a highlight-reel diving go-ahead goal. After the game, Lacalandra said he enjoyed playing at home even though the result didn’t end up the way they wanted. “That feeling playing our first game at home was awesome and it was a great game even though we lost in overtime,” he said. “If we played our hearts out the whole game it may have gone the other way.”
Looking at other Shark players performances, four Sharks, including Lacalandra scored twice during the game. Graduate student midfi elder Alex Russell, senior midfielder Dylan Villari, and sophomore attacker Jake Gillis all found the back of the net two times around. Junior defense Ryan Blume caused four turnovers and recorded a team-best five ground balls, and freshman goalkeeper Will Mark made 12 saves while stopping 57 percent of shots on goal.
The Sharks will return to action on Saturday, Feb. 22 when they host St. John’s University at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium at 1 p.m.

The Black Student Union, Bottom Line Magazine and the Writing Center are hosting the campus’ first annual African American Read-In on Tuesday, Feb. 25. The event takes place in two parts from 12:30-2 p.m. and 6-8:30 p.m. in the Krasnoff Theater. Admission will be free for both parts of the event.
The first part of the event is a read-in where students and staff are invited to read works from their favorite African American authors. Readings can be from traditional literature such as novels, essays and poems, but can also come from modern platforms such as blog posts and tweets. Performances and singing are also permitted.
Cameron Sykes, better known as False Prophet, will host the read-in, and the event will feature accomplished actor and writer David Mills who will perform original poetry. Mills and Sykes will also host a conversation about writing poetry.
The second part of the event will be a Poetry Slam and a Q&A session with Phoenixx Love, the author of “If I Should Die Before I Wake: Your Journey to Awakening Your Calling,” a self help book designed to be a “roadmap to discovering your true self,” according to the book’s description.
Choreographer and dancer Oya Bangura will also perform African dances during the second event. Bangura has performed around the world and is a Post alumna.
The read-in is a public event. Nilda Nelson, Public Safety administrator and Black Student Union advisor, encourages students to bring family members so they can enjoy the event together. “They can see the campus [and] get to know your friends,” she said. “It’s a family event.”
The Bottom Line Magazine will publish a special issue to coincide with the event entitled “The Black Voices Issue” that will be entirely composed of work created by African American students on campus.
The National African American Read-In was originally established in 1990 by the Black Caucus of the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE). The read-in is “the nation’s first and oldest event dedicated to diversity in literature,” and was created to “make literacy a significant part of Black History Month,” according to the NCTE’s website.
The idea to bring the event to campus was a collaborative one coming from Nelson, Jeong-eun Rhee, a professor of education, and Mary Pigliacelli, the director of the writing center.
Students interested in reading or performing at the event should contact Mary Pigliacelli at Mary.Pigliacelli@liu.edu to register in advance.

Members of the Kappa Kappa Gamma (KKG) sorority held a powderpuff touch football game on Friday, Feb. 13, to benefit their national and local philanthropy, Reading Is Fundamental, an organization dedicated furthering the education of children by providing books and access to literacy needs.
     
Four teams competed against each other for a $100 cash prize. A $60 entry was required in order to compete. General admission to the event was $3.
The games ran in ten minute intervals. The teams competed in a round robin style, where each team had a chance to play each other, and no team was removed from the competition. The players took breaks between each game to socialize and refuel. The team with the most wins claimed victory for the entire event.
During breaks, participants played volleyball and soccer, ate, mingled with the crowd, and danced to music. “I’m glad that they’re hosting this because it really just brings together all the Greek members, no matter what letters they wear.” Vikas Dalal, a sophomore finance major and member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, said. “At the end of the day we all just come together for a great time.”
A team made up of members from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity took home the grand prize. “It’s been really fun to be a part of something where we’re bringing together the whole college community,” said Dalal.

Members of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority hosted their first philanthropic event of the semester, the “No Talent Show,” on Tuesday, Feb. 11 in the Gold Coast Cinema.

The No Talent Show featured students from campus showing off things they’re not talented at in hopes of winning a $100 cash prize. It cost $5 to sign up and there were raffles throughout the night. All proceeds went to Reading is Fundamental, an organization dedicated to “inspiring a passion for reading among all children,” according to their website.
Students signed up to participate at the Fishbowl or by messaging the Kappa Kappa Gamma Instagram. “It was open to the public, but most of the performers were from fraternities on campus,” Sarah Scott, a freshman nursing major who attended the event, said.
The event featured students showing off a variety of talents such as throwing grapes at each other in an attempt to catch them in their mouths, bowling and trying to fold a t-shirt using only their teeth, but there was only one winner.
The crowd voted on the best act through an online poll on Instagram. James Lange, a sophomore finance major, took home the $100 cash prize. “My talent was a magic show,” he said.“I was trying to think of something I could do poorly, but something I could realistically do while being funny. I performed a bunch ofpurposefully bad magic tricks.”
Lange performed a variety of tricks from the classic rubber pen to pulling a tablecloth with cups on it, causing all of them to fall over. “I did a card trick and I brought this girl on stage and asked her to pull a card from the deck,” he said. “I shuffled the deck kinda knowing I was going to get the wrong card. Then I randomly got her correct card. It was crazy, everyone started cheering and I was shook.”
Kappa Kappa Gamma will continue to host events throughout the semester. Students can look for their upcoming events and learn more about Reading is Fundamental by going to their instagram, @kappaliu.

Documentaries about serial killers have been growing in popularity amongst students, and Netflix’s “Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,” is no exception. The documentary premiered on Jan. 15, and describes the life of late Aaron Hernandez, football player and convicted murderer.
Hernandez played as a tight end for the New England Patriots in the NFL, but his career came to an immediate end in 2013 after his arrest and sentence for the murder of Odin Lloyd. Lloyd was a semi-professional football player who was in a relationship with Hernandez’s fiancée’s sister. Hernandez hung himself in his prison cell at age 27, days after he was acquitted of a separate double homicide. He left behind his widow Shayanna Jenkins, and their daughter, Avielle Janelle Hernandez.
The three-part documentary on Hernandez’s story can be seen on Netflix and it explores his conviction for the murder of Lloyd, other murder cases he was suspected in, and the factors in his life that may have generated his violent behavior.
Ryan Miller, alum of 2019, was a fan of Hernandez during his NFL career. “I remember all of this happening to Aaron Hernandez as I was a fan of his. I know that this news was shocking to everyone. He seemed like the ‘perfect’ guy. I don’t think that this story is something that will ever be forgotten. It was too traumatic,” he said. “It’s a shame that his family and loved ones will have these sad last memories of Aaron.”
“I always loved watching him play. He was kind of like a role-model of mine,” Michael Ciardiello, a sophomore business major, said. “This news was shocking, and I personally believe that he was a murderer with mental illness and it’s just so sad for his family. It’s sad that his daughter will only have this memory of him.”
This was a great documentary for anyone interested in this specific case, or any murder-mystery. Both Miller and Ciardiello enjoyed watching the full documentary. It contains personal reflections from Henandez’ family members and associates. Hernandez’s downfall from football star to convicted murderer is one of the most notorious cases to emerge from not just the NFL, but the entire sports world, and this Netflix documentary captures it all.

Students can anticipate a rare occurrence from the Post Theatre Company. “The World Goes Round” is a musical revue wherein musical theatre students will perform songs by composer John Kander, and lyricist Fred Ebb.
“The show is a musical revue of Kander and Ebb music which premiered in the 90s, featuring numbers from ‘Chicago,’ ‘Kiss of The Spider Woman,’ and ‘Cabaret,’ to name a few,” Mary Harrel, a sophomore musical theatre major, said.
This show is filled with comedy, drama and romance, according to the cast members. Though the show lacks a plot due to its revue style, all dialogue occurs in song, and five actors perform numerous parts. As a result, the tunes transition smoothly into each other, but are not codependent, allowing the audience to appreciate each number as a stand-alone, according to the original choreographer, Susan Stoman.
With minimal set pieces, backdrops, and costumes, the true color and life added to the show is from the exuberant interpretation of the characters in the cast, according to Harrel.As each number comes and goes, a picture of modern life is painted.
The creative team took things as they went along during the rehearsal process. Anna Betteridge (‘16) is an alum of the theatre company, and is excited to be the choreographer for the show.
“I’ve been collaborating with Paul Johnson, director, and had the pleasure of having current junior Danny Walsh as a choreo assistant,” Betteridge said. “We have a variation of styles and tastes, but we’ve been able to mash those styles up and incorporate lots of different components to the piece.”
“Working with my peers and fellow classmates has been such a joy.” Walsh said. “Getting to watch my friends in action, applying their training, and committing so beautifully to the world of this show has been an unforgettable experience.”
“We’ve been having a lot of fun, but I also have had this great opportunity where I get to play with dance and movement as I learned it here at Post, this atypical physical process has really meshed well with the music in the show, and I’m really excited for an audience to see this unique collaboration.” Betteridge said.
Though this is PTC’s second production of the spring 2020 season, it is also the first time the company will stage a performance in the Krasnoff Theatre under its new name. Performances will take place from Friday Feb. 21 to Sunday, Feb. 23 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are available online at tix55.com/ptc700. Tickets are $15 for general admission, $10 for seniors, and $10 for students with a valid university ID.

The sculpture gallery hosted the art of Lucia Terry, a senior art therapy major, at a reception on Wednesday, Feb.12. The walls were decorated in colorful works of art by the artist as part of an exhibition called “State of Mind.”
The exhibit showcased paintings and pottery of different mediums, and colors that depicted Terry’s emotions. “My inspiration is my internal emotional state, all of these pieces are things I’ve done to express something that I was going through at a certain time in my life,” she said.
Instead of having bias towards a particular piece, Terry said the entire exhibition could be considered her favorite. “For me it’s the whole thing put together. I’m so proud of seeing all of my stuff together, it’s a really good feeling,” she said.
However, visitors of the exhibition had different answers as to what their favorite pieces were. Alum Matthew Anthony (‘19) who majored in the fine arts program, attended the event to support his friend in her first showcase. His favorite piece was Terry’s work entitled “Inner Light,” a painting depicting a woman with colorful, swirling hair who appears to be holding light in her hands.
Anthony praised Terry’s work. “I always knew she did big projects, but this is nuts,” he said.
Other observers wandered the room gazing at the canvases in front of them. Another friend of Terry’s, Stephanie Hilaire, made a special trip to see the artist and her work.
“It’s beautiful work, she put a lot of hard work into it and it shows,” Hilaire said.
As someone who is a friend to Terry, Hilaire mentioned that she recognized progress in some of the pieces, “So it’s great to see the final works and to see all of it put together,” Hilaire said.
Though the works in the exhibition seemed fun and vibrant to some observers, Terry explained that showcasing her collection was a lot of work, with some of the pieces being around 5 years old.
Despite having worked with this collection for so long, this was Terry’s first time showing “State of Mind” to the public.
“It’s exciting, because it feels like people really get to see me and what I’ve been pulling my hair out and sweating over all my life,” she said.
Although it was her first public appearance, Terry has been an artist since a young age.
“Ever since I was a little kid, I was obsessed with art. I would try to draw lines for hours and get really upset if it didn’t work out. But it was something that interested me and kept grabbing me and bringing me back,” Terry said.
Students interested in viewing more of Terry’s work can follow her Instagram @lucia.terry.
“There is always something new to get interested in. For me, it’s about a new experience,” she said.
