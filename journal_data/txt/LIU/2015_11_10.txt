People might think that Greek life is all about the parties, cliques, and frat houses, because movies portray them that way. However, this isn’t the movies, this is LIU Post. At this university, there are no fraternity houses or cliques, but Greek life is a “community of students who are initiated into one of our recognized fraternities or sororities,” said Katherine Wieme, Director of Greek Life & Student Involvement, a position in Campus Life.
Wieme explained that it offers students opportunities to bond, strengthen leadership qualities, and network with alumni. There are 11 fraternities and sororities on campus: Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Chi Nu Alpha.
“We currently have over 250 students in fraternities and sororities,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. “We are proud to now be home to some of the largest national organizations in the world and are excited to add Sigma Delta Tau to our community in the spring
[2016].”These organizations are not all the same; they have different recruitment processes, structures, and types of councils. The three types of councils are the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, or the Multicultural Council. Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi Epsilon, and Delta Zeta are Panhellenic sororities. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are fraternities a part of the Interfraternity Council. Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Tau, and Chi Nu Alpha, are the fraternities and sororities that belong to the Multicultural Council.
“Being in a cultural organization differs from other organizations because we’re very passionate about our organization’s history and the meaning behind the letters; we take pride in the roots of where we come from,” said Richard Batista, President of Phi Iota Alpha, and a senior adolescence education major in mathematics. Batista also explains that one thing you learn is that you should “never forget who you are and where you come from.”
Each fraternity and sorority has a philanthropy that they partner with. “In DZ [Delta Zeta], we raise money and awareness for our philanthropy Speech and Hearing, to try to make a difference in other people’s lives,” said Nicole Cunningham, President of DZ and graduate literacy education major. Their philanthropy focuses on those that are affected by speech and hearing challenges.
“Engaging in community service projects and raising funds and awareness for various philanthropic organizations are fundamental components of being an active member of a Greek organization,” said Alexa Regina, President of Alpha Phi Epsilon, and a senior social work major. She mentions that AEPHI “values service, which has allowed me to give back to the community with the help of my
sisters.”It can be hard to find your place in college. Now that doesn’t mean your clique or “it” group, but a group of people that help you find yourself and enjoy your college and life experience. Greek life can help “students to find their home in a fraternity or sorority,” Wieme said.
“Joining Greek life is so important because when you join your org, you are also joining a community,” said Giovanna Domingo, Financial VP of Alpha Xi Delta, and sophomore accounting major. “Over the last year I have seen such a positive change in Greek life. Even if you don’t know a person and you’re wearing letters, you always have something to talk about because there is that common thread.” She explained that more people have joined, which has shown such a positive growth.
These organizations have made an impact on many students and the campus itself. “Joining Greek life has without a doubt been one of the best decisions I’ve made in college. It’s gotten me way more involved than I ever was before on campus and it’s equipped me with invaluable leadership opportunities,” said Jawaan Smith, VP of Phi Sigma Kappa, a senior arts management major. “Also, knowing you have 20 plus guys who always have your back and are there for you through your highs and lows is a great feeling. It’s definitely a rewarding experience.”
“We are proud that our Greek Life students are also active in student organizations, residence halls, athletic teams, and student run businesses,” Wieme said.
“Being in Greek life means being involved, but still the most important job is for you to be a student. The hardest part about Greek Life is time management,” according to Michael Aquilano, Programing Director of Phi Sigma Kappa and sophomore psychology major.
“When you join Greek Life, you become a part of something that is very active and you need to learn or already have time management skills. Especially if you want to hold and E-board or chair position,” he said.
Wieme explained that the Office of Campus Life serves as the primary advisor to Greek life, including all the governing councils, organizations, and individual members and that they support the growth of these organizations. Campus Life “maintains a Greek life expansion policy for any organization who is interested in becoming recognized on campus,” she said.
“All of our organizations are national with chapters across the country,” Wieme said. “Post students who join a fraternity or sorority will have the opportunity to attend conventions, network with alumni, and meet fellow members from other institutions.”
Berthel added that Campus Life, and the university fully support the fraternities and sororities. “Providing opportunities for students to take part in Greek life is very important to us and we will continue to look
for ways to grow and strengthen our current organizations and add new organizations,” he said. If you think Greek life is for you: go out and meet the different organizations during Greek week or Greek events, which are held every semester and maybe you’ll find your new home.

Before we begin; I’d love for you to check out these statistics, courtesy of the fine folks at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (last modified Apr. 2):

According to the chart above, if you were a part of the workforce in 2014 employed or unemployed, (note that if you were unemployed for three weeks during that time you are considered a discouraged worker) and had a doctoral degree, your field only experienced a mere 2.1 percent unemployment rate, [while receiving $1,600 a week].
Now, let’s look at the members of the workforce who have a bachelor’s degree: According to 2014 American Census data, roughly 66.9 million Americans who are 25 and over currently have a bachelor’s degree: taking home about $1,100 weekly, and an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent. Not bad.
Ah-ha!
While looking at 2014 American Census data, I decided to break out the calculator, and discovered a startling statistic. In a country with 209.3 million Americans above the age of 25, only 66.9 million Americans have obtained a bachelor’s degree and/or master’s/doctorate. That means 142.4 million people in America, age 25 or older, don’t have a college degree.
Oh yeah, and about the graph, that demographic doesn’t even scrape out $700 dollars income a week (about $672 a week), and have an unemployment rate of about higher than 6 percent.
I mainly write opinion pieces. Why? Well, because I’m an opinionated person. I wasn’t really sold on the institution we’ve come to know as ‘college’ before I wrote this article, but when I really thought about it, and look at the numbers, there are really no opinions to be had. You need a college degree, plain and simple.
Also, I have heard the Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Lady Gaga redirect. “Oh he dropped out just after two years!”
“See, you don’t need college!”
In response to these opinions, I would say, “I’ll talk to you after class, let me know when you develop a blueprint for the next generation of technology that cultivates and changes a society, or when you realize that the voice you use to sing in the shower can also sell out Madison Square Garden.”
I know; you know; we know that college can be insanely expensive. However, college opens so many doors for us; doors that we really wouldn’t know about if it weren’t for college. Internships, opportunities to study abroad, and even networking with professors are part
of the opportunities given while attending college. Also, of course, Greek Life, something most people can only accomplish by going to college, and getting that diploma.
All in all, in my opinion, yes, college degrees are necessary. Without one, you’re literally selling yourself short.

For some college students, knowing what their future will hold is an intriguing thought, while others think that the charm of life is that it’s unknown. There is a whole industry devoted to reading into your future, and that industry makes billions of dollars annually. According to IBIS- World’s Psychic Services market research report (Oct. 2015), the industry’s approximate revenue is two billion dollars.
The accuracy of psychics varies immensely, but sometimes they do get it right. Who knows whether this is by luck or chance? I would like to think that there is a psychic out there who knows everything, to whom I could go and find out if I will be successful, reach my goals, and live long enough to witness the end of corn syrup. But then again, isn’t life great in the sense that it’s organic and unknown? With everything else, we can turn to facts to find answers, but when it comes to our future, it’s a combination of what we choose and what happens around us that we cannot change.
The services within the psychic industry include many different things, such as fortune telling, tarot card reading, astrology readings, aura reading, mediumship, and palmistry. According to a study done by the Pew Research Center in 2009, approximately 15 percent of Americans have visited a psychic or fortune-teller. The study also shows no change over the past 20 years of the number of Americans who consulted a fortuneteller or psychic.
Junior accounting major, Julia Raie, went to a psychic in a mall not too long ago, but said that her experience wasn’t what she’d hoped for. “Nothing she said was helpful, or applied to me,” Raie said. It was as if she was pulling information out of thin air.” Raie chose to visit a psychic “If someone could tell me my future with 100 percent accuracy, I would try it again,” she said. “I would like to know if I’d be okay financially, and if I would have a healthy and extended family.”
Christopher Silva, a senior political science major, agreed. “If there was a psychic that could tell my future with one hundred percent accuracy, then I wouldn’t mind knowing my future,” Silva said.
For senior English major, Melissa Nosel, she believes that some psychics are real. “I think some people are capable of feeling the other side,” Nosel said. “I visited a psychic a long time ago, but I didn’t get the sense that she was real. I would go again only if I knew that I went to someone credible.”
Erin Chenicek, a senior English major, said she doesn’t believe in psychics or fortune-telling, “I believe in intuition and other senses that not all of us possess, but not psychics,” Chenicek said.
Sometimes ignorance is bliss, and sometimes the unknown can drive us crazy. But going to a psychic, whether convincing or not, does seem like an attempt to find a shortcut into our future, instead of patiently waiting for what’s to come.

Midterms are in full flow, finals are approaching fast, and it is time to really think about the best way to prepare for these annoying and difficult tests that our lovely professors give us. Every person studies differently when it comes to reciting what you’ve learned over the past few months. What is yours? Do you like to study in the library? Do you like to study while listening to music? Or maybe you like to study when other people are around? Have a think of what gives you the best opportunity to ace these exams.
If you don’t really have a clue what your most effective studying technique is, then you should be a little worried. However, it isn’t the end of the world! There are a lot of approaches you can try; the most common places people get a lot of work done, and a place in which I am sure and hope you’ve been to, is the library. It is very quiet, most of the time. The tranquility provides a fantastic working environment…it’s where it seems like most people go to do their studies, so it really sets the scene for academics (unless you just go there to people-watch, like myself).
However, because of the library’s popularity with students, there can be a lot of people moving and talking, which means there could potentially be distractions that may take you out of the ‘work zone.’ On the other hand, there are many rooms that can cancel these commotions out of your psyche. For example, there are many rooms downstairs that not many people go to, and there are also quiet rooms in the back where all the books are. Have a look!
Studying at home is always difficult for some people. A few of my friends say that there are way too many temptations, which they would give in to if they were at home. Things such as “Narcos” on Netflix, or anything that is just much more exciting than schoolwork, which, for many of us, is most things, to be perfectly honest!
From my experiences, I can really sympathize with what they are talking about. Although I am probably the biggest hypocrite when it comes to concentrating at home, due to the enticement that “Vampire Dairies” provides, there may be a few things that could help you guys concentrate in your ‘groovy’ place of stay.
For example, tea helps me focus on the many vast academic tasks I have to complete. However, with drinks that have a high content of caffeine, you have to be careful and drink them in moderation.
Although this next part is easier said than done, we have to try and remove all distractions: put your mobile on silent; make sure you don’t have Facebook open on a different tab. We have all been there, when someone texts you and you are in mid thought of a particular stats equation, and you just can’t help but have a peek at who texted, then that peak becomes a reply, and then it becomes a full flowing conversation.
One of the most important things for all of us is to get plenty of sleep! Try to get at least eight hours, which is the standard amount of time to. Although many people can stay up late and wake up early and still function pretty well, I think the majority of us would agree that if we were up preoccupied with shenanigans until the early hours of the morning and then turned up to our quantum statistics midterm, it wouldn’t be the best kind of preparation.
Getting a sleeping routine is extremely important. It will allow your body to get used to what you need to do at certain times of the day. When it comes to revising the theory of relativity at 12:20, you will be able to kick-start that mind for the great task ahead. Make sure it’s not sleep that prevents you from reaching your potential in your classes, because it would be so frustrating. Save your sleepless nights for the weekends!
We need to find the best work environment that works for us, whether it is the library, or the comforts of home. Fingers crossed, once you find this place where you concentrate and work your best, you will start improving your grades.

In the first season of “Ash vs. Evil Dead,” Bruce Campbell returns as one-handed, shotgun loving Ash Williams. This is the newest chapter in the “Evil Dead” universe, taking place 20 plus years after the Medieval themed “Army of Darkness.”
Originally envisioned to be the fourth “Evil Dead” movie, creator Sam Raimi decided that “Ash vs. Evil Dead” would work better as a television show instead since extensive material was written and multiple ideas were developed. The “Evil Dead” movies revolve around an ancient book called the “Necronomicon Ex-Mortis or the Book of the Dead,” which can summon demons called Deadites.
The first two movies took place around a remote cabin in the woods where Ash and his friend are terrorized, while the third movie, which will not be addressed in the show due to a studio licensing issue, transported Ash to Medieval times as he attempted to find his way home.
The pilot episode of “Ash vs. Evil Dead” revolves around an older Ash, who traded in his chainsaw hand for wood, works a boring job at ValueStop and lives in a trailer park. After a long night at the bar, Ash drunkenly reads from the ancient book to impress a woman and summons the Deadites once again. This event causes havoc across town, as two Michigan State Troopers investigate a homicide and instead come face to face with the Deadites. Jill Marie Jones, who plays trooper Amanda Fisher, barely survived the attack while her partner was killed. She now has to clear her name since no evidence of the incident was found, while looking for Ash, who she holds responsible.
While working at ValueStop, Ash gets into a fight with a possessed doll and is saved at the last minute by his co-worker Pablo, played by Ray Santiago. Ash then tells Pablo about his past encounters with the Deadites. While Ash is reluctant to get back into the fray, Pablo is convinced that Ash is the leader prophesized to him by his uncle, a shaman. Ash then plans to leave town, knowing that the return of the Deadites is his fault and fears the repercussions. However, Pablo and fellow co-worker Kelly, played by Dana DeLorenzo, discover Ash at his trailer before he leaves. The three then have to fight a neighbor-turned-Deadite, and Ash is once again forced to pick up his chainsaw hand and fight evil.
The four main characters all do a fine job, with Bruce Campbell leading the charge. He easily steps back into the shoes of Ash without missing a beat and adds more vulnerability and personality to the char- acter not seen in the previous movies. Lucy Lawless plays the fifth main character in “Ash vs. Evil Dead.” Her character, Ruby, has a small interaction in the pilot with Amanda Fisher and seems to believe her story while holding a few secrets of her own.
The make-up effects are another mainstay of the “Evil Dead” franchise, which includes “The Evil Dead,” “Evil Dead II,” “Army of Darkness,” the reboot film “Evil Dead,” and now “Ash vs. Evil Dead.” The first two movies had plenty of blood and gore, which Raimi and his team created on set; this mostly applied to the pilot, which aired on Oct. 31, with some computer-generated images thrown in. This episode contains plenty of blood and violence, so viewers who are not fans of excessive gore and bodily violence might not enjoy the show. Viewers who enjoy horror comedies, horror movies, or the “Evil Dead” franchise should tune in.
New episodes of “Ash vs. Evil Dead” air on Saturday nights at 9 p.m. on Starz, a premium cable network similar to HBO and Showtime.

There’s something luxurious about being able to watch every episode of a TV show all at once. No restraints, you can watch it all in one sitting if you want to. And the popularity of binge-watching shows has become a marketing model: Netflix has taken to releasing shows like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” in seasonal blocks.
While I do appreciate this model for its convenience, I do have a special place in my heart for old-fashioned serialized television. To me, it’s like opening an advent calendar day by day, rather than caving and eating all of the chocolates at once. Every day or week there is something to look forward
to, and so it is more rewarding.
Let’s speak in hypotheticals here. You order a pizza. You’re pretty hungry, so you scarf down two, three, four, eight slices. As you sit on the couch, stuffed to oblivion, you can barely think about pizza let alone any type of food without feeling queasy. I think the same stands for television. There have been times where I’ve absolutely stuffed my head with “Family Guy,” “The Office,” “Hell on Wheels”… and then found myself sick of them.
My shows right now are: “The Walking Dead,” “The Knick,” “South Park,” “Last Man on Earth” and “Fargo.” Yes, a lot. Being a reader of the “Walking Dead” comics, I have perhaps a special appreciation for the process of waiting. In that interim week (or month for comics) before the next episode or issue, the anticipation builds.
The audience is allowed time to theorize, to make predictions and discuss the characters in a way that I believe befits the storytelling process as a whole. Some may think they’ve waited so long for this new season, waiting for each episode is just another inconvenience. And that argument is valid, but one can also consider the amount of effort and time that goes into creating a television show. Why compress months of hard work into one week of binge watching?
Take “Game of Thrones,” for example. The fantasy show on HBO features masterfully crafted set design, lighting and award-winning acting, which all takes a great amount of energy and time to perfect. This is a show that has so many twists and turns (cough, cough Red Wedding) that benefit from being released weekly. Fans can discuss the latest character deaths, analyze dialogue and symbolism– all very much like reading a book.
Original fans of the “Song of Ice and Fire” book series can attest to the joys and woes
of waiting years for George R. R. Martin to release the latest addition, with online communities devoted to digging up new ideas and discussing the story. To me, this measure of great passion and individual dedication to a story amplifies the experience and allows the audience to feel a deeper connection to the characters.
Finally, it’s important to consider the ritualistic nature of watching TV weekly. In my family, we make a point to watch certain shows as a unit. It’s a way of bonding. While some families may not do this, friends can. It is not unheard of for people to have viewing parties for TV shows, especially finales and premieres. I believe that there is a certain distinct value in it, one that doesn’t leave the viewer feeling like they’ve had a sugar crash when they’re done.

As the semester continues, artists are in and out of the SAL Gallery on campus and the Steinberg Museum does its usual change. It all feels very familiar; however, an exhibition that isn’t as known to other students on campus is the art therapy program and their show in the Sculpture Gallery up the hill, on campus. It has the potential of bringing a different variety of art, compared to pieces selected for the SAL Gallery’s inventory.
“Their background is about 50/50 in fine art and in something else,” said professor Ann Charlotte Tavolacci. “All of them have some experience with it, but to some, this is their first exhibition, and to others, this is just another one,” she said. It opens up to some new, outside the box approaches that aren’t necessarily the usual.
The students’ assignments are given by Tavolacci, but are open to interpretation. “The exhibition
is called…” Tavolacci has been giving assignments throughout the semester; students can then take a class to bring together all their favorite works, have a small critique and then decide on what’s going in it.
“So far, we have about 100 works,” she said. There are about 20 students in the exhibition, but it is to be narrowed down. “Each student will have one or two in the show, so the walls will be pretty crowded,” she said.
The theme for the show is “It’s Personal,” and the assignments have been in context with the theme. The students have also used words that their art represents for the show, and is put on the posters, promoting it.
Tavolacci mentioned that with the different backgrounds, the words they’ve used have been equally different. Words such as “anxiety, instinct, isolation, music, hope, colorful,” are featured, so expect a variety in art as well.
“It’s about the process, not the product,” Tavolacci said, emphasizing the fact that the program isn’t a pure arts program. It’s a practice what you preach-scenario for the art therapists, as they try to experience first hand what they’re going to learn later on in their studies.
“It’s Personal” opens Monday Nov. 17 through Nov.21, with an artist reception on Nov. 19 at 5 p.m. The exhibition is open to all.

On Wednesday, Nov. 5, students, faculty, and guests had the chance to not only watch a screening of the documentary: “Miriam Beerman: Expressing the Chaos,” but to also have a Q&A with director of the film, Jonathan Gruber.
The film is about the life of artist Miriam Beerman who now suffers from dementia. In the movie, viewers have a chance to take a peek into what her life as an artist was like. The movie begins with a piece of Beerman’s art shot from above, which Gruber calls a “Grand Canyon Effect.”
“The way we did this was by taking high resolution photos flat and then with shadows from each side,” Gruber said. “So with the shadows, the computer then can extrapolate typography from it, so it kind of blended them all together and you have these sort of mountains on top and you could fly through it and do all sorts of cool things. Which I liked a lot because I never had seen that before and we stayed true to her art.”
The documentary touches on all aspects of her life and it shows all the hard times Beerman had to endure; she was born with an illness, later on had a horrible car accident, and eventually lost her husband at
a very young age. You can see her struggles reflected in her art, since a great deal of her painting were very haunting images that portray the suffering of not only herself but of generations of victims.
“I’ve only known her for a number of years and I don’t know her that well but it seems that she does have this sort of spunkiness to her and everyone that meets her seems to find this lightness,” Gruber said when asked whether her dark art portrayed the person Beerman was. “You know, I think just like anything we do some sort of catharsis. Her art does help her get it out,” he added.
“I think there is a lot of chaos in my work,” Beerman said in the documentary, “and I am not trying to put order to the chaos, I am expressing the chaos. It’s inside of everyone but it’s certainly inside of me. Everyone has it most people don’t admit it.” Her art is inspired by German expressionism.
While Gruber prepared the setup for the film, he said that it was a lot of organizing the art into slides and taking pictures. “She is very prolific so it was a pretty laborious process,” Gruber said. “But some of the work stood out, some was iconic. Bill (Beerman’s son) helped a lot in guiding us in the right direction.”
Beerman first thought of the movie in 2011, and because of her loss of memory they had to search for some old interview to get a good narrative.
“We screened this film with people who were part of the Memory Project in Wisconsin and we were talking about how it’s therapeutic on some level for them,” Gruber said, referring to how art may help Beerman with her memory loss. “But the art is different through a person with dementia and I think we are imposing our own values of sadness on it so it’s important to look at it in a different way.”
“One thing that has been really interesting is that the process of this film while she forgets a lot she has been able to retain that the film is being made about her,” Gruber said. “And the watching of the film, which she has done a lot, helps her retain her memories about her life. Out all of the things that have happened with this film that is the most satisfying. So it’s really therapeutic for her.”
People can find Beerman’s art on her website; it shows the places that have some of her collections. According to Gruber, some of her art is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the New York area.
“What I understood through the making of this film is that as hard as it is being a filmmaker, it’s much harder to be a fine arts artist,” Gruber said. “I mean she is a woman with an incredible career and she is in 16 institutions but many people haven’t heard of her she is in the collection that means it’s in the basement and they don’t bring it out.”
Beerman’s lack of desire and/or ability to push herself really struck Gruber. “I am curious of artist todays, teachers, if part of your education is to learn how to present new work and how to market yourself and while that might be distasteful its certainly a part of how you get yourself out there,” Gruber said.
“I think she (Beerman) probably could have done a lot more if she marketed herself and I guess this film is about her rediscovering her while she is still alive and celebrating her,” he added.
The reason why Gruber decided to take on this project was mainly because he is friends with Beerman’s son Bill Beerman.“But still I thought she was a very interesting person and we got a bit of funding from one of her patrons and did some interviews and eventually it came together into a 40 minutes cut and it was truly independent film making,” Gruber said.
Gruber assures that this documentary is nothing like the films he has done in the past. He has never worked on an art film; he wanted to make something that was interesting, not something where he purely focused on her influences.
“Art people might love that but I felt like I really wanted to make it more accessible for people,” Gruber said. “So I wanted to make it funky and cool, have good stories of her struggles as a women artist in the art world in the ‘60s and ‘70s, as well as her struggles now with dementia.”
“This is the third event of [a] six part series of the In Person On Screen Film Series, which was started in support of the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation grant,” said Sharon Maier-Kennelly, General Manager and Director of Programming Initiatives for the Tilles Center. “Technically this is the last one for this semester. We had one in September, October, and now November. Next semester we are continuing for February, March, and April.”
“Once the films were chosen and they were on the schedule I was asked to reach out to different constituencies in the university, students, professors, etc,” said Clara Zahler, Campus Arts Liaison. “So I try to bring people into the house to experience the artist first hand with master classes and residencies. This was a great opportunity to reach to components of the campus that we normally don’t reach out to, for example art therapy was here. I kind of wish that we had had more art students but I was thrilled to see the students here that were interested.”
The films chosen for this series are very varied. According to Mair-Kennelly, next years schedule is as follows: The first film in February will take place in the concert hall and it will be about the Carter Cash family. In March there will be a film called “Rebel,” which is about a young Puerto Rican girl who moved to the U.S. to become a confederate soldier and therefore hides her gender and nationality. Finally in April, which is poetry month, there will be a film called “Deaf Jam,” which is about poetry jams for both hearing and ASL.

With just four seconds remaining in regulation, a 31-yard field goal by Bentley University (5-5) handed the football team (6-4) a 30-28 defeat on Saturday, Nov. 7, in a Northeast-10 Conference showdown at Bentley University Field in Waltham, Mass.
Trailing 28-27 with just 30 seconds to go, Bentley received the ball on the 43-yard line following an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
It only took the Falcons twenty seconds to move into field goal range as sophomore quarterback C.J. Scarpa threw a 31-yard bomb, which was hauled in by junior wide receiver Chris Calvanese at the LIU 14-yard line, setting up the game-winning field goal from kicker Alex Baron.
Heading into this game, Bentley only averaged 14.6 points a game, but history didn’t play its course as they scored 31 points. Calvanese had a field day for the Falcons, recording 10 catches for 154 yards and three touchdowns. The hosts also used a trick play to open up the scoring as senior wide-out Chris Walsh threw a 42-yard touchdown strike to Calvanese in the first period.
Down 27-14 in the fourth quarter, junior quarterback Jeff Kidd and the Pioneer offense flipped the switch; scoring two touchdowns to jump on top, 28-27. Kidd first staged an impressive 17-play, 84-yard drive, resulting in a 13-yard touchdown pass to red-shirt sophomore wide receiver James Higgins, trimming the lead down to seven.
After Baron shanked a 35-yard field goal try, the Green and Gold capitalized finding the end zone once again. It wasn’t an easy task though as the Pioneers converted a fourth-and-long when Kidd hoisted a prayer that was hauled in by red-shirt sophomore wide-out Kyle Ward for 42 yards. The Oregon-native spread the ball around to six different receivers for 91 yards on the drive. Kidd checked down to red-shirt junior running back Mike Williams for an 8-yard touchdown making it a 27-26 game. LIU went on to score a two-point conversion as Kidd connected with Higgins in the back of the end zone, giving the visitors a 28-27 edge with just 30 seconds left.
Kidd, the Northeast-10 Conference Player of the Week, complet- ed 34-of-58 passes for 417 yards and four touchdowns. Red-shirt junior wide receiver Shane Hubbard caught seven balls for 97 yards. Senior tight end Sean Binckes wasn’t targeted much until late in the game, but still had six receptions for 64 yards and one touchdown. However, LIU’s ground attack was non-existent; red-shirt freshman wide-out Ramel Joseph led all rushers with 28 yards on mostly reverses.
The Pioneers were once again depleted with injuries on defense as junior safety Clarence Sears left the game early and senior defensive lineman James Athan had to be helped off the field twice during the game. Red-shirt junior cornerback Kareem Folkes and sophomore defensive back Richard Wright were picked on early and often by Scarpa, as the secondary continued to struggle against the pass. Several miscues and penalties also haunted the Pioneers throughout the course of the game, which was capped off by the unsportsmanlike conduct after the two-point conversion.
Junior linebacker Nate Feliz stood out defensively, leading the Pioneers with 12 tackles. Freshman linebacker Connor Farrell totaled nine stops and one pass-deflection. Sophomore defensive end Kevin Pettit-Frere pitched in with six tackles and a blocked extra point.
LIU Post fell to sixth place in the NE-10 as Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers will travel back to Waltham to play Bentley again this Saturday, Nov. 14, in the fifth place game on Championship Weekend. Kickoff is yet to be determined.

Powered by a four-goal first half, the top-seeded Pioneers routed fourth-seeded University of Bridgeport 6-2 in the East Coast Conference Semifinal on Wednesday, Nov. 4. Less than a minute into the game, the Pioneers began their assault when freshman forward Charlie Ledula notched a goal. After a quick response from Bridgeport a few minutes later, the Pioneers took it to another level.
After an own goal by Bridgeport, sophomore centerback David Arvidsson fired a volley from nearly 30 yards out and it hit the back of the net, making it 3-1 in favor of the Pioneers. Nearing half- time, senior midfielder Per Forgaard made it 4-1. After the intermission, Ledula netted his second goal while fellow freshman forward Toby Ilomuanya added a goal in the 74th minute, making it 6-1.
The Pioneers looked to build on this win when they welcomed NYIT to the Pioneer Soccer Park on Friday, Nov. 5. Led by a solid defense and great play from junior keeper Jesper Malmstrom, the Pioneers shutout NYIT 3-0 and won the East Coast Conference. After a scoreless first half, the Pioneers got on the board in the 57th minute when Forgaard sent a header passed the keeper. After another header found the back of the net by the Pioneers, Forgaard was back at it again when he received a pass from junior forward Jason Lampkin into the mesh.

Three sets were all it took for the Pioneers to take care of Roberts Wesleyan College on Saturday, Nov. 7. The Green and Gold won the match easily, winning each set by at least 12 points.
Freshman outside-hitter Rachel Londot notched her 12th double- double of the season with 12 kills and 14 digs. In addition to Londot, senior setter Monica Amador totaled 11 kills, three aces, and two blocks while sophomore outside-hitter Danielle Valenza finished with seven kills and six sigs.
The Pioneers returned to the court on Sunday, Nov. 8, to do battle with Daemen College in their house. In that match, neither team seemed to be able to gain an advantage as the first four sets were split among the two sides. The Pioneers pulled out the win in the final set, thanks to help all match long from Valenza and senior libero Rachel Ringor. Valenza led both teams in kills with 24 and also amassed 13 digs while Ringor totaled a game-high 28 digs.
In that final and deciding fifth set, the Pioneers gutted out a 16-14 victory, giving them their 20th win
of the season. The Pioneers will wrap up their regular season this weekend with a trio of games, which get underway on Thursday, Nov. 12, against Mercy College. First-serve from the Pratt Recreation Center is set for 7 p.m.

At the beginning of the fall semester, a change occurred in the Theatre, Film and Dance building. The faculty members, whose offices had always been in that building, were told that their offices would be moved to the basement of Humanities Hall.
Professors who hold their classes in the Theatre, Film and Dance building, now have to travel back and forth between buildings.
According to Rosanne Reddy, secretary to Cara Gargano, Chair of the Department of Theatre, Film, Dance and Arts Management, this change was made in order to create more space
for the classes that will now be held in those rooms.
“Some faculty have been [relocated] for voice lessons in those spaces, and eventually a renovation, which is not planned in detail yet,” Reddy said. “I haven’t yet heard a student complain that the faculty isn’t always in the building, but I do see how it could be an inconvenience.”
Davyd H. Suber Jr., Director of the Dance Program, and Cheryl Halliburton-Beatty, a professor of Dance, were both moved to the basement of Humanities Hall.
Alex Mitchell, a sophomore dance major, disagrees and finds it an inconvenience that her professors aren’t available to her in the same space.
“I think it’s a lot less convenient than it used to be. In our department, we have contracts that we have to do throughout the semester. Mine is office assistant, which means I help out in the Dance Director’s office. It’s annoying to travel between buildings to do this,” Mitchell said.
As of now, the students in the dance department have no classes within their major in Humanities, so it makes little to no sense to have their professor’s offices there. “It would be so much easier for everything in our major to be in one place, including our professors,” Mitchell said. Yet, there is no plan to move the professors’ offices back to the TFD building. There is also no definite plan about when the building will undergo renovations. For the time being, the situation will remain the same. “It is what it is,” Suber said.

In 2014, Long Island University’s website underwent a technological make-over. The entire face and layout of the LIU website was revamped. Yet, a recent investigation by the Pioneer found that, despite the aesthetic updates made to the site, much of the old information remains the same. In fact, some of the information is over two years old. Faculty members who have left the university are still listed with their phone numbers and university emails attached. Some of the departed faculty and staff members still listed on the website are:
1. Andrew Rosman
As posted by Fairleigh Dickenson University’s website, Rosman left his position as Dean from LIU’s College of Management to join Fairleigh Dickenson as of July 1, 2014. According to the Post website, he is still the Dean.
2. Katherine C. Hill-Miller
Former Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is now an English professor after stepping down from her position before the fall 2015 semester. This was a front-page news story for the Pioneer on March 31, 2015. According to the website, she is still the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
3. Kenneth Mensing
As of Feb. 2014, Mensing was no longer associated with LIU Post, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is still listed as the Campus Historian and Archivist at LIU.edu.
4. Paul Forestell
LIU Post’s former Provost left the university in the 2014 spring semester. The public can still find him through the search engine on the University’s website.
5. Sandra Lynn Mardenfeld
Professor Mardenfeld left the university after the spring 2015 semester. However, one can still find her name and information under the category Faculty Profiles, where it says she is not only a current employee, but the Chair of the Department of Journalism.
6. T.K. Blue
A former jazz professor in the music department, T.K. Blue left Post before the fall 2014 term. Yet, he is still found on the website as such. Blue’s own website is more up to date stating “As of Sept. 2014, Professor T.K. Blue is no longer on the music faculty at LIU-Post.”
Although the face of the website may be appealing to the untrained eye, the information provided is, in many cases, no longer accurate.
A representative from the IT department, who has previously been a consultant for the website in years past, said that the website is directed towards prospective students versus the current population of LIU Post students.
John Lutz, Chair of the English department, said that not only the students are frustrated by the old information. “Faculty are extremely frustrated about the website because there has been no clear or consistent means for them to provide input concerning changes to its content, nor any communication when these changes been made,” Lutz said. “This absence of a formal process represents a failure on the part of the administration to foster the shared governance and democratic decision-making necessary for a university community to thrive.”
According to Lutz, the administration is breaking links, and taking pages of the website down without consulting the faculty first, which is causing discrepancies within the departments and university as a whole.
The university’s Department of Public Relations, which is in charge of the website, is using the website as an advertising tool, according to faculty members. While advertising is necessary, Lutz said, the faculty would like to have the website geared more towards the professional connections, or links, between colleagues and, of course, as a helpful tool for current students to find professors and other information.
One way to fix the website’s fluency is to make the updating process inclusive for the admissions process and faculty alike. As of now, according to Lutz, the website is being updated too rapidly, with no communication within the university.
George Baroudi, the head of the university’s IT department, did not respond to the Pioneer’s requests for comment about the old information on the website.

The overall crime rate at LIU Post has increased since 2012, while drug related arrests have decreased tremendously, according to LIU’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report (2015). The report presents statistics regarding crime and other campus safety issues from 2014.
A total of 18 crimes were reported on campus in 2014, 11 on campus and seven in the dorms. These included:
The stalking cases are the first reported in the past two years, while a similar amount of burglaries have been reported in previous years.
The drug related arrests on campus have decreased from 100 arrests in 2012, to 54 arrests in 2013, and 15 in 2014.
Liquor arrests, however, increased from 153 in 2013, to 178 in 2014. This is still a significant decrease from 2012, when 234 people on campus were arrested for underage-drinking or illegal distribution of alcohol.
The report showed that the university, as the biggest residential LIU campus, has a significantly higher rate of crime, as well as liquor and drug related arrests compared to the other LIU campuses, including LIU Brooklyn.
In 2014, there were no reported fires at LIU Post. There were two fires in 2012, and one in 2013.
The report is issued by the university in compliance with the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1990, New York Educational Law Article 129-B (enacted in July 2015) and various other laws and regulations.
Besides the crime statistics, the report includes the LIU students’ Bill of Rights, as well as information about what to do in the case of a fire or an emergency situation, or when the victim of a crime on campus. It also includes campus policies.
The report is available to every student and employee of LIU upon request by contacting either the Admissions Office, the Registrar’s Office or by accessing the following website: http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety
The Pioneer reached Public Safety for a comment on the statistics, but was referred to the Dean of Students, Abby Van Vlerah, who was not available to comment.

If this winter weather is going to be anything like the winters in previous years, best of luck; but, you should always look for the silver linings. So, while you battle Mother Nature with a shovel and salt in hand, why not take the fight to the textbook?
Post offers both spring and winter courses to graduate and undergraduate students. Courses are available for students of all majors, from the arts to education, to sciences and mathematics.
However, these courses are costly. For undergraduate students, regardless of what course you enroll in, it will cost $841 per credit. The same cannot be said for graduate students; courses start at $1,151 per credit. These fees do not cover books, or any other amenities. Also, a $100 dollar campus fee is added to the student’s final enrollment fee.
“Don’t let the prices deter you,” says former college professor Christina Bowser, who spent four years at Post as an English professor. “Yes, these courses are not cheap, but you’re essentially paying for an advantage. You’re paying for the course, but at the same time it gets you ahead of the curve, and if you play your cards right, you can graduate earlier because of courses like these.”
Ismael Nehhas, a junior pharmacy major, who attends LIU Brooklyn, agrees with Bowser’s notion on courses held during the break. “When I was at Post I had to take a ton of courses in science. I’m going to be honest it would get stressful, and since I needed to do well in all of my classes in order to get into pharmacy school, I would scale back my credit in take, and just take a course in the winter.”
However, not all students are of the same mindset as Nehhas and Bowser. Students like Emily Desmond, a freshman who is undecided about her major, refers to herself as ‘break traditionalist’, and is adamant about not taking courses during the break. “I’d like to think I work hard during the semester, and I vacation during the break, so I plan to keep it that way.”
Students who wish to enroll into a winter or spring course, can visit Kumble Hall and inquire about courses within, or students can visit LIU’s website at webapps2.liu.edu/Winter/Winter.html.
