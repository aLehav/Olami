LIU Post has announced that it will introduce two new schools to campus for the 2015- 2016 academic year: The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and the Honors College. Jeffrey Kane, Vice President of Academic Affairs, believes this reorganization will increase enrollment, and be beneficial to the overall academic environment on campus.
The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering will be an independent academic unit that will join the School of Business and the School of Professional Accountancy within the College of Management. Prior to the reorganization, the College of Management consisted of the following departments and schools: the School of Professional Accountancy; the Department of Social Work; the Department of Public Administration; the Department of Criminal Justice; the Department of Management; the Department of Finance; and the Department of Marketing.
However, the administration began to notice that certain academic units, such as the Department of Social Work, the Department of Criminal Justice and the Department of Administration, didn’t seem to fit within the College of Management, according to Kane. “These very disparate group of units couldn’t be called the School of Business because you can’t include Social Work as a part of the School of Business. You can’t call Criminal Justice a part of the School of Business. As a result, they created an umbrella term called the College of Management. However, the problem with that is that it created a lot of confusion on the outside,” Kane said. One of the reasons for the creation of the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management was to expand on areas of growth and development such as computer science, according to Kane. “One of the main objectives [of the reorganization] is for students to realize that we do have Computer Science at this university. If you look at the Department of Labor statistics and look at the area of growth in the job market where our students can get really good and professional careers started and developed, there’s a heavy emphasis on computers. There is a tremendous growth area in the job market for this new school will initially be small, but he stated that his goal for the school is for it to grow, and ensure that students have careers ahead of them that “will serve them well and make them happy and productive people.”
“I’m fine with the idea as long as it doesn’t interfere with my graduation date,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. However, according to Kane, the new school will have no impact on individual students because it will not change the already pre-existing courses or the majors offered on campus. “If you’re in accountancy, then you’re still in accountancy. If you’re in business, then you’re still in business. If you’re in social work then you’re still in social work. None of this has an effect on the program that you are enrolled in,” Kane added.
Project Management, a new program that will be offered in the fall in the new school, is a graduate level program now at the approval stage. A degree in Project Management will give students the skills to oversee all aspects of a project, including planning, budget, project control, strategic issues, value management, human resource issues, and legal issues.
The establishment of the Honors College will give LIU more prominence, attract more students, and promote the academic environment on campus that is devoted to students and their academic needs. “I believe that we have one of the finest honors programs in the country,” Kane explained. “When it’s called a program, it seems to have a lesser status than, let’s say, the honors colleges at other universities. It gives the appearance, although a misguided appearance, that the program here is of lesser significance. We want to promote that program and raise recognition of the role that it plays at the university.”
“I feel very positive about this because [it] is a direction that many universities across the country are taking,” said Joan Digby, a Professor of English and the Director of the Honors Department. “It makes us more competitive to be a college rather than a program. I think that it will even encourage students that are already going to Post to apply to be in the honors program, knowing that their diploma will read that they graduated from an Honors College.” Digby continued, “My primary goal is to expand the number of students in the Honors College because that will permit us to offer more courses and advanced electives every single semester. I’d like to try to get an additional 100 or 150 people by next fall so that there [can be] more course offerings.”
Starting in the fall, when Honor students graduate from Post, their diploma will state that they graduated from an Honors College, according to Digby. Honors program students will automatically be moved into the Honors College next fall. The Honors College will keep the same reporting schedule, and will not be structurally different; however, students will have more opportunities being a part of an Honors College rather than an honors program. Digby predicts that as the Honors College at Post develops in connection with LIU Brooklyn’s new Honors College that Post and Brooklyn will have more programming together.
“It might mean that our Pre-Pharmacy students might want to take some courses at the Honors [College] at the Brooklyn campus, or other students from Brooklyn might want to come do a semester to concentrate on Theatre or Music at Post, where we are very strong,” Digby said. “The benefit of all of this, that as a director of a college, I’ll be able to work more directly with the deans of the other colleges so that I will have more input in terms of getting faculty to teach an honors course, and getting faculty to advise research for honors students.”
“If we can be more successful in letting people know what we have, then hopefully we can attract students from different regions, [and] not just the local area,” Kane said. “A dream of ours at the moment would be to open up an honors dorm.”
This fall, the Honors office was moved from Humanities building to room 202 in the Winnick Mansion. Kane believes the change of location of Honors from Humanities to the Winnick Mansion displays great symbolism for what it represents to the university. “Just look at the new location. It’s on the top of the hill in [the] beautiful Winnick Mansion. It promotes the message of, ‘Hey we’re proud of this thing.’ It’s not one program among many. It’s the gleaming top.”
As of now, a dean has yet to be appointed for the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and there is currently no deanship for the Honors College. Dr. Digby will remain the director.
“You can think of these changes as a statement of our aspirations. The real impact is telling people what we aspire towards and what we aim to do in order to move the campus forward. It’s more a picture of where we want the campus to be rather than an administrative shuffling like it might appear to be,” Kane said.

In pursuit of their first title since 2006, the football team (8-3) captured the Northeast-10 Conference Championship on Saturday, Nov. 15, with a 58-25 rout of American International (8-3) at Ronald J. Abdow Field in Springfield, Massachusetts.

After a scoreless opening quarter, the Pioneers capitalized on an interception from sophomore defensive back Ryan Renfroe in AIC territory. Five snaps later, red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino completed a screen pass to sophomore running back David White, which resulted in a 20-yard dash into the end zone for the opening score of the contest.
The Yellow Jackets responded, though, answering the touchdown with 16 unanswered points to grab a nine-point cushion late in the second quarter. However, the Pioneers drove down the field for a field goal before halftime. Senior kicker Karsten Viste nailed a 22-yard field goal to reduce the gap to 16-10 at the break.
LIU Post owned the second half, outscoring the hosts by an overwhelming 48-9 margin. Following an AIC three-and-out, the visitors put together a quick drive resulting in a touchdown. It was Laurino who scampered into the end zone for a two-yard score. Although the Yellow Jackets responded with a touchdown of their own to go back in front 23-17, the Pioneers would not be denied of hoisting the championship trophy.
The Green and Gold went on to score three consecutive touchdowns to grab a commanding 37-25 advantage. The run was bookended by 25 and five yard passes to red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer. A 28-yard strike from Laurino to red-shirt sophomore receiver Shane Hubbard in the end zone sandwiched those scoring drives. Leading by two possessions, the visitors kept their foot on the gas, as they took a 44-25 lead after Laurino found Palmer for a third time in the end zone, on a 72-yard deep ball.
A surprise onside kick followed, as the Pioneers jumped on top of the loose ball at the AIC 21-yard line. Three plays into that possession, red-shirt sophomore running back Mike Williams ran the ball in from 10 yards out to seal the victory.
Laurino continued his outstanding finish to his collegiate career, completing 30-of-57 passes for a season-high 413 yards and five touchdowns. He scrambled for 61 yards and a score as well. White and Williams also pitched in with touchdowns on the ground. Hubbard made 10 catches for a career-high 172 yards and a touchdown, while Palmer had five receptions for 118 yards and three scores.
The Pioneer defense saw red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti lead the charge with 10 tackles while sophomore defensive back Jared Chester and freshman defensive back Richard Wright had nine tackles apiece. Junior defensive back Jahleel Oswald recorded eight stops, a forced fumble, and a pass break-up.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers earned a bid to the NCAA Division II championship. They will be traveling to Petersburg, Virginia, to take on Virginia State University. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 22.

On Thursday, Nov. 20, Dr. Guy Consolmagno will speak at the Inter- faith Center about the conflict between religion and science. Consolmagno is an MIT-trained research astronomer and planetary scientist at the Vatican Observatory, with degrees in Physics, Astronomy, Theology, and Philosophy; he is also a religious figure. Consolm- agno entered the Society of Jesus in 1989, and took vows as a Brother in 1991.
In 2014, Consolmagno won the Carl Sagan for Public Understanding of Science, presented by the Council of Scientific Society Presidents (CSSP). The award’s “purpose is to honor those who have become concurrently accom- plished as researchers and/or educa- tors, and as widely recognized magni- fiers of the public’s understanding of science.” Previous winners include the creators of the TV shows “N3MBERS” and “Bill Nye, The Science Guy.”
“We have asked him to talk about the meeting place of religion and science; that a healthy sense of either and both is to approach the creation through a sense of wonder and awe,” said Father Ted Brown, LIU Post’s Catholic Chaplain. “He truly sees no conflict between faith and sci- ence. They are exclusive areas of study, but are in conversation with each other rather than at odds. One [science] says how things are and how they got that way, and the other answers what does it mean for us humans [religion].”
Consolmagno’s lecture is the last of the “Express-yo Faith” series for the semester. The lecture series, sponsored by the Newman Catholic Community (Newman Club), featured three speakers, and will continue into next semester. According to Father Ted, there’s a good chance that next semester’s speakers will include Mike Hopkins, the American astronaut who recently returned from six months on the space station.
Consolmagno’s lecture will begin at 7 p.m. in the Interfaith Center (Chapel), and is open to the public.

As finals draw near, what exactly are the best ways for students to prepare? Does basic hitting the books work? Or does rewriting notes work better? And, where should students study – in their dorms, or the library?
Some students find that having a quiet study sanctuary is the best way to be successful on final exams. Christopher Scally, a junior Information Systems major, says that the library is the best place to study.
“I think that the library here at school is the best place to get work done. It’s one of the few quiet places on campus that I can sit down and think. Plus, the librarians are really helpful if you need anything,” Scally said. Many students agree that the library is a good place to study. The library’s hours: Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. – 11 p.m., Friday 8 a.m. – 9 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. – 11 p.m., and Sunday noon – 11 p.m.
Students can find other comfortable places to study on campus, as well, including on the couches in the upper part of Hillwood Commons, and in the Tilles Center Atrium. Students who live in a “quiet dorm” will have an easier time studying since loud activity ends earlier than in the other residence halls.
“Studying on campus is always hard to do unless you’re in a quiet place. I personally found that there is a huge difference in say studying in Hillwood or studying in the stacks at the library,” said Robert Goldstein, a junior Accounting major. “I also find that there is a significant difference in what you’re doing while studying. Listening to music or watching television can affect memory retention,” he continued.
A tip when it comes to the actual studying is to make index cards. Jessica Asherian, a senior Psychology major, finds that index cards work well. “Flash cards help me retain information way better than just studying from a textbook. It helps me remember key points [rather] than just useless information,” she said. Other tips include rewriting notes, and producing audio notes. Some students who are auditory learners might record lectures and turn the recordings directly into notes to listen to later on.
Laura Fallon, a senior Music Performance major, stressed that timing is important. “Don’t wait until the last week to study—that would overwhelm anybody in general,” she said. “Organize subjects by which final comes first. Studying them in order allows you to knock them out quickly and effectively.” Fallon continued, “Lastly, separate different categories by subject. Studying a bunch of information all meshed together can make you forget key points that would be on an exam.”
Albert Scott, a junior Social Work major, says that he cannot have anything distracting him from studying. “If I have the TV on in the background or music in my ears, I just can’t concentrate. I find that it is much better to take some study breaks for a few minutes here and there, that way I can concentrate more.”
The students The Pioneer interviewed all had similar responses: make sure to concentrate on studying, take breaks to avoid getting overwhelmed, and avoid distractions. Make sure that you’re in a quiet place, clear your mind and de-stress as much as possible. Finals week ends on Dec. 18, and students will have a month off to relax and regroup before the spring semester begins on Jan. 20.

At the end of the month, the second round of Campus Life’s revamped student and club awards are selected; the nominations are due the last week of each month. Campus Life started rolling out a revised version of the “Student Leader of the Month” award, as well as the new “Student Organization of the Month” award. The awards are meant to shed light on student leaders and student organizations that have done something special either on or off campus.
Director of Campus Life Michael Berthel says they want to emphasize students and organizations that have not necessarily gotten any feedback. “It could be a leader of a club, an RA, an athlete, or any student who has made a significant contribution to the community,” he said. “We want the submissions to come from faculty, staff, and students. Our goal is to highlight student efforts [that] might normally be under-recognized. The established process allows all students the opportunity to be nominated.”
The awards procedure, Berthel said, is now completely digital. “The new process is built around getting the word out to all of campus for nominations. In addition, the former process was built around student organizations, whereas the new awards are hoping to catch a wider range of students. Also, the entire process is online now via electronic submissions. We hope that this will also increase the amount of received nominations.”
The submissions are due the last week of every month. The first nominations were due on Nov. 7. Winners will be announced the week after nominations are submitted. “The winner will be chosen by a committee primarily from Campus Life, including Campus Life Coordinators, but it will also include people from LIU Promise, and maybe faculty from different departments,” Berthel said.
Campus Life received nine nominations for the first of the monthly awards: seven for students, and two for campus organizations. “That’s about what we hoped to get this first time,” Berthel said. In the future, Campus Life is aiming for more nominations, but Berthel viewed the number of November nominations as a success.
Campus Life hopes to add more than just the two awards for “Student Leader” and “Student Organization.” “Event of the Month” is one possibility, according to Berthel. After the winners have been chosen, Campus Life will showcase the winners online, both on Post’s homepage as well as on social media on both Post’s and Campus Life’s Facebook and Instagram pages. The winners will also be honored at the Student Leadership Reception held every December.
“I think it’s good that they get [these] out. I’ve never heard of it before, so it’s good that they try to get it more out,” said Kamilla Martinsen, a senior Broadcasting major. “Students and organizations will be encouraged by it. It’s good that they’ll be recognized for their hard work and get something back for it, and [the fact] that students [can] submit is good, so [they] will feel like their voice counts.”
Next semester, the awards will be given in February, March, and April. Berthel is hoping to give three monthly awards next fall, during September, October, and November. The prizes, Berthel said, will vary between gift bags and gift certificates. Winners will also receive a custom certificates to validate their respective award.
More information about the awards will be distributed to students through campus wide emails in addition to Post’s social media accounts, which can be found at facebook.com/LIUPost and instagram. com/LIUPost.
The Campus Life award winners were announced on Nov. 18; Student Leader of the Month went to Tia-Moná Greene, and Organization of the Month went to the Commuter Student Association.

When LIU Post’s College of Education, Information, and Technology’s Student Council held a meeting for students interested in joining the organization, it wasn’t only to inform students about the council itself, but also to warmly welcome CEIT’s new Dean, Dr. Barbara Garii.
The CEIT Student Council is a group of students, led by president Sarah Naqvi-Syed, who studied Adolescence Education with a concentration in English and graduated with a Bachelor in English Literature from the university.
At the meeting, which took place on Thursday, Nov. 13, Naqvi-Syed said the organization was dedicated to bring together the students and the faculty of LIU Post, provide networking opportunities for students that are interested in internships, and broaden the horizons of all students enrolled in at Post.
“We are trying to make our presence known on campus, and let you know what our mission statement is, which is to facilitate communication among students, [and to] bridge the gap between the students and the faculty,” Naqvi-Syed said.
Students and faculty were brought together as Dean Garii and CEIT professors held the “Dunkin’ With the Dean” event, where Dean Garii did not spend much time hiding. Garii was sincere with the students, and made everyone feel comfortable, not wanting us students to feel that she was hiding behind a huge bureaucracy – the first word that popped into my head when The Pioneer interviewed Dean Garii was “transparency.” Garii pointed out that she wants to engage communication, as well as hear the opinions and requests of the student body. “We are a team,” Garii said.
Dean Garii is a person filled with enthusiasm and energy, and that is not only inherent in her presence, but also through her career. Garii started her undergraduate career dreaming of working within TV and radio. She managed to get a full time job as a talk show-host and producer, until one year after working in the sales industry landed a job at an insurance company. This career change prompted Garii to pursue a master’s degree in Vocational Rehabilitation Counseling at Seattle University.
During the years that followed, she developed an interest in public health, especially the tools associated with advancing the general health of communities; she went back to school for a PhD. in Epidemiology. Before becoming CEIT’s new dean, Garii worked as a middle and high school mathematics teacher for 10 years, which lead her to train educators at Lesley University in Cambridge. Through Lesley, she got to Oswego, where she became an Associate Dean. From Oswego, she found a new home at LIU Post.
“Why did I tell you this long, convoluted story? Because it wasn’t linear; because where I started out dreaming, where I wanted to be, is not where I am, yet every job I had helped me get to where I am, and I think [w]hat we all are trying to say is that have your passion,” Garii said. “Have your dream.”
Garii then explained how she wants students to get that entry job, which in her eyes is the first step on the market that later will lead you to your dream job, even if you are unaware of where it is yet. This is Garii’s main drive – to give students a fair chance of using their theoretical skills in a real environment, and to gain experience from their choice industry.
“The past few years there have been some great things going on, and we are developing some partnerships with K-12 [online learning] schools in our teacher prep-programs. We have partnerships that we are establishing with businesses, industries, and hospitals in the region, and I want to build on those,” Garii explained.

It can be seen as a privilege to dorm at LIU Post, as you have an advantage to participate in the different clubs, activities, and events that take place on campus. Sometimes it can be hard for LIU commuters to participate in clubs and activities due to the amount of time that is spent traveling back and forth to school. Therefore, some commuters may feel disconnected from the campus community. The Commuters Student Association (CSA) answers this predicament by working hard to ensure that commuters feel appreciated and connected, even if they don’t live on campus.
CSA has been around since the early 2000s, and has acted as a strong support system for commuters. All commuters are welcome to join and attend meetings and events. The organization gives students an opportunity to enhance their college experience, form new friends and relationships, and share opinions, ideas, and concerns with each other regarding the university.
The president of CSA, Nicole Cunningham, a Literacy graduate student, identified the objective of the organization: “We really encourage all students, but especially commuters, to get involved on campus,” said Cunningham. “We are aware that, as a commuter, there are challenges because you have your responsibility here [at school], as well as where you live, but it’s also really important to get involved,” she added.
From Nov. 10 to the 14, CSA held its second annual Commuters Appreciation Week for all the commuters of LIU Post. With 70 percent of the campus commuting, CSA wanted to express their appreciation for commuters, and demonstrate to them that they are a big part of the campus despite living off campus.
On Monday, Nov. 10, CSA held “Peanut Butter Jelly Time” at the East West Café. CSA had students come out and participate in making PB&J sandwiches from 11:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. The sandwiches were donated to the needy. 1,106 sandwiches were made, providing a positive start for the exciting week ahead.
Tuesday’s (Nov. 11) event was oriented toward shopaholics. A bus met students outside of Hillwood Commons to transport them to the Tanger Outlets located in Deer Park, where students were given the opportunity to mingle and enjoy some discount shopping.
The fan-favorite Ice Cream Social was held on Wednesday, Nov. 12, in the Hillwood lobby. Students were able to make their own ice cream sundaes while engaging in conversation with other commuters, as well as students who dorm. “When people walked into Hillwood and saw people standing in line for ice cream they were really excited and surprised,” said Cunningham. “It was something small, but big at the same time, for us to show our appreciation.”

Students and faculty of LIU Post are blessed (pun intended) to have the support and services of the Interfaith Center, also known as the Chapel, on campus. The Interfaith Center encourages people to continue pursuing their religious beliefs, as well as come to appreciate those of others. The Chapel offers Protestant worship, Roman Catholic mass, Jewish services, and Islamic worship. As their website says, “if the faith you follow is not represented at the Chapel, they will assist you in finding your tradition locally.” When the Interfaith Center is not holding religious services, it is offering community volunteering and activities for all students and faculty.

Thanksgiving is a time for giving, and being surrounded by the people we are grateful for in our lives. However, some students can’t always make it home for Thanksgiving. No need to feel sad about it, because the Chapel is offering its 26th annual Thanksgiving Fest to all students unable to go home during the holiday. According to Father Ted Brown, on Thanksgiving Day, a light breakfast will be served between 6.30 a.m. and noon at the Chapel. If you wish to get out in town on Thanksgiving, then around 7 a.m., a bus will depart from the Chapel to bring students to the Macy’s Thanksgiving parade in the Big Apple, NYC (students wishing to attend the parade must pay $10 for the bus services).
Ted Brown talked about the plans for the dinner: “A complete Thanksgiving meal will be served in the Long Island room at 1.15 p.m., and later, sandwiches will be available to take back to your room for an evening meal.” Lastly, students will have the opportunity to have dessert with university President Dr. Cline at her campus home. If you are interested in taking part in this Thanksgiving Day event, you can sign up at www.tinyurl.com/thanksgivingfest.
One of the most well-known contributions of the Interfaith Center to the student body of LIU is “All Night Study” during finals week. Beginning Sunday, Dec. 14, and ending on Thursday, Dec. 18,
the Chapel will be open for quiet studying between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. This is the place for students to buckle down and get their hardcore studying on, especially when common places such as the library are packed and thriving with busy bees of students during this crucial time. The Chapel will also provide students with coffee and donuts to keep them going during the wee hours of the night. Father Ted Brown would really appreciate it if anyone would like to help out during the “All Night Study” week. You can contact Father Brown for more information as well as general inquiries about the Chapel and its contributions to campus life at (516) 299-2229.

The football team concluded what has been an incredible season; filled with comebacks, heartbreaks, and exceeded expectations. After two consecutive losing seasons, the Pioneers have turned it around this season, and much of the credit is
due to their head coach, Bryan Collins. Before the season even started and months before training camp was in sight, Collins had the depth chart-board wide open, preparing for the season ahead.
On the railing of the depth chart sits a dirty old horseshoe that Collins found during a jog around campus prior to last season. Collins picked it up, hoping it was a good luck charm, after going 5-11 during the 2012-2013 season. Collins, who is also the head Athletic Director, thought a little luck might be needed to keep up this balancing act between football and his family.
During the fall season, Collins enters the Pratt Recreation Center at 8 a.m. and leaves at 12 p.m. Collins, a husband and a father of two, struggles during the season to see his family. “Unfortunately, there isn’t much balance. You sacrifice certain things for your career,” Collins said.
Collins played middle linebacker throughout his high school and college career. At St. John’s University, he won the Dr. Peter Vitulli Award, which is given to athletes with the most perseverance and courage. Collins ultimately graduated with a Business Management degree from the university. It was a year after graduation that he realized an office job wasn’t the route for him. Although he headed into the city looking for work, he continued to work out, hoping that an NFL team would give him a call. They never did, but Collins was committed to making a living out of the sport he loved.
In preparation for a career in football, Collins returned to his high school alma mater, Saint Francis Preparatory School, as an assistant coach. After several years of coaching there, Collins ultimately got the head-coaching job at LIU Post in 1998.
Perseverance is a trait Collins has continually exhibited throughout his life. He recently celebrated the seven-year anniversary of his kidney transplant. Collins had surgery in the off-season, and never missed a game.
Collins is not just a coach, but a teacher as well. “It’s great to stand in front of a group of young men and look into their eyes and they’re looking back at you, and you just feel they are paying attention to what you have to say,” Collins said.
Mike Sollenne, junior offensive lineman, gets to listen to his speeches firsthand. “He’s a yeller sometimes, but every coach is,” Sollenne said. Despite his first two seasons being losing ones, Sollenne finds comfort in Collins’ past success.
During his first eight seasons as a head coach, he led the Pioneers to a 73 -17 record. Sollenne also supports the coach on his 5,000-hour community service goal for all of LIU’s student- athletes. “It’s great to do a lot of community stuff,” Sollenne said. Collins’ passion for community service comes from his belief that: “We are so fortunate to be able to play [and] with service you appreciate what you have,” Collins said.
“Communication is paramount to every relationship,” Collins added. As a middle linebacker in college, it was his responsibility to communicate with his team and it was his responsibility to make adjustments. Collins uses those same communications skills in his role as athletic director. It is clear that Collins’ love for sports has rubbed off on his children, including his daughter, Megan, who played four sports in high school.
Collins also expects progress off the field, according to Ian Schraier, Director of Athletic Media Relations at LIU Post and a 2007 graduate of the university. Schraier has firsthand knowledge of that commitment, since their offices are footsteps away. “Collins pushed me when I was a student working in the office, and now as an employee,” Schraier said. worse.”Collins said, “If you’re staying the same, you’re getting

The student newspaper, The Pioneer, has informed LIU Post students for over 50 years. The paper includes campus events, news, and sports, profiles of students and professors, and provides a forum for students to express their opinions.
After over 50 years, are students happy with the content offered in The Pioneer, or do they want to read something else? Let’s find out.
The current newspaper has five sections; News, Features, Opinions, Arts and Entertainment, and Sports. In my opinion, these sections cover the campus in an effective manner. But, I am an editor of The Pioneer – what do other students think?
Freshman Education major Gina Cammarata said, “I’d like to see things that [involve] my peers, what they are involved in and doing around campus.” More specifically, Cammarata wants to see more “clubs and sports [coverage], ads promoting clubs, game results and actions from the games.” Cammarata would also like to see local news, as well as campus news.
Melissa Norman, a freshman Dance major, would like to see a Music section in the paper. She would also like to see a gossip column. For the gossip column, “you can go local; it doesn’t have to be celebrity [gossip],” Norman said.
Cara Snider, a junior Dance major, said that she would like to see more information on what goes on in the city, “like dance shows.” Snider would also like to see a Health and Wellness section in the paper that would discuss things “like diets, what food[s] you should intake, and what exercise you need,” Snider added.
Jess Falconer, a senior Forensic Science major, who was previously the Business Manager of The Pioneer, said that she would like to see comics, crosswords, and puzzles in the paper. In the comic section, she would like to see something that goes “beyond the story.” Falconer mentioned that she would also like to see more things that happen on “Long Island that are relevant to the campus.”
Senior Forensic Science major Kayla Mahoney said, “I think it would be cool to have an advice column. [A place] where students can turn to for advice.” Mahoney said that the advice should help students get a positive outlook. She also suggested the advice column provide tips on “how to get the best out of the campus” and “how to survive certain professors.” Mahoney pointed out that the columns should be written anonymously so that the professors can’t track the students.
The Pioneer has an ethical policy of not accepting anonymous submissions, because we believe it undermines the credibility of the paper. However, these great suggestions will all be thoughtfully considered.
I personally think these are wonderful suggestions, especially the Health and Wellness section. That would be very helpful. If you have any ideas about something you would want to see covered by The Pioneer, please email us at liupostpioneer@gmail.com. We would love to incorporate your ideas for the spring 2015 semester!

We international students have a completely different fashion sense than do the Americans! Do you agree? Tight trousers or jeans (called “pants” in every other language apart from English, which I find extremely bizarre as we call pants “briefs” in England!), tight or fitted tops, shirts and jumpers. These are fashions that foreigners are renowned for. Many of the Americans I see on a day-to-day basis at Post, however, dress in rather baggy clothes, such as athletic shorts or “pants.” This week, I wanted to see what the Americans think of our dress sense. Is it unique, or weird? Do they like it?
The Americans on the men’s soccer team are overwhelmed with Europeans, and Europeans have the world’s best dress sense, right? Smart, unique, wacky, unconventional, with a swaggy touch—at least this is how I think of my companions and myself! So, have these Americans on the soccer team been converted to the inherent sense of style that the Scandinavians and the Brits bring?
I was speaking to a long-term server of the men’s soccer team—a guy highly regarded in the ranks of the team, and someone who has been a truly great college-athlete: Victor Muntean, a senior majoring in Business Management, also an American. We spoke about what he thought of the style brought forth to the changing room over the years from different international student-athletes. “I would say that the Europeans’ style, from what I have noticed throughout my years here at Post, is as eclectic as any other culture,” he said, and explained himself, “I have found varieties of different fashions and styles every day I walk into school. I have noticed that some prefer a more traditional and tailored style, such as dress shirts and a sweater with smart shoes. I have also seen others wear tight pants with a shirt, but keeping it informal with a pair of sneakers. And then I see the stereotypical Europeans who wear an eccentric dress code of many different colors chucked together. Sometimes their clothes can be too big or too small. They seem fairly presentable compared to the American standard of jeans and a t-shirt, or the infamous sweatpants and hoodie. While some of these interesting international styles have rubbed off on me, although I do like to keep the more casual American look.”
This is the opinion of a guy who has experienced so many different cultural styles: Swedish, British, German, Danish, Chinese, South American, and many more. This does, partly, answer a question I asked earlier: Have these Americans on the soccer team been converted to the inherent sense of style the Scandinavians and the Brits bring? As Vic said, he has taken a few things from these crazy and different styles. However, this doesn’t apply to all Americans. I also spoke to another team member, Vincent Tavernese. I texted Vin: “What do you think of the European style?” He replied, “Awful!” So I think from that text, we can see that not all Americans agree with these out-of-the-box styles!
On the other hand, being at an American college now for around two months, I have seen many international students who have actually inherited the American dress sense. They have adopted the chilling, comfortable, and relaxed style the Americans seem to share. I also have these days, as do the other internationals I’m guessing, when they feel like just tucking up into trackies (“sweatpants” in English) and a big warm hoodie — especially in these wonderful, harsh winters, or the day after a night out shape-cutting and drinking (water obviously).
But this replication of the internationals’ style doesn’t rub off onto the Americans in the slightest. I haven’t yet seen an American with a similar style to an international student like myself. I have also found it fascinating since I came here, the diversity of styles one campus can have. For me, this is the beauty of college. I am witness to so many different ways of living, dressing and different values people live, and this really does reflect in what people wear and how they dress. It is so refreshing to see so many different personalities each day instead of seeing a generic dress code that people follow! Go out and have a day or two of trying out a different style, see and feel what it looks like to be in a different outfit. See it as Post Pride, but instead of the green and gold colors, a pair of loafers, a buttoned-down collar and some skinny jeans, or the conventional, multicolored smash-up!

Imagine you’re a student who attends college, but there are other people around you; some who’ve been arrested before, or who’ve committed crimes in the past. Would you ignore that person, only recognizing them as a criminal? Or would you give them the benefit of the doubt, a second chance? Recent studies show that colleges and universities are overlooking prior criminal records.
The Center for Community Alternatives (CCA) is a nonprofit group “whose mission is to promote re-integrative justice, and reduce society’s reliance on incarceration.” An article published by CCA on Nov. 8, reads, “College Admissions Now Look at Criminal Records.” In the article, some key studies show that, “66% of the responding colleges collect criminal justice information, although not all of them consider it in their admissions process.”
Other statistics include that, “A sizable minority (38%) of the responding schools does not collect or use criminal justice information and those schools do not report that their campuses are less safe as a result.”
Another article on Truthout (Truth-out.org) by Levi LaChappelle, on Oct. 8, states a current challenge that many college students face. “It is worth considering how many promising individuals have been discouraged or disadvantaged in the college admissions process because of their criminal record,” LaChappelle said. He elaborated, saying that, “65 million Americans now have a misdemeanor or felony conviction; the number of individuals with a criminal record who have considered applying to college is probably no paltry sum.”
With the thought of criminal records being tried in the process of college admissions, what do students of LIU Post think?
“Information should [not] be required unless it’s been within one year of enrollment,” Mike Nicosia, a sophomore Accounting major, said. “Judging a kid on doing something when he was 13 or 14 will not reflect his or her character when they are enrolling for college.”
Meanwhile, Josh Levine, a junior Psychology major, believes that, “Anyone who wants a higher education should be able to attain it; however, if [that] person has a charge of murder for example, or something of violence, then it should be provided just as a safety precaution.”
Levine believes that reviewing prior criminal records could help prevent any further issues. “The combination of things that could be done would keep students and teachers out of harms way,” she said.
As for Nicosia, he thinks, “Transfer students should be required to provide this information.”
Should universities overlook students’ criminal records? Let us know your thoughts on liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

Alexandra Zampelli, a senior Fine Arts major, is holding her senior thesis exhibition in the SAL Gallery in Hillwood Commons from Nov. 17 through the 23. Her show, “Anthony St.,” is based on street art, inspired by the likes of Banksy, and Shepard Fairey, who is known for his OBEY sticker campaign. Zampelli is from Queens, which is where a lot of her influence and interest in street art comes from.
The artwork itself is spray painted on wood, diamond plate steel, and paper. “I found some old photos after my grandfather died, and figured these were too good to waste,” Zampelli said. She took the photos and made them into stencils for spray-painting through Photoshop and “days of exacto-knifing” them into stencils.
“The pictures are of my family. Not portraits, but more like moments,” she said. The snapshots include her grandparents and parents, including pictures from the army, a simple shot of someone enjoying a beer, and even the family cat.
Zampelli intends to make the space for her show feel like a street corner. “I made a fence, and I’ll have cones and old garbage cans I spray painted to make it look like a street corner in Manhattan or Brooklyn,” she said. “I also have posters like the ones you see around the city. Using wheat paste, I’ve pasted the ‘posters’ on boards full of graffiti that I’ll have against the walls.”
Zampelli says graffiti and street art are her favorite medium. “I believe the most controversial form of art is graffiti because of the people and places with which it’s associated. I’m intrigued by the controversy, technique and the way this art form is perceived,” she writes in her statement, presented by the artist at the exhibition, explaining the goal and thought behind her artwork.
After she has finished her education at Post (she’s due to graduate in May 2015), Zampelli plans to teach art in high school. The reception for her exhibit will be held in the SAL Gallery from 5:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 19.

LIU Post class of ‘72 alumnus, Lynn Roseman Carr, self- published a book titled “Shouldn’t Dating Be Easier?” this past August. This is the first book written by Carr, who was born and raised in Jericho, Long Island, and currently lives in Pennsylvania. The book compiles interviews conducted by Carr, searching to answer questions regarding the difficulty of modern dating, and what defines a relationship.
After graduating from LIU Post, Carr began working as a reading teacher in Philadelphia, Penn., but quickly realized her passion for writing and decided to leave teaching in order to write her first book. She was inspired to ask the question, “Why should dating be so hard?” while she was perusing miscellaneous bars and events in her new hometown of Philly. Carr decided to use this inspiration as the beginning of a quest to find out why dating is so difficult for all ages.
The writer went to different clubs and bars to conduct over 4,000 interviews with men ages 21 to 90. With composition book in hand, she began her interviews, never recording names or exact locations of the interviewees to maintain their privacy.
Carr has received great publicity for her book. The book gained ground when it was featured on the radio station Heat 100 in Philadelphia, and at book signings in department stores and boutiques within the state. She has not done any publicity in New York thus far, but plans to in the near future.
“Shouldn’t Dating Be Easier?” is for adults of all ages, whether it be a woman in her mid-20s, or men who just want to see a different perspective on dating. Carr’s demographic covers just about anyone and everyone who is interested in learning the tricks of the trade when it comes to dating and relationships.
The book is not just about dating and why it is such a struggle in general; it also contains stories of how couples met. All of the testimonials in her book are from people whom she interviewed. The last three chapters of the book deal with different types of relationships; meeting at work, through friends, or by chance. Most of the stories are of people who met completely serendipitously.
One chapter in the book, called “Warnings,” is dedicated to advising both guys and girls about the dating “do’s and don’ts,” such as making a date like an interrogation—no one wants to be questioned on the first date!
Carr is her own publicist, and plans on doing a lecture series on online dating with Gayle Crist, the author of “How I Met My Second Husband Online At Age 50.” The lecture, which will be held in Philadelphia, will be $28 per person and will feature a two-part lecture series, led by both Crist and Carr, answering questions and offering dating advice to the masses. There will also be an opportunity to purchase both of their books.
As for some inspiration on dating, Carr said, “Smiling is the most important thing, be the best you can be for you, and the guy you are meant to be with will come. This book isn’t just about flirting, it is about a strategy for how to start, develop, and maintain a relationship.” Carr’s book is available online at her website www.shouldntdatingbeeasier.com for $10.

To promote the film “Horrible Bosses 2,” Warner Brothers held a conference call on Nov. 10 with universities across the country to talk to actors Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis. Warner Brothers’ press allowed students to ask questions regarding the film.
“Horrible Bosses,” released in 2011, was a critical and financial success with both solid ratings and high box office profits, leading Warner Brothers to make a sequel. The movie-going community, however, is skeptical of how good a sequel can possibly be after the success of the first film.
“I think they’ll really like it,” said Day. “People will be skeptical, but I think they’ll like it. If a studio makes money, they want to make a sequel. It’s a business. We had a lot of conversations about what it could be. Creatively, we took it to a place [where] it could have made sense.” “I genuinely liked it more than the first. I’m feeling good. It’s every bit as funny as the first,” added Bateman. The actor added that all of the material in the “Bosses” sequel is new. “We had a good time trying to make people laugh. We didn’t want to repeat ourselves,” Sudeikis said.
“Horrible Bosses 2” sees Nick (Bateman), Dale (Day), and Kurt (Sudeikis) going into business for themselves. The story steers away from the plotline where the trio tries to kill their horrible bosses. Now,it’s their turn to be the horrible boss. After a faulty deal with an entrepreneur and his father, the trio is without legal representation and in great amounts of debt. They kidnap the entrepreneur and attempt to use the ransom money to pay their dues.
While one may view this plot as something of a sitcom version of “Fargo,” in terms of a comical kidnapping gone wrong, director/co- writer Sean Anders and co-writer John Morris worked as a creative duo to help create a different, more appropriate, and original style.
Sudeikis was extremely happy with the work of Anders and Morris. “They’re two of the best comedy writers. They did a great job with ‘We’re the Millers,’ especially with this whole part in the middle [of ‘Horrible Bosses 2’] that feels like Fincher’s ‘Fight Club’ or [a part of a] Soderbergh [film].” Bold words for a comedy, but Day assured it was stylistic when it needed to be, and made sense on film. “It’s great to work with such people,” concluded Day. “It’s great people wanted to be in the sequel after seeing and hearing about the first. I’m so, so grateful.” “Horrible Bosses 2” will be released nationwide on Nov. 26. “We hope you enjoy it. It’s a fun film,” said Sudeikis.

On Nov. 4 – 9, Nassau Coliseum featured Disney’s “Frozen on Ice,” an ice show inspired by the popular animated Disney film “Frozen” (2013). This Disney show has something for everyone, even college students.
The Disney movie features the strong bond between two sisters — Queen Elsa and Princess Anna. After Elsa’s secret is revealed and she runs away from the kingdom, Anna goes on a quest to find her. Along the way, she meets a handsome ice salesman named Kristoff, his reindeer, Sven, and a talking snowman named Olaf. On the quest, Anna attempts to save her sister from herself, since Elsa cannot control her powers.
The ice show followed the movie closely, with only a few things left out or altered. The show left out the fact that Anna and Elsa’s parents were killed in a storm while on naval journey across the sea. Also, the ice show did not include the scene in which their parents brought Anna and Elsa to a community of trolls to erase Anna’s memory of Elsa’s magic, and to teach Elsa how to control her powers. Unless you saw the movie, you would be unaware of the fact that a young Kristoff actually witnessed the royal family in the troll community.
The ice show did, however, have all of the necessary plot twists, along with costumes and props that closely resembled the movie, had it not been animated. Elsa had her signature snow gown and white hair, Anna had her princess gown, and Kristoff was dressed in warm winter clothing, as an ice businessman would be. The ice show even used a giant inflatable replica of the snow monster, more commonly known as Marshmallow, which Elsa creates to keep Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away from her palace.
The set was incredible, as well; lighting played a major role in the show, which worked to highlight the characters’ skating routines. Snowflakes lit the entire area during the scenes, and the ice show made use of special effects and props. During multiple parts of the show, it “snows,” covering the stage with snowflakes. For the troll scene, moss covered balls were rolled around stage. The characters of Sven and Olaf were giant props themselves – Olaf was played by a man in a giant snowman costume, and Sven was played by two people in a reindeer suit.
Overall, it was an incredible show that I would definitely recommend seeing. The show will be performed at the Prudential Center in New Jersey on Nov. 19 through the 23. Tickets start at $38, and can be purchased at www.ticketmaster.com.

On Saturday, Nov. 15, the men’s basketball team (0-2) opened up their 2014-15 campaign with a 62-71 loss against Franklin Pierce (1-1) on day one of the LIU Post Tip-Off Tournament at Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y.
Up 11-9 just over four minutes into the game, the Pioneers went on a quick 7-0 spurt to widen their advantage to 18-9 with just over 14 minutes remaining in the half. Senior forward Charles McCann scored the first four points of the run while senior guard P.J. Torres capped it off with a lay-up. The Ravens fought back, though, cutting the deficit to 25-20 before a 10-0 burst by LIU made it a 36-20 game at the 2:01 mark. Senior guard Isiah Stokley accounted for seven of the points while sophomore forward Greg Dotson provided the energy with a one-handed stuff.
At halftime, the Pioneers held a 36-28 advantage, mainly because of their ability to get good shot opportunities. Stokley led the Green and Gold at that point with 11 points. The Ravens opened up the second half strong and went on a 20-4 run over a seven-minute stretch to go in front 48-42. The Pioneers re-gained the lead on a Torres lay-up, but the Ravens prowess from beyond the arc was too much to overcome. The visitors shot 7-13 from downtown in the half and willed their way to the nine-point victory.
Torres played an all-around great game, finishing with 17 points and 10 boards to go along with five assists and two blocks. Not to be outdone, Stokley dropped 14 points and snagged nine boards while McCann tallied 13 points.
The Pioneers returned to action on Sunday, Nov. 16 when they welcomed American International (2-0) to Brookville, N.Y. The Yellow Jackets were led by senior guard Bobby Harris and senior forward Marcus Porter who each had 20+ points in the double-digit victory.
The first half was tightly contested, as neither side was able to grab the upper hand. Both teams played relatively even basketball throughout the half and it translated to the scoreboard, as the Pioneers held a slim 28-27 advantage at the break. The Lions came out of the break strong and dominated the game in every facet, outscoring the hosts 50-35 in the second half. The Lions shot 44 percent from the field and were hot from three-point land, as they shot close to 60 percent for the match.
The Pioneers were led by Dotson who had 18 points, grabbed eight boards, and rejected two shots. Junior guard Akosa Maduegbunam had 17 points to go along with two steals. Head coach Erik Smiles hit the hardwood again today when the play Bloomfield College. Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at Pratt Recreation Center.
After dropping their season opener to Adelphi University, the women’s basketball team (1-1) squeaked past the Setters from Pace University (1-1) on Saturday, Nov. 15 in Garden City, N.Y.
The Pioneers dominated the paint, outscoring the Setters 34-16 down low. The hosts started out strong, grabbing a quick 8-0 lead, but Pace regained their composure and evened up the score at 13 at the 10:41 mark. After a jumper by freshman guard Jasmine Bailey put the Pioneers up two, Pace went on 19-10 run to take a 32-25 lead into halftime. The Green and Gold were led by senior guard Chelsea Williams, who had 14 points.
The Pioneers kept the game close throughout the entire second half, but were finally able to leap-frog the Setters and gain the lead with just over five minutes left on a pair of free-throws from Williams. After a jump shot from junior forward Nyasia Davis pushed the lead to 58- 55, the LIU defense came up big with some stops down the stretch to preserve the first victory of the season. Junior guard Quanisha Ratley finished with 10 points and two assists while senior guard Ashley Castle added nine points and grabbed eight rebounds. Williams led all scorers with 29 points.
Head coach Deirdre Moore and the Pioneers return to action today for their home opener against the Huskies from Bloomfield College. Tipoff is scheduled for 5 p.m.

On Friday, Nov. 14, the women’s soccer team overwhelmed Assumption College in the first round of the NCAA Division II Championships in Albany, N.Y. Two days later though, they did not have the margins on their side, as they suffered a loss to first-seeded Saint Rose in overtime.
On Friday, the Pioneers took the lead in the latter stanza of the first half when junior midfielder Morgan Miller found the target from close range after a scramble. LIU Post stayed disciplined and made the most of their chances for the rest of the first half, as they had seven shots on goal and a dominant possession percentage. The Greyhounds only hit the target once.
In the second half, the Greyhounds came out strong, looking to even out the score, but the Pioneers responded with a quick goal. Senior forward Lauren Bellone found the unaccounted for sophomore forward Julia Backman on the left peak of the 18-yard box, and Backman found a gap to pass it in between the outstretched arms of the Greyhound keeper.
The goal forced Assumption to scale up the aggression. They outshot the Pioneers in the second half, but sophomore goalkeeper Hrafnhildur Agnarsdottir kept her gloves warm and the net untouched to record a clean sheet.
On Sunday, Nov. 16, the Pioneers returned to action against first- seeded Saint Rose for the second round of the NCAA Tournament. LIU Post continued its offensive stride and started off the scoring to put the home favorites under early pressure. Junior forward Susanne Vistnes dribbled through the defense before smashing the ball with her left foot from the 18-yard box into the lower right corner — making it her 19th goal of the season.
The Pioneers looked to be taking the lead into half time, but with less than a minute to go, a free kick out on the left wing found Saint Rose senior forward Carmelina Poupola who managed to get the ball just over the line to even out the score.
The scoreboard shone 1-1 even after full time, even though the Pioneers scored one at the end of the second stanza; the referee called a foul against the guests just as the ball hit the net, and the battle had to face overtime. Both teams had chances to kill the game, and it was Saint Rose that drew the longest straw. With only seconds left of the first overtime period, the hosts cooked up the winning recipe. A cross into the box found Poupola who scored again to make it 2-1.
“We got robbed on our goal just before they scored,” Agnarsdottir said, disappointed that the close ending did not favor the Green and Gold. Overall, however, the Pioneers have successfully finished the season with a 15-3-1 record, and qualified for the National Championships — said to be their main goal before the season.

The men’s soccer team (15-4-2) took on the NYIT Bears (14-3-1) in the first round of the 2014 NCAA Division II Men’s Soccer Championship on Thursday, Nov. 13, at Manchester, New Hampshire. The Pioneers, looking for revenge against the Bears who ended their winning streak a week ago in the East Coast Conference final, rebounded with an impressive 2-0 win.
The fifth-seeded Pioneers got the scoring started in the 13th minute of the contest. Junior midfielder Per Forgaard sent a cross to fellow junior midfielder Matias Ruiz and the combination worked perfectly, as Ruiz was able to find the back of the net to give the Pioneers the one-goal advantage. The Pioneers went into halftime with the 1-0 lead, as both sides picked up the defensive intensity.
As the second half rolled around, it was clear that the Pioneers were the clear aggressors, outshooting the Bears and being more accurate on their shots. LIU had six shots on goal compared to just one for the Bears. In the 74th minute, the duo of Ruiz and Forgaard teamed up again. This time, Ruiz sent the cross to Forgaard and he connected for the goal with a beautiful bicycle kick. That was all the offense the Pioneers needed, as the Green and Gold closed out the 2-0 victory. Junior goal keeper Jesper Malmstrom kept the opposition off the scoreboard for another shutout.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Nov. 15, when they took on the No. One ranked Penmen from Southern New Hampshire University (17-1-2). The Pioneers, who showed perseverance all match, came up clutch in the closing minutes of the contest.
The Penmen came out of the gate strong, and capitalized in the 13th minute when junior back Dominic Samuel scored off a free kick. With momentum on their side, SNHU scaled up the aggression and put another shot in the back of the net. The Penmen took their two-goal lead into halftime.
Well into the second half and still down by two goals, the Pioneers needed a spark. They got one in the 89th minute; senior forward Eivind Austboe notched his 16th goal of the season off a scramble in front of the net to keep hopes of a win alive. With less than 30 seconds before the final whistle, Forgaard crossed the ball into the box where freshman forward and ECC Rookie of the Year Jason Lampkin cleaned up the mess and tied the match with a one-timer that beat junior goalie Dom DiMaggio. The two teams took a brief break and hit the field again for overtime.
In the overtime periods, both teams had their opportunities, but neither team was able to come through with a goal so penalty kicks were going to decide the winner. After Austboe gave LIU a 1-0 lead, Malmstrom stopped junior back Jonathon Lupinelli’s attempt. Over the next two rounds, the Penmen took a 2-1 lead as DiMaggio stopped back- to-back attempts.
After both squads converted in the fourth round, junior midfielder Alex Billington tied the shootout at three. With the match on the line on the ensuing kick, Malmstrom stood strong and came up with the save to keep the shootout going—and the Pioneer season alive. The Pioneers led off each of
the next three rounds with successful chances, and clinched the hard-fought victory when graduate back Callium Williams clanked his shot off the crossbar in the eighth round.
Head coach Andreas Lindberg and the Pioneers will hit the road to face Merrimack College in the East Regional Final on Thursday, Nov. 20, with kick-off slated for 7 p.m.
