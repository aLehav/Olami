On Sunday, Feb. 12, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in the Super Bowl. The 2022-23 National Football League (NFL) is in the books, and it didn’t come without its fair share of twists and turns. When the regular season ended on Jan. 8, many were caught off guard by which teams made the playoffs.  
Some teams like the Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City Chiefs, San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills breezed their way into the top seeds in the playoffs, while some teams came out of nowhere to sneak in. In the NFC, the New York Giants and Seattle Seahawks got into the dance in the final weeks while it came down to the last week for the AFC’s lowest seed. 
The Jacksonville Jaguars went on a tear to end the season, ripping off five straight wins on their way to a division title. Meanwhile, the Ravens and Dolphins, who were leading their divisions earlier in the season, limped into the playoffs with backup quarterbacks. With the injuries surrounding these teams, a lot of people were surprised that they made it into the postseason. 
Among them is junior broadcasting major Brendan Kaufman, who thought other teams would take advantage of the struggles of Miami and get the seventh seed. 
“I think the Dolphins definitely should not have made the playoffs. After Tua went down, they weren’t much of a team at all,” Kaufman said. “I was also surprised that Seattle made the playoffs because they also skidded towards the end after a pretty strong start.” 
Broadcasting alumni Ryan Boettcher had a similar view on the matter.
 “The Dolphins were a surprise to make the playoffs because the Patriots and Raiders had a chance to make it, and the Dolphins were playing with Skylar Thompson,” he said.
Once the playoffs began, it was anyone’s game, and the Wild Card round proved it. While some games went as expected, all of the games were exciting. The highlight games were the Jaguars erasing a 27-point deficit to stun the Chargers and the Giants pulling off an upset win against the Vikings. 
Boettcher felt it was impressive what the Giants and 49ers accomplished this year despite their uncertainties.
 “I was surprised by the Giants vs. Vikings outcome because I thought the Giants didn’t really have any weapons on offense,” he said. “Also, what Brock Purdy was able to do as a rookie, leading the 49ers to the NFC Championship, was surprising.” 
On the other hand, Kaufman anticipated most of the outcomes. 
“I was surprised that the Dolphins played the Bills so close even though Buffalo won, but other than that, nothing really surprised me,” he said. 
Leading up to the big game in Glendale, Arizona, the refereeing was a topic of conversation around the country. After a few questionable calls throughout the postseason, including a late hit call that sent the Chiefs to the Super Bowl to face the Eagles, many were fed up with the officiating. 
Kaufman believes that the officials have played too much of a role in deciding the outcome of games. 
“Sometimes they miss things. Sometimes they call things they normally would not call, but then they do. Sometimes they don’t call things they normally would. It has not been good, but that is how it’s been for the last few seasons,” he said.
Boettcher disagrees with this sentiment and believes the refs have been fair to both sides this postseason.
“Honestly, I actually didn’t hate the referees. Especially with the Super Bowl, they were both clear and obvious penalties. Both teams were getting equal calls, and I have no issue with it,” he said.
This came after some controversial plays in the Super Bowl, which helped the Chiefs get a 38-35 victory over the Eagles. 
Plays that drew the attention of many fans included a possible DeVonta Smith catch getting called back, a Nick Bolton scoop and score getting called back and the most crucial play was a holding call against Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry on Kansas City wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster on the final drive. 
This set up kicker Harrison Butker for a game-winning 27-yard field goal to secure the Vince Lombardi trophy. This thriller is already being considered by many to be one of the greatest Super Bowls of all time. 
Boettcher, who works at CBS Sports Radio, talked about his take on air the week leading up to the big game.
“I predicted on the radio that the Chiefs would win,” Boettcher said. “I was sweating a ton because I thought the Eagles were in control for most of the game.” 
Both agreed that Mahomes should have been the MVP of the game, but if it wasn’t for one play, another Chief could have won it. 
“I was not surprised that Mahomes won MVP, although I think Nick Bolton would have won it if that other fumble recovery for a touchdown counted,” said Kaufman. 
In a game that showcased the future of the NFL, the quarterbacks put on a show. 
“I believe Mahomes is already a lock for the Hall of Fame, honestly. What he has done with the little time he has had is incredible,” Kaufman said. “I think Jalen Hurts will bounce back from this, and I don’t think he will regress, but I’m not sure if the team will make it back to the big game again.” 
The quarterbacks were not the only ones with their legacies on the line, as Chiefs coach Andy Reid, formerly coach of the Eagles, and current Eagles coach Nick Sirianni are at different points in their careers. 
“I feel like Sirianni made leaps and bounds with the talent he has, and he made a great culture to which the Eagles should be a powerhouse for the next three or four years,” said Boettcher. “For Andy Reid, I don’t think you can ask much more from him. He has been one of the best coaches in the NFL for the last 10 to 15 years, and this Super Bowl victory seals him as a Hall of Famer easily.”  
While Reid is coaching some of the best talent in the league, it is undeniable that he has one of the best football minds. 
“Granted he has Mahomes, but what he has been able to do with the defense, special teams and play-calling has been amazing,” Boettcher said. “He outcoached Sirianni so much that the injuries and the talent difference we saw between the teams didn’t matter.” 
It will be hard for the NFL to top the excitement that the 2022 season brought, but the future looks bright for the league. With many teams seemingly becoming playoff contenders, it should make for an interesting free agency and draft.

On Thursday, Feb. 9, at 3 p.m., the NBA trade deadline came to a close. This deadline saw the Brooklyn Nets rebuild following trading away their superstar talent in Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. 
Irving was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on Feb. 6, one day after he requested a trade from the team. Brooklyn received Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 2027 second-round pick, as well as 2029 first and second-round picks. Dinwiddie previously played for the Nets from 2016 to 2020. With Kyrie gone, the Nets sent Kevin Durant to his requested location in the Phoenix Suns along with T.J. Warren in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder and four first-round picks alternating years from 2023-29. 
With Irving set to become a free agent at the end of this season, the trade came as no surprise, considering Irving has been at the center of controversy in recent years. Irving was one of few NBA players who refused the COVID-19 vaccination, making him ineligible to play a majority of last year in home games due to strict city-wide vaccine requirements for sporting events. He also missed a portion of this season after a suspension from the team following his promotion of a movie deemed antisemitic on his personal Instagram. 
With Durant under team control for the next three seasons, the blockbuster move before the deadline confirmed the Nets’ desires to rebuild after the nightmare outcome of trading their superstar trio of Durant, Irving and James Harden, who they sent to Philadelphia at the deadline last year. 
Travis Demers, a class of 2003 alumni of LIU Post, who has been the play-by-play voice of the Portland Trail Blazers radio since 2018, expressed his belief that the Kyrie Irving trade made sense for both sides in an interview with WCWP. 
“With Kyrie, I think we all expected it. Eventually, he was gonna get traded, and to see him go to Dallas, it makes perfect sense. They need another superstar next to Luca Doncic. That team wasn’t going anywhere. They add Kyrie Irving, and that team is significantly better now,” he said. “Brooklyn is getting back Spencer Dinwiddie, a guy they’ve had before. They know he’s a good starter/role player, while Finney Smith is a really good defensive player. He can shoot the three, so I think that was a good move there.”
However, Demers was surprised about the move with Durant.
“I saw the news come through that Kevin Durant was traded to Phoenix, and that was shocking, not just the fact that Kevin Durant goes to Phoenix. The Suns didn’t have to give up Deandrae Ayton, so they still have Booker and Chris Paul, now Kevin Durant. They gave up Bridges, who a lot of teams wanted. I love Michael Bridges and Cam Johnson, who has been hurt, and I know they probably wanted to move on from him. Crowder was gonna go anyway,” he said. “I was shocked that that deal came out the way it did. I’m sure there are a lot of people that woke up on the East Coast shocked to find out that in the middle of the night, Kevin Durant was traded. I was one of those people 100 percent. All the reports were looking like the Nets were going to hold on to KD at least until the end of the season. That was not the case.” 
In an interview with WCWP, Producer and anchor at CBS Sports Radio and WFAN, Shaun Morash, showed his frustration with the Kevin Durant trade.
“It’s hard to say they won when you got a real star to come to you, and you had the control over him for the next three years in Kevin Durant. I don’t blame them for taking a swing at these two guys,” he said. “Kyrie was clearly the bigger head case, but the idea that you basically just handed over Kevin Durant to start over, you need to hope one of the homegrown guys you hold on to or Michael Bridges is that good a player. You’re going to need some combo of three really good players to become a finals contender, which is what you were with Kevin Durant.”
The Nets are currently sitting at 33-24 and are 5th seed in the Eastern Conference. Only time will tell how the Nets adjust following the loss of their superstar talent and whether they have a team competitive enough to compete in the NBA playoffs this year.

Starbucks is the largest coffeehouse chain in the world and dominates the beverage, breakfast and lunch industry. In recent years, like many other large corporations, Starbucks has faced many struggles due to numerous social, political, financial and economic factors.
COVID-19 was the onset of the company’s current issues, costing the company around $3 billion. Starbucks’ stock (SBUX) dropped from $114 a share to $75. During the height of the pandemic, numerous stores temporarily closed or had reduced hours for the safety of their employees. Over 15 stores in America permanently closed. Strict lockdown measures in China contributed significantly to the decrease in the company’s sales. China has a rapidly growing number of Starbucks locations. Almost all of these were shut down, drastically reducing the number of international sales.
Many Starbucks employees were driven to despair by the pandemic. As a result, more than 250 stores unionized and advocated for better working conditions and livable wages. The first store to form a union was in upstate NY. In an unfair labor practice complaint filed in Buffalo, NY, the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board accused Starbucks of 29 violations. The company had charges of 200 violations of the National Labor Relations Act. This occurrence encouraged other employees across the country to follow suit and unionize and boycott.
Though Starbucks employees aren’t on the front lines fighting viruses, their jobs can be stressful and challenging. Despite being considered partners by the company, minimum wage workers claim they aren’t treated accordingly. College students make up the majority of employees, many of whom are overworked and underpaid. They have limited control over their work schedules, so they sometimes have to work long hours at times that are not convenient for them. Since the summer of 2022, Starbucks has had an in-store traffic problem. Stores started to receive an accumulation of orders in a short time. Employees have to act quickly to compensate for the low number of staff. Online, images of drinks and brown Starbucks food bags crowding the pickup counters at Starbucks circulate on various social media platforms. The low staff is due to many employees being fired for unionizing. Many employees also walked out of stores as a protest against management.
Freshman biology major Habiba M started working at Starbucks in June 2022, prior to the pandemic. 
“ After the pandemic, the state of New York issued new mandatory Health laws that staff has to follow. Starbucks has always been strict with cleanliness. So, there wasn’t anything I had to get used to.  You always wash your hands before you go on the floor and constantly wipe/sanitize the counters where we make the beverages, also we check the lobby and make sure everything is neat. Something that changed because of Covid is that we don’t put milk, cinnamon, and sugar in the lobby because it increases the chance of disease spreading as people will touch the same objects. Instead, when they ask for a specific amount we give it to them on the side in a short cup. The Hardest part of my job, which doesn’t really happen that often, is when a customer is rude to us, which can get uncomfortable sometimes but Starbucks allows you to walk away if you can’t handle the situation, let someone else handle it or if it gets very unsafe, you can file an incident report. The majority of my customers are very nice. My favorite part in my job is when I craft beverages, hand them to the customers and see them loving their beverage especially when they leave a compliment about how it tastes so good. Overall working, I love my job at Starbucks but if I could change one thing it would be more pay during rush hours. ”  
Starbucks is notorious for being more expensive than its competitors. Their prices are much higher on average than Dunkin’ Donuts and Tim Horton’s. Around February 2022, Starbucks raised the prices of its products. The company claimed that it was due to inflation, increased costs of commodities, and labor costs. As many other food chains adjusted their pricing to correlate with the mass inflation of products, this isn’t surprising. The company’s CEO, Kevin Johnson, told investors that the company plans to raise its costs in the future. Consumers are able to turn a blind eye to expensive Starbucks products. However, people are starting to question if it is worth the investment. Many argue that they can easily be replicated by other companies for a lower price. Other companies already offer products that are almost identical to what’s available at Starbucks. The food and drinks at Starbucks could also be made at home. There’s been a surge in “copycat” Starbucks recipes online that provide affordable recipes for Starbucks drinks and food. However, the convenience of buying your coffee and not making it on your own is part of the appeal.
Despite its reputation as a coffee shop, many argue that Starbucks today is most notable for its sugary non-coffee beverages such as matcha, chai and refreshers. Long-time Starbucks buyers have expressed concerns about the company as it moves away from its traditional coffee and breakfast niche and offers more complicated items. People miss the old Starbucks. Several in-demand and popular products have been recalled, including double shot espresso drinks. The beloved espresso drinks were pulled from the menu after it was revealed that the drinks were contaminated with foreign materials. The drinks were conveniently available in cans in retail stores, as well as regularly at Starbucks. A poll done by the food publication, Mashed, revealed that many coffee drinkers didn’t like the newly introduced holiday drinks at Starbucks. The new sugar cookie almond milk latte was not well received by some consumers. Many complained it wasn’t as good as other non-dairy drinks and had an unfavorable taste.
Starbucks announced that it would be making changes to its Rewards Loyalty program through an email sent to members in December 2022. Through the Rewards Loyalty Program, members can earn free items and receive discounts by collecting stars with each purchase. Each dollar spent at Starbucks translates into one star when members pay through the app. The value of the stars members earn through their purchases will be increasing. Fifty stars will have a value of 100 stars, 150 stars will have a value of 200 stars, and 200 stars will have a value of 300 stars. Members will have to spend more money to earn more stars. The changes will take effect on Feb. 13, 2023. Many people took to social media to express their disapproval of the changes. Many accused the company of trying to rip them off & make college students, a large fraction of their demographic, go further into debt.
It’s not too late for the company to change its trajectory. If the company listens to its employees and customers and takes an open-minded approach to development, it can overcome its weaknesses.

It can be challenging to differentiate fact from misinformation when it comes to supplements because there is so much hype surrounding their alleged benefits. While vitamins and minerals are crucial for good health, consuming them as pills, capsules or powders is not necessary.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a statement that there is insufficient evidence to support the notion that taking supplemental vitamins and minerals can prevent cancer, cardiovascular disease or mortality. 
Considering the underwhelming research, it might be worthwhile to consider whether taking vitamins on a routine basis is necessary.
“In some cases, yes they are,” Post nutritionist intern Anthony Hannold said. “Doing something like getting a Vitamin D check or B12 and folate are typical vitamin samples that a doctor will check on your yearly visit because those are typical deficiencies a person could have. They [vitamins] are necessary in certain situations.”
Junior nutrition and dietetics major Arianna Stolz takes multivitamins every day, but agreed with Hannold.
“Personally, I take a multivitamin that has all of our essential vitamins and minerals, just to give me that safety net to make sure I am getting what I need,” Stolz said. “However, vitamins and supplements are not really necessary. This is not acknowledging specific health issues which may require them and can just be expensive.” 
Although vitamins and supplements are widely used, their lack of FDA approval raises questions regarding the safety and effectiveness of these items. 
“It’s always good to check with a medical professional and do your own research rather than taking a vitamin because you feel like you should be. There’s an appropriate amount to use and that’s what you should strive for,” Post nutritionist intern Machaila Byers said. 
TikTok has become an increasingly popular source of inspiration for people looking to improve their health and nutrition in recent years, but it also gives some a platform to offer health hacks that aren’t always reliable. 
Hannold advised looking at a person’s bio to see whether they have the appropriate credentials if you do find yourself questioning the credibility of your favorite TikTok health professional.
“If they have a RD after their name they’re probably pretty reputable. That requires four years of schooling – anatomy, physiology, chemistry, microbiology and then you have to do rotations. Having an RD after their name is something I would look for, that is someone who is highly trained in evidence based practice,” Hannold said. 
Some of Stolz’s favorite influencers who support research-based nutrition evidence are Steph Grasso, Claire Chewning, Diet Culture Rebel, Sofia the RD, Find Food Freedom and Abbey Sharp. 
It could be tempting to try the strawberry-flavored multi-gummy that your favorite influencer has recommended, but you should probably stay clear and search for better options.
“Incorporate a lot of different foods, colors, textures. There’s vitamins and minerals a lot more absorbable by the body when you take them in as whole foods versus a synthetic form which is going to be a supplement. Certainly you can indulge from time to time but you can’t eat fast food three times a day and expect vitamins and supplements to cover your bases,” Byers said. 
Instead of relying on vitamins and supplements, many nutritionists say that people should develop healthy habits that support their physical health and general wellbeing.
“The best way to live this lifestyle is by making it customizable to your life and your needs. Nutrition is very individualized and will look different for everyone,” Stolz said. Campus nutritionists are available to meet with students to discuss nutritional questions and concerns. To schedule an appointment with a nutritionist, email liunutritionist@gmail.com.

Sunday, Feb. 5, was the 65th annual Grammys award ceremony. It’s one of music’s biggest nights. Many records were broken at the ceremony.
In the main categories, Beyoncé broke the record for most wins by any artist in Grammy history, Harry Styles took home album of the year for “Harry’s House,” Lizzo won record of the year and Samara Joy won best new artist and Bonnie Raitt won song of the year. 
The Grammys are not only about winning awards, the live performances are also emphasized. Bad Bunny opened the ceremony, having everyone up from their seats dancing to one of his biggest songs, “Un Verano Sin Ti.” Other performers included Luke Combs, Kacey Kusgraves, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Mick Fleetwood, Migos’ Quavo, Mary J. Blige, Stevie Wonder, Brandi Carlile, Lizzo and Harry Styles. 
Not only did they have talented artists perform but the Recording Academy hosted a celebration of hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. LL Cool J, Big Boi, Busta Rhymes, Spliff Star, De La Soul, DJ Drama, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Missy Elliott, Future, Glorilla, Grandmaster Flash, Grandmaster Mele Mel, Scorpio, Ice-T, Lil Baby, Lil Wayne, the Lox, Method Man, Nelly, Public Enemy, Queen Latifah, Rahiem, Rakim, Run-D.M.C., Salt-N-Pepa, DJ Spinderella, Scarface, Swizz Beatz and Too $hort joined the Grammys in tribute to the genre. They also honored musicians who passed away this year during a separate segment. 
The biggest award of the night is Album of the Year. The nominees were “Voyage” by ABBA, “30” by Adele, “Un Verano Sin Ti” by Bad Bunny, “Harry’s House” by Harry Styles, “Renaissance” by Beyoncé, “Good Morning Gorgeous” by Mary J. Blige, “In These Silent Days” by Brandi Carlile and “Music of the Spheres” by Coldplay. Harry Styles took home the prize. 
Styles was stunned as he heard his name being called and was jumping up and down with the super fan who announced his win. During his speech, he included his fellow nominees, “I’ve been so inspired by every artist in this category with me at a lot of different times in my life. I listen to everyone in this category when I’m alone and I think moments like tonight it’s obviously so important for us to remember that there is no such thing as best in music,” Styles said. 
While many of his fans were ecstatic for Styles’ win, it was a huge upset to many critics and fans who expected Beyoncé to take home the award, especially after her barrier-breaking visual album “Lemonade” lost the same category in 2017. Other fans were rooting for Bad Bunny’s album, “Un Verano Sin Ti” that made history as the first fully Spanish album to be nominated as Album of the Year. 
Fans of Styles shared their joy at his victory in the category.
“I was nervous the entire time I was watching the Grammys. There were so many amazing artists up for Album of the Year but I was so happy when Harry’s name was read off the envelope. He’s worked really hard on this album, touring for almost 2 years now and it’s only his 3rd Grammy. I truly think it was well deserved,” sophomore musical theater major Grace McNally said. 
Beyoncé’s fans, also known as the ‘Beyhive,’ believe that she should have won and that she was robbed of winning. However, on the night, she set the record for most Grammy wins. Since her first win in 2001, she has won a total of 32 Grammy’s. That night, she won four awards: Best Dance/Electronic album, Best Dance Recording, Best Traditional R&B and Best R&B song.
Fans of Beyoncé shared their disappointment and frustration at the decision not to award her with Album of the Year.
“Honestly, what does Beyoncé have to do to win Album of the Year?” senior fashion merchandising major Mikaela Fracsino said. “I love Harry Styles, I’ve been a fan since his One Direction days, but I don’t know. Beyoncé is a musical legend. She didn’t win album of the year last time and “Lemonde” was so good. I just think these award shows are a scam but at least Beyoncé knows that she is the best of the best,” she said. 
Styles’ album, “Harry’s House” was released in 2022 and was at the top of the music charts globally. His music was in commercials, movies, on the radio and on TikTok. He had a highly visible press coverage of his music that Beyoncé’s album couldn’t match. Although “Renaissance” was a long-awaited comeback, she still kept a low profile. 
“I don’t think any of us sit in the studio thinking, making decisions based on what is going to get us one of these,” Styles said during his acceptance speech.
Freshman nutrition major Amanda McCarty shared her agreement with this sentiment.
“I agree with Harry Styles. No one is thinking ‘oh my God, I have to do anything I can to win an award.’ Artists do what they want, what they feel, what they think is special,” she said. “Harry and Beyoncé are both respected artists and it’s hard to tell who is better, but I believe they’re both truly equally amazing.”
The 2023 Grammys ceremony had 12.4 million viewers across the United States, an increase from last year’s numbers.

Justin Roiland was the co-creator of the hit cartoon show, Rick and Morty. The show premiered in 2013 and is now considered one of the best animated shows on television according to  IMDb. The show is about a mad scientist and his grandson who have adventures with space/time, the multiverse and interdimensional travel. The show has been running for six seasons with a total of 61 episodes. 
Before “Rick and Morty,” Roiland created “The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti” which was a parody of “Back to the Future.” This show inspired Roiland to create “Rick and Morty.” He was the character’s voice in the original parody and eventually became the voice of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith, the eponymous characters of the hit show. 
In January 2020, an alleged violent incident occurred between Roiland and a woman he was dating at the time. There has not been much detail revealed to the public, but the criminal complaint was filed in May 2020, and the police arrested Roiland three months later in August. He was released on a $50,000 bond. 
In October, Roiland pleaded not guilty to two felony counts. One of them being domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violent, fraud and/or deceit. If he is found guilty, he faces a potential prison sentence for his actions. There have been multiple court hearings but there is no scheduled date for his trial. There is a restraining order filed against him which specifies that he is not allowed within 100 feet of the victim; this order will last until October 2023. His attorney said a plea deal is on the table.  
Roiland released a statement through his lawyer. 
“It’s hard to overstate how inaccurate the recent media coverage of this situation has been. To be clear, not only is Justin innocent but we also have every expectation that this matter is on course to be dismissed once the District Attorney’s office has completed its methodical review of the evidence. We look forward to clearing Justin’s name and helping him move forward as swiftly as possible,” it read. 
Fans of the show on campus expressed shock and heartbreak at the news.
“It’s honestly so heart wrenching to hear something like this. I love watching Rick and Morty, and the fact that the person behind the characters could do something like this. I don’t know how this managed to stay out of the public eye for almost three years too, like how did I just heard about this,” junior marketing major Lisa Raymond said. 
Abuse is not the only thing Roiland is being accused of. There were many women who came forward with screenshots of inappropriate conversations with Roiland. An example of one conversation was with Roiland and a 16-year-old girl. It was explicit and they discussed sexual exploration. He told her she was “hot” and “jail bait,” he also told her that once she turned 18, she should take up “cam whoring,” which is someone who performs sexual acts online.
Fans of the show were disgusted by these revelations.
“It’s gross,” freshman business administration major Lilian Ferguson said. “He is literally talking to a minor… a grown man having sexual conversations with a 16-year-old girl, it’s sickening. I do hope the show decides to let him go.”  
Since Roiland’s arrest, Adult Swim and “Rick and Morty” released a statement about Roiland’s accusations.
“Adult Swim has ended its association with Justin Roiland. Rick and Morty will continue. The talented and dedicated crew are hard at work on Season 7,” the statement read.  
Fans have taken to Twitter and TikTok expressing their thoughts on how differently the voices of the main characters will be with Roiland and if the show will survive its creativity without him.
“I’m nervous to see how the voices pan out. Each character has such a distinctive voice that I don’t know how someone else can carry that torch,” senior finance major Elijah Stout said. “It’s one of my favorite shows, and I don’t plan on stopping to watch it.” 
Although Roiland may have co-founded the show, there is an entire other founder. The last time Roiland was credited for writing an episode was in 2017. Season seven is in production and fans will have to take the wait-and-see approach.

Pop singer and businesswoman Rihanna made her long-awaited return to the stage, and also subtly announced her second pregnancy while performing at the Super Bowl Halftime show this past Sunday, Feb. 12. 
Prior to her anticipated return, Rihanna was interviewed by Nate Burleson from NFL Total Access, and asked if there were going to be any surprises. She responded by saying “I’m thinking of bringing someone” with a smile. After this subtle hint, and after six long years, Rihanna fans worldwide tuned in this past Sunday, for quite the surprise indeed. Within seconds into her show, a baby bump was revealed to the 118.7 million live viewers, causing fans to rush to Twitter to confirm whether she is pregnant or not. 
To many people’s surprise, as she had just given birth to her son last May, the pregnancy was confirmed by a rep of the singer. Within minutes of her performance, the word “pregnant” was trending on Twitter with more than 40 million tweets, discussing whether or not Rihanna was pregnant.
Besides her shocking pregnancy announcement to fans and viewers of the Super Bowl, the Rihanna put on a captivating 13 minute performance, surprisingly with no special guests. She was accompanied by her couple hundred energized dancers who took over most of the show with their electric dance moves, leaving fans across the continent to jolt out of their seats to dance and sing on the top of their lungs in excitement to hear the hits they’ve played on repeat.
LIU has an abundance of Rihanna fans. Junior business major Serena Chen shared her excitement in advance of the performance
 “I’m counting down the days,” she shared. “I’m overflowing with excitement, honestly, I’ve been a fan for years, since I was in elementary school, “Pon de Replay” is my favorite song since I was a kid and I used to play that song on repeat on my Hello Kitty CD player… I’m just trying to get by this week, so I can enjoy this weekend with my girlfriends; we’re having a special viewing just for the special occasion.”
Another student, sophomore political science major Josh Seamore, also shared their anticipation for the performance. 
“I’m actually really excited, truly, which is strange because I was never really a big fan of Rihanna. But my girlfriend is and now she’s really brainwashed me and I’m not gonna lie she has some hits,” he said. 
Seamore also provided a prediction for the performance.
 “I’d be willing to bet she ends with Diamonds or Stay,” he said.
Senior biology major Kelsey Robins, also a fan of Rihanna, shared her thoughts on the surprises hinted at.
 “I would be shocked if she brought out Drake, they have a lot of hits, but I also know they have some history,” she said. 
Robins refers to the dating history between Rihanna and Drake. They briefly dated back in 2016. 
Robins shared her appreciation of Rihanna’s music and the impact it’s had on her life.
“My favorite Rihanna [song] would have to be “Consideration.” I really relate to the song. During my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time with my friends, so I probably played that song like a million times and it just hits different every single time, it’s just perfect in every way,” she said.
Rihanna opened the performance with her hit song “B*tch Better Have my Money,” as the camera zoomed out, she was displayed 50-60 feet in the air on a platform as the camera gave you a full view of the raised platform.
 The stage set up resembled the stage layout on the retro video game “Super Smash Bros.” Memes about the comparable raised platforms soon emerged, with photoshopped video game characters placed next to the singer. 
After her opening song, the hits kept coming, with songs like “Wild Thoughts,” “Work,” “We Found Love,” and closed with her enchanting love ballad, “Diamonds.” Fans and viewers found the singer’s performance breathtaking. 
After her performance, it was revealed that Rihanna declined being paid for the performance. Past performers have been compensated financially For example The Weeknd was paid $17 million dollars for his time in 2021. Rihanna instead opted for brand exposure within her performance, which seems to have been a smart business tactic as her music streams skyrocketed. According to confirmed sources the singer’s music streams surged more than 640 percent. A mini-ad during her performance for her beauty brand, “Fenty Beauty,” caused web browsing searches for the brand to surge reportedly by 883 percent. It’s not confirmed whether sales have increased for her beauty brand since her performance. 
All the attention has been on Rihanna these past few days, with headline after headline covering the singer and her impact on pop culture. Rihanna sits in second place for most watched Super Bowl Halftime shows, just behind Katy Perry and in front of Lady Gaga.
Though it was only 13 minutes that Rihanna performed, it was a moment that many fans will likely talk about and remember for decades to come. Until the next Rihanna project announcement, fans wait patiently like they did for six years, eager to know what’s next for the singer.

A variety of opportunities emerge for students as the spring semester takes off. Some of these opportunities are upcoming events on campus. 
Promise hosts Mental Health Mondays, where students can discuss the many stressors of college and learn coping strategies and tips. Each Wednesday, Promise holds a trivia night in Sharkbite, during which prizes are given out to the winners. Having a variety of events to choose from makes participating in campus life easy for students. The Center for Healthy Living hosts weekly art therapy workshops for those interested in art. There are various clubs for religions and ethnic backgrounds like the South Asian Student Association (SASA), Brothers and Sisters in Christ (BASIC) and the Jewish Leadership Association (JLA).
Many students want to be involved in college activities and events, but don’t know what to do, or where to start. Sometimes attending your first club meeting or participating in events can be intimidating. Especially if you are a new student, commuter, or introvert. But being around people with similar interests, hobbies, life goals and qualities can lift spirits.
If that’s not enough to encourage students to participate in campus events, consider shark points. Shark points are points you can earn by attending various campus events. They can later be used to get free Post merchandise like lanyards, blankets, shirts, water bottles, drawstring backpacks, and more. Sweatshirts and hoodies cost around $50-$70. A pair of LIU socks cost $15.28 at the bookstore. Therefore, getting LIU merchandise for free is favorable to a lot of students. Many organizations and groups offer Shark Points for attending their events. On Feb. 2, the nutrition club is hosting a welcome-back meeting for new or returning members. Meeting attendees will receive 5 shark points. BASIC is hosting a pizza tabling event in Hillwood Commons on Feb. 1 to raise money, where attendees can get pizza and 15 shark points. The club is raising money in hopes of being able to attend BASICCON, a two-night event in Rochester where they will meet others in BASIC from the state. The student chapter of NAVTA is having a sticker and hat sale at Hillwood Commons on Feb. 6, where students can purchase items and get 20 shark points. The Student Nurses Association is holding its second general meeting of the year via Zoom, where members can receive 25 shark points.
The majority of people at Post don’t know what shark points are. When asked, most students said they might have heard of shark points, but don’t know what they are. There isn’t much information about them online.
 At liu-post.prescence.io, there is a short description of what shark points are, but no details on how to use and redeem them:
“Earn Shark Points for attending campus events! Campus events are worth Shark Points! Earn enough shark Points and you can redeem your Shark Points for Swag like lanyards, drawstring backpacks, water bottles, blankets, t-shirts, and more!”
Many students do not know what shark points are.
“I don’t know that existed, but nice,” freshman biology major Leiel Mulakandov said. 
“I think it’s nice, it doesn’t hurt anyone. My first impression is that it’s a good thing. I just found out about it so I don’t know much. I definitely think it’s a good way to encourage people to go to events. I’d be excited to get a hoodie or at least a discount.
Freshman art major Amora Galara did not know what shark points were either. 
“I probably have a few, but I have never used them and I don’t know how to use them,” she said. “No one really knows about it. I don’t know how to access them at all.”
Shark Points were further discussed by Promise Coach Stephanie Lowe.
“Shark points have always had the intention of getting students involved and engaged through our wide variety of programs year to year, through encouraging attendance among the student body. With the COVID-19 pandemic taking place with the introduction of our Presence platform, we are reimagining this process,” Lowe said.  “We have been working on revamping this point system with new initiatives, prizes, and experiences awarded when students check into not only Promise’s events, but student organization meetings and events as well. We will have more information on these in the coming weeks that we are excited to share with the LIU community.” 
Promise staff is working to increase student involvement on campus this semester. Upon further development, shark points will strengthen the community by bringing students together, but there is not yet a system in place to use them.

The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) will now take you to Grand Central Terminal.
On Wednesday, Jan. 12, the LIRR opened a new terminal at Grand Central. With the train now going to both Penn Station and Grand Central, Long Island residents now have the option to go to the east or the west sides of Manhattan. The LIRR is the only major railroad in the New York City (NYC) metro area to have this option.
However, the train will require a transfer at the Jamaica Station in order to get passengers to Grand Central. There are currently no trains from anywhere in Nassau and Suffolk that will take you straight to Grand Central.  
Being a school on Long Island, Post students tend to be frequent LIRR users in order to get to the city. Although students haven’t tried going to the new terminal at Grand Central, they plan to. 
Sophomore education major Lauren Mathews expressed that she definitely plans to use the new terminal.
“I live in Westchester, not upstate, and my town has a train station and it goes to Grand Central not to Penn Station, so the LIRR now going to Grand Central will be more beneficial and easier if I want to go home for the weekend,” Mathews said. “My friend also goes to Columbia University [located on the upper east side of Manhattan] and that will make it a little more convenient to visit her rather than going to Penn.”
Sophomore business major Ela Kisin plans to use the new terminal soon.
“I’ve actually never been to Grand Central before, but I’m planning to take the LIRR to Grand Central because I’m visiting my friend who goes to West Point Military Academy,” Kisin shared.
Speech therapy graduate student Andrew Detres shared his reasons to use the terminal as well.
“A friend of mine just moved to the area near Grand Central terminal itself so a visit to his new place might give me a more concrete reason to go to that particular location,” he said.  
The Jamaica transfer wasn’t necessarily a deal breaker for students, however, it’s agreed that they would like to see a train from Long Island that goes directly to Grand Central. 
“That would be amazing [to have a train that goes direct] because rather than having to stop and transfer you can go straight [to Grand Central] and it will be easier for everyone,” Kisin expressed. 
However, despite the train station being only a mile apart, Kisin still thinks it’s worth going to Grand Central if you want to end up on the east side.
“The Jamaica transfer doesn’t take too long. I think it just depends on the day and timing of everything, but I would take the transfer to go to Grand Central rather than go to Penn and take the subway,” she said.  
Mathews thinks a bit differently about the Jamaica transfer. 
“I’m not good at trains and it will make it easier to navigate [without the transfer],” Mathews voiced. “Me personally, I think it’s just more of a hassle, so I think people will be more turned off to it. I think in peoples’ heads, including my own, it just seems like more work.”
Now that students have the option to go to Penn Station and Grand Central, which one will they use more?
Detres was a bit on the fence, but ultimately had an answer. 
“That’s a tough one. I would guess that I would be using Penn Station as a preference only because most of the things I can think of that I would do in the city it would be easier to just go out of Penn. Of course, I’m not ruling out the door of that changing in the future,” he added.
Kisin thinks that Grand Central may be more of a preference for her. 
“I think it depends on where I want to go and my agenda. I think that just for timing I would rather go straight to Grand Central just because it’s closer to a lot of my favorite parks like Bryant and Central park,” she said. 
Overall, students feel that having the additional option to get to Grand Central on the LIRR will be beneficial. Whether you want to spend your city day on the east side of Manhattan or travel longer distances, the LIRR will now conveniently take you straight to the NYC station that may fulfill all your travel needs.

On Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2022, voters across the United States headed to the polls to vote in the midterm elections. Some states had Governors elections and/or elections for the U.S. Senate. However, all 435 districts in the U.S. House of Representatives held elections for the two year term from Jan. 3, 2023 to Jan. 3, 2025. 
Due to the population shifts from the 2010 Census to the 2020 Census, states had to redraw their congressional district maps to match the populations. New York’s third congressional district, home to the Post campus, was redistricted, making it become one of the most competitive in the nation. The old third district, which also included Post, was represented by Democrat Tom Suozzi, who retired in 2022.
The election in November was between Republican George Santos and Democrat Robert Zimmerman. Both men campaigned with TV ads, mail flyers and countless lawn signs across the district. When all votes were counted, Santos was deemed the winner receiving 52 percent of the vote, compared to Zimmerman’s 46 percent.
Zimmerman is a Long Island native. He grew up in Great Neck, and now, along with his business partners, operates a business, ZE Creative Communications, in his hometown. 
“We formed [the business] back in 1988, and it’s a strategic communications firm that’s evolved over the years. It started in my apartment at the time, I was living in Jericho, now we are based in Great Neck. I’m very proud of what we’ve accomplished. We have a diversity of clients throughout the Tri-State area…We have engaged in very creative activities that I think have been very defining as the industry evolves,” he said.
Throughout his time as a child, before becoming a small-business owner, Zimmerman dealt with personal struggles of his own. He describes his childhood as a young closeted gay man as “isolating,” and told his story about how an adult he confided in about his sexuality suggested he receive conversion therapy. 
“Growing up as I did in Long Island in the seventies, and coming of age in the mid to late seventies, as a gay kid, it was a very isolating time. Fortunately it’s different now, at least here. In other parts of the country it’s not all that different.The isolation, the bigotry, the prejudice, those are all very real, and the sense of intimidation is very real,” he said. “When I started coming of age, I asked someone I trusted, a retired educator, questions I was having about my life and my sexual orientation, and he said to me ‘there are doctors who can make you feel better, and get you healthy.’” 
Zimmerman became an intern for his congressman at the time, Rep. Lester Wolff (D-N.Y.), and learned firsthand the causes and policies that members of Congress focus on in their day to day job. 
“I saw how relevant government can be for people’s lives…that doesn’t mean big government, but government that is effective,” he said.
Zimmerman first ran for Congress when he was 27-years-old. The race was unsuccessful, which he attributes to Nassau county having a more Republican-friendly voting history at the time. He then had two unsuccessful bids for the New York State Legislature.
“Nassau county was even more Republican then than it is now, and it was a tough race, I didn’t make it for sure. I tried to run for state legislature, those were closer races, but I took it as a mandate to go into the private sector,” he affirmed.
After decades of working in the private sector, Zimmerman decided to make a candidacy for the third district in 2022. He faced four Democrats in the primary, and won the nomination with a little over 35 percent of the vote.
When running for the seat in 2022, Zimmerman reflected on how the hotly contested 2022 New York Governor’s race affected the election. 
“The biggest issue we faced in this election had nothing to do with running for Congress, and that was the greatest frustration. This was an election year defined by the Governor’s race,” he said. 
Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-N.Y.) won the Governor’s race, but by a much smaller margin than former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) won the last one by in 2018, leading many political pundits to conclude that there was a coattail effect from Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), Hochul’s challenger, down to the Republican congressional candidates across the state.
Zeldin won the new third district by 13 points, while President Biden (D) carried it by 11 points in 2020, solidifying the district’s status as a swing district.
Zimmerman has focused on political issues throughout his adult life, including gun safety, protecting the Long Island sound and protecting reproductive freedom.
“I always held those issues very important to me. Standing up for reproductive freedom, gun safety, a safe and secure Israel [and] standing up for small business opportunities, as so many businesses face today,” he said. 
Santos ran his campaign boasting about his NYU education, his work at CitiGroup and Goldman Sachs and his Jewish heritage, all of which turned out to be lies.
After winning the election, many news outlets began to report that Santos lied about much of his life in order to get elected. 
“It’s interesting, the few times I was with him, you spent 10 minutes with the guy you knew nothing added up. This was not a master criminal, this is a sociopath. He only debated me twice, he refused to show up to any other debates. He wouldn’t appear in front of any editorial boards. His whole strategy was just to try to avoid public attention and just focus on working the Republican base and praying for a landslide,” he said.
One of the things Zimmerman campaigned on was calling out Santos for his role in spreading the narrative that the 2020 Presidential election was stolen from former President Donald Trump (R), among other things.
“Despite his lying about it, George Santos was an active supporter of the insurrection movement. He was literally on video tape saying he wrote a check to get the insurrectionists out of jail after they assaulted police officers. Despite the fact that he lied about it, he was for a national ban on abortion. He literally compared abortion to slavery and said women would use rape as an excuse to get an abortion,” he added.
Zimmerman says that he wishes that his campaign had more information, and the time and resources to focus on Santos’ lies during the campaign. After a five-person Democratic primary, Zimmerman said that his campaign had “no money” to use in the general election against Santos, and had to fundraise again.
One lie that Santos told that shocked many in the district and around the country was lying about being Jewish. He said that his grandparents fled Ukraine from persecution, and then survived the Holocaust. The Forward reported that his grandparents were actually born in Brazil, and never lived in Europe during the Holocaust. Santos later said that he claimed to be “Jew-ish” and not fully Jewish. However, in a campaign letter that he sent out, he described himself as a “proud American Jew.” 
The third district has a Jewish population of 13 percent, and many people, including Zimmerman, feel that he lied about being Jewish to get voters in the district to support him. 
After numerous calls to resign from Congress, Santos has stayed. He has said that he will not run for re-election, but his term has almost two of the full two years to go. Zimmerman said that he is not focusing on the next election right now, but he has been focusing on the present. 
“Whatever I can do to overturn this fraud, try to restore faith and trust in our democracy, I’m committed to doing. [We are] building a bi-partisan coalition, and we are on our way to doing that, keeping the public pressure on through speeches, through petitions, through rallies, to make sure not just that George Santos is forced to resign, but making it clear that those Republicans, in Washington and locally, who support him are accomplices to the crime and that we’re gonna call them out for being accomplices to the crime,” he said.
Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-N.Y.) of the neighboring fourth district has called on Santos to resign, along with Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman (R-N.Y.), the Nassau County Republican Party and many other Republicans. 
In the meanwhile, it is uncertain if voters will be heading to the polls for a special election. Zimmerman feels that Santos will hurt Republicans’ image and they will eventually force him out.

As a former Post professor, I’ll miss the Pioneer – but  I welcome the new opportunity for contact with the school where I taught for many years. Good luck to “The Tide” !

In recent months, rumors have spread that the Post campus is considering adding a Friday class, starting in the fall 2023 semester. According to multiple sources, current Monday and Wednesday morning classes will be switched into a Monday, Wednesday, Friday class schedule, making each class 45 minutes each instead of the current 80 minutes. Monday and Wednesday afternoon classes, as well as Tuesday and Thursday classes, are not currently scheduled to change. Common hour will also be shortened to 50 min.
“I first heard of it from one of my professors right before winter break,” junior fine arts major Elisabeth Buckley said. “She likes to tell us what’s going on since we don’t get any updates from the actual school itself. She told us that it would be a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule instead of Monday and Wednesday, and we all are pissed about it. She also mentioned [that] common hour would be shorter and it’s great because we already have trouble getting food with the long lines at Hillwood, any shorter and you won’t be able to get food.”
Students, especially commuters, have expressed their concerns about how adding the extra day may  complicate their  work and study schedules.
“It definitely works against me and a lot of students on campus,” sophomore business administration major Justin Patlias said. “I’m a commuter, so the extra day on campus will make me spend more money on gas. I have to come here on my off day when I usually work. So I’ll be spending more money and also losing a chance to make money with these Friday classes being implemented.”
Students have also mentioned that the reduction of common hour will hinder their ability to conduct certain extracurricular activities on campus.
“I had clubs that I spend time with during common hour, and not having those 90 minutes will severely affect our capabilities of doing stuff because it’s such an easy time for everyone to meet,” Patlias said. “By the time we get lunch, already half an hour is at least gone before we get to meet. So if you are only giving us 20 minutes to meet every day, what’s the point? I study during that time as well, so those 90 minutes are crucial to my learning.  Taking that away is not helping at all.”
Some students speculate the reasons for Post’s administration pushing the change, one possible reason being that administration wants students to spend more time on campus to increase campus life.
“I think it’s going to decrease campus life because common hour is a very lively time,” Patlias said. “A lot of clubs meet, people hang out, people study, etc. It’s really the only time that if you walk around campus there’s other people around. After class time, it’s empty after hours, there’s no one walking around, common hour is the only time where I feel like this school is alive. Then the new Friday classes are gonna make people just want to go home quicker and not hang around. Overall, it’s just going to interfere with socializing on campus.”
“I don’t think they’re giving an actual reason why they’re implementing the change,” Buckley said. “I don’t, there’s a good reason. We all thought it was because they were matching Brooklyn’s schedule but that’s not the case because Brooklyn does not have that schedule.”
A change.org petition was started, which at the time of publishing, has reached 1,183 signatures. Students are not happy with such a change being talked about without being consulted about how it may interfere with their everyday activities.
“I feel like the administration is not listening to the students,” Patlias said. “A lot of students heard rumors last semester about it and we had a petition about it, and I think around a thousand people signed to not have a change and they kind of blatantly ignored it. It really does make the students feel like we have no voice on the campus, that we pay $40,000 a year to go to.”
Students took to the change.org petition to express their thoughts for signing the petition against the change.
“LIU continues to completely disregard the needs of students,” Courtney Smith said in the comments on the petition. “The incident in Post Hall with the lack of security, transparency (and a lockdown) on campus, the failure to follow through with academic programs (the failed PT program which was supposed to come out in 2019), status of on-campus housing and food, disregard for programs such as dance, and egregious costs are just some of the ways that students are ignored. Even further, we hear the complaints of teachers and recognize the discrepancy between professors salaries and one particular school administrator. If LIU cares about maintaining student satisfaction and outcomes, they would ask for feedback on these issues before they sink.”
“Due to my major I am required 14 hours a week in & off campus field work during weekdays,” Ang A also said on the petition. “Having Friday off gives me the opportunity to do so. Therefore, this change would hurt students pursuing degrees such as: teaching, nursing and more where hours are required. Shortening common hour would drastically hurt those who are going to extra help during that time and clubs/organizations who meet/or table during common hour.”
According to the creator of the change.org petition, Peyton LaFrenz, the LIU administration claims that they cannot verify that signatures on the website are real students. 
The Student Government Association (SGA) recently put flyers around campus encouraging students to sign a new student opinion survey. 
Signs with a QR code for the SGA survey are posted around campus for students to participate in.
