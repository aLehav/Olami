After a season full of ups and downs, the bowling team performed well at the Wildcat Invitational tournament in Wilmington, Del. from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2. “We finished after the first two days seated sixth, and we fought the last day to receive third place and get a trophy,” team captain Patricia Kelly, a sophomore business administration major, said. During that tournament, the team beat three teams from Wilmington University, Molloy College and Adelphi University. 
The
tournament was the team’s proudest moment during the current season. “Adelphi
is nationally-ranked, and we worked hard as a team and we beat them,” Francesca
Rossi, freshman forensic science major, said. It was her first time
accomplishing a feat like that on a team. 
“I’m
proud of the team really coming together through every tournament,” Emily
Cavanaugh, freshman nursing major, said. “Whether we start at the bottom, we
always pull it off the last day to place in tournaments.” Her personal best
score is 279.
The  bowling team was formed on campus three years
ago, according to Kelly. She and her teammates are proud to have helped build
their team by doing what they love.
 Nicole Lettich, freshman nursing major, is
proud to be a part of a team that cheers each other on. “We notice that all the
better teams are very involved with each other and they cheer, and I feel like
we’ve improved that this season,” she said. 
Their team’s scores in competition have improved overall. “When we cheer together as a team, our momentum is higher and we perform better,” Lettich said. 
“A lot of
these athletes are dedicated, and they’re looking to get better no matter
what,” Cavanaugh said.
Kelly is
glad to have developed a close relationship with her teammates. “I always have
a family and girls I know I can trust and depend on if I need anybody,” she
said. “It affects gameplay because we know we have each other’s back.” Kelly’s
personal best score is 289.
“I knew a
lot of girls on the team, so I knew coming in that I’d have a lot more
friends,” Lettich said about joining the Pioneers. There are nine members on
the team.
“I like
the team atmosphere and we all get along very well, we have a lot of laughs,”
Rossi said. “They push me to do the best I could do, and I do the same for
them.” Rossi’s personal best score is 280.
Lettich
anticipates placing higher in tournaments and winning more titles. The team won
second place at the Kutztown Duals tournament in Whitehall, Pa. in November
2018 and fourth place at the Red Flash Invitational in Altoona, Pa. in January.
Her personal best is 289. 
The team
members hope to improve their performance moving forward this season and win
first in tournaments. 
“I’m looking forward to combining with LIU Brooklyn,” Cavanaugh said.
“We will have a bigger team, but I know we’ll each work hard to become part of
that starting five.” The team will not move to Brooklyn, but they will meet
with the rest of the team for practices and play together at tournaments,
according to Kelly. The coach for the Brooklyn team will become head coach. 
My teammates
and I are looking forward to the ECC championships “since this is our last year
as LIU Post before the merge,” Kelly said. “We definitely want to make it a big
one.”
The
Pioneers’ next tournament is at the Metro Classic on Feb. 16 in West Babylon,
N.Y. Their season ends on Sunday, March. 24.

What you’ll need:

Glass mason jar Acrylic paint Paint brush Tape Scissor Ribbon (optional) 
First, cut hearts out of your tape. Stick the hearts onto your mason jar in your preferred pattern. Once the tape is on the mason jar, paint the jar, covering the tape. 
Once the first coat of paint is dry, paint it a second time to ensure it is opaque. When the paint is fully dry, peel off the heart- shaped tape to reveal windows shaped as hearts now on the jar. 
Finally, decorate the outside of the jar with ribbon or string, and
then put battery-operated fairy lights inside the jar so that they can
be seen through the heart-shaped windows that are not painted.

The Student Activities Board (SAB), creates large and small events to enhance students’ college life outside the classroom. Members will organize live entertainment in Hillwood Commons on select dates throughout the spring 2019 semester to offer students a taste of talent chosen by fellow classmates. 
The Gold Coast Cinema will host two stage
shows at 6 p.m. on Feb. 12 and April 10, each
showcasing a stand-up comedian. In addition,
performances by acoustic musicians branded
the “Coffee House Series” will take place in
Hillwood during common hour on Feb. 25,
March 25, and April 23. An “End of The Year
Bash” will take place on the Great Lawn on
April 29.

Knowing that “commuters usually don’t stay for the performances that are at night,” the scheduled times reflect the board members’ intention to attract a variety of students, according to Cassidy Shankar, SAB’s programming chairperson and sophomore forensics major. 
Heather Bash, the board’s large event chairperson and junior criminal justice major, is disappointed in the turnout for past events. “The talents so far have been enjoyed by everyone who has attended, but it’s sad to see that the attendance from the student body is pretty low for events that are paid through funds from the school,” she said. 
Freshman education major, Anthony Dushaj, was unable to attend the band Small Time Napoleon’s live performance on Jan. 22 due to his commitment to the wrestling team. “I did hear about bands playing on campus, and I heard pretty good things about it,” he said. 
Ryan Day, LIU Promise’s assistant director of events and operations, took over as the board’s advisor last year to help transition more control of the organization into student’s hands. The goal is to “branch out from the traditional activities organized in the past,” Day said. 
The organization originally consisted of
executives, chairpersons, and a few general
members. “This year we had to rebuild the club
from the bottom up,” Shankar said. SAB now
accepts a larger general membership, helping
to provide a wider representation of student
opinion.

Last fall, Day and a few board members participated in a conference held by the National Association of Campus Activities (NACA), where they joined neighboring universities in scouting out different acts touring college campuses across the country. They learned how to contract performers for large and small-scale events, according to Bash. 
Bash is excited for their announcement of the artist who will perform at this year’s annual Spring Fling. Through a survey emailed out to students last November, board members were able to gage the musical genre and type of performer students wish to see. The artist chosen is still under wraps, according to Day, but the board is hoping to plan a reveal event upon completion of the contract signing. The concert is scheduled for Thursday, April 29. 
Students who wish to contribute their ideas or assist with campus activities and events are welcome to join the activities board, according to Day. “We actually just got these fancy rewards cards for our general members as an incentive to volunteer at events and come to the meetings,” he said.
Students who reach the first tier win a staff t-shirt, and then each time they reach another tier, their name is entered in a raffle for a chance to meet the artist headlining the spring concert. Those interested in joining SAB can contact Day at Ryan.Day@liu.edu.

Valerie Clayman Pye, assistant professor of theater, has been part of the New Victory Theater’s 2018-19 LabWorks Artists program in order to develop new theatrical works for families. She is collaborating with Spellbound Theatre, which creates theatrical work for audiences ages 0-5, Pye is creating “Shakespeare’s Stars,” a project intended to connect multimedia and Shakespearean text to give young children a visually immersive experience with the playwright. “We introduce babies to classical music and Shakespeare’s heightened text has structure in it that is similar in terms of patterning and listening and things like that,” Pye said. “It’s going to be very exciting.” 
“Shakespeare’s Stars” is a deconstruction of Shakespeare in an attempt to create a new work for younger audiences. “It’s not following a particular narrative, it’s using Shakespeare to create an immersive performance experience, Pye said. “Babies and very small children, they can’t follow a complex narrative like that, but they can hear, and the alliteration that Shakespeare uses, the wordplay, and the way in which he works with language is very appealing to the ear, and that appeals to children, and that’s what peaks their interest.” 
Pye wants to find a way to make Shakespeare more relatable to audiences, and her “Shakespeare’s Stars” is a way she seeks to do that. “One of the big things in my own creative work is about helping to make Shakespeare more accessible for people and also how can we shake some of the stereotypes and some of the stigma surrounding Shakespeare, so that people can engage with the work in a way that perhaps they are more receptive to it,” she said. “Shakespeare can [seem] stuffy or rigid or old-fashioned and so on, but when we engage with it without our stereotypes, it’s actually not difficult to understand and it’s very relatable to us today.” 
There will be another developmental residency in June for Pye’s “Shakespeare’s Stars” where the final touches will be made, after which Pye and the other creators will seek partners to produce a fully-staged production. “One of the things that has been wonderful about being in the LabWorks program is that we receive a lot of professional development support and so we are fortunate enough to become integrated into a community that includes people who produce, book, and represent works, and this often can be on an international scale.” 
Pye is also working on a book, co-edited with Hillary Haft Bucs, associate professor of theater at Western New England University, called “Objectives Obstacles and Tactics in Practice: Perspectives on Activating the Actor,” intended to look at different approaches for teaching the work of theater practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski. Stanislavski developed his method, which emphasizes the actor’s use of his conscious will in order to experientially activate emotional experience and subconscious behavior. 
“The objective, obstacles and tactics are the three main components of Stanislavski’s training method for acting, but there are lots of different ways of engaging that in the studio or classroom rehearsal and so on. And so this book brings together a variety of different perspectives of how the master acting teachers are engaging with these concepts in the classroom and in the studio,” Pye said. Pye noted that before Stanislavski came, there was no standardized method of training actors. “At least in the Western world, almost all of our actor training is based in some form on Stanislavski’s work.” 
Pye explained that Stanislavski was “an absolute pioneer” and that her book will look at “what the best acting teachers are doing to help communicate Stanislavski’s teaching with actors and training.” The book will be published by Routledge in January 2020. Two other professors from Post, David Hugo and Maria Porter, will also contribute to the volume. Pye wrote a chapter for the volume called “Hunter/ Hunted: Experiential Learning and the Actor’s Craft.” Hugo will contribute which uses the concept of an obstacle to transform it in such a way that actors respond to it as in real time; this is applied to both non-musical and musical performance. Porter proposed a way to connect Stanislavski’s concepts with the ancient Greek dramatists. 
Pye’s love for Shakespeare and theater
stems from a very active engagement with
theater early on. “I was really lucky in the
third grade to have an amazing teacher
who allowed us to do our assignments in
different ways.”

After her undergraduate degree, she began work in children’s theatre with Theatreworks/USA. She received an MFA in acting from Brooklyn College, an
MFA in staging Shakespeare and a Ph.D.
in performance practice, both degrees
obtained from the University of Exeter in
England.

“I went to England and I did a second MFA degree in staging Shakespeare, and then I realized I was really interested in what was happening at the Globe, the replica of Shakespeare’s theater in London. When I experienced Shakespeare in that space, it felt completely alive and different from how I had experienced it in other places.” For her Ph.D., she “had a grant from the British government to develop an actor training methodology based on the conditions at Shakespeare’s Globe [and] the relationship between the space for which he wrote and the text.” That methodology became the groundwork for “Unearthing Shakespeare: Embodied Performance and the Globe,” her first book, and for her work at Post where she teaches her methodology to theatre students. She has also served as adviser to the Post Theatre Company’s production of “The Comedy of Errors.” 
She doesn’t have one favorite Shakespearean play. “There are different plays that do different things,” she said.“There are plays that teach us about leadership, that remind us how to pay attention to the fact that we all in our differences deserve respect and dignity and to be treated equally. I think that there are plays that help us understand the complications of what love is, and what identity is, and I think that there are plays that kind of highlight the horrible things that human beings are capable of doing to one another, and I think that they all have really important places or positions for us,” she said. “Measure for Measure,” for example, has “one hundred percent”
relevance in the age of MeToo. And “The
Merchant of Venice” and “Othello” are
“about human rights and stereotypes and
the dangers of inequality and racism.”
Likewise, “The Comedy of Errors” shows
“how there’s a time and a place for pure
fun as well as looking seriously at what
we could be doing better.”

Pye advises aspiring theater actors, directors, and others to become more engaged in the world. Her advice “is to study human behavior, to observe the world around you, to be very curious about how we tell stories and how relationships unfold between people, and to understand how we can learn from the history of how theater has helped people understand the world around them.” 
Pye is teaching Intermediate Acting II,
as well as Advanced Voice and Speech I.

Govinda Willard took over as the part-time Catholic campus minister in the beginning of the spring semester, replacing Felicia Viscusi, who was the campus minister from September to December 2018. Viscusi left the university to be the full-time minister at Stony Brook, where Willard just left. The Campus Ministry is a part of the Diocese of Rockville Center, along with Adelphi, Hofstra, and Stony Brook universities. 
Father Michael Duffy is the current part-time chaplain of the ministry, which has been on campus for decades. He replaced the previous chaplain, Father Ted, in September 2017. 
During Viscusi’s brief time as campus minister, the ministry had daily meetings for prayer, fellowship, and reflection. There was rosary, a women’s group, and Bible study. “There were also opportunities to meet with college Catholics from different universities through various intercampus events. Service opportunities, a fall retreat, and an international mission trip to the Dominican Republic during winter break were all available to the students as well,” Viscusi said. 
Willard, who came from Stony Brook University, where she was campus minister and music director from September 2018 until this semester, said her role has three parts. First, she is “a support and a guide for students who are interested in exploring their faith or growing in their faith.” Second she will “cultivate a community within the university where students can meet and perhaps grow in friendship with other students who want to explore their faith, and grow in their relationship with God.” Third, she will “create events where students can come and explore their faith, like opportunities for prayer, or studying the Bible, or having women’s and men’s groups.” She will also plan service trips, social work, mission trips, and retreats. 
“My main goal is to create a Christ-centered community, a community of students that can
find friendships and share values as well as to
help students find the great joy and strength
that comes from having a relationship with
their Creator,” Willard said.

While Father Duffy provides the sacramental needs for the ministry, Willard will run the other activities, but says there will be some overlap. 
Willard has great hopes that the Catholic ministry will be deeply powerful on the campus. “[T]he power of God is infinite,” Willard noted. “[W]hen the students and God show up, amazing things happen. I consider my role as evangelization through hospitality and friendship.” The Catholic campus ministry is larger than the student-run Newman Club, and it is through the ministry that the Mass and the sacraments are administered. 
Willard’s personal faith story allows her to relate to other college students. She became a practicing Catholic when she was 18-years-old. “I was not very interested in my faith, growing up, all throughout high school. I was going to classes and parties, and everything began to feel really empty, and I said to my mom one day, ‘I think I need to get more spiritual,’ and she said, ‘OK. I’m going to take you on a pilgrimage.’” 
Through prayer, mass attendance, and fasting, Willard started to feel the presence of God and of His existence. 
This reality helped her to find God in a particular moment of crisis in her life. “Things have culminated in my life as I got back home. I haven’t changed much, but I have found myself in a difficult circumstance, and in that moment I prayed the Our Father prayer, and that’s something I wouldn’t have done had I not gone on that trip and prayed that prayer so many times,” she said. “Saying that prayer in a time of [personal] crisis was a turning point.” 
Willard also saw opportunities for her to work in music during her late teenage years. She played the flute with various jam bands and “sat in” with bands and artists such as Moe, the Disco Biscuits, Michael Franti and Spearhead, and Colonel Les Claypool’s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade. ”It was a very exciting and adventurous time, and I knew it was God’s hand, because there were doors opening that were completely miraculous,” she said. “Performing in the music industry is extremely competitive and it’s not that many opportunities for this particular genre of music, and through that whole time I noticed that the part that I found most fulfilling was watching God’s hand open doors and having adventures with God. The music was secondary.” 
A turning point for Willard was her calling to ministry work. “I felt called to a greater mission. I had seen what all these tremendous tools or gifts that we have in the Catholic church that had helped me grow stronger and had inspired me and energized and animated me to so much joy and fulfillment, that I really felt called to help share in the mission of the catholic church.” 
She wanted other people, particularly young
people who are the age she was when she had
her conversion, to be able to experience what
is out there. Willard volunteered in 2015 at
Saint Anthony of Padua in East Northport as
a catechist for eighth graders, allowing her to
share her faith, provide counsel, and coordinate
vacation Bible camps.

“After I had all this experience in volunteering, I saw a position open at LIU Post, and I felt drawn to the role. This is it this is what I [was] created for, I felt, to help students find their way to happiness and fulfillment.” 
The campus ministry has about 20 active
students who attend Sunday masses.

Viscusi, who moved to a full-time position at
Stony Brook, has a high estimation of Willard.
“Govinda radiates the joy and love of Christ in
all that she does. Her trust in the Lord and her
passion for the faith will be huge assets to the
community. Her knowledge and love of Scripture in particular is something that will help the students to thrive in their faith and their personal relationship with Christ, and help them to better be able to hear the voice of God in their own lives.” 
Jack Tomlinson, a first-year physical and health education student, views Willard as a blessing to the community. “She is an extremely nice and caring lady. You could tell that just by having one conversation with her,” Tomlin- son said. “As far as being a campus minister, so far she’s been extremely active.” Willard has planned several events for community service such as a trip to a soup kitchen and a day-long prayer retreat in Huntington. During a recent Sunday Mass, the musician was unable to be there, so Willard stepped in and played the guitar and sang. “It shows that she wants to be involved and not just be there,” Tomlinson said. 
Tomlinson sees Willard’s presence as one that “promotes a vibe of happiness and a feeling of purpose and a desire to help others.” 
Michaela Fox, a junior musical theater student, also has positive words to say about Willard. “She’s very sweet, and she’s ready to take on whatever is given to her. She has multiple talents; she’s musically talented, and very faithful, and devoted to the faith, and I think that’s exactly what we need in a campus minister,” Fox said. “You can tell [with] everything that she does, she does with God in her heart and in her mind, and that is what we need here on campus.” Fox sees Willard as someone who will bring a further emphasize missionary work to the campus ministry. “She’s very open-minded and she has a lot of plans,” Fox said. 
Willard said her purpose is to be like Jesus
and to dwell in love. “My job is to pray and be
filled with the love of God, and to pour God’s
love through myself and my life into the world
and to give God’s love to others.”

LIU Promise teamed up with Relay for Life to hold a casino night from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Feb. 7. Students played different card games such as blackjack and Texas hold’em to win over $5000 in prizes donated from Browse, Ticketmaster and other vendors. For students not interested in cards, there were craps and roulette tables, as well. 
Admission to the event was free and each student who attended received 500 “LIU Dollars,” that could be used to place bets at the different tables and potentially multiply their earnings. Once students were done playing, they cashed out the LIU dollars for raffle tickets that give them a chance to win prizes. Students were also able to purchase additional “Relay Dollars” from Relay for Life representatives. 
This was the first time a casino night event was held on campus. The idea for the event came from students that suggested it to Campus Life. The equipment was rented from Enjoyable Entertainment, which also provided the “pit bosses” to run the tables.
DeAnna Aguinaldo, a freshman whose major is undecided, said she had a great time enjoying the festivities. “I like that people can come together and meet new people or hang out with friends,” she said. 
Adam Pilzer, a junior health information management major, said he was impressed by how well the event was received by the student body. 
“It was definitely well-run. I didn’t expect to see a big turnout from students, but seeing everyone playing all the games to win prizes and enjoying the re-opening of the End Zone with all of the new snacks, I was impressed with how everyone just came out to take time off from studying or working to have a good time with their friends,” he said. “I already asked if we can have this event again and was informed that it will be back.” 
Relay for Life is a volunteer group
that hosts fundraisers for the American
Cancer Society. Relay for Life’s main
event will take place on Thursday, April 4
at 7 p.m.

The office of employer and alumni engagement has many events planned for the spring semester. The events, according to Moreen Mitchell, university director of employer and alumni engagement, will help students prepare for job interviews and create resumes that will impress future employers. 
On Feb. 26, “How to Market Yourself as a Student Athlete” will be held at 5 p.m. in Hillwood Commons Room 221. On March 19, “LinkedIn/Social Media Workshop” will be held at 1 p.m. in Hillwood Commons Room 221. 
A “Mock Interview Day” will be held on
April 9 and April 10 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and
a walk-in resume workshop will be held on
April 16 and 17. Both events will be held in LIU
Promise, Hillwood Commons, Room 270.

Brianna Licausi, a senior physical and
health education major, said she is interested
in attending the events.

“Something I struggle with is my resume, so
if there is series on building resumes and what
to put on it versus what not to put on it, I think
that would be very useful,” she said.

Licausi also thought that mock interviews
could be helpful. “I know I have problems with
being shy in interviews, so I think it would be a
great way to prepare for the future, and I think
it’s a really good idea,” she said.

Charli Beshers, a sophomore education and
math major, said she is also enthusiastic about
the events.

“I think it’s a great idea and a great opportunity for students, especially those who don’t have family to help them or access to other people who can help them,” she said. “I think writing resumes can be very tricky especially for first time people who don’t know how to do it at all.” Beshers said the workshops are a great idea that will allow students the opportunity to perfect their resumes and become prepared for professional interview settings. 
Nicole Trani, a junior nursing major, also
said she feels the events would be good for
students to attend.

“I definitely think that it’s important to
have your resume, and having your college
prepare you as far as schooling goes, but no
one can really prepare you for getting a job and
the techniques needed,” she said.

Of the mock interviews, Trani said they, “[The mock interviews] can help someone feel prepared especially since some college students don’t work at all,” Trani said. “When you graduate, you are getting a job that a lot of other people want, so you have to stand out.”

With the East Coast Conference Championships coming up, the men’s and women’s indoor track teams gathered for a workout at the Pratt Recreation Center indoor track. With a smaller roster than last year and a lot of dedication, the athletes expect to perform at their best. 
Last year, the women’s team came in third place and the men’s team in fourth place. A lot has changed since then. The announcement of the merger between the Post and Brooklyn athletic teams led to some athletes deciding not to run this year. The roster has shrunken, mainly on the men’s team. 
“On the men’s side, we have lost kids. We got a couple of kids injured, some transferred and some just didn’t came back from last year,” Kevin Buckley, head coach for both teams, said. Last year they had 25 active athletes, this year they have 11 to 12 players that are active. 
The turbulence has been a challenge for the athletes, but Buckley is pleasantly surprised with how his athletes have handled the situation. “The kids who are here, they really hung in,” he said. Buckley is particularly delighted with the women’s team. 
“The women’s team gets a grade of A for keeping their focus, practicing, going through everything and succeeding when the vast majority won’t be running next year,” he said. next year, the indoor track teams will be located at the Brooklyn campus, which creates problems for Post athletes.
Not all majors are offered at both campuses, which prohibits a move for athletes who want to stay in their major. Buckley also said there is a very established Division I team at Brooklyn and a majority of his athletes will not be offered a spot on that team. 
Despite the changes, Buckley has high hopes for the upcoming championship and expects a lot of personal records. “Everyone should have their best times,” he said. He also hopes to get some of his runners qualified for the IC4A/ ECAC Championships in March, where the runners will compete against a majority of Division I runners. “We are looking to be as good as we can. Even though we are a little bit out of business, we will keep on going and keep on trying,” Buckley said. 
One of the strongest athletes who will compete at the ECC Championships is sophomore marketing major Destyn Harding. Buckley described him as “the hardest worker you can possibly want.” He runs the 60-meter dash, 200-meter dash and the 4×400- meter relay. At last year’s ECC, Harding finished second in the
60-meter dash and fifth in the
200-meter dash. This year he has
his mind set on the gold.

“I expect to win the 60 and to
be top five in the 200,” Harding
said. Buckley also has high hopes
on Harding, especially in the
60-meter dash.

“He is a definite threat,” he
said. Harding recently qualified for
the IC4A Championships.

Another potential scorer is senior political science major Kaitie Schillaci. “She is back in form again,” Buckley said. “She was a bit out of form but she is running very well now,” Buckley said. 
Schillaci runs both indoor and
outdoor track and needed some
time to adjust to the faster indoor
tracks. “Getting indoors is always
a little bit harder because you are
coming from cross country where
it’s all outside and long distance,”
Schillaci said. “It’s a transition
and you got to wake your legs up.”
Though she hadn’t performed as
well as she hoped in the beginning
of the season, Schillaci said she is
stronger now and more confident.
Her goal is to beat her personal
record. “I ran at 3:09 last weekend
and that is my personal record so
if I can run at 3:05 or 3:06 maybe
that would be nice,” she said.

Junior Alexandria Okon is another runner who is expected to perform well. “She is the ECC pre-season athlete of the year, the favorite in the 500-meter, where she is the defending league champion,” Buckley said. “And [Okon is] the meet record holder, and she is the favorite in the 800-meter, where she has the best time of the year,” Buckley said. What distance she will be running at the ECC Championships is not decided. “She can’t run both. They are too close together,” Buckley said. Okon was not present during practice on Feb. 8 due to a visit to Brooklyn, where she most likely will be running next year. 
Both the men’s and the women’s team have many other runners Buckley sees as potential scorers. He mentioned, among others, Margaret McKeever, who will compete in the 1000-meter dash, Nicolette Agostinacchio and Nataly Ramirez in the 500-or 400-meter dash.
This ECC Championship will be Buckley’s last one as head coach for the Post track teams due to the merger. When the announcement reached him, he decided to not be a part of it. The head coach for Brooklyn team, Simon Hodnett, will be responsible for the track teams next year. 
In his 45 years as a coach,
Buckley has spent the last three
as head coach. “I have enjoyed my
time here but now it’s time to stay
home and read a book all day or
find something else. We will see
what happens but it was a good
run,” he said.

The East Coast Championship
will take place on Saturday, Feb. 16
at Ocean Breeze Athletic Complex
in Staten Island.

With their starts of the 2019 season just around the corner, the men’s and women’s lacrosse teams are working hard to prepare. The men’s team is coming off a 10-5 record in 2018, with an overtime loss to rival NYIT in the East Coast Conference finals. 
This season, the Pioneers tied with NYIT for first in the East Coast Conference pre-season rankings. “We don’t pay attention to the polls, but I was surprised that we were tied. They [NYIT] won the championship last year and I thought they deserved to be number one in the polls,” head coach Eric Wolfe, said. 
“During the offseason, we’ve been putting in a lot of work: wall ball, shooting, cardio, lifting, et cetera,” senior defender Michael Licata, a double-major- ing in mathematics and physics, said. “Everyone has been put- ting in their time to get better.” 
The team aspires to get back to the East Coast Conference championship with all the hard work it put in this offseason. “We have a lot of talent spread deep though our roster. We have an experienced offense with almost every starter returning and a defense with great potential to make a lot of stops this season,” Licata said. 
With a lot of offensive starters returning, the name that stands out is sophomore Will Snelders. Snelders had a historic freshman year scoring 74 points and 61 goals. “Will’s season last season was a proud accomplishment for our entire program, everyone takes a part of those numbers he put up,” Wolfe said. “This season, I anticipate our scoring to be more spread out as we have a lot of options on the offensive end.” 
The first game is set for Feb. 16 at 2:30 p.m. against American International College. “We are going to be fun to watch this season,” Wolfe said. 
The Women’s team is coming off a 14-6 record in 2018, with a loss to Adelphi in the first-round of the NCAA playoffs. This season, the team ranked as number one in the East Coast Conference and number seven in the nation. “We’d love to get back to the conference championship. We still have a lot to prove and we have unfinished business this year,” head coach Meghan McNamara said. 
Only one player is missing
from last year’s roster. Captain
and four year starting goalkeeper
Olivia Kirk graduated in 2018,
opening up the position. “We have
two great goalies who came in this
season – Mackenzie O’Brien and
Hailey Duchnowski,” McNamara
said. “It’s whoever is in net, we’re
not worried one bit,” she said.

With a team filled with returning players, most of them have been playing together for years. “Playing together for the past couple years really is nice, knowing everyone’s tendencies and their style of play,” junior health sciences major, Paige Sherlock, said. Sherlock, a two-year starter for the team, was recently named one of four team captains along with Carly Spano, Trish Brisotti, and Alyssa Mallery. 
“We have a lot of freshman
that’ll step-up and make a big
impact for the team. Things are
looking really positive and we are
looking forward to accomplishing
big goals this year,” Sherlock said.

The first game for the women’s
lacrosse team is set for Feb. 23 at
11 a.m. against Merrimack College.

The baseball team will play the first game of their last season in green and gold on Friday, Feb. 15. Instead of forfeiting their season, the baseball team is using their heartbreak due to the campus merge as motivation. 
Last season, the Pioneers made it all the way to the East Coast Conference Championship and had a winning percentage well over .500. 
Michael Gaffney is ready for this season as it will be his last as head coach. 
“My thoughts going into this season are that we have to try to enjoy each other as much as possible; we’re going to try to win as many games as possible and that’s the bottom line,” Gaffney said. “ I really am impressed with the players and the way they push each other and the way they’re not taking the current situation for granted. It’s actually inspiring.” 
Junior health science major and first
baseman, Zach Fritz talked about the
cohesiveness of the team.

“We just stick together and play for
each other. Our chemistry is strong right
now and that sometimes matters more
than talent,” Fritz said.

However, Fritz is still a competitor and wants to win it all, especially this season. “My goal for this season is to win a championship and beat every team that doubts us and thinks that we are packing it in because of the school merge,” he said. 
Senior philosophy major, Johnny
Dehler, outfielder, will do whatever it
takes, even affect his statistics to win it
all this year.

“If I strike out 20 times this season and it somehow helps us win a championship, then I want to strike out 20 times. My performance does not matter to me and when I look back at our most impressive season two years ago, I didn’t play much, but I had the most fun, so I am fine replicating that if we can win each game doing it,” Dehler said. 
Due to the athletic merger of the LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn teams, some players did have to make the tough decision to walk away from the team, but that isn’t affecting the team’s morale. In fact, since the team isn’t as full, it reinforces the morale of the team. 
“These guys could have left mid-year,
and we did have a few guys leave mid-
year because they did what was best for
them,” Gaffney said.

“Everyone that wants to be here is here,” Dehler said. “Everyone that is here is committed to winning the exciting and regional championship. There is zero slacking this year.” 
This is an emotional finale for the baseball team; it’s going to be exciting to see what lies ahead this season. 
The season opener on Feb. 15 will
be in Tampa. F.L. against the University
of Tampa. The team’s first home game is
on Feb. 28 against the University of New
Haven.

The first exhibition of the spring semester opened in the S.A.L. Gallery in the library on Feb. 6. Second year MFA student Jessica Hart displayed her collection, “Disparu,” inspired by the reality of species extinction. Three large, colored abstract pieces were mounted on the far wall, that represented different natural disasters such as hurricanes.
“I’ve always been really interested in animals; since starting my time at Post most of my subject has been animals,” Hart said. “I draw them large-scale whether they be the size of two doors, or three doors, they are pretty large.” The exhibition carries a collective message, following Hart’s last exhibition at the end of 2018, where she explored activism alongside five artists, with her focus on abused animals. “What led to this exhibition specifically is animals that are currently dying or extinct,” Hart said.
By following PETA and ASPCA, Hart remains up to date on the stories surrounding the animals’ deaths. “There have been roughly three animals that have gone extinct since November [2018],” Hart said. “One is the eastern puma; he went extinct only two weeks ago.” The others are the white rhinoceros and the blue macaw.
Hart’s favorite works are the collection’s white pieces. “Each canvas is its own animal,” she said. The intricacy of the collection and attention to detail helps depict the five different extinct animals. Hart replicates the texture of the animal’s skin or fur and created each individual piece using different styles of applying gesso [white paint mixture] onto the canvas.
“The reason I chose white-on-white is due to the fact of the animal leaving us,” Hart said. “The loss of color means there’s nothing there left, and that why it’s called ‘Disparu,’ it’s French for gone or faded away.”
Hart will graduate spring 2020, and intends to further explore the white-on-white styling. “This is recent, like the last month and I love them, I love being able to work with not color,” she said.

The End Zone re-opened with a bang, bringing out a DJ and free wings for all on Wednesday, Feb. 6. The End Zone, located in Hillwood Commons, has not been used recreationally by students in the past two years, aside from club events, meetings or conferences. The idea to revive the space emerged from the Dean’s Council. 
“We talked about the End Zone
and how it used to be pretty
popular (and) used to be well liked
by students,” Dean of Students
Michael Berthel said. Facilities
services upgraded the space with
new paint, decor and two new pool
tables; Aramark dining services
created a new menu for students.
The goal was to create a student
“hot spot.”

The End Zone will serve as a late night spot for students, with operating hours from 8 p.m. to midnight, Thursday through Sunday. The Winnick Student Center, the primary food source for resident students, closes early on the weekends; Saturdays at 7 p.m. and Sundays at 8 p.m., leaving, students with no options for food after hours. 
Manny Kaur, junior radiology technician major, said the campus has very limited food hours, and is eager for a place to eat late at night. “I used to starve since everything is closed,” she said. 
The End Zone’s new menu includes a variety of “bar food,” including, burgers, wings, mozzarella sticks, quesadillas, nachos, loaded french fries, onion rings, mac’n cheese bites, and more. Students can pay with cash, credit card, or by using their dining dollars. 
Berthel promised that the space would not be used for meetings or conferences, but that it was “strictly a student space,” something that the campus was lacking. Upcoming events in the End Zone include a Valentine’s Day paint night on Thursday, Feb. 14 at 8 p.m., a “Survivor” season premiere party on Wednesday, Feb. 20 at 8 p.m., and an Oscars watch party on Sunday, Feb. 24 at 8 p.m. There are more events planned throughout the semester. 
The space gained a lot of traction post-free wing night, with students using the space during common hour, between and after classes, and late at night. Senior film major Fredric Roberts has only been to the End Zone a handful of times in the past four years, however he plans to watch upcoming soccer games there. “If there’s an important game on campus, it’s great to know there’s a comfortable place to watch it,” he said. Resident students are pleased to know there is more to the university outside of their dorms.
“[We] used to have to go to McDonalds or some other place off campus [to hang out],” Kyle Duncan, a digital game design and computer science double major, said. “But going off campus late at night is so annoying, so I’m glad End Zone is back open,” he said.

The photocopy machines in the library now require students to insert their LIU ID cards before use. Some students are confused about the change in the copying procedure. The change was made without an explanation, leaving many students to believe they will be charged for printing. 
Thomas Walker, associate dean of libraries, confirmed that students will not initially be charged for copies. 
“Actually, they [the students] don’t have to pay to print. The university is still letting students print for free up to 500 pages. It’s a system of recouping cost once the free copies are exhausted,” Walker said about the new photocopying procedures. Students’ ID cards are encoded with a counter to track the amount of pages they print. Students who don’t have their ID card on them will be unable to print. However, Walker said the library plans on using a copy machine that accepts coins and copy cards in the future.
Louis Flores, a junior health care administration major, was angry when he heard that students would have to pay to print.
 “I overheard in class that it was possible that we would be charged to print at the library and I guess since we now have to swipe our cards to print, [it] made me believe it, but 500 [free copies] seems fair,” Flores said.
Morgan Bailey, a sophomore acting major was also upset. “It’s outrageous; I’ll have to pay per sheet, I have to print a paper today and I’m trying to figure out some alternatives to do so,” Bailey said, unaware of the first 500 free copies. Many students were searching for other ways to print on campus to avoid a fee.
Because students were not made aware of the change in copying procedures before they found the reconfigured copying machines, they are curious as to where the money will be going, who decided to implement this new rule and why.
Walker explained the rationale behind the copying charges. “Each year, we spend in the tens of thou- sands of dollars on paper alone; we would rather be spending that money on database subscriptions to help people with their current research or book purchases,” he said. “It was a group decision [to eventually charge students], but I support it; there’s not one particular person who decided to implement this rule.”
When using the library printer, the words “Secure Queue” show on the screen with the student’s name and a balance underneath. The screen reflected a 50.00 balance, similar to a commuter student dining dollars balance (resident students receive $350 dining dollars). Students saw that after printing two pages, the balance was not affected, while few others complained about being charged. It could be a glitch in the system, but it wasn’t confirmed if they were charged or not.
According to Louis Pisha, Reference and Interlibrary Loan Librarian, the school plans on making students have to swipe their cards on all printers within the campus.
Fortunately for students, printing is still free in places like the writing center on the second floor of humanities and the career bar upstairs in Hillwood Commons. The fee after 500 pages has yet to be determined, according to Walker.
