Dear readers,
On March 1, The Pioneer published the First Amendment on the front page to show that we support free speech and a free press not only for students on this campus, but for everyone, throughout the United States. The White House’s action of denying access to a White House Press Briefing on Feb. 24 to several media outlets, including CNN, The New York Times, and Buzzfeed, undermines freedom of the press for all journalists, including student journalists. As journalism students, it is not only our duty to ensure that free speech and a free press, which include both dialogue and criticism, remain a part of this campus for the future, but also to stand up for journalists everywhere.

For the past 22 years, William Kirker has truly been the man behind the scenes. While his work is always seen, seldom is his work appreciated; and never has it been celebrated.
The title of Director of Facilities bears tremendous responsibility. When there were reports of graffiti accumulating on the bookshelves in the library, Kirker was on it. When a snowstorm dumped a foot of snow on campus three weeks ago, Kirker allocated the proper resources to dispose of the snow, salt the roads, and clear the paths and parking lots of any hazardous debris, so that the campus could adequately operate and serve its’ students the next day.
It’s been that macro-mindset, and efficient management that’s kept Kirker as the director of facilities for more than two decades, but after 22 years, he will leave his position at the end of the semester. The “decision to leave is my own,” Kirker said, adding that he has an opportunity to move onto a new challenge.”
While Kirker did not disclose that new opportunity, he did offer some perspective as to why he’s decided to take his skills elsewhere. “As you get older, you gain a different perspective on life. When opportunities come along, you may need to make decisions that you never thought you would. But change can be a good thing if you make it so,” Kirker said.
Kirker wasted no time explaining why leaving Post will be difficult, while thanking those he’s worked with along the way. “What makes it difficult to leave are the people you leave. These are people that you have worked with every day and for me over 21 years. They become a big part of your life, they are your “work family”.” He called his staff “the best.” Kirker added: “One person can’t do everything. The team effort approach we have is what works. I couldn’t get through one day without them.”
Kirker’s beloved secretaries, Beth Funfgeld and Josephine Curello, offered recognition for the work Kirker has done, while highlighting exactly how great a man Kirker has been, and continues to be. “He really loves you guys [the students],” Funfgeld said. “Always, you guys come first. It’ll be hard when he leaves, he is a great man.”
Kirker is expected to serve as director of facilities through graduation, until sometime in early to mid May, continuing to preserve and build up the campus he’s called home for the past 22 years.

On Friday, March 3 Time Out, the concession stand in the Pratt Recreation Center, began to sell acai bowls. The addition to the menu was made to bring a healthy momentum to the athletic center. Promise coaches James Economou and Cara Caporale spearheaded bringing new healthy options to Time Out, Hutton and Post and The Doll House as they are all student run businesses..
The desire for acai bowls send students off campus. Students spend approximately $15 – $30 per week. Junior dance major Katelyn Cotto visits Super Bowls in Syosset two to four times a week to enjoy her healthy treat. “[Having acai on campus] would save me time from travelling 15 minutes,” Cotto said.
Employees of Time Out had training for making acai bowls on Tuesday, Feb. 28 by freshman volleyball player Sarah Sahli. The California native has had experience creating the treat as it is been popular on the west coast. “We gave out samples to the yoga and pilates classes that Tuesday; honestly everyone loved them,” Economou said. “The other thing that they liked was the price point.” Locations closest to campus selling this product have prices starting at $9.50, not including tax or add ons. Time Out sells 16 oz. bowls for $7.50, which includes three toppings and protein if desired. Also new, Sixteen oz. protein shake cans are being sold, priced between $4 and $5. Erica Bergen, a junior arts management major, is not a frequent buyer of acai bowls but would “definitely get them here if they are good!”
According to Economou, a major asset of the healthy bowls and shakes is the protein used in each product has been approved for use by NCAA athletes. “[Athletes] will never have to worry about putting something ‘illegal’ in their body that may fail a drug test,” Economou said. Because Time Out is located in the athletic center, Economou and Caporale “really want to have a healthy foot forward.”
Another change to the campus food and beverage offerings on campus is the addition of Dunkin Donuts iced coffee bottles in Hutton and Post. Flavors include original, mocha, french vanilla, and espresso. Bergen, however, still thinks she will wait on the Starbucks line. “I just don’t like bottled coffee!” she said.
Bubble Tea is also “in the works,” according to Economou. “Acai bowls and Bubble Tea are fairly popular in the Queens/Metro area now, which is where a big population of our students come from. We want to give them something that they may have already been used to back home.”
Yet another dining change in the works is extended hours and a wider variety to the Doll House menu. Economou hopes to extend hours past midnight so students do not have to have food delivered to their dorms after Winnick closes. Students are not sure about the impact of new hours. “I think it would depend on what food [The Doll House] will have,” Bergen said. “I might still get Domino’s, but I’d be open to [buying food at the Doll House].” Plans are being made, but have not yet been finalized, to add more menu options, such as grilled cheese and frozen yogurt. “I think it would definitely prevent me from ordering unhealthy foods,” Cotto said. “This would be a better alternative to getting Domino’s, Chinese, or Abeetza.”

As of fall 2017, the degree plan for most baccalaureate students will be reduced to a 120 credit plan of studies, replacing the current 129 credit plan of studies required to obtain most bachelor’s degrees. Students currently on 129 credit plans will be able to switch to 120 credit plans with no stipulations; all incoming freshmen will be put on 120 credit plans.
“You go to your advisors and they can put you on the new plan” Dr. John Lutz, a professor in the department of the English, said. Lutz who led a committee which pioneered the 120 credit initiative, cited a ordability as a motivation for the reduction in required credits. “The nine credits has shaved off $11,000 or $12,000 for people’s degrees” he said.
In addition to a ordability, Lutz cited university competitiveness as a major motivation for the new plans of study as well. “If students opt to go on the new plan, our four year or six year completion rate goes up right away; but we will see a big difference in four years from now; most universities have 120 credit standards,” he said.
Lutz noted that the location of the nine credits being reduced varies from department to department. “I’ve worked on this with departments. For some programs, one of the things we did is reduce our core curriculum requirement by six credits,” he said. Lutz attributed the initiative’s inception to the university’s 10-year strategic plan. Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, who led efforts to design the university’s 2015 strategic plan, is excited to present this 120 credit plan to the student body.
“This change is all about students; it will very likely increase graduation rates and decrease student debt…the new credit structure will likely result in a decreased financial burden on students by shortening the time it takes to graduate,” Kane said.
Kane confirmed the fall semester implementation, “Working with the deans and faculty, we have taken the steps necessary to begin the change coinciding with the start of the September 2017 school year. I have also been in contact with officials from the New York State Department of Education to implement it.” Kane indicated that student response to the 120 credit change has been “very positive.”

On Thursday, March 2, members of the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 30, which represents the maintenance workers at both the LIU Post and the LIU Brooklyn campuses, held a protest by the west gate of campus at noon. The protesters blew up a big inflatable rat, a common practice at union protests against employers, and handed out flyers to protest working without a contract.
The demonstrators included workers from both the Post and Brooklyn campuses who are upset over working without a ratified union contract for 18 months. The flyers handed out reflect their frustration, saying “It’s time to respect labor at LIU,” and “LIU administration’s failed approach to labor relations is embarrassing the LIU community. Workers on campus deserve respect.”
University Communications Strategist Jennifer Solomon provided a statement on behalf of President Kimberly Cline in response to the protests: “Long Island University has had a long standing and positive relationship with Local 30 and we have consistently achieved mutually successful agreements in the past. We look forward to upholding this tradition as we continue to negotiate in good faith towards a fair and responsible contract.”
Robert Wilson, the business representative for IUOE Local 30, explained their efforts further. “Basically the administration has taken a stern position on removing benefits for guys that have been employees for decades,” he said. The benefits removed include pay raises and sick days that workers have earned over the years. Wilson said they are looking for a fair contract, fair wage increases, and for the university to offer the benefits it once did. “They don’t recognize these guys are part of the LIU community,” he said.
Negotiations on new a contract for workers on both campuses have been ongoing, but not much progress is being made. “They just don’t want to move anymore,” Wilson said. “So we’re here to demonstrate and let them know that we’re just not going to tolerate it.” The union has also held a demonstration on the Brooklyn campus in September.
Andres Puerta, the IUOE Local 30 organizer, said “It’s really an embarrassment that the administration has failed to put together decent labor relations.” Both Puerta and Wilson stressed the importance of student involvement in their efforts as well. “We would love to get the student community involved in this,” Wilson said. Puerta agreed, saying students also need to push back.
The IUOE Local 30 is asking students and faculty to contact President Cline and demand that the administration reach fair agreements with workers on campus. Students can also visit the IUOE Local 30 website at iuoelocal30.com, or follow them on Twitter @IUOELocal30.

Caitlyn Greig, a senior dance major, is organizing an event to raise money for cancer research while also hoping to set a world record. The dance majors, together with the Post dance and cheer teams, are attempting to break the Guinness Book of World records for the most dancers to participate in a three minute hip-hop dance. The current record, according to The Guinness Book of World Records is 1,685 people. To break the current record over 1,685 people will need to participate in the choreographed dance.
The filming of the dance will be done on April 29 from 1-4 p.m. Greig and her fellow seniors are working with Campus Life in efforts to use the football field or another campus location, but nothing has been confirmed yet. The students are organizing the event through a Facebook group entitled “Break a Guinness Book World Record & Raise Money for Cancer,” and are reaching out to local cheerleading gyms and dance studios to get anyone interested in participating involved.
The students have no set goal for the amount of money they would like to raise and have not yet picked a charity to give the donations to, but they are looking for as much money as possible to help families whose children are sick with cancer “The topic of children suffering with cancer is a really terrible situation. We want to use our art of dance to help raise money to help even one family going through this situation. Parents should never have to choose [between] giving up a job and helping their child stay healthy and supported,” Lauren Hirlado, a sophomore dance major, said.
There is currently a fund raising jar set up in the dance department office located across from the library. According to the Facebook group, “The best way to raise money it is to ask for spare change. Change in pockets, ash trays, under the seats of cars, etc. Get a jar, decorate it, provide info about the cause on it, and ask for spare change.” “People can create their own jars; that’s what we are hoping for and whatever [money] they raise in their jar, they will bring,” Greig said.
The students in the dance department have been planning this event for two months. Diamond Avant, a junior dance major, is choreographing the two minute dance, which will then be posted on Facebook for those who plan to participate in the choreography to learn the dance. This event is open to anyone who is interested in participating. Anyone interested can contact Caitlyn Greig at caitlyn.greig@my.liu.edu.

The Starbucks in Hillwood Commons has been getting a lot of heat lately for its lack of items. Some products, including almond milk and skim milk, have been sold out recently, which has affected customers.
“Starbucks is a daily morning routine for me, but unfortunately sometimes they don’t have a few of the flavors I want which is a bit upsetting,” Taylor McNamara, a senior psychology major, said.
David Conway, the director of operations for Aramark, the food service that oversees the Starbucks on campus, said that the issue is being addressed. “We were put on a new delivery schedule by Starbucks Corporate,” he said. “We have, for the most part, worked through this change and, in the future there should not be an issue. If so, it will be isolated.” Conway noted that the biggest problem he sees with the campus Starbucks “is lack of working and customer space in the Hillwood Café. During busier periods it is difficult to work in the current area,” he said.
The students and faculty who work there didn’t want to comment on the topic, but did tell people to complain so change is made. There was a change in Aramark management for the campus Starbucks location a couple weeks ago. Aramark is trying to meet the new Starbucks standards by training supervisors. All training requires certified barista training and store certification.
Students have noticed that since a recent change of management, Starbucks has had difficulty in keeping products on the shelf. “I go there to get caramel iced coffee and they are out, and then I ask for vanilla chai tea and they are out of that, I just don’t get it,” Chiara Marangelli, a senior childhood education major, said.
The concern expressed most frequently by students is the espresso machine not working. However, Conway has ensured that “the machine is in fact working. It is scheduled for maintenance, which will be done over the next week.”
Conway also stressed that Starbucks strives to be the best that it can be for all students. That is why Aramark takes all students concerns very seriously and always look to address complaints or concerns raised, he said.
Students with complaints or concerns about Starbucks can go to the Aramark offices on the first floor of Hillwood Commons and let them know.

In honor of International Women’s Day, LIU’s Office of Employer Relations hosted an event in the Hillwood Cinema from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. on March 6, beginning with a students’ artistic showcase, and followed by a Women in Business panel.
The event opened with a performance by “the women singers of Long Island Sound Vocal Jazz Ensemble,” followed by the Post Concert Dance Company performing, “Like A Girl 2.0,” choreographed by Jennifer O’Neil, a senior dance major. Nino Chavchadez presented her original artwork focused on female subjects.
Five female executives then spoke on a Women in Business panel. The panelists included Barbara J. Beatus, Associate Executive Director of Girls Inc. of Long Island; Cary Carbonaro, Managing Director of United Capital of New York and New Jersey; Trooper Erario, a NY Troop Recruitment Officer; Mallory Kerley, Manager of Marketing and Communications for United Way of Long Island; and Wendy Ofer, a Diversity and Inclusion Specialist for Canon USA. Moreen Mitchell, University Director of Employer Relations, introduced and moderated the panel, asking questions regarding their career pathways, their current roles, and opportunities for students at their companies.
A Q&A followed the panel discussion. Audience members were able to ask for advice from these women on the best ways of finding success.
When it comes to interviews, it is always important to come prepared, the panelists said. They advised bringing a printed copy of your resume to the interview, even if the employer or recruiter already has it. “I know sometimes I’m too busy with other meetings to print out your resume,” Beatus said. “It’s always nice when you come prepared.”
How you dress for an interview can be important. Each panelist expressed her discontent with the style of dress that millennials tend to wear when coming to meet with them. “You can’t wear jeans to an interview!” Beatus said. “We tell people to dress business casual and they show up in sweatpants,” Ofer said. “A first impression is a lasting impression.” Panelists gave the advice to dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
When it comes to meeting people and gaining contacts to add to your network, a student asked the panelists the best way to sustain the relationship. Carbonaro said the best way to keep in touch is to utilize social media. “By commenting on my stuff, you’re constantly on my mind.”
Beatus agreed, giving the example of an employer that she kept in contact with. “I met a recruiter four years ago and at the time there were no openings, but I made a reminder to reach out every three to four months,” she said. “We kept a consistent, mutual connection for four years and eventually an opportunity came.”
“If there is someone very specific that you want to connect with, I would think to ask them if you can shadow them, conduct an informal interview, or even ask them to mentor you,” Kerley said.
Success isn’t easily obtainable and can sometimes come unexpectedly sudden or late in life. The panelists were asked if their current careers were where they expected to be working. It was a mixed response, with two out of the five panelists being in careers of their initial interests.
Kerley wanted a path that was completely opposite of what she did in high school. “I de facto [went] into communications, because I liked talking to people and branching out of my comfort zone,” she said. Kerley interned at several places, including a radio station, marketing & special events, public relations, and merchandising positions, before settling into a career with Canon.
Erario, who studied physical education in college parallel to her marine corps enrollment, discovered during her internship at a corporate gym, that it was not what she thought it would be. In her last two years in the marine corps, she applied for the police exam in multiple locations, and landed a job just as she graduated.
Beatus, who also teaches yoga, closed the panel by sharing a quote from one of her students. “My [yoga] student who is 65 said, ‘I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up,’ so just remember that,” Beatus advised. “It’s always a process, it’s always changing, so don’t put so much pressure on yourself. Just try to really think about what you like and what makes you excited. It could take you a while, but explore your options.”

We take sexual assault ‘very seriously,’” 95 percent of American university presidents said in a montage of press releases on cases of sexual assault and rape that occur on or near their respective campuses. Their goal, however, may not be to protect the students, but to “protect the institution first,” as proven, unfortunately, throughout the film “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary presented by Greek and Campus Life at the Gold Coast Cinema in Hillwood Commons on Tues., Feb. 28. The film explored and exploited, case by case, rape culture in universities nation-wide.
The trajectory of the documentary followed several narratives of reported rapes on college campuses, beginning with the exhilarating moments of their college acceptances and ending with the tragic acts of their assaults and lack of support from those colleges.
Along with personal stories, the documentary included a myriad of national statistics and press releases about instances on college campuses in which a rape or assault occurred. According to the documentary, more than 16 percent of women are raped on college campuses, meaning one in five women experience rape within their four years of college. Of that 16 percent, 88 percent do not report their assaults, and only two to eight percent are false reports.
Throughout the documentary, students witnessed the inaction of the school and administration and the underreporting of these rape cases. Victims subjected to victim blaming, dissuaded and shamed for “crying rape” and putting these “safe” universities at risk of losing potential students.
“Just being a woman on a college campus and seeing someone brave enough to come out and say ‘this happened to me’ and to not receive help because of the money, it’s disgusting,” a student in the audience said.
In more cases than not, the instigator of the rape or assault goes free and without reprimand from the university. The documentary showed a disparaging comparison between the number of reported rapes and the number of expulsions, suspensions, or any action at all taken against the rapists, exposing more than 100 universities with a disproportion of over 100-200 reports and 0-3 expulsions.
The leading narrative followed Andrea Pino and Annie Clark, two rape survivors, coincidentally from the same university, who had experienced this lack of support, and banded together to create the organization End Rape On Campus. This organization utilized Title IX, a federal law prohibiting gender discrimination in education, to hold their university accountable for letting their rapists go free. Title IX cases hit universities’ federal funding.
Pino and Clark set out on a road trip, traveling to universities all over the country to meet with other silenced rape victims and to educate as many people about Title IX as possible.
LIU Post takes active stances in both preventing and dealing with sexual assault and rape cases. “Every Campus Life staff member is trained in Title IX,” Joseph Vernace, a campus life coordinator, said. The student bill of rights is posted in every building on campus, making Title IX easily accessible to students.
“New York state is definitely one of the most progressive when it comes to sexual assault,” Heather Stevenson, the Campus Education Coordinator for the Safe Center LI, who’s goal is to restore hope for victims of abuse, domestic/dating violence, and rape/ sexual assault, said. “That’s pretty evident here at Post, being in an environment – an empowered community – that doesn’t condone rape and sexual assault.”
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE), a fraternity at LIU Post, decided in the Fall semester to promote awareness for sexual assault on campuses and to take part in Post’s second annual “Take Back the Night” (TBTN) movement. “Embarrassed and outraged” that their SAE brothers across the nation have given their fraternity the negative alias, “Sexual Assault Expected (SAE),” as well as coining the phrase “no means yes, yes means anal,” the LIU Post chapter of the fraternity joined TBTN to make a difference and show that sexual assault will not be tolerated.
Joining their pledge are the fraternities Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, and Phi Sigma Kappa, as well as the office of Campus Life and the Safe Center LI. Together they have hosted several events on campus, including the “Pillow Project” in November 2016, in which fraternity members carried pillows decorated with statistics and quotes on rape and sexual assault around campus, mirroring a similar mattress project done by a female student at Columbia University; “Walk a Mile In Her Shoes,” an event on March 7 where men walked a mile in heels to support victims of rape and sexual assault; and the screening of “The Hunting Ground” to get members of the campus community to start a dialogue on rape and sexual assault.
Future events by Greek and Campus Life include a self-defense seminar in partnership with the Kung Fu club and self defense experts from Long Island on March 20 & 21 during common hour, and the big event, TBTN on March 30 at 7 p.m. in the Pratt Recreation Center. All proceeds will support the End Rape on Campus movement by providing funds for educational programs, training, and support on sexual assault.

A fire broke out in the second floor kitchenette of Queens Residential Hall midday Monday, March 6. The fire was caused by a cooking incident – a popcorn bag accidentally placed in the microwave for 20 minutes instead of the advised two and a half minutes. Smoke quickly filled the second floor and the alarm was sounded.
Students exiting the residence hall assumed the alarm to be another drill, and were surprised to find the fire marshall was not waiting outside for them as in previous months.
After ten minutes of the continuous alarm blaring, students were visibly anxious and began to ask questions. Several residents from the second floor said that the second floor was filling with smoke; another saw the door to the kitchenette propped open with trash cans.
Kenneth Conn, a night electrician, later confirmed a small kitchen fire. “Someone overcooked their snack,” he said. After students were allowed to return inside, two public safety officers remained on the scene. The floor smelled of smoke, the microwave received scorch marks, and a window in the kitchenette broke as a result of the fire.
Representatives of Public Safety assured the incident had been contained and no one was injured, but made no further comments.

This summer, up to 15 students can earn three credits by taking a trip to Slovenia and studying abroad in an ECO 44 course, led by economics professor Veronika Dolar. The trip will run from June 28 to July 10, and also feature visits to Vienna, Austria; Venice, Italy; and Pula, Croatia.
According to the course’s website, liuslovenia.weebly.com, activities include the chance to swim in the Mediterranean Sea and in an Alpine Glacier Lake, go over 500 feet deep in a coal mine, then use a cable car to climb 6310 feet above the sea level in the Slovenian Alps. On the same day, visit the birthplace of the Lipizzaner horse, and tour “one of the most majestic caves in the world where baby dragons are born.”
Students will also have the chance to visit one of the most advanced thermal power stations in the world , which is not open to the general public. This is made possible because Dolar, who is from Slovenia, uses her connections in her native country to gain access to places and experiences other tourists wouldn’t have access to. “We get lectures by the foreign minister of labor, and when we go to my hometown, we get the welcoming party by the mayor of the city,” she said. Dolar led this summer travel course before in 2015. The course offers the chance for students to witness economic differences and similarities in other countries and cultures firsthand. And Slovenia specifically, Dolar says, is a great example for this. “It’s a very big welfare state, it has high taxes, and their GDP per capita is much lower,” she explained. “But I think when you go there, people are surprised by how good life is. This is something that I think is an eye-opener.” Dolar stated that visiting Slovenia allows students to see how countries do things differently, and that there are multiple approaches to solving problems in the economy and society.
Emil Andersson, an LIU Post alumnus who went on the trip in 2015, said the trip is mostly about the economic transition in Europe, how Yugoslavia transitioned into a free-market economy, and how the countries that separated from Yugoslavia created their own states. “It was easy to understand how economic policies influenced society,” he said. Andersson said he “absolutely” recommends the trip for students. “I learned a lot,” he said, adding that it was “a nice mixture of economics and history.” Andersson created a website about his experiences in this course, including his pictures and work from the trip and a blog, that can be found at emilandersson.weebly.com.
This course can appeal to more than just economic students, Dolar said. The course is cross-listed as a political science and international relations course but history, environmental science, art and business are key components of the trip as well. “Pretty much anybody can get something out of this,” she said.
This is only the second time that Dolar is offering this course. When the course was first offered in 2015, it did not feature visits to Austria and Croatia. Dolar said she thinks those places add another component to the history aspect of the trip.
The cost of this course is $4,653, which includes tuition and fees for accommodation, meals, in-country transportation, admission to events and museums and tours, according to the course site. Airfare is not included in that price. Dolar said students can travel with her on a flight from JFK to Vienna, but it can be up to $400 cheaper for students to buy their own tickets.
More information on the Slovenia trip can be found by contacting Dolar at veronika.dolar@liu.edu, or by visiting the course’s site. Students can apply by clicking on the “course registration” tab on the website, and filling out the application.

On Thursday, March 2, the Student Government Association (SGA) and Theta Chi teamed up to co-sponsor the campus’ first Silent Disco event in the Long Island Room of Winnick Student Center.
A silent disco is a popular event commonly held in the boroughs, it is a gathering of music-lovers dancing together, only the music is not played over speakers for all to hear; rather, it is heard through headphones given to participants at the beginning of the event. The end result is a bunch of people moving and grooving to what looks to be complete silence – insanity at its finest.
Aaron Cooper, a sophomore acting major and marshal for the Kappa Beta chapter of Theta Chi on-campus, said the idea came up during a fraternity meeting. “We brainstormed ideas for different events, and another brother and I came up with a silent disco,” he said. “It is something that hasn’t happened at Post before, and we were able to get SGA to co-sponsor the event with us.”
Adam Hornbuckle, a junior political science major and vice president of SGA, said, “[The fraternity] had all of the logistics down, but they needed some funding to put it on. Everyone in Student Government loved the idea.” About 50 people came to kick up their dancing shoes. Participants received a set of headphones, which played three separate music stations – EDM, Top 40, and Alternative – simultaneously. Listeners had the option to choose what kind of music they wanted to hear with the press of a button.
Admission was $5 for an hour and $10 for the night; all the proceeds were donated to Relay for Life, a total $609. Multiple campus organizations tabled at the disco by sponsoring their own booths. The Music Industry Club, Rainbow Alliance, Phi Sigma Kappa, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Zeta, and Sigma Delta Tau showed their support by selling baked goods and merchandise at the event. Theta Chi offered a non-alcoholic black-light drink bar, including their signature “Theta Chi lattes,” and a 50/50 raffle. Cooper commented, “Since we will be catering to different tastes in music, I think this will be a great opportunity to bring many people from across campus together for a great cause.”
“It’s something new for students to try, and it’s [SGA’s] pleasure to help Theta Chi put on the event,” Hornbuckle said. “We’re always here to help facilitate great ideas that clubs and organizations have, whether it’s through advising or bankrolling it; we’re happy to help.”

Summer, summer, summer, summer, wait, rewind, it’s still winter. It’s official, spring break is here, with just two days of classes left. All-inclusive hotel and flight prices are skyrocketing as we speak. Middle and high school students are not included in the college spring break ritual, but still look forward to it starting from their early days of middle school. Each year, college students across the country get together and go on trips with their friends to places like Miami, Cancun, and the Dominican Republic. Let’s see where Post students are going this year.
“I’ve always wanted to go to Miami for the lavish lifestyle, the nightlife and the endless parties, and fortunately, I will be going there with my best friends this spring break.” Allison Wayne, a junior biology major, mentioned. All-inclusive tickets to Miami are starting at $499 on major vacation ticketing sites. Miami offers the first-time goer the nightlife that will bring them back next year, with bars that serve cocktails and margaritas that start at $2 and last all night long, streets that are filled with parties to the point where one doesn’t have to pay to get into a club because they can party outside, and even hotels that are right on the boardwalk of the nearest beach.
Not everyone wants to escape to a mini- summer vacation in Miami for spring break. Some students are going to the mountains to ski, sled and enjoy the cold and snowy weather while it lasts. “I feel as though Miami and all those other popular places are played-out, and everyone’s always going there, so in an effort to be different I’ve organized a trip between my siblings and my friends to head up to the Poconos for spring break,” Thomas Severe, a freshman English major, said. “I can have fun within New York, but there’s so much out there that I don’t even know exists, so explain to me why I should limit myself to the five boroughs of New York.”
Camelback Resort, located in the Poconos Mountains, has started its spring break packages at $1300 for six days and five nights for a family of four, but tickets must have been bought before March 3rd to get the special.
With such a short amount of time to go on vacation, some students stay at home and make money. Danielle Akamba, a junior English major commented, “I honestly don’t believe the hype behind spring break; it’s just another American excuse to go and waste money.”
Due to the fact that most students don’t have Friday classes, spring break starts this Thursday for many students who will be off to classes again on March 20th.
Syracuse, here I come.

Most LGBT students and allies feel they have the right to express themselves freely and without judgment, and the Rainbow Alliance advocates for this cause. President of the Rainbow Alliance, Christina DiSilvestro, a senior public relations major, along with junior broadcasting major and vice president Alexandra Tiso, reinstated the Rainbow Alliance in Sept. 2016. DiSilvestro explained the club’s purpose, “The Rainbow Alliance is a safe-place for those who are inside of the LGBTQ community and its allies. We welcome anyone who is willing to step outside of the normal boundary and get down to business to help support the LGBTQ community with fun events and fundraisers!”
The club was started years ago, but stopped running because of decline in members. In fall 2015, other students tried to revive the club, but did not have enough members or a good advertising team. “I didn’t know anything about it; we had no clue it was an already a founded club,” Tiso said.
In Sept. 2016, DiSilvestro and Tiso began planning and revamping in order to bring the Rainbow Alliance back. During the fall semester, they did the paperwork, rewrote the club’s constitution, and got approval from the head of campus life, Matt Blanar, for the club to be active again. With the help of the head of student clubs, Tara Ernst, who met with DiSilvestro and Tiso every Monday and helped fill out the five-star papers that are required for all clubs, the Rainbow Alliance was ready to restart. DiSilvestro and Tiso began tabling events in Hillwood Commons to gain members. “We got over 50 signatures in two months,” Tiso said of their efforts during the fall semester. Over winter break, Tiso and DiSilvestro worked together to prepare for their first Rainbow Alliance meeting.
On Jan. 25, 2017, the Rainbow Alliance held its first meeting, with 22 people in attendance. They now hold meetings every Wednesday at 12:30 p.m., with more and more members in attendance. During the meetings, the members discuss events, fundraisers, and end with an open discussion. At this time, a question that a member wrote is picked out of a jar, and the members discuss and give their own input.
The Rainbow Alliance held a bake sale in Hillwood on Feb. 21 and raised $60 to help with event costs for the Take Back the Night event that will be held on March 30 in the Pratt Recreation Center; they will also take part in that event. There are many events coming up for the Rainbow Alliance such as another bake sale and their Pride week, an event-filled week to honor the LGBT community.
The bake sale will take place on March 7 in Hillwood at 12:30 p.m. to raise money for club t-shirts and Pride week. On March 27, a transgender speaker will address students in the Gold Coast Cinema and will play the trailer for the documentary “Real Boy,” which will be played the following day at the Tilles Center. The club’s Pride week begins April 17 and ends on the 20. Each day, an event will be directed towards LGBT activism. Their biggest events are the candlelight vigil and the Pride week finale. On April 17, the club will hold a candlelight vigil to honor those who passed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. On April 20, the Rainbow Alliance is taking over Hillwood; you can get your makeup done by an artist, drink a milkshake, take lots of photos, and dance to music sponsored by WCWP, the campus radio station.
With the help of the Rainbow Alliance, LGBT students and allies across campus have found a place to express their beliefs and find friends that understand them. Julio Feliciano Jr., a senior public relations major, who also handles the club’s PR, said, “This club has honestly touched me in a way I could have never expected. It is just so amazing to finally have a club that is for individuals that identity under the LGBTQ umbrella. And I am very excited on what the club will be doing for the rest of the semester and for future years to come.”
To join the Rainbow Alliance, email Alexandra.tiso@my.liu.edu or attend the club’s meeting Wednesday during common hour in Hillwood room 109.

Leah, pet of junior psychology major Marissa Angelo, is a one-year-old pitbull. Leah joined Angelo and her family in Sept. 2015 from a breeder on Long Island. “She helps me with stress because when I go home to visit, she jumps all over me and is so loving that I forget what I was stressed about in the first place,” Angelo said. Leah and Angelo love running around outside together. “I am so happy she is a part of our family. She brings so much joy to our lives.”
