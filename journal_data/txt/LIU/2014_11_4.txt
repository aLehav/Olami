On Nov. 10, a box set of unreleased Bob Dylan lyrics will come to life in the album titled “Lost On the River: The New Basement Tapes.” About a year ago, musician and producer T-Bone Burnett received a message from the legendary folk-singer’s publisher, asking if he wanted to do something with Dylan’s songs, which were all hand-written in 1967 during his “Basement Tapes” hiatus. Dylan supported the distribution of his unreleased lyrics to Burnett.
With a uniquely rare project underway, Burnett asked no more questions, setting out to find a collaborative force of musicians to bring Dylan’s words to life. In March 2014, Elvis Costello, Rhiannon Giddens, Taylor Goldsmith, Jim James, and Marcus Mumford were invited to Capitol Studios, in the basement of the Capitol Records building in Hollywood, to arrange these playful lyrics. Burnett trusted that each of these artists had the talent and ability to illuminate the original spirit intended in these 47-year-old lyrics.
Dylan is one of the world’s most acclaimed and critically driven artists, and has touched the hearts of millions. In December 1960,
Dylan left his native state of Minnesota for New York, and started playing various gigs at local clubs in Greenwich Village. Within a few months, Dylan became increasingly active in New York’s flourishing folk scene. By the beginning of 1964, he cemented himself within the folk community. Despite the fame and success he achieved early in his career, Dylan never seemed to forget the roots of his musical inspiration.
One of Dylan’s earlier influences was Woody Guthrie, the American singer-songwriter known largely for the patriotic song,
“This Land is Your Land.” Dylan often paid homage to his hero at performances by telling the crowd he’d been traveling around the country following in Guthrie’s footsteps. Shortly after his arrival in New York, Dylan would frequently visit Guthrie at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, where he was suffering from Huntington’s disease. As a tribute to the “Dust Bowl Troubadour,” Dylan released “Song to Woody” on his debut album in 1961. In this song, Dylan seems to have a final word with Guthrie, reminiscing about an unpredictable world, but a spirit left untangled—referring to Guthrie’s. The ghost voice of Guthrie continues to live on through the “Freewheelin’” mind of Dylan.
Burnett’s musicians embark on a similar quest to now speak the language of Dylan. “You try your best to make a strong foundation, and dress it up however you like,” said Sam Beam of Iron & Wine, in an interview with Sound Opinions, a Chicago-based radio talk show. After two weeks in the studio, Burnett’s team of artists did just that. They put together 40 recordings, the first 20 of which will be released on the new album this November. As Dylan once saw in Guthrie’s work, this project strives to embody the same concept. The same music may be “hittin’ some hard travellin’ along the way,” but that doesn’t mean it’ll go away either.

The women’s soccer team continued its winning streak to close out the regular season on the road. The seven-hour bus ride to upstate New York over the weekend ended with two goal-scoring contests for the guests, who are now looking to bring the momentum to the next stage of the season—the East Coast Conference playoffs.
The Pioneers kicked off early in the late afternoon game under the lights in Rochester, N.Y., on Friday, Oct. 31. Whether it was the cold weather or the cause of an offensive drive from the Pioneers, the hosts from Roberts Wesleyan College froze only minutes in when senior forward Lauren Bellone caught up a loose ball in front of the Wesleyan goal.
The Green Machine doubled up after 13 minutes of play, this time from a corner kick whipped in by junior forward Susanne Vistnes. Senior defender Rebecca Swedberg met the cross in the box, to make it her first of the season.
However, Roberts Wesleyan did not go about unanswered. Before half time, the referee filed a penalty that the home side rolled in behind sophomore goalkeeper Hrafnhildur Agnarsdottir.
After the 2-1 score, the Pioneers lost their momentum for some time, and the game evened out in chances. Regrouping in half time, the Green and Gold came out solid, not letting Roberts Wesleyan back in the game. Instead, they could take advantage of the forcing attempts from the home side with speedy counter attacks. The Pioneers scored not once, but twice during the final minutes of play, ending comfortably with a 4-1 win.
In the second game against Daemen College, on Sunday, Nov. 2, not much changed for the Pioneers. As the weather remained chilly, the offensive peak did, too.
The narrow, turf field did not seem to complicate the drive forward; starting from a dominant midfield, chance after chance was created in the offensive third. On the other side, the defensive line did not let Daemen disturb Agnarsdottir in goal, who could record yet another clean sheet. As the final whistle blew, the scoreboard shone 0-5 to the Pioneers.
Next up for the team will be a home game in the East Coast Conference playoffs, scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 5. Up for the round will be Bridgeport, with kick-off at 1.30 p.m.

The No. 5 ranked field hockey team (11-2) returned to action on Wednesday, Oct. 30, when they traveled to Garden City, N.Y., to battle with the No. 7 ranked Panthers from Adelphi University (10-4). The Pioneers were superb both offensively and defensively, netting five goals and shutting out the highly touted Panther offense.
In the 12th minute of the contest, the Pioneers had a golden scoring opportunity and they took full advantage of it. Off a corner from junior forward Keliann Margiotta, graduate defender Dani Crouse found the back of the net to give the visitors the quick 1-0 lead. Both teams played stellar defense for the remainder of the first half, but the Pioneers managed to outshoot the Panthers, giving them some confidence heading into halftime.
Just minutes into the second half, Margiotta capitalized on a scramble in front of the net and found the back of the cage to put the Pioneers up two goals. Freshman forward Kaycee Zelkovsky then put the game out of reach with two goals in a four-minute span. Margiotta put the cherry on top with a goal in the 66th minute. The Pioneers totaled 19 shots and the suffocating LIU defense allowed measly five shots on the afternoon. Sophomore goalkeeper Ericka Parks kept the Panthers off the scoreboard and recorded three saves in the victory.
With their confidence sky high, the Green and Gold traveled to Vermont on Saturday, Nov. 1, when they faced off against the Purple Knights from St. Michaels College (8-6). The Pioneers got the best of their Northeast-10 Conference rival in a match that featured one lone goal.
The first 35 minutes of action saw a total of zero goals, as both sides played very strong on the defensive end. In the 42nd minute, Crouse found Margiotta inside the circle and Margiotta scored a goal, the only one that day. The Pioneers racked up 21 shots while the Purple Knights totaled zero. Parks earned her ninth victory on the season and posted back-to-back shutouts.
On the season, the Pioneers rank first in the nation with 4.21 goals per game. Individually, Margiotta has scored 24 of LIU’s 53 goals so far while accumulating 10 assists. She also currently leads all of Division II in average goals per game with 1.91.
Head Coach Raenee Savin and her squad return to action on Friday, Nov. 7, when they welcome Bellarmine University to Brookville, N.Y. Game time is set for 2 p.m.

On Friday, Oct. 31, the men’s soccer team (13-3-1) took the field against the Redhawks from Roberts Wesleyan College (10-6-2). The Pioneers dominated in every facet of the game and cruised to a 6-0 victory in Rochester N.Y. The victory gave the Pioneers a clean slate for the month of October, as they won all eight of their matches and posted four shutouts.
The Pioneers grabbed the lead in the 10th minute and never looked back. Graduate forward Dale McDonald sent a pass to sophomore forward Johann Kristjansson who netted his second goal of the season. Just six minutes later, McDonald was able to beat the keeper to put the Pioneers up 2-0.
Already leading and with momentum on their side, the visitors stayed aggressive. Freshman back David Arvidsson was the recipient of a pass from sophomore back Johannes Forgaard and the freshman tallied his first collegiate goal. A little over a minute later, McDonald scored his second goal of the contest, pushing the Pioneer lead to 4-0 at halftime.
The Pioneers outshot the Redhawks 7-1 in the first half and continued their stellar play in the second half. The hosts were kept off the score board while the Green and Gold added two more goals, putting the game on ice. Kristjansson and Arvidsson each added their second goals on the evening to round out the scoring. In the net, junior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom stopped the one shot that came his way and earned another shutout.
The Pioneers returned to action on Sunday, Nov. 2, when they visited the Daemen College Wildcats (5-10) in their regular season finale. The Pioneers continued their dominance and came away with a 5-0 victory.
The Pioneers got the scoring started with a goal in the eighth minute from Kristjansson. From that point on, the Green and Gold did not look back. Only minutes later, McDonald conducted one of his many chances to double the lead.
The first half was very physical, as yellow cards were handed out to multiple players. Senior forward Eivind Austboe got a penalty kick as a result from the overly-physical Wildcats and netted the shot. Less than five minutes after scoring the penalty kick, Austboe connected for another goal, his 15th on the season.
The Pioneers set the tone for the match, with 19 shots compared to just seven for the hosts. With back-to-back shutout victories, the Pioneers pushed their winning streak to a season high of nine games. The Pioneers, who are peaking at the right time, will face off against the Dowling College Lions on Thursday, Nov. 6, in a conference semi-final playoff game. Kickoff is slated for 1.30 p.m.

On Saturday, Nov. 1, the football team (6- 3) cruised to a 28-3 victory against Northeast-10 Conference foe Southern Connecticut State (2-7) at Jess Dow Field in New Haven, Conn. The Pioneers are now one win away from clinching a spot in the NE-10 Championship game on Nov. 15. American International has already earned the league’s top spot following a 24-21 triumph against Merrimack College on Nov. 1.
After falling behind 3-0 early in the first quarter, the Pioneers grabbed their first lead of the contest with a touchdown at the 2:47 mark. Red- shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino completed back-to-back passes to red-shirt freshman wideouts Kyle Ward and James Higgins for a crucial first down. The drive was capped off by a 22-yard keeper by Laurino for the score.
One LIU possession later, the Green and Gold converted a fake punt on fourth-and-three. Senior punter Tyler Feely dashed for 13 yards to move the chains to the Owl 28-yard line. On the following snap, Laurino connected with red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer on a 28-yard strike into the end zone to extend LIU’s advantage to 14-3.
The visitors kept the pressure on the Owl defense, as they tacked on another touchdown. Red- shirt freshman running back Michael Million and sophomore running back David White carried the ball for 17-and-11-yard gains to the put the Pioneers back in Owl territory. Laurino then lobbed a jump ball into the end zone that was hauled in by red-shirt sophomore wideout Shane Hubbard. The touchdown gave the Pioneers a 21-3 advantage.
In the latter stanza, the Pioneers built on their 18-point cushion after anchoring a 10-play 82-yard drive resulting in a nine-yard touchdown pass from Laurino to Palmer. The 28-3 lead for the Pioneers held up, and the final touchdown summed up the afternoon for the Green and Gold.
Laurino finished 21-of-36 for 281 yards and three touchdowns. White had 18 rushes for 91 yards, while Palmer caught six passes for 76 yards and two touchdowns. Hubbard had four receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown, as well.
Defensively, red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti and red-shirt sophomore defensive back Justin Ortiz led the squad with six tackles apiece. Red-shirt junior linebacker Brandon Cheney totaled five stops. Ortiz and Cheney each tallied a sack as well. As a unit, LIU recorded five sacks and two takeaways in the win.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers wrap up the 2014 regular season on Saturday, Nov. 8, when they host Bentley University on Senior Day at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Kickoff is slated for noon.
