With the NHL just over a month into its season, there have been quite a few surprises, growing expectations for teams and potential new audiences growing in the league. 
One of the biggest standouts so far this season in the NHL is the Buffalo Sabres. Last season, the Sabres traded away their franchise player Jack Eichel to the Las Vegas Golden Knights after contract disputes and disagreements over his surgically repaired neck rehabilitation. 
After this trade, the Sabres turned their focus to a full-on youth movement. Highlighted by their young stars in Owen Power, Jack Quinn and Casey Mittelstadt, the Sabres are currently defying all expectations, as they currently sit seventh in the Eastern Division, just behind the powerhouse teams in the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. 
In addition to the Buffalo Sabres, another team that has stood out after a month of play is the Philadelphia Flyers. Under new head coach John Tortorella, the Flyers have come out with new energy and have been playing at a high level versus tough competition. Right now, the Flyers are fourth in the very tough Metropolitan Division and have been getting great production from Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, as he has two goals and six assists in 12 games.
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell spoke about these early season surprises from the Sabres and Flyers. 
“I’m definitely surprised by the Sabres and Flyers so far. I thought that the Sabres had potential, but I did not think they would be this good this quickly,” Campbell said. “I expected the Flyers to be awful, but they’re playing well so far. I’m sure that they’ll fall off at some point.” 
Highlighting the two New York hockey teams, the Islanders and Rangers both are off to great starts this season. Right now, the Rangers are fifth in the Metropolitan Division with 15 points, and the Islanders second in the division with 18 points in only 14 games played. 
The Rangers and Islanders are being led by their elite starting goaltending. Reigning Vezina award winner Igor Shesterkin is currently 6-2 with 2.58 goals allowed per game average. On the other side, Ilya Sorokin is 6-3 with 2.20 goals allowed per game. 
In addition, these two teams have some of the most explosive offenses in the league. The Rangers currently have one of the NHL’s top three performers in the month of October with Artemi Panarin, while the Islanders are scoring the sixth most goals per game with 3.6.
Even though the Rangers have a top three star of the month, graduate speech pathology student Ryan Branigan wants his favorite team to add a mega-star into the mix. 
“A trade rumor that’s been popular has been for Patrick Kane. I don’t know if that is the best move given what it would take to get him, but that move would obviously be an exciting one,” said Branigan.
Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks has been rumored as a New York Rangers trade candidate as his time in Chicago is starting to become clouded with a youth movement and contract issues beginning to bubble. With or without Kane, Branigan went on to mention how important this season is for the fans and supporters of the Rangers. 
“The Rangers’ expectations are at least to make the Stanley Cup, if not win it. Anything less than another deep playoff run will be looked at as a disappointment,” Branigan implored. 
Brady Campbell, a fan of the Islanders, also has high expectations for his favorite team. 
“Obviously, there were some things that were out of their control last year, but they were also not good. Most of the core is still here, and I definitely think this team should be a playoff team,” Campbell explained. “They are built for the playoffs, so once they get there, I think they could make a run, but the first important thing is to get back to the dance.” 
Though the NHL season is just beginning, hockey fever is starting to sweep over New York once again, with Stanley Cup dreams in sight.

Tuesday, Nov. 1, marked the NFL’s annual trade deadline, which limits teams from making trades with each other till the end of the Super Bowl. This year, the NFL trade deadline was one of the busiest transaction-filled weeks in history. 
In particular, there were 10 trades involving 12 players on the deadline. This total is the NFL record for any single trade deadline day. 
This NFL trade deadline also brought a different energy to fans. Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell spoke about how this season’s trade deadline wasn’t the same.
“It was a really exciting trade deadline this year, which is something that the NFL has lacked. The trade deadline has been one of the few things about the league that they did worse than the MLB, NHL, and NBA,” Campbell said. “It was cool to see a couple of stars get moved as well. Hopefully, this is a yearly thing now with the amount of trades at the deadline.” 
Specifically, at the NFL trade deadline, both the New York Jets and New York Giants made some trades that were questioned by many fans. 
For the Jets, they made two trades before the trade deadline, including the addition of running back James Robinson from the Jacksonville Jaguars and the trading away of edge rusher Jacob Martin to the Broncos. 
Running back James Robinson has been productive for the Jets so far in replace of rookie running back Breece Hall, who tore his ACL in the Jets matchup versus the Denver Broncos. In two games, Robinson has 70 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. 
Graduate speech pathology major Ryan Branigan thinks the Jets got away with a steal in James Robinson. 
“James Robinson is a solid back that got disrespected in Jacksonville. He’s a good pass catcher and downhill runner, and he should fit in nicely with the Jets,” Branigan said. “It was a good addition, given how cheap it was to acquire him. It helps them right now, but I don’t know about the future.”
On the other side of Metlife Stadium, the New York Giants didn’t make a big splash addition to their roster, but traded away a disgruntled asset. Second-year wide receiver Kadarius Toney, who has battled injuries and disputes with coaches, was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a conditional third-round pick and a sixth-round pick. 
As a Giants fan, Brady Campbell thinks that the Toney trade was inevitable. 
“The Kadarius Toney trade is an interesting one for the Giants. He had shown that he is very talented and could be a star here. At the same time, he couldn’t stay healthy and he was constantly hurt,” Campbell explained. “In the end, it didn’t seem like he wanted to be here, so I think it was the right move for both the Giants and Toney.” 
Besides the New York teams, many other league-altering trades happened during the NFL trade deadline. Some notable moves included franchise tight end T.J. Hockenson being traded from the Detroit Lions to the Minnesota Vikings, linebacker Roquan Smith being shipped from the Chicago Bears to the Baltimore Ravens, and wide receiver Chase Claypool being sent to the Chicago Bears from the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
These teams’ moves were notable, but there was one team that stood out compared to the rest. The Miami Dolphins went all in on this NFL trade deadline, as they traded a first-round pick and more for Denver Broncos edge rusher Bradley Chubb and a fifth-round pick for running back Jeff Wilson Jr. from the San Francisco 49’ers.  
Now with the season past the midseason mark, things are looking competitive and wide open in the NFL with nine weeks left. 
“Last week proved again, any given Sunday, anyone can beat anyone with the Jets upsetting the Bills,” Branigan said. “I’m looking forward to seeing what happens in the second half and the playoffs because I have no clue.”

When he passed away in August 2020, the death of actor Chadwick Boseman was felt throughout the world. He was most known for his role as the “Black Panther” in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He suddenly died of cancer in 2020 and fans were heartbroken, especially because “Black Panther’s” story was only getting started. 
The overwhelming success of the first Black Panther movie in 2018 made it obvious that fans wanted a sequel. The sequel was in production at the time of Boseman’s death, but with the main character now gone, delays in the filming process were inevitable. 
Fans began looking for answers about the future of their beloved character which are now finally going to be answered on Nov. 11, 2022 when the sequel film, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, hits theaters. 
Arguably, the biggest shock about the film is not going to be the fate of the “Black Panther” character, but the fact that the team was able to get Rihanna to be featured on the soundtrack of the film. 
It has been six years since Rihanna released her commercially and critically acclaimed studio album Anti. This album is the last that fans have heard of Rihanna’s solo music. Until now. 
Rihanna’s hiatus from the music industry began when she made the decision to enter the beauty world where she now owns the empire known as Fenty Beauty. Her fans, the Navy, have supported her through this endeavor, but have missed what Rihanna first became famous for, her music. 
Rihanna’s new single, titled “Lift Me Up,” was released on Friday, Oct. 28, 2022 and it comes directly from the soundtrack of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. 
The song itself is a stripped down ballad that focuses on Rihanna’s vocal performance to tell the story. The song discusses themes of loss and grief as a tribute to Boseman. 
Fans had generally positive opinions of the song upon first listen. Some are saying that it was exactly what she needed to do, while others are missing the pop radio legend she was in the 2010’s. 
“I guess this feels like something a little bit different for her. Interesting now that she’s a mother. It has a lullaby fee,” junior English adolescent education major Alyssa Tamburo said. 
Rihanna’s new found motherhood can be a direct influence of her new musical endeavor. She had given birth back in May 2022, as per a TMZ report. Besides that piece of information, there is no public information about her baby as Rihanna has decided to keep the baby’s life private. 
Fans of Rihanna and Boseman expressed appreciation of the larger sentimental value of the song.
“I think that ‘Lift Me Up’ is a beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman and it should not be evaluated as something more than that. This is clearly something that Rihanna felt was necessary to help deliver the message of the film [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever] and that is why she released it. I do not think we should consider the start of her new musical era, but instead this should be a standalone single that honors the life of a powerful man.” junior business administration major Rebecca Margolin said. 
Rihanna’s return to the music industry was inevitable. It is obvious that her “Navy” missed her dearly. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will be released on Nov. 11, 2022 and based on the clues found within the song’s lyrics, “Lift Me Up,” will be played at the film’s most heavily anticipated scene, Boseman’s memorial.

In recent months, the new hosts of the hit game show Jeopardy have been getting mixed reviews from fans. The classic television trivia series has recently adopted a dual hosting format after the passing of long-time host Alex Trebek. 
Recently-instituted hosts Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik have taken on a unique style of scheduling. Jennings has hosted from September and will continue into December for the regular season. Bialik will take over in the new year to host new tournaments such as The National College Championship.
Some watchers of Jeopardy have stopped watching the show completely, and others feel hesitant to see the show with new hosts. Fans at Post were passionate about giving their outlook on upcoming seasons.
A student on campus and a former Jeopardy fan said she turned away from watching the show because of the change. 
“They should have just been done with Jeopardy after Alex Trebek died … He was the face of Jeopardy, and if he’s not there to host, it’s just not the same,” junior international business and finance major Emma Thibodeau said.
Trebek was the face of Jeopardy for 37 seasons. He was 80 years old when he passed away from pancreatic cancer in November 2020.
Student and self-proclaimed casual watcher also misses Trebek. 
“I like the consistency of having one host. The thing with Alex Trebek is that you’re growing an attachment to that person and the way they run things in their style.” junior international business major Emma Thibodeau said.
Not all reviews of the new hosts are negative, however. Many are excited about the diversity Mayim Bialik, a Jewish woman in STEM, brings to the show.
Thibodeau shared her thoughts on whether she would ever consider watching the show again with the new hosts .
 “I definitely like that they have a woman on there now since like the ’70s it’s been a male … So, maybe I will check out some of her episodes,” she said. 
Bialik’s co-host Ken Jennings is a record-breaking former Jeopardy contestant, who has come under fire for multiple controversial tweets. His most discussed tweet was from 2014 when he said “Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair.” Many Jeopardy fans were disgusted and disheartened by the tweet, and feel uncomfortable watching new seasons of the show.
Sophomore data analytics major Devon Linden shared his thoughts on if the Jennings controversies have steered him away from watching.
“As someone who assists the disabled routinely, I’m honestly pretty appalled by the tweet. It’s really disgusting basically equating someone’s value and physical beauty to their ability or disability,” he stated.
Jennings has also come under fire for a recent ruling when he allowed a guest to correct himself after mispronouncing a word. Earlier in the season, another guest had said the wrong first name when giving the full name of an answer, but was not allowed to correct herself due to the question only asking for the last name. Some fans claimed that this was sexist, but the game allows corrections of pronunciation, but not of word or phrase.
Overall, the dual hosting schedule seems to be over complicated and confusing to many, and the inexperienced and controversial hosts have turned many viewers away. Many fans seem to be hesitant about watching the newest seasons of Jeopardy and feel that the show is not the same without the original host personality, Alex Trebek.

Drake and 21 Savage released a music video for their song, “Jimmy Crooks.” The video ends with a scene of the two artists announcing their upcoming album together, “Her Loss.” 
This is not Drake and 21 Savage’s first collaboration together. They’ve both featured on many songs together like, “Knife Talk” off of Drake’s album “Certified Lover Boy,” “Mr. Right Now” off of 21 Savage and Metro Boomin’s album, “Savage Mode II.” Each time both rappers collaborated, they received an immense amount of listens. Their song “Knife Talk” has about 65 million views on Youtube.  
Both rappers have an impressive track record that demonstrates their ability to bounce off one another and compliment each other’s voices. Drake’s music is described as the “nice guy” of the hip-hop/rap industry. He raps about women from his past and present. While Savage raps about growing up on the streets, gun violence, or about his enemies. The two are very different but can balance each other’s energies.  
Their new song “Jimmy Cooks” comes from the character Drake played in Degrassi: Next Generation, Jimmy Brooks. Drake held this role for about eight years, making it very special to him. This song debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Drake fans on campus were very excited about the news of a joint album.
“I am such a huge fan of Drake and 21 Savage so when I heard the news they were releasing an album together I was ecstatic. I made sure to send the instagram post to my friends who would be just as excited as me,” senior finance major Elijah Stout said. 
The album was set to be released on Oct. 28, 2022 but now will be put out later than expected. Drake’s long time producer Noah Shebib just contracted COVID-19, delaying the release of the album. 
Drake posted to his Instagram story a statement about pushing back the album: “Our brother @ovo40 got covid while mixing and mastering the crack so he’s resting up and NOVEMBER 4th is ‘Her Loss’ Day. We’ll see you soon.”
Fans are upset they have to wait an extra week for the album, but they expressed it is worth the wait.
“Drake and 21 Savage delayed ‘Her Loss’… it’s more like our loss. This was something I was looking forward to but hey all good things come to those who wait. At least Rihanna’s new song was able to get all the attention since it’s been 6 years since she released something,” business administration major Michael Gonazles said. 
The two artists recently unveiled their tracklist hours before the release. On the record there will be 16 songs: “Rich Flex,” “Major Distribution,” “On BS,” “Backoutsideboyz,” “Privileged Rappers,” “Spin Bout U,” “Hours in Silence,” “Treacherous Twins,” “Circo Loco,” P—y & Millions,” “Broke Boys,” “Middle of the Ocean,” “Jumbotron S–t Poppin,” “More M’s”, “3 AM on Glenwood” and “I Guess It’s F–k Me.”
Not only did they release the track list, but they decided to troll their fans with a fake cover of Vogue magazine, as well as a fake NPR Tiny Desk concert and an interview on the Howard Stern Show. 
Fans of the two artists found the promotional antics funny and entertaining as they wait for the album.
“They got us good,” junior at St. Francis Prep High School Gabriel Stout said. “I kept sharing every post with my friends group chat only to find out it was fake. I love when artists can play around with their fans, especially hyping it up for when the album drops.” 
Drake and 21 Savage’s new album ‘Her Loss’ will be out Nov. 4, 2022.

On Thursday, Oct. 27, a new group on campus, The Shark Social Group, collaborated with The Center for Healthy Living to host their Halloween-themed kick-off event.  
Various students showed up in costume ready to play the “haunting” board game “Betrayal at the House on the Hill.” 
This event served as an opportunity for students to mingle while simultaneously learning lessons on combating social anxiety. Staff from The Center for Healthy Living joined students to talk about how intimidating socialization could be.
The director for the Center for Healthy Living, Dawn Loshigian, is overjoyed to be working with the Shark Social Group. 
“I’m beyond excited, to watch everyone play this interesting and spooky game is really cool,” Loshigian said. 
“Part of college life is more than just academics. It’s about experiences. It’s about fun, it’s about connecting with other people. It’s important for students to engage,” Loshigian said. 
The mission of The Shark Social Group is to increase group socialization for both commuters and students that live on campus. The group also prioritizes mental health and aims to help people overcome their anxieties. The Shark Social Group hopes to become a safe space on campus
This is a very personal project for the co-founder and sophomore health science major, Alexa Rivas, who’s a commuter student with anxiety. 
Rivas has her own fears when it comes to socializing but she’s making great strides to help students with similar struggles. 
“There’s a lot of commuters on campus who don’t get a chance to come to a lot of events. It’s definitely important to have people meet each other and to help people out,” Rivas said. 
Many future events will be in collaboration with The Center for Healthy Living.
“I’m hoping to do a lot of things that pertain to mental health, so The Center for Healthy Living is a big part of it,” Rivas said. 
Although there wasn’t time during common hour to finish the lengthy game of “Betrayal at the House on the Hill,” the fact students showed up and socialized is seen as a success to Rivas. 
“I found this to be a fun success for our first event,” freshman political science major Aiden Litwin said. 
Litwin is the co-founder of The Shark Social Group alongside Rivas. As a commuter, Litwin also struggles with the social aspect of college. 
“I agree with Alexa and why this club is essential to have here,” Litwin said. “Post is a predominantly commuter community, so I feel it’s important.”
Shark Social’s next event will be held during common hour on Thursday, Nov. 17 in Hillwood Commons. They will be holding a food drive where they will be accepting nonperishable food donations.

WCWP radio station, home of 88.1 FM is under new leadership. Post alumni and former WCWP member, Peter Bellotti, is now the new director of the station. Bellotti has many experiences to bring to the station this year.
After graduating from Post, Belloti built connections with CBS Sports radio,WFAN, Westwood One and was a producer for pre/post game shows for the New York Giants. He is bringing  in almost 15 years worth of radio experience to the station. 
“I come into this with a lot of experience and I want to take that experience and help our students,” he said. “And help our students succeed in this rebirthing industry.”
Belloti sees the station moving in a positive direction with goals centered around student involvement and multimedia outlets.
“ I see it going in a direction we pushed for, as a lot more student involvement in terms of our Wave and Fm programming,” Belloti said. “The ultimate goal is to get students on the FM side and continue them on The Wave. I also look for new platforms for students to excel in. There’s several avenues I want to go in and expand our Fm schedule.”
Podcasting is one new thing Belloti wants to implement into the station. 
“That’s where the future of our business is going. For where we are, I see us on a talk-type level. I think interesting documentaries or interesting discussions with prominent people,” he said. “If we have podcasts geared around interviews and conversations on certain topics is what I’m looking forward to adding to our lineup, and other ideas that the students and I come up with collaboratively.”
Creating podcasts is a new idea that Belloti has that may benefit the radio station due to a lot of markets looking into the podcast business. Being able to work at your alma mater is a blessing to many college alumni. Having the ability to be the director of  the WCWP station meant alot to Bellotti.
“I’ve always dreamt about this opportunity. Didn’t expect it to come this soon but I’ve always dreamt about coming back to the station and being in a role like this,” he said. “It’s basically a dream come true to be back. And I’m ready to go with new ideas and content.”
Belloti sees a ton of potential for the future of the station.
“I think we are at an interesting time. I think in 3 or 4 years we could have a lot more student involvement on FM programming and a lot more podcasts. I see the station building on the foundation we have now.”

RISE is a student-run organization at Post that was created with the ideals of advocacy, strength and community for students on campus. It currently has 52 active members and six executive board members.
“The main goals of RISE are preventing sexual assault and educating on domestic violence and spreading awareness. [We want to] create a safe space, so anyone can talk to us if they have any problems or concerns,” Event Coordinator and junior social work major Kaitlyn Jordan said. “We want everyone to be educated on what [domestic violence] is and know the warning signs in order to help others and yourself … We have a lot of main focuses, but I think they all tie in together.” 
The program spreads awareness, educates and provides resources about a wide array of topics such as dating safety, domestic violence, LGBTQ+ issues and mental health.
Sexual assault and domestic violence are not easy or simple topics for everyone to discuss, but the board members of RISE agree that recognition of what is happening is the first step for awareness of these issues. They are passionate and believe in a common goal of helping those who need it and creating everything a community should be about.  
“I don’t think people realize how quickly things can escalate if you are with a toxic partner. Sometimes people aren’t aware of it, sometimes you don’t see the red flags or warning signs,” Vice President and junior art therapy major, Olivia Glusic, said. By having these kinds of events, we can educate and spread awareness of what is not okay. Speaking up and directing people to resources can change someone’s life.” 
The organization often discusses the prevalence of domestic violence in college relationships.
“[Sexual assault and domestic abuse] happens so much more than we are aware, on campus or off, and many [people] don’t talk about it or report it, and just because you don’t report it doesn’t mean that it didn’t happen. Some people are afraid, but you aren’t alone, it happens to many people. There is help in healing and to become stronger,” Jordan said.
RISE hosted an event on Oct. 26 in Hillwood Commons. The event was supposed to include a speaker from the It’s On Us organization. This was to be focused solely on sexual assault prevention and what to do as a bystander, but the event didn’t go as planned when the speaker was unable to arrive on time due to outstanding circumstances. The board members of RISE decided to make the event an open discussion about safety for students and future events.
“[The event] didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to as the guest speaker was nearly two hours late and ultimately didn’t end up coming,” Campaign Manager and business and finance major, Emma Thibodeau, said. “However, I thought it was great that we were able to turn it into an open discussion forum type event instead and receive feedback from general members of RISE. I hope it at least helped connect some people to us in a way they couldn’t before.” 
The event then turned into a discussion that allowed people to speak freely about different issues on campus. One student even mentioned that now being a senior, he had been looking for something like RISE since his freshman year. He personally experienced trying to help others, and did not receive the help he needed. He was especially happy and relieved about RISE being a resource for students to use. 
The mission statement of RISE is to promote advocacy, strength and community for Post students. They are here to create a safe and inclusive space for the campus community and direct people to resources they might need. 
“We’re just kind of that bridge to help people to get where they need to be, in terms of safety and health,” Jordan said.
Some upcoming events will include tabling to cover different topics, making it interactive for students, “Rise Above the Algorithm” where a guest speaker will speak about mental health and social media on Nov. 21 at (time and place). There is also talk of a poetry slam coordinated with a group from Adelphi University on Dec. 6 (time and place), movie nights, volunteer opportunities, and more. Next semester, the two biggest events RISE will work on bringing to campus are the annual Take Back the Night and a mental health awareness walkathon coordinated with Project Help.
RISE has been taking action to help students understand that their organization is also about togetherness and fun, as it is awareness. The organization often has trivia events for students to attend. 
The members of RISE also truly enjoy the team they are part of. They can freely collaborate with one another by using their own skill sets, sharing ideas, allowing freedom, expression and support.
“[We are] a great community of people that believe in the same thing with goals that we want to accomplish. We are dedicated and motivated to make LIU a better place for students,” Jordan said.
For students interested in joining RISE, follow their Instagram @liupostrise.

On Oct. 29, a deadly accident occurred in South Korea. It was before Halloween in Itaewon, South Korea, and a party venue was so crowded with people when the accident occurred. The accident occurred in an alley in Itaewon, and 154 people were killed. 
There is a United States military facility around the venue where the accident occurred, so the accident site was crowded with many foreigners. Itaewon was more crowded than usual, partly due to the influence of the city becoming a popular spot for TV dramas and other events. Also, in South Korea, all kinds of restrictions were put up due to COVID-19, but all restrictions have been removed for the first time in three years and more people have gathered. The day of the accident was uploaded on social media, and so many people gathered that those in costume could not move.
The alley where the accident occurred was slightly hilly, and then more and more people were falling from the top to the hill, folding on top of each other in this accident. The cause of people’s death in this accident is believed to be suffocation, in which many people were trapped underneath and unable to breathe. However, the detailed cause of why so many people collapsed and when they began to collapse is still unknown, and the South Korean government is trying to figure out the detailed cause.
This type of accident could also happen in the U.S. For example, at a home party, when many people gather and the house is too crowded, a similar accident could occur. If some people fall over at the home party when it’s too crowded, people will start pushing each other and could die by choking. Thus, some feel we need to be careful and need to prepare for when it happens.
Senior University of Hawaii at Hilo business management major Erick Shinjo thinks this can be prevented.
“I think there are some ways to prevent such accidents in public places. First of all, we should restrict the number of people and make enough room for people to walk around. I think it leads to the prevention of overcrowding, and there will be no problem even if someone falls. Also, it is a good idea to deploy security guards,” Shinjo said.
In addition, Senior Western Oregon University communication major Hibiki Ouchi offered the following thoughts.
“This accident could occur all around us. So, I think the best way is to stay away from the crowded place when you find congestion because it can be difficult to get out once you are in the crowd. However, if you get caught in a dense crowd, it is effective to try to get as close as possible to the edge of the road,” Ouchi said.
This accident was not expected by anyone and caused many deaths. Thus, it is important to prepare to avoid being involved in an accident. If there are people who stopped in a crowded place, an accident could occur. Therefore, what you can do if you are in a crowded place is to look around you carefully and act accordingly.

Italy has elected a new prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. Her party, “The Brothers of Italy,” is a far right organization with many of the members being connected to and affiliated with neo-fascist groups and organizations. Meloni herself from an early age was part of the neo-fascist group “the National Alliance,” formerly named the MSI or the Italian Socialist Movement. These groups are openly and unapologetically far right and neo-fascist. 
Meloni became the leader of the youth division of the National Alliance and has been involved with far right and neo fascist organizations from an early age. The brothers of Italy party is a metamorphosis of the MSI and NA and sport the same tri-colored green, white and red flame that was used by Mussolini during the second world war. 
The Brothers of Italy also share the same headquarters used by Mussolini’s party, and are also running under the slogan “God, fatherland, family” which is taken directly from their fascist ancestors. Meloni has taken a hard line stance against immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, women’s rights, minority rights and migrant rights. Meloni and her party say that their main goal is to unite Italy and to mitigate division amongst the people. They have also stated that they want to bring Italy back to its former glory, reinstate the traditional ideals of Italy and give Italy back to the true Italians. 
Meloni also has a hard line stance on not being a part of the European Union (EU), and says being part of the EU is not in the best interest of Italians and Italy as a whole. Many people are questioning the motives of the brothers of Italy and what intentions they have for the future of Italy not only politically and economically, but socially as well. 
Music major John Appleton had this to say about the current situation going on in Italy. 
“I think it’s the old cliche of history repeats itself, there are so many similarities and clear connections to fascism with the Brothers of Italy and Meloni, and the social and economic conditions are similar to how fascism came to power in the first place during the 1920’s and 40’s,” Appleton said.
Appleton feels that the economic and social conditions in Italy are a cause for the election of Meloni.
“The people are economically and socially beaten down and feel insecure about their country and want a strong charismatic leader to bring them back from supposed ruin. We can already see in the past few years a rise in attacks on minority, LGBTQ and migrant citizens. One migrant man was beaten and killed in broad daylight in the middle of the street while people just watched, people have been shot at as well as many other transgressions that are being carried out. I think we will see more and more aggression and violence in Italy, and it has only just started,” Appleton said. “I am curious to see if Giorgia Meloni and the brothers of Italy have what it takes to run the country and to unite rather than divide the country like they said. From the looks of it it’s already off to a bad start in my opinion.” 
In the upcoming months the brothers of Italy and Giorgia Meloni will be in the spotlight and under close scrutiny not only by the Italian people but by the entire world. Meloni and her party in recent months have tried to tone down their neo-fasicst rhetoric in order to be more widely accepted by the world and the Italian people. She boasts that she and her party are conservative, not fascist. 
Meloni is a clear choice for many people in Italy and has stirred up a lot of support. Although there are many people who support her and her platform, the election had the lowest turnout in years. 
Post 2016 business administration alumni Linda Magnioli spoke about the projected voter turnout.
 “I think people are not turning up to vote during this snap election because the Italian people are fed up with the disorganization and corruption of the Italian political and voting system. The Italian governing power has a notorious reputation for being disorganized and completely not efficient, why would people turn up to vote when they don’t trust their own system of government,” Magnioli said.

On Saturday, Oct. 29, the LIU Sharks won their first game of the season, defeating the Duquesne Dukes 50-48 in double overtime on the road in Pittsburg, PA. 
It was the first career start for freshman quarterback Luca Stanzani following the Sharks’ 7-game losing streak to start the year. The Sharks got off to a slow start, trailing 14-0 early in the second. However, the Sharks responded with 28 unanswered points to take control. 
It all started with a late rushing touchdown by Stanzani in the second quarter to get the Sharks on the board. The second half was a wild one. To open up the 3rd quarter, the Sharks scored on five plays, capped off by a 64-yard touchdown pass from Stanzani over to Davon Wells to tie the game at 14. Three plays into the Dukes’ next drive, Sharks’ Defensive Back Caleb Nartey got a 36-yard pick-six for his first career interception to put the Sharks ahead. Three plays into the very next drive, on a mirror image play, Stanzani connected with Wells again for a 58-yard touchdown.
The Dukes would not go down without a fight, scoring two minutes later on a rushing touchdown by Quarterback Joe Mischler to cut the deficit to 28-21. After a slow first half, Sharks’ Running Back Pat Bowen exploded for a 44-yard rushing score to put the Sharks back ahead by two scores. The 4th quarter was all Duquesne, with Joe Mischler putting together two drives capped off by 13-yard scores from two separate receivers, sending the game into overtime at 35-35. 
The Sharks’ set the tone with a 12-yard score from Stanzani over to Tosin Oyekanmi on his first reception of the day. The Sharks held the dukes to three yards on the first three plays of the Dukes’ drive. However, on a 4th & 7, Joe Mischler saved the game on a do-or-die 22-yard score to Joey Isabella to send the game into double OT. The Dukes scored first with an 11-yard score from Mischler to Janneh Abdul but were not able to connect on the 2-point conversion as required by NCAA overtime rules. 
This set up the Sharks with a chance to win it after Stanzani connected on a 14-yard score on 3rd down to Pat Bowen to tie the game at 48. Finally, after a hard-fought game on both sides, Luca Stanzani connected with Micheal Love on a fade route for the 2-point conversion to end the game. 
Stanzani was named NEC & National FCS rookie of the week for his performance, which included going 22-27, with 5 total touchdowns and 390 yards from scrimmage. 
Wells had 7 receptions for 199 yards, more than half of what he’s had in his entire career up to that point. Sharks’ Safety Victor Nelson Jr. had two interceptions, giving him six on the year, making him the FCS leader. 
Sharks Defensive End Eric O’neil was named NEC Defensive Player of the Week for his performance, which included 9 tackles, 5 for a loss and 2.5 sacks.
Soon after Head Coach Ron Cooper joined LIU in early January and brought his staff together, Stanzani claimed in an interview with WCWP that Offensive Coordinator Kort Shankweiler got him on board. 
“Coach Kort offered me mid-February. They made it really known that they wanted me here, and they wanted to get me up as soon as possible for my visit. So we made that happen, and I’ve loved it ever since,” Stanzani said.
After playing off the bench in a few of the Sharks’ losses early on, Stanzani knew he just had to stay patient to play in each game when the opportunity arose.
“I just knew that I always had to be prepared. That’s what the coaches tell me, just be prepared, So when my moment came later in those games, I just had to be ready, and I was,” he said. 
Stanzani knew going into the game in Duquesne that this would be his opportunity to get his first start. 
“It’s exciting. It’s what I worked for. I came here to play to show what I got, so when Coach Cooper told me, I was definitely thrilled,” he said. 
Stanzani knew he couldn’t get over anxious after being down 14-0 early and had to continue fighting and putting together good drives. 
“We just had to believe. We’ve been in situations where we’re down, some teams start to give up a little bit, but we knew that if we just kept going and kept fighting, we would come back, and we did,” he said. 
Stanzani believes in himself and understands there is still room for improvement. 
“Everything can always keep getting better, obviously, but as a freshman, I can mature physically. There are certain things in the pocket that I can do better: getting timing better with receivers and getting relationships with them better can improve a lot,” he said. 
Stanzani has high hopes for himself and the team going forward. 
“I’d like to just win out and do as good as we can in these last three games and build that momentum going forward into the next season and hopefully win a lot of games next year,” he said. 
In an interview with WCWP, Head Coach Ron Cooper acknowledged he could not have been happier with his team after battling the whole way. 
“We had a very excited team. They’re fired up. When you win a game like that on the last play of the game, it usually makes it a little bit special,” he said. “It’s tensed up all game, going back and forth, they’re ahead, we’re ahead, you have to win in overtime. We had to go for two, and they had to go for two. So our guys responded, but they were excited and played well.”
After giving Stanzani the starting role for the week, Cooper is ready to trust his young quarterback. 
“He did a great job as a true freshman, only 18 years old, playing in his first Division I college football game as a starter. Last year at this time, he was getting ready for the playoffs in high school, and he joined us this summer, and he was prepared for it,” he said. “He’s talented, the question we didn’t know about him was how he was going to perform in a game environment. He practiced well, and he’s done everything we’ve asked. He’s learned the playbook, he’s learned the scheme, and he was talented, but he stepped in.” 
Stanzani got right back to where he left off the following week, beating Central Connecticut State University 29-20 at home on Saturday, Nov. 5. 
Stanzani had another high performing game, going 19-32 in his second career start, with 284 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown. 
It was a 59-yard touchdown pass from Stanzani over to Oyekanmi to finish the first quarter that put the Sharks ahead 13-7, and they did not look back from there.
Sharks’ Kicker Micheal Coney connected on three straight field goals to add to the Sharks’ lead in the 2nd and 3rd quarters to solidify the lead. 
After two touchdowns in the 4th by the Blue Devils to make it a competitive game, it was Safety Ayinde Johnson who sealed the deal for the Sharks on defense with a 40-yard pick-six for his first career interception on the Blue Devils’ final drive of the day. 
The Sharks are now 2-7 on the season with two more games left to play. The Sharks will look for Luca Stanzani to continue to dominate on the field while preparing himself to lead the program next year. 
The Sharks host the Stonehill Skyhawks on Saturday, Nov. 12 at 1 p.m. You can listen live on WCWP and the Wave.
