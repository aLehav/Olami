Over 54 percent of the U.S. population has been vaccinated for COVID-19 as of Sept.10. The New York population that has received at least one dose of the vaccine is currently 69 percent.
According to the Steven S. Hornstein Center for Policy, Polling and Analysis poll, 23 percent of Americans believe that the worst of the pandemic is over.
“I think that people are acting like COVID-19 is over when it’s not,” junior health sciences major Miranda Ruiz said. “Lots of people are still dying each day. I lost two of my uncles only a month ago due to coronavirus.”
Before the semester started, Chief Administrative Officer Joseph L. Schaefer announced in an email to the university on Aug. 2 that LIU is requiring all staff, faculty and students to require proof of vaccination to be on campus. Some religious and medical exemptions have been made, and those students must be tested for coronavirus weekly.
“The resurgence of the pandemic, fueled by the highly contagious and more deadly Delta variant, leads us to an obvious conclusion,” Schaefer said. “It is one that more than 600 other universities and counting have reached. Our duty to you and your responsibility to the greater community requires the establishment of a mandatory vaccination policy.”
Classes and numerous events will be held in person this semester. And while the university is requiring masks for some indoor events, like classes, as a precaution in reducing the spread of the Delta variant, students have mixed feelings about their safety on campus.
“I believe they are implementing safety measures as best as they can, but we should all still be masking up,” junior musical theatre major Hannah Winston said. “But, I think that the school should be providing case numbers online, give sanitizing wipes for certain spaces, have a set or maximum number of people allowed in certain spaces, make sure we wipe down certain spaces individually after they have been in use, and have people mask up indoors even if they are vaccinated. I feel safe knowing that I took the precautions that are best fit for me to be as safe as possible. I’ve always felt safe after my dose of the vaccine.”
While it is school policy to wear a mask indoors on campus, it is often not enforced.
“I’d say only about three-quarters of students in my classes wear a mask. I don’t, some of my professors don’t,” junior marketing major Jacob Shamah said.
Senior nursing major Antonette Dalfino has had a different experience with students wearing masks in her classes.
“I have not been to one class where someone wasn’t wearing their masks, which I like to see,” she said. “I personally want to protect as many people as I could so even though I was looking forward to not wearing the masks, I will do what I must so that I can do my part to slow the spread of COVID.”
Students are thrilled to have more events in person this semester after almost a year and a half of virtual events.
“Having events in person again is a step back to normalcy,” Shamah said. “The Move It Monday event had a few bouncy houses, wipe out and a ladder climb with a smoothie and coffee cart to cool off with. It was fun to reconnect with old friends, as well as hang out in between classes. I’d say it was a pretty big turnout.” 
Ruiz looks forward to more in-person events.
“I’m looking forward to the school year and the in-person events that are taking place. Particularly, the Latino and LGBT events planned for this semester,” she said. “I’m also excited for my lab job in the chemistry department, especially because it’s in-person and I get to actually get to work hands-on in the lab and with the students.”
Official reports of positive coronavirus cases on campus are not available at this time.

LIU has added Men’s Volleyball to their athletics program. The team is the newest addition to the campus’ roster of 34 sports. 
Athletic Director Dr. William Martinov is excited about the newest addition to LIU Athletics. 
 “We’re excited about our new men’s volleyball program. The sport provides a fast pace, intense energy and matches up well with our perennially successful women’s program,” he said. “Our head coach, Shawn Patchell, is a great coach and recruiter and will build a program based on high academic and athletic standards.” 
Martinov claims he was looking for the best when finalizing the process to get this team going. 
“We always consider the sports landscape in terms of national interest, resources, and the ability to be competitive within our region and conference. Men’s volleyball has a great interest across the country and around the world,” he said. “Our ability to recruit exceptional student-athletes and be highly competitive were foremost in our consideration and decision.”
Men’s Volleyball’s inaugural coach, Shawn Patchell, has a history of success with prior coaching at Division I and II levels. Most recently, Patchell coached Concordia University Irvine for eight seasons, where he aided the program’s move from NAIA to NCAA Division II. 
Coach Patchell holds a 230-145-1 record as an NCAA coach. Additionally, Patchell brings USA Volleyball expertise as he coached the Men’s National Team to the 2012 Pan American Games, where they won the gold medal. In regards to the inaugural season, Patchell stressed the importance of improving every day.
“My expectation is to have learning opportunities and get better every day in practice and to compete at the DI level,” he said. 
Patchell has a strong schedule compiled full of future NEC rivals and even included a trip to Hawaii for the team. 
“One of the highlights of the season will be traveling to Hawaii to play two matches with the 2021 NCAA National Champions. UH is excited about the growth of Men’s Volleyball and our new program and is always a gracious host. It will be a great experience for our student-athletes to compete on TV and in front of more than 10k fans on another island!”
Patchell believes every one of his players will make an impact this year. 
“In our inaugural season, all 15 players will make a key difference. Volleyball is all about team chemistry, and we have a group of young men that are great teammates,” he said.

Brendon Rodney, a 2016 Long Island University Alumni has secured his second Olympic bronze medal in the Men’s 4 x 100 meter relay. Rodney won his first back at the 2016 games in Rio, and on Aug.16, he took home his second in Japan. 
The Canadian team of Rodney, Aaron Brown, Jerome Blake, Andre De Grasse had a time of 37.70, finishing in third place behind Italy and Great Britain. 
Rodney feels there is no bigger moment than being in the Olympic Games. 
“Competing for your country is always a great honor but competing at the Olympics with the world watching is probably the biggest honour for any athlete in my sport of track and field,” he said. 
Despite the 2020 Olympics being postponed and all the other challenges of the last two years, Rodney re-assured his commitment to staying the course. 
“My preparation remained much the same. I was thrown off a few times, but it’s part of the daily norm and we just have to roll with the punches,” Rodney said. 
Rodney will always remember LIU for what was instilled in him as a young collegiate athlete. 
“I thank LIU everyday for my development as an athlete because it was where I first started to believe I could be one of the world’s best and where I became one of them,” Rodney said. 
Men’s Track & Field head coach, Simon Hodnett, has been with the program in Brooklyn since 1999. Hodnett has so many great memories of watching Rodney since the moment he signed his scholarship to join the Blackbirds. 
“I have too many favorite memories of Brendon and his time here at LIU, my favorite memories include signing his scholarship and letting me know that he would be attending college at Long Island University, attending the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, and watching him set a personal best in the 200 meters,” Hodnett continues.“As well as watching him and his teammates compete and earn a bronze medal in the 400 meter relay, watching him win a national title at the 2016 Canadian track and field championships as he made his first Olympic Games team, all while establishing a new personal best of 19.96 in the 200 meters.”
Hodnett has seen a lot of Rodney’s development both on and off the field from being a student athlete, to now being an Olympic medalist. 
“Brendon has developed into a world class athlete by staying focused on his goals. He would always be in my office talking [and] asking me questions about training or about life,” Hodnett said. “He listened to me, and I listened to him. Brendon got stronger in the weight room. His endurance improved. And he became more efficient from a technical aspect whenever he began sprinting. Those three things improved, which led to improvements in all of his running events,” 
Hodnett felt as a student athlete Rodney was focussed on not only athletics but academics as well. 
“His parents instilled in him the importance of an education and he did everything that he needed to become successful on and off the track. My goal as a coach was to design a training plan that would assist him in reaching his goals. Him reaching his goal had more to do with him knowing what he wanted,” Hodnett said. 
Hodnett feels there are many parts to Rodney’s game that allow him to be great when the moments call.
“His focus, work ethic, drive, determination, and the encouragement from his mother, father and family members helped him to excel during his biggest moments,” he said.
Hodnett claims Rodney’s presence and leadership always positively affected the people around him. 
“Brendon has always been a team player and like a brother to many of his teammates. He worked hard and motivated his athletes to train hard as well, so that the entire team could be successful as a unit,” he said. “He did not enjoy traveling to competitions without his teammates, and always had fun at competitions when he had his teammates there, so that he could share his success with them.”
Hodnett is confident that Rodney will always hold a tremendous legacy on the LIU Track & Field Program. 
“Brendon is the only person that I know of in the history of our track and field athletes that earned three medals in international level competitions. His one bronze medal for the world championships and his two bronze medals from the Olympic Games makes him the greatest track and field athlete in the history of our sport,” he said. “He is legendary, and I am thankful that he chose our university to compete for.”
Rodney has continued to experience immense success as he looks back on what he represents to everyone cheering him on back home, and at LIU. 
“LIU is my home away from home, and the support I have received from them has been unmatched, so the feeling is great being able to compete in front of Canada and my LIU Family,” Rodney said. 
Rodney is still far from finished in his professional career, as he looks to compete again and grow his legacy even further. 
“My goals are to compete at one more Olympic Games and come away with two or three more medals,” he said.
