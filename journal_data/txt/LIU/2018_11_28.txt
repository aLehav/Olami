On Tuesday, Nov. 13, Amazon announced that it would move its new headquarters to New York City and Arlington, Virginia; the corporate giant also said that it would invest about $5 billion, and each location would see around 25,000 new job openings. Sounds good, right? Well, there is another side to this story.
Corporations usually decide to locate in areas with sturdy infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and reliable transportation, so they can operate effectively. Ac- cording to The New York Times, Amazon was given $2 billion in tax subsidies for its decision to build facilities in these locations. Why is it that one of the nation’s most prosperous companies was just given $2 billion?
The answer is simple: Amazon is just one example of an alliance between the business class and the political class. Amazon’s decision to move one of its new headquarters to New York City is no accident, as the city is run by Mayor Bill de Blasio, one of the most liberal mayors in the country. Big corporations often lobby before Congress and give contributions to the politicians; in turn, the politicians give favors to the corporations.
Unfortunately, the Right has defended large corporations for years. Corporate America, however, hates the idea of free markets and competition, which are conservative ideals: according to The Daily Beast, a left-leaning website, “That’s because they have the resources to hire the lawyers needed to navigate regulations, and the lobbyists who can help change the rules if necessary.” Companies like Amazon end up becoming monopolies, and competition from small business is crushed. There is nothing conservative about this practice, just as there is nothing conservative about most big corporations. It is just the opposite: they are the backbone of the Democratic Party.
If you were to check the donor lists of Democratic candidates like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, you would find that many large corporations often donate generously to Democrats. According to AlterNet, the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, gave over $300,000 to Hillary Clinton in the last election.
For all the yammering we hear from Democrats about the evils of corporate America, they certainly have no problem taking donations from large corporations for their political campaigns.
The Republican Party deserves some blame, too: in order to satisfy the business interests that fund their campaigns, establishment Republicans often are silent on the issue of illegal immigration and border security, as they want to provide cheap labor to their corporate donors. A mass influx of low-skilled labor often puts downward pressure on the wages of Americans. Many on the Left are right to say that corporate America deserves some skepticism; the problem is, they are enabling the very practices they claim to be fighting against.

Editor’s Note: “Voiced” is political opinion column taking a liberal stance. While “Voiced” reflects the thoughts and beliefs of the columnist, it may not reflect views of The Pioneer, which is an objective, unbiased entity.
Some people find diversity to not be a strength but a thorn in today’s political climate, staggering the growth of the American people. Certain individuals feel that equality is our strength, but what happens if there is no equality? People have different economic and social standings all the time. How can you say there is equality if “stop and frisk” affects people we know personally? How can you say there is equality when the law stunts the growth of certain cultures? How can there be unity when our country is more divided than it has ever been?
Affirmative action at colleges exists to help certain students who did not have the same opportunities others were. If you criticize the ideas that the less fortunate should not be helped, what does that say about what you stand for? Where is the equality in that? Policies like this exist to level the playing field. It is not special treatment, but it’s to help make up for the treatment some people did not get.
When looking at the country as a whole, diversity has helped us progress; many opportunities are available for a wider variety of people. Our way of life is a cultural diffusion of other societies.
On the basis of international relations, what neo-conservatives argue is the United States must encourage the spread of democracy around the world. But what is a country’s place to assert its sphere of influence on societies that may not want it? People who blindly follow conservatism and whine about foreign countries tend to forget that the citizens of a society mean no harm just because they are different.
A government is not always representative of its people, as clearly evident in the United States, where many Americans do not always support government decisions. Continuing this notion of spreading democracy has not always benefited people. For example, Yemen, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Syria, and the Philippines were all “given” democracy by the United States with the notion it will create equality; instead it resulted in civil war. Look at the lives lost because a certain first world country thought it was right.
Diversity is not only our strength but it is the crux of American society. It drives us to do better. It teaches us to understand the world around us. This country was forged by immigrants meant to welcome people with open arms, regardless of their race or creed. Inequality will always exist; racism, prejudice, spite will always reign in the echoes of certain groups. But in between the lines and at the tables of the legislative chambers, acceptance will as well.

In the Nov. 14 issue of The Pioneer, we published a political opinion column, “Trick’s Take,” that gives one student’s perspective on the issue of diversity. While the column reflected the opinions of the writer, and the Pioneer takes great pride in providing a forum for all students to express their opinions, The Pioneer does not support any political perspective, and strives to be a neutral, unbiased entity.
That being said, this week, we are publishing an opposing viewpoint about diversity in America in order to reflect as many student points of view as possible. We also invite other students to share their views on diversity or other issues of importance to them, either through a letter to the editor, or by submitting a column to The Pioneer at liupostpioneer@gmail.com. We will do our best to publish as many as we receive, space permitted. Please keep the columns from 350-450 words and letters to the editor under 200 words.
Finally, we apologize for publishing the Nov. 14 “Trick’s Take” column without attribution for the quotes that were used. They were generalized thoughts rather than quotations from specific people.
Sincerely,
Jada Butler & Ashley Bowden Co-Editors-in-Chief

“The Search for Wondla” by Tony DiTerlizzi is the first book in the Wondla trilogy, which chronicles the story of Eva Nine. Born in a subterranean sanctuary and being raised by multi- utility task help robot zero-six (Muthr), Eva has never seen another human, yet she dreams of meeting others on the surface. Although Muthr insists that Eva is the only one of her kind, Eva has proof that she is not the only human on Earth.

The proof comes in the form of a strange artifact that Eva found, the only thing she did not receive from Muthr. Eva dubbed it her Wondla, because those were the only letters on the object that she could decipher. A picture on the Wondla depicts a human girl and man, walking with a robot through a field of flowers.
When a mysterious hunter invades the sanctuary, Eva is forced above ground to find flora and fauna unlike anything she studied. Eva soon discovers that she was not living underneath
the planet Earth, but beneath an alien planet called Orbona. An alien named Rovender Kitt and a behemoth creature joined Eva and Muthr. Throughout the book they travel Orbona to discover why Eva was put on an alien planet, all while being pursued by the hunter that destroyed the sanctuary.
By the book’s climax, the plot of “The Search for Wondla” turns toward a twist ending about Orbona that was hinted at throughout the story. However, just before the twist is revealed the surprise is spoiled by a sign that Eva and Rov- ender read just before realizing the truth behind Orbona. And the other big reveal, which tells the reader just what the Wondla is, happens to be a bit anticlimactic.
Despite its flaws, “The Search for Wondla” is a great sci-fi read for readers who enjoy mysteries and twists in their stories. This first book is fun read, with excellent world building, and yet isn’t afraid to make a reader cry. Altogether, “The Search for Wondla” is the perfect start to a fascinating trilogy.

With the stress of finals approaching, holiday shopping, trying to stay warm in this frigid weather, commuting long hours, and anything else you might be juggling, it’s easy to feel tired and run down. Unfortunately, quick meals are often stripped of nutritional value and leave our bodies starving for many essential nutrients, one of them being iodine.
While often overlooked, iodine is an essential nutrient- meaning our bodies cannot synthesize it on its own, but must consume it through food or supplement. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), iodine deficiency, which had previously been remedied by the development of iodized table salt, is potentially re emerging due to the acute decrease in nutritional status of growing soil.
Iodine is only naturally present in fish, sea- weed and soil. In fact, just as we get iodine from certain vegetables, dairy and grains, these foods get their dose of iodine from the soil they grow on. This simply means if there’s no iodine in the soil, then there’s no iodine in the food, and so no iodine for us to consume. Unfortunately, intense farming practices and alkaline fertilizers, both of which are practices that are used and applied widely in the agricultural industry, strip soil of this nutrient.
In fact, many are unaware that iodine deficiency is the number one preventable cause of brain cell damage and mental disabilities in America ac- cording to NCBI. Additionally, iodine affects brain development before birth which is why pregnant mothers are instructed by healthcare professionals to increase iodine intake. Once born, iodine continues to contribute to the strength and longevity of brain cells, making this mineral imperative for memory, reaction time and overall cognitive function.
It’s important however, to get iodine levels checked by a medical professional before increasing consumption since elevated iodine levels can be toxic to the thyroid and create hyperactivity and other nervous system disturbances.
While we don’t have control over farming practices, we do have control over what we buy at the supermarket. If we chose to consume organic dairy, meat, and vegetables, then the likelihood of ingesting a sufficient amount of iodine from diet alone increases since organic farming practices are kinder to soil and often preserve nutrient levels.

With the season’s first snow on Nov. 15, it’s always a surprise of what kind of wet slushy cold weather it can throw at us.
Winter is a rough season for commuters; snow and ice slow down traffic and can lead to being late or even potentially missing a class. As a commuter, it is very important to leave some extra time for road closings, shoveling and all the other things that come with commuting.
I find it necessary to heat my car up in the morning, as it saves time and is beneficial to the car itself. A cold car in the winter can lead to engine problems and frosted windows. Don’t forget an ice scraper, they can become your best friends when needing to chisel off the ice build up from overnight frost.
Being a commuter for almost three years now has showed me every obstacle winter has to offer. Being conscious of changing road conditions is so important when commuting over an hour. I’ve dealt with road closings, traffic delays and multiple car pile ups during the winter commute; winter is the most dangerous time to commute.
In these kinds of conditions, the size of your car certainly helps. Trucks and SUVs are more accessible on the highway and can handle treacherous road conditions better than small cars. In the long winter days, 4-wheel drive can be your best friend.
If you have a small car like I do, you find it very hard to travel with only a 2-wheel drive transmission; slips and slides are more common due to the minimal traction you have on the road. Your best bet is taking it slow and steady because your life isn’t worth rushing in these kinds of conditions.
Bad weather mixed with heavy traffic during the winter can be a reason for any student to dislike commuting. For me, time management is key to a long commuting day. I wake up over an hour early to check the news for accidents and closed roads. Leaving enough time in the morning to get to where you have to be can be critical when traveling long distances.
This is the time of the year where the dorming students have the advantage over commuting students. It’s easy for them to wake up and walk to class while commuting students wake up hours before they do and
have to deal with all the problems the road has to offer. It’s during times like this when I wish I was a dorming student.

The Muslim Student Association (MSA) club promotes acceptance and aims to prevent Islamophobia. One of the religious clubs on campus, MSA began late in the spring 2018 semester. President
Humdia Barakzai, a sophomore pre-pharmacy major, said the club came to a slow start as they worked on obtaining a budget and building an executive board.
“LIU Post is a diverse school, and there are multiple religious clubs here, so I wanted to introduce the MSA because I don’t want anyone to mistake the religion as a bad religion. I want people to become more aware of what Muslims believe in, what we’re about, and why we do what we do,” Barakzai said.
The executive board members echo Barakzai’s sentiment.
“Our mission in MSA is to promote knowledge about the Islamic culture and participate in fundraisers to help groups willing to help others,” Nakeeb Ahmed, MSA treasurer, said. Though being treasurer goes beyond money. “I voice my opinions in the meetings and what our goals are for this club,” Ahmed said.
“Our group consists of people born from different descents, which makes it a very diverse group of members,” Muhammad Umar, MSA’s secretary, said. Umar’s job is to make sure that every member is up to par with their duties and responsibilities.
MSA hosted its first event of the fall semester with the Middle Eastern Student Association (MESA), a vigil service on Wednesday, Oct. 31, for the victims of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Penn.
They plan to host a formal with MESA, where the proceeds will benefit countries that need assistance. They also plan to celebrate World Hijab Day on Feb. 1, where they will invite guest speaker, alumna Daisy Khan, author of “Born with Wings: The Spiritual Journey of a Modern Muslim Woman.”
The club is open to both Muslim and non-Muslim students. Barakzai said she wants club members to have an understanding of their religion and culture. “I know there are so many people who have questions, and I don’t want anybody to give them a wrong answer,” she said.
Anyone interested can contact the president at Humdia.Barakzai@ my.liu.edu or the club’s faculty advisor, Dr. Shaireen Rasheed at Shaireen.Rasheed@liu.edu.

Administrators deny the “Common Sense” authors’ claim that professor and board of trustees member, Cherie Serota poses a conflict of interest.
In the second anonymous “Common Sense” pamphlet, the authors suspect that appointing Cherie Serota, board of trustees member, as the director of the fashion merchandising program, was a political move. The authors insinuate a conflict of interest, saying, “Cherie Serota’s husband Daniel Serota, is the current mayor of Brookville, in which a portion of our campus resides,” including, “the part where the supposed veterinarian school is going to be built.
Michael Soupios, tenured political science professor and president of the faculty union, confirmed that “in order to advance the construction of the vet school, there needed to be permits from the town.”
Plans for the veterinarian school, however, have been in the works for several years. Construction of the school has yet to begin, as the university is still waiting on building permits, according to Gordon Tepper, university director of public relations. Areas slated for construction have been marked, but are not set to begin until 2019.
The authors of the pamphlet claim Serota was unfairly made director of the fashion merchandising program. The Pioneer reached out to Serota for comment, but she denied the request. Instead, dean of students Michael Berthel, Gordon Tepper and university counsel Michael Best, met with The Pioneer before Thanksgiving break to take our questions. Tepper later responded to inquiries via email after the break.
“Cherie was working as an adjunct professor, and she agreed to serve on the search committee to find a director for the Fashion Merchandising program. When the search committee was unable to find the right candidate after two national searches, Dean Valli (of the College of Management) and other members of the committee concluded that Cherie was the best fit, and she had done an excellent job,” Tepper wrote in an email.
Some faculty members questioned Serota’s teaching qualifications. Serota had her own fashion line called “Belly Basics” which revolutionized the maternity market in 1994 with the introduction of the Pregnancy Survival Kit, which gained worldwide recognition and changed the way pregnant women dressed across the globe.
“Under Ms. Serota’s direction, LIU’s Fashion Merchandising program is widely respected and offers students unique opportunities to prepare for a career in the fashion industry,” Tepper said. “Ms. Serota’s knowledge and connections in the industry allow students to gain access to fashion events and businesses around the world.”
Tepper said the Board of Trustees is pleased that one of its members is teaching at LIU. “Ms. Serota brings a first-hand perspective on student experiences and issues. She is an asset to the Long Island University Board and its students.” he said. “As is standard practice in all organizations, LIU has a policy governing the disclosure of any university ties by its trustees and officers. Ms. Serota has fully complied with this policy and the board has approved her teaching assignment from inception. Ms. Serota does recuse herself when issues affecting her department come before the board in accordance with university policy.”

There will be a Narcan training event on campus on Wednesday, Nov. 28 in Pell Hall room 139 during common hour. The training is open for students, staff and faculty members interested in education on preventing an opioid overdose by way of Narcan.
Narcan is a nasal spray used to immediately reverse an emergency opioid overdose. It can be used in crucial situations by blocking the brain’s opioid receptors. The spray can stabilize a person going through an overdose.
This presentation will focus on life saving practices and harm reduction.
Linda Gomez is a certified Narcan trainer, family addiction coach and peer advocate working with families impacted by the epidemic raging in our country.
Gomez made this her “ascending passion” in 2012 after she lost someone very close to her. Since then, she focused on being an advocate to shatter the stigma that comes with addiction.
More than 700 people lost their lives in 2017 to an overdose in Suffolk County, one out of three families are impacted today by opioid overdose.
The heroin epidemic is a growing issue within the Suffolk County area and combating addiction is a main focus on Long Island. Recovery programs such as “out patient” assist those suffering from addiction by integrating them into a new lifestyle.
Those interested in the event can email Post-sna@my.liu.edu to RSVP. Free kits are available to those who pre-register. Supplies are limited.

The Student Government Association held their second Town Hall panel of the fall semester on Tuesday, Nov. 13, focusing on the topics of athletics and student involvement.
The panel included senior associate director of LIU Promise Joseph Vernace, dean of students Michael Berthel, university athletic director Debbie DeJong, and director of recreational sports Rick Hamilton. Approximately ten students were in attendance.
Many of the questions focused on the changes to the athletic department resulting in the OneLIU merger.
One student asked what would happen to the Pratt Recreation Center once most indoor sports move to the Brooklyn campus.
The panel did not answer the question with specifics. Instead, Hamilton responded by saying the absence of indoor sports will be positive for students. “[Students will have] the ability to come in and use the space more often than they’ve been able to over the past 15 years,” he said.
Berthel also felt the newly free space in the Pratt will be a positive for the campus. “From a student life perspective, we’re excited to get more access to the space,” he said. “We’re constantly trying to fit in events like Pratt After Dark, Midnight Madness, Move-A-Thon and Relay for Life.”
When asked about Greek Life expansion on campus, Vernace said that there were no current caps on the possible size of fraternities or sororities.
“We don’t have a cap on Greek Life. As our enrollment continues to grow, as more and more start continuing LIU, especially with going D1 and having that prestige of the University, enrollment in theory should increase,” Vernace said. “Greek life should increase, so your chapter sizes should get bigger and bigger.
Erica Ferrara, a senior geology and environmental sustainability major and vice president of SGA, acted as the facilitator of the event.
When asked how SGA and the administration plan to respond to comments brought up by students, Ferrara said there are many avenues by which a solution could be reached.
“We contact the appropriate administrator and see what they can do about the specific concern. If it’s a personal issue, we immediately have that students’ email sent to the administrator and they’re contacted,” she said. “We’re [also] doing a QR code, where students can log in to a comment form and students can fill in an anonymous comment.”
In response to student concerns over the OneLIU merge, Ferrara said events like the town hall series are vital to address student concerns.
“A lot of [students] have come to us with [concerns] and we’ve been working with athletics. That’s why we have a town hall like this, just so athletes and people who are concerned about athletes can come and ask questions,” she said.
The next town hall meeting is on Thursday, Nov. 29 at 12:20 p.m. in the Krasnoff Theater, and will cover academics.

To the editors,
I was appalled and saddened to learn about recent treatment of the Pioneer editor and a staff writer by LIU administrators. It is my understanding that in the Pioneer’s reporting on the “Common Sense” pamphlet, the Dean of Students asked the editors to leave out information about Professor Cherie Serota until he could research a response. I am proud that the Pioneer made an independent and responsible decision to omit that information until it was fully and fairly reported. However, when they went to meet with the Dean of Students again, supposedly to obtain the requested information, they were faced with not just the Dean of Students, but also the university Public Relations Spokesperson and the University Counsel (by phone).
Not only is such a meeting intimidating for a student, but her adviser or another professor should have been invited to attend with her, especially given the participation of the University Attorney.
Furthermore, it is my understanding that the three administrators never did answer the Pioneer’s questions about Professor Serota regarding her dual roles as a faculty member/program director while also serving on the Board of Trustees, but instead spent most of the meeting berating the editor and staff writer about the Pioneer’s reporting on the “Common Sense” pamphlet, claiming that it was inappropriate content that should not have been reported. Of course, the editors of a student newspaper must make independent decisions about what is appropriate and not appropriate content for their newspaper, and administrators cannot and should not dictate that content. If the students make a considered judgment that a story is newsworthy, then administrators should not question that judgment. This is a critical First Amendment standard that all members of an academic community, at whatever level, should respect.
I am incredibly proud that the Pioneer is keeping our campus informed in a professional, unbiased and thoughtful manner. Administrators should not stand in the way of that hard work, and indeed should be praising and supporting our students for it, rather than throwing obstacles and threats in their paths.
It is extremely disappointing to see university administrators stooping to this level. They should all be ashamed.
Sincerely,
Barbara Fowles, Ph.D
Professor of Communications and Film College of Arts, Communications & Design

Dear Readers,
I found myself in an awkward position last week after meeting with the dean of students, at his request, regarding a section of the anonymous “Common Sense” pamphlet about an alleged conflict of interest involving board of trustees member and director of the fashion merchandising program, Cherie Serota. At Michael Berthel’s request, the Pioneer held the part of our Nov. 14 story, “New Anonymous Pamphlet Found on Campus,” which discussed Serota, until he could provide an administrative response.
We agreed to hold that part despite the fact that Serota is a faculty member, and we have never had to go through the university’s PR, or the dean of students for that matter, to speak with a faculty member. But to be fair, we did not publish that part.
I set up a meeting with Berthel before the Thanksgiving break to obtain the requested information about Professor Serota, who would not speak with us. Josh Tolentino, the staff writer who has been covering the series of anonymous pamphlets, accompanied me to the meeting.
We assumed the meeting would include Serota, Dean Berthel (since he organized it) and Gordon Tepper, the university director of public relations. Berthel and Tepper were present, but Serota was not; instead, via phone call, was Michael Best, the university counsel. To have the university’s lawyer present was unusual, considering the topic. My adviser was not invited, nor was the chairperson of my department or any other faculty member from my department.
What we wanted to know was: Is there a conflict of interest in Serota being a member of the university’s board of trustees and a faculty member and director of a program? Is she paid as a faculty member (even though she is a board member)? What are her qualifications for the faculty position? Was she hired through a search and interviewing process as all other faculty are?
We didn’t get answers to our questions that day. Instead, the first 20 or so minutes of the meeting were spent with both Best and Tepper berating us for The Pioneer’s coverage of the “Common Sense” pamphlets. They never told us not to publish anything, rather they speculated about our reasoning behind covering these pamphlets. They asked that their questions and comments be kept off the record continuously. But, in essence, they believed we were wrong for covering what they called falsehoods and details they said were exaggerated. They even asked me whether, if there had been an anonymous pamphlet spread around campus saying that I was a child molester, I publish it.
The simple answer: yes.
My job as a journalist is to report on the news. Dozens of anonymous pamphlets dispersed on campus, written by students, being read by students – that is considered newsworthy. The difference between PR and journalism is this: in PR, only the good news should be shared, they want to control the narrative in their favor; in journalism, we don’t care if the news is positive or negative, news is news. So if a pamphlet saying I was a child molester was spread, would I want it published? No, I wouldn’t like it, but my opinion on the matter is irrelevant to the newsworthiness. I have a duty to report on it, and to debunk it if I know it not to be true.
With the “Common Sense” pamphlets, the Pioneer has done just that, covering the reaction from students, faculty and administrators, and fact-checking the bold claims the authors made. The Pioneer has been applauded for our news coverage and fair reporting, even from readers outside of the university, which is why the topic and tone of this meeting came as both a surprise and an insult.
I began writing for The Pioneer even before my first semester as a freshman at Post during the summer honors institute in journalism. Since then, I’ve worked hard to cover news on the campus as a staff writer, assistant news editor, news editor and now editor-in-chief. I always aim to write balanced and fair stories under the guidance of my advisor, Professor Carolyn Schurr Levin. I’ve interviewed students, faculty members, administrators and even President Kimberly Cline twice. I strive to get every side of a story to best inform my readers when presenting them with the news of the week. To be told that if I want to run the student newspaper and have a career in journalism, that I should “do it right,” is beyond insulting.
I’ll continue to use journalistic integrity and good news judgment in all of my own work, and I will ensure that the entire Pioneer staff does the same.
Sincerely,
Jada Butler
The Pioneer Co-Editor-in-Chief WCWP News Director Journalism Major
