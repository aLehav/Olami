The C.W. Post men’s soccer team is now 6-0, with two wins in the last week. With an impressive start to the season, the Pioneers are now ranked number 15 on the NSCAA Poll.
Having two of their freshmen forwards named ECC Player of the Week in consecutive weeks and sophomore goalkeeper, Marco Jorgensen, named to the ECC weekly honor roll, the outlook seems bright for the Pioneers, but not without a challenge.
On September 14th, the Pioneers faced Bentley College in Boston and were quickly down 1-0 after 12 minutes, struggling to strike back and put the ball in the net. In the second half, Post picked up its game, having 10 shots on goal following intermission. After the 75 minute mark, senior William Lindberg made the score even with a 20-yard shot, following a pass from junior right wing, Andreas Olsen. This goal was Lindberg’s first of the season.
The Pioneers kept on with their offensive attack and were rewarded in the 84th minute, when freshman forward Cemil Turan gave Post the lead. Turan dribbled down the sideline and finished the sequence with a goal, which proved to be the game winner.
Saturday, C.W. Post played Stonehill College in its fourth home game of the season. The Pioneers were in for a rocky start, as less than five minutes into the game, the  Stonehill Skyhawks took the lead. However, the Pioneers’ offense would respond back. Led by team-captain Eirik Bjornoe, the Pioneers took control over the game, putting several shots on goal and keeping the pressure on the Skyhawks’ defense. About midway through the first half, Bjornoe knocked through a penalty kick, evening up the score.
The Pioneers continued their solid offensive play and were rewarded with another penalty kick after a handball inside Stonehill’s box. Bjornoe repeated his success, scoring yet another penalty kick, giving the Pioneers a 2-1 advantage.
But, two-time ECC Rookie, and Player of the Week, freshman Eivind T. Austboe wouldn’t let Bjornoe steal the entire spotlight. Late in the second half, Austboe secured the lead for the Pioneers after curling a low shot into the right corner on a free kick right outside the box.
“We have to stop letting in those early goals in the beginning of the match, but as long as we clean up our mistakes, and end up with a win, even if it isn’t our best day, I am satisfied,” said Austboe after Saturday’s game.
The Pioneers next matchup is away on Saturday, September 24th, at 3 p.m. at the University of Bridgeport.

For students who live in any of the residence halls on campus, a clean and functioning dorm is a must. However, there are complaints from students with issues concerning the dorms’ overall condition and cleanliness.
Jackie Wiswall, a Junior chemistry major, who is currently living in the Brookville dorm, has complained three times of a leak in her ceiling that has yet to be fixed. The alleged leak has been present for over four days, and, according to Wiswall, only one person came to look at the leaks, and no repairs have been made. She said of the issues, “Maintenance and cleanliness is okay, but the maintenance workers’ responses to problems, like leaks, the Ethernet boxes, and outlets are slow.”
Though some students say that the dorms are satisfactory, others complain that facilities, like the bathrooms, are still not being cleaned enough.
According to Jennifer Fuoco, the Associate Director Resident Life, most students have been asking for carpet-free rooms and to have wireless Internet in their dorms. As of now, Brookville, the Red and Green suites, Post, and Riggs Halls are carpet-free, and more of the dorms will be renovated during the summer months.
In regards to wireless Internet, it would take a great deal of time to drill through the walls, but IT (Information Technology) has already started making plans for this long-term project. Yet, there are already Wi-Fi hotspots in the dorm lounges.
The overall maintenance of the dorms, according to Fuoco, is staggering. During the summer, a team of electricians, plumbers, and carpenters come to repair damages, and furniture is also replaced if necessary. Two weeks before the dorms open for students, the custodial staff checks every room as well as cleans them. Everything from walls, furniture, windows, and floors are cleaned and repaired. It’s clear that maintenance works very hard in providing clean and well-kept rooms and bathrooms.
However, there is another side to the problem: students not taking the time to keep their own dorms and bathrooms clean.  With so many complaints about the conditions of the campus dorms, many students have admitted that their peers do not clean up after themselves as much as they could.
A representative at the Student Health and Counseling Center says it is important for students to take an active part in maintaining hygienic bathroom facilities as well as keeping their own rooms clean. This includes not leaving trash on the floors, cleaning bathroom stall and shower cubicals after use, and, of course, washing your hands. With flu season dawning upon us, health officials are quick to stress the importance of keeping our bathrooms and ourselves free from germs to prevent the flu from spreading through the student population.
It is imperative that dorms be cleaned regularly, and students must be active participants in maintaining a healthy environment If you experience any problems with your dorm room, it’s important to let your R.A. know about the problem, so they can help resolve it as soon as possible.

Dr. Robert D. Hannafin started his journey as Dean of the College ofEducation and Information Sciences at C.W. Post on August 1st.Formerly working as Director of Learning and Development at Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, he says it was very unusual to wind up here at C.W. Post. However, this does not mean he wasn’t very well qualified for his new position. At PWC, Dr. Hannafin was responsible for the developing of training courses and preparing people to work at the firm, in other words “corporate training.” He has extended these skills to his new position as Dean and plans on bringing all of his experience into C.W. Post to help faculty prepare students for their future.
When asked what new ideas he has for the College of Education and Information Sciences, Dr. Hannafin gave a brief overview, “I plan on helping to improve interpersonal skills, these are things that employers look for.” The Dean plans on meeting with faculty and expects them to be fully on board with these new ideas. He also expressed the importance of creating meaningful relationships with schools that students will potentially be working at.
As for the recent decline in enrollment to the our College of Education and Information Science, Dr. Hannafin stated, “It is disheartening for people this year and last year trying to get a job, it could be another couple of years. It’s going to get better though, not worse.” The
Dean’s message is one of hope. Dr. Hannafin and his faculty have a feeling of concern for the students out there who can’t get jobs but assure everyone that there is hope. “Teaching is a calling, not a profession. You go into it because that’s who you are. It’s part of your DNA.” says Hannafin.
As for the College of Education and Information Sciences, it seems that this new year brings not only a new Dean but a plethora of ideas that he has brought with him. So, although C.W. Post is not where Dr. Robert D. Hannafin thought he would wind up, he is so glad that he did. “I love it, I really love it,” he says, “I was meant to be here.”

A new school year has begun, and, for some of the students, this means adjusting to another language, a new culture, new traditions, and leaving their families and homes thousands of miles away to pursue an education in America. Why did they choose studying in America, and how did they end up at C.W. Post?
“I wanted to get connections; I wanted to travel and get to know different cultures, and, most importantly, learn the language properly,” says Matilda Nilsson, a Swedish sophomore, studying business at C.W. Post.  Nilsson says she wanted to study close to New York and heard about the school through a Swedish agency she was directed to after counseling at her high school in Sweden.
Henrik Idsoe, a freshman studying at C.W. Post,from Norway is also a business major and, in addition to his studies, is playing on the men’s soccer team. He heard about the
school through some friends. “I like the opportunity where I can combine playing soccer and get a great education at the same time,” says Idsoe.
More than 40 countries are represented on campus, with the largest amount of international students coming from China, India and Korea. Nisha Yadav is a graduate student studying business, and, after receiving her bachelor’s degree in India, she came to New York to finish her education.  Yadav says she chose C.W. Post because of its proximity to the New York City, where Wall Street and a number of other financial businesses are located.
Studying at Post has afforded her the opportunity to make connections in the financial market.  She has already completed her first internship and is currently looking for another one.
Assistant Provost Jessica Hayes works at the ISS (International Student Services) and lists the close location to NYC, the reputation of the academic programs, and the beautiful campus as reasons for C.W. Post’s large number of international students.
Hayes says she is determined to help ensure academic success for the international students and is also eager to develop inter-cultural experiences and growth for domestic students.
“I personally think its great. I really enjoy going to school where there is a lot of diversity,” says junior Steve DeBellis, a junior music education major.“I wish I had the opportunity to study outside the country.”
The influence from countries all across the world makes C.W. Post campus a diverse and versatile environment, where there are multitudes of opportunities to be taken on and room for all kinds of dreams to be pursued. According to Hayes, close to 200 of the international students are currently taking advantage of a work benefit called Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT), which is a one-year work benefit once a student completes his or her degree. Students who want to follow the ISS Office can “Like” its Facebook fan page by searching C.W. Post International Student Services.

Are you an undergraduate adult student who is enrolled in college for the first time?  Are you planning a career change and in need of new qualifications?  Are you returning to college, determined to finish your degree this time? You’re not alone! You may be surprised to learn that there are more than 550 undergraduate adult students presently enrolled in classes at C.W. Post, and many of them have the same questions and concerns as you.
Did you know, or are you surprised to know that C.W. Post has a place – the Office for Non Traditional Students – in Winnick House, Room 210, dedicated to the special needs of undergraduate adult students, that is those over the age of 25?  Morgan Lyle, an adult student Journalism major, who also works full time on campus as the Assistant Director of P.R. knows pretty much every office on campus, so it was no surprise that he knew about the Office for Non-Traditional Students. Another adult student, Ronica Copes, Journalism Senior, was referred to the office by the Financial Aid Office because she was looking for additional funding to help pay her college tuition.  Copes felt that she might not have heard about the office if it were not for that referral, and expressed an interest in knowing what other services are offered there.
Adult student Stacy McKenna was introduced to the office about five years ago, by her step-mother, a Post employee. McKenna is a Finance Junior and she finds the Office for Non-Traditional Students to be “tremendously helpful” to her. For example, she learned from the office that she was eligible to apply for Life Experience Credits for three classes. Since McKenna takes one or two classes each semester, this invaluable advice has not only cut a year off her studies, but it cut her tuition bill in half for those three classes.
The Office for Non-Traditional Students is headed by Rita Jorgensen, and her assistant Mike Santoro. Jorgensen said that she and her staff assist adult students with their queries and also refer them to the many resources available at Post. She encourages adult students to feel free to visit the office, or send an email outlining their questions to adult-services@liu.edu. The Office for Non-Traditional Students helps with topics such as the Life Experience Program, the Alpha Sigma Lambda Honor Society for Adults, the Returning Adult Scholarship, and an upcoming Return-to-Learning Workshop in October.
If you are new at Post, and even if you are not new but have not yet participated in this workshop, you might find it very useful to attend the Return-to-Learning Workshop for all undergraduate adult students on Saturday, October 1, from 10:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., in the Lobby of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library. The workshop provides strategies on how to study more effectively, approach test-taking with less stress, and how to navigate the resources available in the library. It will include a hands-on demonstration in the library’s computer lab, as well as a tour of the library.
The Office for Non-Traditional Services has agreed to set up a network for adult undergraduate students at Post. Jorgensen’s office will accept e-mails from adult students interested in participating at adult-services@liu.edu.  Put “ASAP Network” in the subject line.
As an adult student, your life is probably already filled to capacity between work, family obligations, classes and study. Therefore, you might find it extremely helpful to tap into a network of other adult students, where you will be able to find support and guidance in addition to the help you already receive from faculty and staff at C.W. Post.
Lyle thought this new networking initiative  “might be a good idea” and said that he “would register.”  Likewise, Copes said that she would try it, and thought that being in touch with another older student, “someone who is serious” about school, “might be a good networking tool, a good idea.”  When asked is she would join, McKenna replied “sure” and elaborated that she is interested in finding out from other adult students “what experiences they have had with resources available at Post.”
The Pioneer, too, is reaching out to adult students, asking you to write to us and give us feedback and comments, at Eileen.OConnor@my.liu.edu. Here are some questions to get your thoughts flowing and your e-mails coming to us.
What have been your experiences here at Post as an adult student?  Have you found it easy to navigate the Post campus?  Do you know about the Office for Non-Traditional Services?  Have you used that office?  If yes, what has been your experience there?  If no, are you interested in finding out more about the services offered there?  Do you have tips to share with others coming after you to guide them?  What help do you need to succeed and are you getting that support here at Post?  How about telling us about help that you did get and how important it was to you and your success?
If you have some funny stories to share about your own experiences, we’d like to hear those too.

The idea for this topic came when I was walking through the parking lot and checking to see how many people actually had the C.W. Post parking stickers on their cars. I was surprised to see that most students had one, although in between there were those that didn’t. I’m not throwing you under the bus on this one, because I too am guilty of not having a parking sticker either. I did at one point have one, but I recently purchased a new car and I didn’t want a sticker on my bumper just yet. Well, it’s been a year and I still don’t want the green sticker on my bumper.  So far, I have not received a ticket or a warning, so I’m curious  as to what the point is of these stickers?
According to the C.W. Post handbook, it states, “all vehicles parking on campus must be registered with the Department of Public Safety. Campus members’ vehicles can be registered at the Department of Public Safety office free of charge anytime.” It also states, “All motor vehicles without a properly affixed parking permit will be summoned.” Lastly, the handbook states that Public Safety will summon or tow cars for various reasons. Vehicles without parking permits are stated to be a violation.  The purpose of the permits, the handbook states, is that in case of an emergency with your car, Public Safety can contact you. I contacted the office of Public Safety who told me the rules were in the handbook and didn’t comment any further.
Clearing up any confusion that I once had (?), I promptly signed up for a parking permit. It didn’t take much time and it was free of charge. Just remember your plate numbers, because I had to go back and remind myself what they were.  The funny thing that I remember is getting my parking permit on my first day of class in freshman year, but I NEVER even considered getting a permit for my new car. Maybe it’s the fact that the car isn’t paid off yet, or I was just too lazy to actually go and get one. Well, now I have the sticker, but it’s still not on my bumper, no, it’s taped in my window on the left side of the driver’s seat, just like the handbook instructs.

With the start of a new school year, the Pioneer staff thought that it might be nice to begin on a fresh page with the Village of Brookville.  In short, we wanted to start the year with an interview with the Mayor.  Unfortunately, arranging such an appointment has been more than just difficult; it has proved impossible.
For years, there have been rumors haunting the C.W. Post Campus detailing an unrivaled animosity towards our school from the citizens of the Village of Brookville.  It had been my intent to speak with the Mayor, the Honorable Caroline Bazinni, and get her final weigh-in on how the V.O.B. views our school and its feelings on Post calling Brookville home.
While her assistant assured me, over the phone, that the Mayor is a busy woman, a fact that I in no way doubt, and that she would, given time, get back to me, her lack of response to my numerous calls and emails has left a sour taste in my mouth.  Again, I find myself wondering just who is running Brookville.             Despite numerous attempts to coordinate a meeting, I am still coming up empty handed.  Why is this?  It should not be quite so difficult to ask a few questions to the Mayor – an elected public official – of a small town such as Brookville.
Truth be told, I’m beginning to feel as if the Village of Brookville gives the illusion of being a well-run town when it’s just an elaborately staged smoke-and-mirrors act.  Of course, this is my opinion, so think what you will.
I can only hope that, in the name of journalistic integrity, I receive a reply soon, so that I may post the Honorable Caroline Bazinni’s rebuttal to my assertions.  After all, nothing would make me any happier than to have Mayor Bazinni prove my initial opinions wrong.  So, I ask, “Great and Powerful Oz,” are you really there, or would you rather us just ignore the men and women behind the curtain who truly run the machine that is Brookville?

As students returned to C.W. Post for the first day of school, many were shocked when they arrived to their classes.  Post’s full time teachers were on strike. When people hear that teachers are on strike, most assume it is all about money, and while it is part of the reason, there are also many underlining issues as well.
Teacher strikes have been occurring more frequently in the last 10 years, but it is hard to know exactly how many nationwide. However, historically, when teachers in Universities and colleges strike, the outcome is unsuccessful. Examples of this include St. Johns University in 1966-67 and Oakland University in 1994 and 2007. Statistically, teacher strikes are only successful if they have the support of the student body.
In the case of C.W. Post, the administration and faculty agreed on a five-year contract with a zero percent pay increase in wages, small pay bonuses, and a renegotiated health insurance plan.  There is also an opportunity for the faculty to receive a 1% pay raise, which is dependent upon enrollment in upcoming school years.
Both the Administration and Faculty feel as though the strike could have been avoided.  However, members of the faculty believe the administration was not willing, initially, to meet them in the middle. “The Union had not been posturing for a strike; we were playing fair,” said Professor Anke Grosskopf, “Negotiations are supposed to be fluid, but it seems that administration and faculty have different interests. The conversations were very rigid on the administration’s side, and the overall tones of the talks were bad.”
With so many perceiving strikes to be all about money, students are wondering: If the money isn’t going to the faculty, where is it going? Post student Stephanie E., who chose to withhold her last name, responded to that question, saying, “I wish I knew. Pell and Humanities Hall[s] haven’t been updated.”  When asked where she thought the money should go, she answered, “I would like to see the money spent on the availability of classes, better food at Winnick, and better equipping the school to handle the volume of people pouring into Winnick and Hillwood during common hour. I understand why teachers are striking; they are on the front lines and are part of the back-bone of this University. I’m in a class where my teacher doesn’t have enough desks to seat all of her students in her classroom. That’s her problem that she has to deal with on a regular basis, not the administration’s.”
Provost Paul H. Forestell explained that the faculty receives benefits that are not in the form of a check at the end of the year. “The University puts money into their retirement, tuition remission, and healthcare,” said Forestell.
Administration maintains that many of the financial problems the University faces are due to a lack of endowment.  University President Dr. David Steinberg has held his position for 25 years. When asked why such a vital life-line for the Long Island University campuses is so low, his response was: “The University purchased the estate from Marjorie Post, and when they named the University after her father, they didn’t receive any large or substantial gifts from the Post family that many other schools who are named after well-noted and economically elite people receive – like Carnegie Mellon and the University of Chicago (John D. Rockefeller).”
Despite days of empty classrooms and seemingly tense negotiations, both sides have come to an agreement that they can live with, and school again is back in session.

Every C.W. Post student must pass a computer, library, and oral competency exam before they are eligible to graduate. The purpose of the exams is to test what the University feels are “essential literacys”, according to Nicholas Ramer, Associate Dean of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences. All three exams are supposed to be completed before junior year. If a student does not pass these exams he/she must adequately complete a workshop in which he/she gains no credit. The other option is take an introductory course in which it is possible to receive credit. Transfer students with more than 60 credits are exempt from the exams.
These competency exams have been part of C.W. Post’s core curriculum for over 20 years and are updated every few years. The Computer Department writes the computer competency exam. On the exam you will find questions about basic hardware, the Internet, operating system software, and basic productivity.  The library faculty comes up with the library literacy exam. This exam deals with understanding different sources of information, the best ways to conduct research, and how to use the school’s library to your best advantage. If you are a Theatre, Media Arts, or Education major, the oral competency requirement is fulfilled within your program.
Maria Wahl, a Junior Early Childhood Education major, passed the library exam, but failed the computer exam and is now taking a computer workshop. Wahl said that she is very frustrated with the workshop and is not finding any of the information useful to earning her degree.
“I feel like this test is overwhelming; it’s five weeks of extensive work on top of my 19 credits. It has no basis for my education, nor my future.”
Transfer student, Brian Arons is an environmental science major who is less than enthusiastic about taking these exams.
“I’ve heard that the library exam was pretty easy but that the questions on the computer test are really hard. I’m nervous about failing it because I don’t have room in my schedule for a labor-intensive workshop right now,” said Arons.
The school does in fact provide study guides for both exams. The study guide for the library exam can be found on the C.W. Post website under the library section.  The study guide for the computer competency exam is available in either Hillwood Commons or Kumble Hall, along with dates and times that the exams are held.

Now, I know that, like his or her coffee, everyone takes his or her love in different forms.  Some like the “I can’t keep my hands off of you” romance, while others prefer the quiet kind of love, filled with stolen glances from across crowded rooms.
But, whether you take your love loud and proud or quiet and tender, we can all agree that, sometimes, a little romance can go a long way.
This past week, I had an argument with my boyfriend. This is something that I’m not one to publicly speak about, but for the sake of relationships everywhere else, I’ll continue. Our fight, which was about my boy blowing off plans to, as he had put it, “have a really special day just for the two of us,” really got me thinking: Is it more appreciated when romantic gestures are planned out and scheduled down to the second, or is it better to have your significant other suddenly sweep you off your feet all over again and make a day special for the both of you?
Personally, I can find the merit to each approach, but I happen to think that spontaneity is a much more romantic gesture than over-planned outings.  You know, that unexpected bouquet of your favorite flowers for no other reason than because he thinks you are the most perfect thing on the planet and he wants to show you it – that’s what romance is about.
Don’t get me wrong, having that date on your calendar, circled with a giant red heart – guys, don’t lie, I know you do that too – gives a girl something to look forward to – a special day or night spent doing whatever it is you and your love find fun and romantic.  We can gush to our girlfriends about how lucky we are to have such a wonderful guy, secretly hoping to make them all jealous of the relationship that we treasure so much.
It may all seem so cliché, and I guess that not every relationship is like that, but then what does everyone else like?  Am I alone in thinking that, like in my case this week, I’d rather not be promised a romantic outing, but, instead, would much prefer a sudden call asking me to “get ready. I’m taking you somewhere special”?  I may be crazy, but if that’s not true romance, then what is? Let me know what you think; send me your thoughts and opinions on what kind of lovin’ you like best – cwpstpnr@gmail.com

It’s the first day of class. All of your school supplies are ready to go.  You purchased or rented the textbooks for class. You walk to your classroom only to find that class has been canceled due to the strike, unless you were one of the lucky students whose professor continued to have class.
This was not the greatest way to start off the school year, as senior Biology education major Louis Scala put it, “It was ill timed.”  Many students, especially commuters, expressed disapproval upon hearing of the canceling of their classes.  With gas prices the way they are, can you blame them? After an increase in student tuition, canceled classes may not have been the greatest news for anyone returning to school.
On the other hand, not all students objected entirely to the cancelation of classes.  Many, including Kim Woods, a senior childhood education major, who understood the professors’ reactions toward the unsettled contract. “I understand why the faculty [members] were frustrated and decided to take the actions they took by fighting for their rights to a fair contract.” said Woods. “But it was also frustrating for students who felt that their education was being hindered, and put second for the first week of school.” Marie Serpico, senior adolescent education major agreed. “Teachers should stick up for what they deserve,” said Serpico. “The strike should have been settled in a more time-appropriate manner.  Going into my senior year was very unsettling because of what happened and I felt very uninformed.  Especially for freshman just starting college, I can’t imagine how confusing it was.  I’m glad it’s over.”  After a few days of abandoning classes, the C.W. Post faculty union membership reached an agreement with the university administration and all classes were in session by the following week.  Despite mixed opinions from the student population at C.W. Post, there is one thing that we can undoubtedly all agree on; the strike has already made this semester a memorable one.

Redshirt junior Grayson Laurino and redshirt freshman Steven Laurino once again have the opportunity to play football alongside one another. The Laurino brothers were born native to Long Island, however, they moved to Boise, Idaho, not long after. Both young men had the privilege of playing on Boise State Turf while living there. Grayson played quarterback in high school, tallying 1400 passing yards and 500 rushing yards overall in his 07-08 season. Steven, as quarterback after Grayson left the program, tallied 1100 passing yards, 12 touch-downs and 500 rushing yards in the 08-09 season.
Interview with Grayson Laurino:
1.How long have you been playing football, and why did you begin playing?
I have been playing football since the 7th grade. I was able to watch my best friend’s football practice when I was in 6th grade, and, after that practice, I knew football was the sport for me.
2.What position did you play in high school?
I played quarterback.
3.Did you find it easy playing with your brother in high school?
In high school, Steve and I had a great connection on the field. It was very easy playing together because we knew what we were going to do on the field.
4.What made you decide to come play in New York as a walk-on, and was it difficult?
It was very difficult to come to New York as a walk-on. I left all of my friends and family in Idaho to come Post. I wanted to play football, and when the coaches at Post gave me the opportunity to walk on, I took it.
5.How did you feel when your brother committed to C.W. Post?
Steve had a very tough recruiting process, and I didn’t think he was going to come to Post. Everyone thought he was going to go play for Boise State. When I got the word he decided to come here, I was overwhelmed. I was relieved and happy at the same time. I knew he was going to be a great player for this program.
6.Would you say you and your brother share a connection on the field today?
Yes, we share a connection on the field, but right now, we need work. College is a lot different from high school. It’s not just pitch and catch anymore. It takes a lot more skill, communication, and hard work from the whole team to have a successful play.
Interview with Steven Laurino:
1. How long have you been playing football, and did your brother have an impact on you picking up a football for the first time?
I’ve been playing since 5th grade. Yes, he had an impact. We both played soccer, and we started considering football with our friends. We always played at school –  just never organized. If he didn’t make the switch, I wouldn’t have either.
2.  How do you feel now that you and your brother have flip-flopped positions in the transition from high school to college ball?
The whole flip-flop of positions came over a long period of time. I started playing quarter back when he left for college, and it took him almost two years to switch to wide receiver. So, we were both quarterbacks for a long time. He eventually switched to wide receiver, and I came into Post as a safety. Then, they switched me back to quarterback, and it wasn’t until people started mentioning it that we really noticed the irony.
3.  Do you feel you guys share the same connection on the field today as you did in Boise?
We are brothers, so there is always a connection, but, unlike [in] high school ball, this is a much more sophisticated game, and now, it isn’t so much a connection as it is just me reading the defense and getting the ball to the guy who gives us the best shot in that scenario.
4.  What made you decided to follow in your brother’s footsteps by coming to Post?
I didn’t really follow in his footsteps; I just got robbed of finishing his senior year with him because I broke my collarbone, and I wanted to play with him again. Whether or not we go on to the next level, I just wanted to have an experience that most people will never get, playing college ball with his brother. That, to me, was a bigger success than playing Division I.
5.  Do you and your brother motivate each other to become better players?
When it comes to motivation, I don’t think either of us buys into any of the cheesy brother stuff.  We both have a burning desire to be the greatest, and neither of us has to say a word to each other to make that fire burn. It’s in our blood, not our words.

The C.W Post Pioneers women’s soccer team went 1-1 this past week, defeating the Caldwell College Cougars 4-1, then falling to Southern New Hampshire University at 4-3 in overtime.
The Pioneers traveled to Caldwell College on Wednesday, where Alexa Niciforo, Eliza Sefton and Tove Eriksson led the team to a 4-1 win. Niciforo, a sophomore, scored two goals, while Sefton and Eriksson each scored one goal.
The Pioneers jumped on the board early, when Niciforo scored on a breakaway at 22:06 to push the Pioneers ahead 1-0. Niciforo received the lead pass from freshman midfielder Heidi Eikeland. Four minutes later, Sefton scored an unassisted goal to make it a 2-0 in favor of the Pioneers. Eriksson would score at 42:54 on a penalty kick to give the Pioneers a commanding 3-0 lead.
The Cougars broke up the shutout in the second half off of a goal scored by Carissa Strye to make it a 3-1 game. The Pioneers answered back when Niciforo scored her second goal of the game with 12 minutes remaining to play.
Senior goalkeeper Allie Weiser was given the win for the Pioneers. She made only one save in the win. Robin Franchi was handed the loss for the Caldwell College Cougars.
On September 17th, the Pioneers traveled to Manchester, New Hampshire, to take on the Southern New Hampshire University Penmen. There, the Pioneers suffered a tough 4-3 overtime defeat.
The Pioneers once again started off strong. Lina Harle scored 5:40 into the game on an out of position SNHU goalkeeper. The Penmen responded 32 seconds later, as Ashley Jaskula scored on a rebound shot to tie the game at one.  The Pioneers regained its lead later in the half when Heidi Eikeland found the back of the net for a goal. Eikeland caused a turnover and scored to make it 2-1.
The Pioneers struck again in the second half. Prudence Rydstrom scored a header inside the right post to make it a 3-1 Pioneer lead.
The Penmen responded in the 76th minute when Kaliegh Roberge scored to make it 3-2. With just over a minute left in the game, Arierl Teixiera’s free kick set up Kasey Morrison for the tying goal and sent the game to overtime.
Morrison put the nail in the Pioneer’s coffin scoring the game-winning goal six minutes into overtime.
Pioneer goalkeeper Allie Weiser made 11 saves in the 4-3 loss to the SNHU Penmen. Its record moves 3-2 on the season with the loss. The Pioneers do not take the field again until Friday, September 24th, when they travel up to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to take on the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights.

The C.W. Post football team had been blown out in the first two games of the season and wanted to avoid a third, but the 25th-ranked Mercyhurst Lakers proved to be too much for the squad, beating the Pioneers 34-7.
Once again, the Pioneers struggled on offense. Steven Laurino returned after missing a game with a wrist injury but was just 11-27 for 92 yards. Laurino struggled throwing the ball, and the Pioneers’ running game was held to just 31 yards over the entire game.
The Lakers opened up the scoring with a one yard run by Ricky Matthews. Matthews also rushed for another touchdown later in the game and totaled 54 yards.
Matthews had a good day rushing, but Saturday was all about Laker quarterback Travis Rearick, who torched the Pioneers defense for 372 yards and a pair of touchdowns. His favorite target of the day was Trevor Kennedy, who caught 11 passes for 206 yards, including two touchdown passes.
The final score and stats reflected that the Pioneer defense played poorly, but they were victims of big plays and were forced to spend over 43 minutes on the field due to the lack of offense. C.W. Post’s D.J. Young had an interception and broke up 3 passes, while Billy O’Connor and Andrew Jackson racked up 10 and 9 tackles, respectively.
The Pioneers kept the game close for most of the first half, despite the nearly nonexistent offense. A big play in the game that proved to be the turning point came with three minutes remaining in the first half and the Lakers up just 7-0. Post running back Thomas Beverly fumbled the ball, allowing the Lakers to get good field position. In those three minutes after the fumble, the Lakers took advantage, scoring twice to make it a 17-0 game, a deficit that the Pioneers were never able to make up.
The Pioneers got on the board in the third, when second-year running back Anthony Brunetti rushed into the end zone for a five yard score. But, that proved to be the only time that the Pioneers would reach the end zone.
Despite being winless on the season, the Pioneers will get the chance to play at home for the next two weeks to, possibly, find a way to change the number on the side of the left column. That will start next Saturday, September 24th, when the Shippensburg Red Raiders head to Hickox Field. Coverage on 88.1FM and WCWP.org will begin at 12:30 with the game following at 1 p.m.

How long have you been playing for the C.W. Post women’s soccer team?
This is my fourth year playing at Post.
What was your first impression of Post?
I remember thinking how beautiful the campus was and how everyone was very friendly and helpful.
How do you feel about Post now?
Post has really been my second home, and I am really thankful for everything that I have experienced here. I have learned a lot about myself and about life, which I probably would not have learned if I did not come here.
What lesson(s) will you take from Post?
The most important lesson I will take with me from Post is that if you want something, you have to work for it. No matter if it is schoolwork or soccer, you have to be willing to work hard to get the results that you want.
What is the best memory you have with the team?
My best memory with the team is last year, when we made it to the Sweet 16. Unfortunately, we lost that game, but it was a great feeling knowing that we were among the 16 best teams in the country, and I enjoyed playing every minute of that game. Even though we did not make it any further, I am really happy and proud of that season.
What do you want to do after you graduate from Post?
My goal is to become a physical therapist, so in a few years, I will be back in school.
What will you miss the most from Post?
I will definitely miss my team the most, as well as being a college athlete. I am also going to miss all of the friends I have made here, who have made this the best four years of my life.
Tove Eriksson has played in 56 games during her career her at C.W. Post.  Eriksson was named to the 2008 East Coast Conference Third Team as a freshman.  The Pioneers have an overall record of 3-2, and in the 2011 ECC Preseason Poll, they were predicted to finish first as repeat conference champions.   After a two week succession of away games, the Pioneers will take the field again at home on October 5th, when they take on N.Y.I.T. at 4 p.m.

Since the season is going well this year, we are a little bit more satisfied with the soccer.
What lesson(s) will you take from Post?

What is the best memory you have with the team?
I have a lot of good memories with the team.  My most recent [one] was coming home from Bentley after we turned the game around and won. We sung the whole bus ride back to Post.
