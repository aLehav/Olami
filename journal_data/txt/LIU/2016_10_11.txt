To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Homecoming 2016, from Oct. 7-9, featured events for current students, prospective students, alumni and families.  The festivities began on Friday, Oct. 7 with a pep rally at 7 pm at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. On Saturday, Oct. 8, there were many alumni events, including a small party celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Pioneer newspaper and a welcome back alumni party at WCWP, the campus radio station. Along with the alumni events on Saturday, there was an open house for prospective students and their families, along with campus tours.
And, of course, there was the homecoming football game. The team beat Saint Anselm College, 63-20,  to improve its record to 6-0 forthe season. Backed by a first half, which featured 42 points, the Pioneers cruised to a decisive 43 point victory.
The No. 21 ranked football team didn’t waste any time getting on the board. On the game’s second play, red-shirt defensive lineman Kenny Scotland intercepted a deflected pass and took it back nine yards to the house for the pick-six. Zero offensive snaps and already a seven point lead.
On Saint Anselm’s next possession, they turned it over again. This time, freshman defensive back Joshua Flowers came up with the take away and red-shirt sophomore running back Malik Pierre was the beneficiary, with a nine yard score to extend the early Pioneer lead to 14-0.
Two possessions later, the Pioneers found themselves in the end zone  again. Unlike their previous touchdowns, this drive started on their own 21 yard line. The cap on the drive was a 15 yard scamper by senior running back David White at the 6:28 mark, to put the Pioneers in front 21-0. The three touchdown first quarter set the tone for the offense and the defense mimicked that; shutting out Saint Anselm in the first 15 minutes.
In the second quarter, the Pioneers finished an impressive 16 play, 95 yard drive that culminated in a two yard rushing touchdown by senior quarterback Jeff Kidd. Down 28, Saint Anselm refused to fold, responding with touchdown, but their defense was simply no match for the Pioneer offense.
The Pioneers totaled 532 yards of offense on 81 plays while Saint Anselm went for 356 total yards, most of which came late. The first score through the air went to red-shirt junior wide out James Higgins, who hauled in a five yard touchdown; extending the lead to 35-7. A few possessions later, Kidd connected with Pierre for his second score of the day, pushing the lead to 42-14.
The second half was more of the same from the Pioneers, who scored three unanswered touchdowns. Red-shirt junior receiver Kyle Ward was the recipient of a six yard touchdown while White hauled in a three yard score for his second of the day. Freshman halfback Tim Marinan scored the final touchdown of the day on a 42 yard run.
Kidd went 22-31 through the air for 204 yards and four touchdowns. On the ground, four Pioneers crossed the goal line including White, who led the team with 131 yards. In the receiving department, four Pioneers hauled in touchdowns, but the corps was led by red-shirt wide out Shane Hubbard, who hauled in eight balls for 74 yards.
Head football coach Bryan Collins and his team are back again on Saturday, Oct. 15, when they travels to play Southern Connecticut State University. This Ne-10 clash start at noon.
Homecoming weekend ended on Sunday, Oct. 9 with a Long Island beer tour. The rain certainly didn’t dampen the festivities for Homecoming 2016.

Election Day is less than a month away, and to say it’s just around the corner is an understatement. On Tuesday, Nov. 8, Americans go to their polling places to cast their votes for who they think the next leader of the free world should be.
Deadlines for registration to vote vary from state to state; New York’s deadline is Oct. 14. This time of year has students thinking, how important is it to vote?
“I think it’s important to vote. It’s our opportunity to have a say in who’s going to make our country a better place,” said Lindsey Greenfader, a junior fashion merchandising major. “This November will be my first time voting, I’m voting for Hillary, I think it’s time we have a woman in the White House,” she added. Frank Ranfone, a sophomore psychology major, agreed, “Yeah, it is important to vote; it’s only one vote, but it counts.” Ranfone said he’d be voting for “Trump, baby!”
Junior criminal justice major, Salina Webson said, “I think everyone can make a difference in some type of way. I actually just registered to vote.” She added, “I don’t know who I’m voting for, but definitely not Trump.”
These Post students agree; voting is important. But students interviewed about whether they felt obligated to vote were split 50/50 between yes and no.
Sophomore health science major, Miranda Alldaffer said, “No it’s not an obligation, it’s a choice and I don’t like any of the [candidates].” Similarly, Brendan Gaghan, a senior history major, said, “No, I feel like there is no need to vote in today’s day and age.”
Others, however, felt that voting is an obligation. Connor Farrell, a sophomore business major said people need to exercise their rights. And Matt Ruhlig, a sophomore marketing major said, “I think the change starts with us.”
The results of the Pioneers’ unscientific poll of students were clear. Although most think it’s important to vote, only half think it’s their obligation. Yet, they all agreed that this election is the most interesting one of their lifetimes. For most, it will be their first chance to engage in the political process. In November, we will see just how many choose to cast their vote, and of course, which candidate is elected.

The Honors Program began in 1963. As the Pioneer reported on Nov. 3, 2015, the Honors Program became the Honors College in fall 2015. There are currently 200 undergraduates, of all majors, in the year-old college.
Honors students have unique opportunities such as small, seminar-style classes, mentorships, Merit Fellowship programs and scholarship opportunities. The offices recently moved from the second floor of Humanities to the second floor of Winnick house, also referred to as “the mansion” on the hill.
Joan Digby, a professor in the English department, has been the director of the Honors Program since the late 1970s. “I never got bored, I love it, I still love it, ” Digby said.
As director, Digby works with an advisory council and serves as a general advisor to all students in the program. All incoming freshmen and transfer students accepted into the program must have a high school average of 89 and above, including combined math and verbal SAT scores ranging approximately around 600.
Four-year honors students are required to take 30 credits, and three-year participants 18 credits within their major. Juniors/seniors need a 3.4 GPA to join, following 12 credits (if they don’t enroll their freshmen year).
Each student in the honors college is required to go to five merit events per term. Merit events are held by the students/faculty, called the “honors advisory board.” They usually plan a variety of seminars, group discussions, community service, and music and theatre plays honors students attend for merit. The events are open and free for everyone.
The Honors College requires students to write a thesis involving research in their area during their senior year. “For a lot of people that is the key for them, a lot of the students in the Honors College leave either writing a book or documenting it,” Digby said. Most honors students, prior to graduation usually have done research in their field of study and are much more prepared.
Digby, and her husband, John Digby, run a small press called Prehensile Pencil Publications, The Feral Press. They welcome all students who want to write or are interested in publishing. The publications are purchased by university libraries and small press collectors. All of the publications are illustrated by artists working in black and white media.
According to Digby, many of the students from the honors college end up getting some of their own work published, which gives them something to show at job interviews.
“The Honors College is wonderful and diverse. Dr. Digby is a wonderful professor. I highly recommend the Honors College,” said Ilana Leviton, a sophomore English major and member of the Honors College. “It is mainly for students who really want to put that extra effort into getting that A and getting that B. The honors college is also reasonable if you’re struggling.”
Digby’s office is on the second floor of the Winnick House. Her doors are open for anyone interested in finding out more about the Honors College as well as the courses she teaches, such as “The Horse in Literature and Perspectives in World Literature.”
Honors college students are also eligible for special scholarships that help make college more affordable. To learn more, visit www.liu. edu/post/honors

Changes have been made this semester inside the Hillwood Café, as reported on by The Pioneer in the Oct. 5 issue. The area that was formerly strictly for pizza has now been revamped, adding a fresh fruit smoothie bar. The refrigerator under the sushi counter has added prepared sandwiches, salads, parfaits, and fresh fruit cups. These items used to be located in the back left refrigerator, near the coffee and tea counter. The back left refrigeration section is now filled with a variety of bottled drinks, along with bowls of fresh fruit on the bottom shelf, no longer holding the pre-packaged items.
The change in location of packaged items has led students to believe there has been a decrease in the amount and variety of food. Edward Taraskewich, resident district manager of Aramark Foods, said that is not the case. There is a consistent amount of grab-and-go salads, wraps, and sandwiches compared to prior semesters, according to Taraskewich.
“Our team has also expanded the variety of fruit and dessert items in the grab-and-go section and added toppings for yogurt and custard desserts,” Taraskewich said. “The change in location was made for greater accessibility.”
If there is not a prepared salad or wrap to the liking of a student in the display case, there is the salad/wrap station on the opposite side of the sushi station. But, the line for the salad bar no longer runs parallel to the cashier lines, as it did last semester. It is now on the opposite side, closer to the grill. Not all students are appreciative of the change. “The salad line is still long and overrated,” said Marvin Johnson, a senior economics major. The salad bar prepares orders between 11 a.m. – 3:30 p.m., according to one of the servers.
Hours of operation at the café have stayed the same: Mon. through Thurs., 7a.m. – 7 p.m., Fri. 8 a.m. – 2 p.m., and closed throughout the weekend. For commuters, the hours of operation are not a problem because their classes usually end before 7 p.m. For residents on campus, this schedule is difficult. Theatre lighting professor Mike Gugliotti said it is difficult for rehearsing theatre students to find food on the weekends, especially on the academic side of campus. “It was so hard for them to grab food during their dinner break because nothing in Hillwood was open,” he said.
Though students could go to Winnick, rehearsals are in the Little Theatre or the Theatre, Dance, and Arts Management building. Oftentimes, the rehearsals run beyond the hours of operation of the dining hall.
The End Zone is an option for late dining on campus, operating Mon. through Sat. 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., and Sun. 8 p.m. to 12 a.m. “Additionally, this semester the Aramark team has updated the End Zone menu and hot entrées have been added back to the grill menu,” Taraskewich said. “The whole Aramark team is proud of the student centered changes.”

Some 14 percent of college students identify as Latino/Hispanic, according to collegeboard.com. There are 6,224 undergrad students. We were only able to find two professors who identified as Latino. In honor of Hispanic Heritage month taking place from Sep. 15 – Oct. 15, we are uncloaking Niria Leyva-Gutierrez professor, art-lover, Cubana-Americana.
Professor L-G as the students call her, is an assistant professor of art history and museum studies.          Leyva-Gutierrez is an art enthusiast and enjoys artwork from the 17th century including, Diego Velázquez and Peter Paul Ruben. But her favorite things about teaching are the students. She recalls the last time she took students to a museum on a field trip and was touched to see that a handful of students have never been to a museum before.
Leyva-Gutierrez describes the experience of visiting museums as a “turn on switch for your brain” and guarantees you’ll leave with a “new set of eyes.” She has been teaching for 16 years and is going on her fifth year at LIU. She did her undergrad at Tufts University and obtained her Ph.D. at NYU Institute of Fine Arts.
Leyva-Gutierrez grew up in Tampa, Florida, surrounded by Cuban-Americans like herself. Both her parents immigrated from Cuba at a young age; forcing them to drop out of high school. When asked about any adversities she has had to face being Latina, she said she was one of the lucky few whom did not face racism or discrimination. However, there are many other obstacles than xenophobia.
Leyva-Gutierrez is a first-generation college student. She grew up in a bilingual home with her two sisters, however, like most Latino first-generation students, parents may know nothing to very little about the college process in the Unites States. She recalls being on her own when it came to filling out college applications. Frustrating as it can be, she has always remained proud of her culture and where she came from. She thinks embracing your culture is very important, and even double-majored in Spanish Lit to further understand her culture and language. Leyva-Gutierrez has two kids who she tries her best to ingrain the Cuban culture and Spanish language into, the same way she was taught.
For whatever reason, the small presence of Latino/Hispanic students and faculty is saddening and unfortunate, according to Leyva- Gutierrez. “We should have a larger presence on campus.” Especially with the off-putting remarks presidential nominee Donald Trump has said about Mexicans and the Latino/Hispanic community, Leyva-Gutierrez believes, “latinos are starting to realize how strong a voice they can have.”
There have not been any events recognizing Hispanic Heritage month on campus. However, there are other ways to celebrate the Latino/Hispanic culture this month. You can pick up some Salvadorian pupusas or the Mexican beverage, aqua de horchata; listen to the sensational Cumbia music of Selena, and head over to some museums exhibiting Latino/ Hispanic artists. The celebration of diversity is always beneficial.

Where do the angry Facebook post, the revealing Snapchat story and the unfiltered tweet disappear to after they’ve been deleted? Are they really gone forever? Michael Hartnett, author of “The Great SAT Swindle,” and “Universal Remote” introduces the question in his coming-of-age novel, “Generation Dementia,” released Oct. 1, 2015.
“I was first looking for something to deal with the idea of data,” Hartnett said, sharing his inspiration of the novel. His book revolves around the theme of technology and its impact on human behavior, also seen in his two previous works. In “Generation Dementia,” Hartnett wanted to embody the data in a physical form—as garbage.
“It’s always laying around, being picked up, and moved around,” Hartnett said.The story follows Narrator Hash O’Connell as he and the disoriented, the suicidal, the desperate cellphone addict lineup to get on a garbage truck in Frick Village. The story represents the overhaul of data-stressing teenagers today. In this revealing look at life, Hartnett divulges that even if we think our garbage is gone, it never goes away.
Alfred Doblin, an LIU alumni, wrote in a blurb on the jacket of the novel, “Hartnett artfully shows us the only truly non-disposable thing in our society is our garbage. It’s an enjoyable and perceptive read from the beginning to the end.”
Hartnett received his masters in English education at Long Island University, and holds a doctorate in English literature from SUNY Stony Brook. He teaches world literature, also known as English 8, at Post on Saturdays and teaches literature at Jericho High School.
Hartnett does not try to promote his books to his students at the university. “They already have enough to read with my class,” he said. With two other published works, his students eventually come around to reading them, commonly after getting to know their professor.
“It takes usually about a year to write, and then another year to rewrite and edit, for all the revisions,” Hartnett said on the process of writing his books. He is already working on his next book, exploring certain ideas about American history that he is curious about. “[I’m] not sure the direction,” Harnett said, “but it might deal with Disney World.”

Heather Parrott went to the College of Charleston in Charleston, S.C., and majored in sociology. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree, she continued studying sociology as a graduate student at the University of Georgia, receiving her doctorate in 2009. She also received graduate certificates in nonprofit management and women’s studies.
With her passion for sociology and helping those around her, she has accumulated “about a decade of social work experience working for nonprofit agencies that address family and gendered violence,” Parrott said, explaining that it involved “[working] on staff at a rape crisis center, a group home for abused children, and a domestic violence shelter.”
Fast Forward almost eight years, and Heather Parrott is a tenured professor on campus teaching classes in social statistics, research methods, race and ethnicity, sociology of poverty, immigration and society and gender violence.
It’s the idea that you can always do better that drives Parrott the “extra mile.” That same thought inspired Parrott to form a college research program, piloted by hardworking professors and students.
“In February 2016, I sent an email out to all Post faculty to feel out interest in an LIU research center that worked with Long Island nonprofit agencies. Within 48 hours, I received responses from 22 faculty members across 17 different departments,” she said.
Her vision for the Research Collaborative program on campus is becoming a reality. “I had wanted to do something like this for a few years,” Parrott said. “Having worked for nonprofits and taken classes on nonprofit management, I know that nonprofit agencies typically need to collect data within their agencies for the sake of securing funding, justifying funding, or just seeing if new initiatives work; yet they typically do not have adequate resources to collect, analyze, and compile all of the data they believe is necessary.”
The Research Collaborative is made up of an “interdisciplinary network of LIU faculty and students who help conduct research for nonprofit agencies. While research is the centerpiece of this endeavor, the broader goal is to more effectively mobilize the expertise of LIU faculty to assist Long Island nonprofit agencies and, wherever possible, use these connections to enhance student learning,” Parrott added.
One of those nonprofit agencies is the Empowerment Collaborative of Long Island, or ECLI. A non-profit organization, it works hands-on with the victims and survivors of human trafficking on Long Island.
Human trafficking is “The fastest growing business of organized crime and second largest criminal enterprise in the world,” according to Jennifer G. Hernandez, ECLI’s co-founder, who estimates the costs to around 99 billion dollars annually. “And New York City ranks in the top 10 cities [of cities that human trafficking is ran through] where this is happening.”
According to Jennifer Castillo, co-founder of ECLI and Hernandez’s colleague, the human trafficking occurring in New York City spills over onto Long Island. The Island ranks 20th for human trafficking in the country, according to ECLI’s statistical analysis page. Furthermore, ECLI projects that 70 percent of prostitution is conducted by way of dating websites. A prime example is backpages.com<http://backpages. com/>, where people can solicit sex online and exchange currency for “service,” within just one hour after information between the service provider and the client is exchanged.
To prevent human trafficking, ECLI is receiving funding from Safe Harbour, another non-profit organization that works to end human trafficking on Long Island, as well as the Legal Aid of Central Islip, according to Hernandez and Castillo. Organizations of this kind funnel survivors of human trafficking to ECLI. ECLI then provides shelter, food, and counseling services for the young men and women affected by human trafficking.
Castillo and Hernandez made it a point that “Human Trafficking on Long Island shows no bias when it comes to race, gender, or economic status,” saying, “everyone is affected.” Aside from providing counseling services, ECLI is currently working to set up fundraising and awareness events in Brentwood and other communities in the near future.
Parrott and the Research Collaborative program currently has 20 faculty members officially affiliated with the program. Professor Benjamin Gerdes, in the department of communications and film, is one of those professors.
Gerdes and his field production class (BDST 25) are “currently working on a semester long research project with ECLI [through affiliation with the Re- search Collaborative Program],” Gerdes said. The class will put together an 8-10-minute documentary clip, covering and interviewing the survivors of human trafficking on Long Island. “We’re trying to connect the school with domestic-social issues that affect Long Island,” Gerdes added.
The feedback and support the program already received is exciting for Parrott.
“Right now, our projects are all with faculty or classes of students, but I hope the collaborative will expand to be able to incorporate undergraduate and graduate students,” she said. “If students are interested in [pro- viding] research [For nonprofit organizations] or internship opportunities [provided through Parrot and the Research Collaborative Program], please contact me as well and I can see what I can arrange.”
Parrott can be reached at heather.parrott@liu.edu. The LIU Post Research Collaborative website is at www.liucollaborative. com.

This month, the Post Theatre Company presents Trojan Barbie by Christine Evans, whose work has received multiple awards across the U.S., U.K., and Australia. The show is directed by Illana Stein, a New York based theatre director, who was brought in specifically for the show.
According to Samuel French’s website, Trojan Barbie is a, “Part contemporary drama, part homage to Euripides’ Trojan Women, Trojan Barbie recasts the legendary fall of the city of Troy against the vivid reality of modern warfare. Poetic, compassionate, and tinged with great warmth and humor, Trojan Barbie is an epic war story with a most unlikely heroine, who always looks on the bright side even as past and present collide about her.”
The cast includes our very own students Emily Banks, Melissa Bianchi, Jaeda Blair, Torun Esmaeili, Griffin Lockette, Nyla Sampson, and Diamond Essence White as the Trojans. In other various roles, Gabe Amato, Paul Bakey, Aaron Cooper, Justin Dickenson, Ethan Graeme Moore Dodd, Angela Downs, Ervin Gonzales, and Christina Kroell perform, all of whom are theatre majors.
“It has been wonderful working on Trojan Barbie with this talented group of students,” Stein said. “They’ve become a true ensemble as they embraced the world of the play. In the rehearsal room they have explored mask compositions, built character collages, rhythm and tableaux work. Hopefully it will all pay off in the performances they put up.”
Stein explains that her favorite part has been the conversation in the first days of table work “as we dug deeper into the themes of the play of war, gender identity, female empowerment, and rising above the constraints that society can put on people.” The play is complex, and Stein expresses pride in the students for accepting the challenge.
“What I love about Trojan Barbie is a world that marries the old and the new, or in our design how we fully embraced the plastic and the stone,” Stein added. Inspired by the Greek tragedy Trojan Women by Euripides, Trojan Barbie represents victims of war: the refugees, the voiceless, and the women, according to Stein. “The hope is that the women have each other to hold on to. For these women in the play, Lotte, on of the characters, bares witnesses to it all and is there to bury the dead and carry on their stories so they are no longer forgotten,” she said.
Angela Downs, a senior musical theatre major who plays the role of Helen in the play, says, “Every experience is different. Seeing the trajectory of the production is one of my favorite things. To think back on table work, and talking as a cast about the meaning of the play and its bare bones, to finally dressing it with movement and space, and then costumes, sounds, and lights. Each layer puts you deeper in the world and encourages your character to come to life. It’s exhausting spending 24 hours a week in the studio and hours and hours doing outside work on your own, but it is the most rewarding and thrilling experience.”
Downs spoke about the excitement of opening night. “You can feel the energy from the audience get stronger as more people come in. The sound from the people talking is a very specific sound and it’s almost calming to me, but yet lights a fire that can’t exist is rehearsals or tech runs,” she said. “Our company is also extraordinarily supportive and we can count on a full house and a safe audience. My hope for opening night is for the cast to come together as an ensemble like we haven’t before, and to allow ourselves to play and have fun and find new moments on stage. This is our job, and to be part of theater in any way makes me feel extraordinarily lucky.”
The play incorporates aspects of Greek mythology, which may be confusing to the audience if they have no prior knowledge of Greek Mythology and related events in its history. It may be difficult to understand why certain characters behave the way they do and why they have a certain intensity. Despite this, the play offers a good sense of humor amongst the intense moments and makes it easy to follow the events. The play runs in the Little Theatre Mainstage on Oct. 7, 8, and 13- 15 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 9 and 16 at 3 p.m. Tickets are $15 general admission, $12 for seniors, and $10 for students. To make reservations, email the box office at post-ptc@liu.edu or call them at 516-299-2356.

With each passing year, it seems that New York Comic Con continues to increase in popularity. The lines get longer and the exhibition floor becomes increasingly congested with people moving from vendor to vendor. While its size may be intimidating to newcomers, the experience is still thrilling year after year. With panels such as “Iron Fist” and “Doctor Who,” and guests like Stan Lee and Jenna Coleman, this convention from Oct. 6-9, at the Javits Center, was one fans would not soon forget.
One of the biggest issues of this year was the new system by which fans entered the Javits Center. In previous years, there was one entrance at the side of the center where all fans would go through to enter the building. While the area was packed with people, there were no long lines present. This year, however, fans greeted by two lines that wrapped around the building and several hours wait to get inside, because the staff was only letting in one group of fans at a time. There was also a lack of staff outside, so most fans were aimlessly walking around the building until finding the right line to get on.
Once inside, fans are greeted with a steady amount of panels, autograph and photo-op sessions, and hundreds of vendors to occupy their day. While there were several popular panels this year, one of the biggest was the BBC America Takeover that showcased TV shows “Class,” “Doctor Who,” and “Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency.”
The panel was held at The Theater at Madison Square Garden instead of one of the main stages at the Javits Center. Fans were treated to several trailers from “Class” and “Doctor Who” and a screening of the first episode from “Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency.” Attending were several stars and writers from each show, including The Doctor, the title character in “Doctor Who,” played by Peter Capaldi.
The new Marvel series on Netflix, “Iron Fist,” was also a popular panel, as new footage debuted and several cast members held a Q and A. Fans also had the opportunity to meet some of their favorite heroes and villains throughout the four-day event. Some popular guests included Jon Bernthal, from “The Walking Dead” and “Daredevil;” Jenna Coleman from “Doctor Who;” and Adam West, who is most famous from playing Batman in the 1960s TV show.
Perhaps the most popular guest was legendary comic book writer Stan Lee, who made his final appearance at New York Comic Con. Possibly thousands of fans lined up for autographs and paid a hefty price of $100 to meet their hero one last time. Comic book artist John Romita Jr. was also present, and will be appearing at Post on Tuesday, Oct. 11.
Along with panels and guests, another popular aspect of Comic Con is cosplay, where people dress up as their favorite character and walk the show floor. Once again, some of the most popular cosplays were Harley Quinn, the Joker, and Deadpool. The Margot Robbie and Jared Leto versions of Harley Quinn and the Joker were the most abundant, as they were main characters in the movie “Suicide Squad,” which released in August and is still in theaters. Some of the more inventive cosplays included an eight-foot tall clown, and several homemade costumes.
Even though New York Comic Con keeps expanding, there is still nothing like it in New York. It’s amazing to see thousands of fans come together each fall to support their passion. As long as Comic Con continues to grow each year, it will remain in New York for a long time.

The Music Industry Club held its third annual “Phenomenon” singing competition on Friday, Oct. 7, in the Hillwood Cinema.
The student judges included Salvatore Ciulla, the president and founder of the club, who recently finished an internship at Sony Music’s subsidiary “The Orchard,” a platform to sell music through a distribution network; Savanah Cummings, last year’s winner who is a senior nursing major; and Alex Martinez, a senior music major and theatre minor who toured with the Jazz Department to Montreux, Switzerland, to perform at the Montreux Jazz Festival last July.
The contestants comprised of music majors, members of the club, and passionate singers in unrelated majors, making the competition fairly diverse. “They all had much to offer irrespective of where they came from,” Cuilla said. “I really enjoyed planning and judging this event. The panel was really knowledgeable about their music and overall the show ran smoothly.” Ciulla said. He cheered for the audience turn-out of around 50 who came out to support the contestants.
There were nine contestants, each performed a song in the first round. Only five of these nine made it to round two. Three of these five were selected by the highest votes, and two were selected by the judges.
Round two consisted of another performance by each of the contestants. The remaining two advanced to the finale, once again by earning the audience’s and judges’ votes.
The finalists were Sam Pollet, a sophomore biology major and Eric Carter, a freshman music major. “They both performed really well and were really engaged with the audience,” Ciulla said. The winner was then determined by the highest number of votes that were texted in from the audience; Eric Carter claimed the victory.
The top three contestants were awarded a spot to perform in the club’s annual music festival (MIC Fest), which will be held during the spring semester. The second place winner, Pollet, received $50. Carter earned the grand prize of $100, a spot to perform at Runway’s annual fashion show, apart from performing at the MIC Fest.
“I was stoked! Phenomenon is typically held in the fall, but we had a lot of people ask if we can do another one next semester,” Ciulla said. “Our big event next semester will be our annual music festival we do in the spring called MIC Fest. As for now, we do not plan on having another Phenomenon show until next year.”

On Oct. 4-5, the CW premiered the newest seasons of two of their most popular shows, season three of “The Flash” and season five of “Arrow.” “The Flash” follows the adventures of Barry Allen, played by Grant Gustin, as he uses his gift of super speed to protect his city from super villains. “Arrow” revolves around former billionaire Oliver Queen, played by Stephen Amell, who becomes a vigilante and uses his archery skills to save his city.
The two shows were both created by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, Andrew Kreisberg, Phil Klemmer, and Geoff Johns. Inspired by DC Comics, the two shows have been praised for the blend of action and story in a superhero show, as well as the excellent blend of drama and humor. While not remaining completely faithful to the comics, the two series have engrossed both comic book and non-comic book fans alike.
In the season two finale of “The Flash,” Barry used his speed to go back in time and stop his mother from being murdered when he was a child. The new season picks up three months later, in an alternate timeline where his life has completely changed. Both of his parents are alive, he was never adopted by Joe West, who is portrayed by Jesse L. Martin, and he never became friends with Iris West, played by Candice Patton. At first, Barry believes that his life in this timeline is better than the one he originally led.
However, a new villain called the Rival has arrived in Central City and it’s up to the Flash to stop him. In this timeline, though, Wally West is the Flash instead of Barry. Once Wally fails to defeat the Rival, Barry reveals himself, and the two team up. After Wally is fatally injured during the battle, Barry realizes that he can no longer stay in his new timeline and decides to make things right.
Once again going back in time to the night of his mother’s death, Barry allows his mother to be killed, believing this would put the timeline back to its original state. However, it’s not long after he comes home he discovers that messing with the timeline has major consequences on his life.
“Arrow” picks up five months after the conclusion of season four. Team Arrow is smaller than it once was, containing only Oliver, Felicity Smoak, and occasional help from Curtis Holt. Felicity and Curtis are portrayed by Emily Bett Rickards and Echo Kellum. Oliver has, once again, prioritized his vigilante work over everything else, including his job as mayor of Star City. Due to this, Felicity suggests that Oliver assemble a new Team Arrow comprised of other vigilantes who have emerged around Star City, inspired by Green Arrow and his team.
However, Oliver refuses, vowing that his old team would return when they are needed. In the meantime, a new criminal has come to town in the form of Tobias Church. Church, played by Chad Coleman, has come to Star City to unite all of the criminal organizations under his command. His first step in taking over involves displacing the Green Arrow. Church plans to draw out the vigilante by taking all of the politicians, including Oliver, hostage. Oliver escapes thanks to his sister’s help, and returns to free the other hostages with a police team as back up.
“The Flash” and “The Arrow” are just two of the four DC Comic Books shows on the CW network. The other two, “Supergirl” and “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow” will premiere on Oct. 10 and Oct. 13, respectively.

“Erik, I’ve started drinking a lot of coffee.” “That’s great Harry however are you drinking it the right way? The Swedish way?”
Now, this conversation took place a year or two ago between myself and housemate Erik Berthagan, a senior economics major. Although I said “of course” to Mr. Thor, (as he is also known among friends), I didn’t really understand the concept of drinking coffee properly, or the ‘Swedish way’ as Erik would put it, until I visited Sweden this summer.
“Fika” as they like to call it over there isn’t just the ‘chugging’ of liquid to keep you awake and make you energized: it’s much more than that. It’s a very simple drink, but with complicated properties: the properties of conversation, the atmosphere whilst drinking it, the social aspect of conversing with another person, which in this day and age seems so difficult to do.
Yes, it does give you that boost after a 7 a.m. practice, or the spike after a night out on a Wednesday and you are stumbling like a zombie to that English Lit class at 9:30 a.m.. But if this magical substance is drank at a chic coffee shop in Manhattan, where even the packaging is like a super hip hipster, and as soon as you hold it with that heroic grip and place it around your lips, you are immediately transformed into a Chris Hemsworth lookalike (much like our friend Erik).
Maybe the above description was a little farfetched, but to put it in simpler terms…maybe drinking coffee to just drink coffee and get a buzz isn’t the ‘right’ way to drink it. Perhaps having a coffee with a friend or even better, friend(s), is much grander of an occasion.
On the soccer team, we have a thing called coffee club, where a few of us lads on away trips will go get coffee together. We sit, we exchange ideas, we talk about how our semester is going, we exchange our opinions on current affairs and politics, I usually bore them with spiel on Philosophy, and of course, we talk about soccer.
Something as simple as a cup of coffee with a few comrades can highlight a day, truly. Please you must try it. This notion that Erik spoke to me about is a fantastic concept, and sitting out in the beautiful summer sun in Gothenberg with a ‘kaffe’ in hand, ray bans on and talking with my best friends about anything, is asolute bliss.
What I am trying to convey to my fellow students is creating an excuse to go and socialize, to have social gatherings with other people, to explore different ideas, as well as having a caffeine-high. I really feel that we are extremely social beings, we want to be around company (most of the time), and having one of the vast options of coffee is one way in which we can begin to mingle with one another.
If you are that person who doesn’t drink coffee, which I used to be, the same still applies. You can have tea or a hot chocolate, but being there, being PRESENT with your friends to discuss things and understand different ideals, getting to know one another, is the true concept of fika.
It is common in other cultures—the “Middle Easterns” who use the drinking of coffee as a social event to catch up on gossip, or the Italians who have three or four variations of coffee for a particular part of the day. But in the United States, we seem to just drink it on the go, while we are getting from A to B, and it seems to be such a waste.
So, are you drinking it the right way? If not, grab a companion and get to a coffee shop; talk, smile and engage.

Exercise or rest? Study or party? Fast food or home-cooked? You are faced with the same dilemma several times a day. Do something that feels good for now or do something that you will profit from in the future. Invest or spend. Saw or harvest.
If you were a homo economicus, the super rational person in economic theory who is assumed to take all choices, you would just calculate the net present value of the two choices and choose the greater.
But there are a couple of problems with this approach. Apart from the challenge of making good predictions about future payoffs, which is always a problem in investment strategy, you have the question about which variables you should take into account and how you should value them.
How much is having fun and social life worth compared to higher grades? How much is health worth compared to a better economical situation? The well-being of a human is multidimensional and not just her economic situation, like in a company.
Viewing every decision alone will open up for supopitimizing. One decision might make one area of your life better, but will cannibalize on another. In order to maximize physical performance, it might be rational to exercise three hours a day. In order to maximize GPA, it might be best to study into late night. But in order to stay motivated and healthy over time, it might not be the best thing to do. Without a holistic view, making all the right choices might not be the right choice at all.
Lastly, and maybe the most important part of the problem, is that humans don’t make active decisions at every situation faced. It is time and energy consuming for the brain to go through the process. For example, when we buy something, we usually buy the brand we bought the last time. We develop a habit.
So maybe there is a pattern to our choices. And that is why the famous marshmallow test conducted at Stanford is so extremely interesting. In the test, young children had to choose between one marshmallow right now, or wait and get two. The researchers found that the kids who could resist the present temptation would become more “successful” in life, becoming richer, healthier and receive higher grades. If one were to believe this study, the ability to postpone your reward explains why some people achieve more than others.
Through early human history, the brain reward and pleasure system is a quality evolution that made us develop to survive, such as when gathering food. In the later part of history, the long term planning ability has probably been extremely useful in developing wealth and societies.
While it is not hard to understand why people with total lack of impulse control and people who easily get addicted can experience hard times planning the future, it is intriguing to consider what the optimal habit is.
Is the function of level of success and ability to postpone pleasure linear or not? Is it always better to postpone your reward or is there a sweet spot, where the occasional easy reward will make you perform better?
Even if there wouldn’t be a sweet spot and it always pays off to invest, the problem is not quite solved. Since the relationship between economical wealth and happiness is suggested to be non-linear, you really first have to make sure what success really means to you, before you can decide when to harvest.

On the heels of its 4-0 shutout victory over Wilmington University, men’s soccer jumped to fourth spot on the national div. II ranking. The team took its new-found confidence into its Saturday, Oct. 8, matchup against Mercy College where they used a three-goal second half to force a draw.
The Mavericks were by no means the aggressors even though they established a three-goal lead, converting three of five shots in the first half. The Pioneers snapped out of their funk in the latter 45 minutes, though, when a red card was issued to the Mavericks and senior midfielder, Alex Billington, buried a penalty kick to put the Pioneers on the board.
Less than a minute after Billington’s goal, sophomore midfielder, Charlie Ledula, picked his spot and netted the second Pioneer goal of the day, courtesy of a pass from senior forward, Jason Lampkin.
Speaking of great passes, junior midfielder, Harry Pearse, beautifully executed a corner kick where redshirt junior midfielder, Erik Berthagen was able to head the game-tying goal.
For the remainder of the game, the Pioneers exploited their advantages and got shot opportunities, but were unable to cash in, including the overtime sessions.
The 3-3 draw still keeps the Pioneers’ loss column a big ol’ donut, but the team’s winning percentage dropped from a perfect 100 to 95. Post currently sits at 9-0-1 and is the top-ranked team in the region. Head coach Andreas Lindberg and his squad return to the pitch on Friday, Oct. 14, when they visit Roberts Wesleyan College. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m.

After piling up win after win, the no. 1-ranked Pioneers were finally dealt a blow, losing their first match of the season to NE-10 rival Adelphi University, 2-1, on Wednesday, Oct. 5.
The Pioneers fell behind early, but never got rattled. As time began to become a risky factor, the intensity turned up and the Pioneers broke through late in the second half to tie the game at one. It was sophomore forward/midfielder, Emily Miller who tallied with just over six minutes in regulation.
However, missed opportunities would come back to haunt the Pioneers, who did not execute on multiple scoring chances. After Miller’s heroics, she had two scoring chances denied; one off the post and the other by junior Adelphi keeper, Amanda Gargiulo. Overtime became necessary to decide a winner.
In the extra session, the Pioneers were awarded a penalty stroke, but freshman midfielder, Arantxa Rosainz Caloca’s shot was blocked. The stop by Gargiulo set the stage for the Adelphi victory less than two minutes later, when senior forward, Lena Pollich, wound up and fired a shot past senior goalie, Ericka Parks.
The 2-1 overtime loss was the first of the season for the Pioneers who, as a team, have still yet to allow more than two goals in a game.
Head Coach Raenee Savin and the team looked to get back on track on Friday, Oct. 7, against Southern New Hampshire University in front of the pioneers faithful. Similarly to their Wednesday match, the Pioneers suffered a 2-1 defeat.
The game seemed destined to go into overtime, tied at one, before Penmen back, Alison Hildreth, scored a game-winning goal in the 70th minute. The literal last-second goal knocked the Pioneers off and sent Southern New Hampshire home happy.
The hosts seemingly dominated every facet of the game, out-shooting the Penmen 24-6 and controlling possession of the ball. However, the Penmen made their shots count and got great play in the net. The lone LIU goal came courtesy of Miller, who scored her team-leading 10th goal of the year.
After starting the season 8-0 and climbing to the no. 1 ranking in the nation, the Pioneers have dropped two straight, including one at home.
Next match is scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 15, at Saint Michael’s College. Kick-off at 11 a.m.

Alan Hahn, studio analyst for the MSG Network and host of the Hahn and Humpty Show with Rick DiPietro, which airs weekdays from 12 – 3 p.m. on ESPN New York and 98.7 FM, will be speaking on Monday, Oct. 17, at the Pratt Recreation Center gymnasium at 7 p.m.
Hahn, a Post journalism graduate, will be discussing his experiences from his days as a Division II athlete and sports editor of The Pioneer to his career in sports media. “My plan is to tell a few stories, have some fun and provide some examples of pursuing a career,” Hahn said.
Before he began working at Newsday in 1995, Hahn recalled feeling overwhelmed about about life after college. “I remember how challenging it was to be able to play DII basketball [at LIU Post] and stay ahead of the game when it comes to setting myself up for my career.” He also had an uphill battle ahead of him recovering from a major knee surgery. “I’m sure there are a lot of student-athletes dealing with this and hopefully I can give them some ideas, strategies and inspiration,” said Hahn.
At Newsday, Hahn covered high school athletics before being promoted to cover the New York Islanders until 2006. He later covered the New York Knicks. He most notably was the first beat writer to report that LeBron James would sign with the Miami Heat. Following the NBA lockout in 2011, Hahn moved to the MSG Network and now hosts down the pre and post-game show with fellow Long Islander, Wally Szczerbiak.
Hahn hopes to provide knowledge to students who want to follow in his footsteps. “It’s always good to hear from someone who walked the same road you are walking,” said Hahn.
The lecture is free of charge and open to the public.

After a 10-day break between matches, women’s soccer was back at it again on Wednesday, Oct. 5, beating the Rams from Philadelphia University, 1-0, in the City of Brotherly Love.
The lone goal on the afternoon came via sophomore forward, Andrea Huntzinger, who sent a shot over the keeper’s head and into the net in the 67th minute. The goal was Huntzinger’s third of the season, good enough for a share of the team-high with fellow sophomore forward, Isabella Fuduli.
The Pioneer defense was stellar, not allowing a single shot on goal in the win. The team has now pushed its winning streak to four, and has won in shutout fashion in three of those four games.
The Pioneers returned to the field on Saturday, Oct. 8, for an East Coast Conference duel in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. against Mercy College.
It was an instant classic in favor of the Pioneers with the girls in green coming out on top, 2-1, thanks to a last-minute goal by junior midfielder, Klara Berggren.
The Pioneers kept a clean sheet in the first half, backed by the stonewall of a goalie, sophomore Hillevi Eklow. As for the offense, the Pioneers grabbed the 1-0 lead on a mark by freshman midfielder/forward, Gabrielle Clark.
After the Mavericks took advantage of some Pioneer miscues, which led to a goal to tie the game, overtime seemed like a logical conclusion to settle the match. Berggren had other plans, though, netting the game winning goal and giving her team the win. The victory gives the team five in a row, and pushes its record on the season to 7-2-1.
Head Coach Mark Dawson and his team hit the field next on Friday, Oct. 14, when they visit Roberts Wesleyan College. Start time is slated for 5 p.m. from Rochester, N.Y.

Coming off a 3-0 victory against Mercy College in the home opener, the Pioneers had similar results against Queens and Stonehill College, beating both of them on Friday, Oct. 7, in Stonehill’s backyard.
In its first match against the Knights from Queens College, the volleyball team dismantled its opponents in five sets. The Green and Gold were led by a team-high 17 kills by sophomore outside hitter, Rachel Londot, who also totaled 14 digs to help out as well. Junior outside hitter, Danielle Valenza, also played well, amassing 10 kills and eight digs.
The Pioneers edged the Knights in five sets thanks to some key blocks by sophomore middle hitter, Elise Strange, who had seven blocks—good enough for a share of the team-high with freshman middle hitter, Lea Brady.
In the second match, the Pioneers made quick work of Stonehill, but not without challenge. Each set was won by five points or less. Again, Londot and Valenza played huge, leading the team in kills with 10 each.
The Pioneers got a strong contribution from Giulia Genna as well. The sophomore setter had two aces to go along with 26 assists and 10 digs, all of which led the team in the match.
The victory improves the Pioneer record to 5-10 on the season and 2-4 in the East Coast Conference.
The Pioneers, led by Amanda Ostapow, are back in action Friday, Oct. 14, when they welcome Saint Anselm College to the Pratt Recreation Center. First-serve is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Shane Hubbard had big aspirations after graduating from John Adams High School, located in Queens, N.Y., in 2011.
During his time at John Adams, he played basketball and ran track. After being asked by his coach Joe Emma to try out for the football team his junior year, basketball and track became a blur. Hubbard played two seasons of varsity football and was the city’s leading receiver in 2011, with 74 catches and 1,500 all purpose yards. He was ranked among NYC’s top 100 players on nycfootball.com—a site based on NYC high school football players and recruiting news.
Hubbard, a highly recruited wide receiver, came to Post in fall 2012 in an attempt to pursue his high school dream of becoming a professional football player. In 2013, Hubbard made his debut at Post, and played in 10 games. He had 13 catches for 150 yards, and a touchdown. In 2014, Hubbard opened the season with a 10-catch, 142-yard performance and also scored a touchdown against East Stroudsburg. That season, he led the Pioneers with 83 receptions and 1,058 yards, setting the program record for most receptions in a single season.
Hubbard is now a senior criminal justice major. He has plans to become a professional football player, but he knows that the odds are tough. His main focus is making sure he works hard and practices every day to become better. Hubbard’s success comes from his hard work and dedication. “You put in the work, you get the result,” Hubbard said.
With practice four times a week and lift twice a week, it’s important to stay grounded. The practice is paying off. Hubbard is the Pioneers’ leading receiver with almost 500 yards in six games and is also the leader in receptions and tied for the team-lead in touchdowns with four.
According to Angelo Fradelakis, Hubbard’s teammate and freshman tailback, “Hubbard is a great teammate and player, he is a hard-worker and if he keeps it up he can go far.”
“I’ve never been undefeated at any level and it feels good to know that no one can beat us,” said Hubbard
Sharene Hubbard, Shane’s mother, is someone he admires and works hard for each and every day. “I thank God for my amazing support system. My mom tells me all the time how proud she is of me and how far I’ve come,” Hubbard said.
Larry Fitzgerald, a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, is Hubbard’s idol. He admires him both on and off the field. He has influenced his path to becoming a professional football player.
“I can say I’m blessed and hopefully one day all my hard work will pay off,” Hubbard said.
