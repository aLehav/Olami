On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

Get ready for WCWP radio station’s annual scavenger hunt from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26. This year, 44 students will participate on 22 teams. The prize is a $100 Visa gift card for the each of the two members of the winning team.
This year’s scavenger hunt will be different from years prior. The entire event is being run through WCWP’s Snapchat (@mywcwp). Victoria Onorato, WCWP Program Director, is coordinating the scavenger hunt.
“The turnout was a lot bigger than I expected, but I am excited about it,” she said. The teams must take a selfie while wearing their WCWP shirts with a sticker on the back for each member of their team. Wearing the shirt and taking pictures with the stickers are a part of the rules that were set by the station. The pictures will serve as proof of completing a certain objective of the scavenger hunt.
All participants have to attend the rooftop party that WCWP will be hosting on Halloween, Oct. 31 during common hour in order to be eligible to win.

Dining Dollars are allocated to both commuter and resident students at the beginning of every school year. Dining Dollars allow students to purchase food, snacks, and beverages at on-campus locations via a set balance attached to their LIU ID card.
Having currency on your ID card is an efficient way of purchasing food on campus. Because students always have their student ID cards with them for building access and library usage, there is no need to worry about carrying cash or a credit card. It’s quick, easy, and when using dining dollars, there is no added sales tax on items. For campus residents, regardless of their meal plan, $300 worth of dining dollars are provided during both the fall and spring semesters, while commuters receive $50 worth of dining dollars each semester. The dollars are non-refundable and non-transferable and must be used before the end of each semester.
Jodi Darvick, a junior education major living on campus, said she hasn’t had a problem with the amount so far. Darvick, who has been on meal plan three, which provides 14 meals per week at the Winnick Student Center dining hall, since freshman year, said she uses her dining dollars for snacks, coffee, and other foods. “It’s a perfect amount for me, at least,” Darvick said. “If I’m not eating at Winnick, I sometimes spend my dining dollars at Subway or at the Hillwood Cafe, but usually I’m buying a lot of coffee.”
J.P. Formacheli, a sophomore criminal justice major from Levittown, New York, commutes to campus. According to Formacheli, the $50 balance he receives per semester is not enough. “Sure, I understand that students living on campus will receive more, but $50 per semester is too low of a [balance] for commuters,” he said. “Monday to Friday, I spend about $10-12 per day on food, snacks, and the occasional coffee or milkshake from the cafe. $100-$200 is a fair range,” he said.
According to Dean of Students Michael Berthel, in addition to the $50 in dining dollars for commuters, commuter meal plans are also available for students to opt into if they are not residing on campus. “We encourage commuter students to consider purchasing a block meal plan to make their campus life experience easier and more convenient,” Berthel said.
Dining dollars can be spent at every food and beverage venue on campus and at Hillwood Commons, yet cannot be spent in Hutton & Post. Interested in a coffee from Starbucks, a footlong sandwich from Subway or sushi, burgers, and pizza from the Hillwood Commons Cafe? Simply scan your ID card and help yourself to tax-free cuisine.
Students who would like more information regarding the commuter meal can contact the office of Campus Life at post-campuslife@liu.edu. Students are also able to reload their dining dollars onto their “LIU Wallet” via the LIU website or at the kiosk next to Campus Concierge.

Dondre Lemon, a junior journalism major, wanted to make The Pioneer accessible to a broader audience of students. With permission from the editors, Lemon created scripts out of the stories to broadcast on PTV, the campus news station. This project, entitled Pioneer TV, is a television news show creation out of Professor Jean Carlomusto’s applied TV class. “Pioneer TV represents an exciting opportunity for journalism and broadcasting students to work together on producing a newscast version of The Pioneer paper,” Carlomusto said.
The student-run show is designed to run parallel with The Pioneer, transferring print content to video. While student reporters attend school events, they will film parts of the event and interviews with students and faculty. From the print stories and video recordings, they will create segments that viewers could enjoy on campus and on the internet. Pioneer TV will utilize both YouTube and liupostpioneer.com as its online platforms, with the goal of eventually also connecting with WCWP radio station.
Lemon, along with junior broadcasting major Kyhara Jeanty, developed the idea in their applied TV class. The duo will host the show twice a month and plan to run it weekly in the near future. They are excited to see the feedback it gets around campus.
The show gives students real world experience in the classroom. “For journalism students, or any student who enjoys this kind of work, they could get experience in front of the camera, working with equipment, and learning a unique form of reporting,” Lemon said.
All students are welcome to join in the broadcasting project. Lemon is actively recruiting students to work on the news broadcasts. Students who participate on crews will be acknowledged in the on-air credits at the end of the show. If there is news to be reported or a segment to be filmed, students can borrow a camera from the TV studio on the second oor of Humanities Hall.
The first episode of Pioneer TV was posted on YouTube on Wednesday, Oct. 18. Lemon and Jeanty covered the week’s news, including the Pioneers’ 52-35 homecoming victory over Southern Connecticut State University and former President Bill Clinton’s visit to campus.
“It was awesome,” Jeanty said. “Dondre did the editing and it looked very similar to The Pioneer, beginning with news and ending with sports.” To view the first episode, visit the Youtube channel LIUPostTV or LIUPostPioneer.com.

On Tuesday, Oct. 17, former U.S. Representative Steve Israel and Professor Amy Freedman, chairperson of the political science department, spoke about an array of current and thought-provoking issues during “Conversations with a Congressman,” hosted by the Hutton House Lecture Series.
The event, held during common hour in Humanities 119, began with opening remarks from Israel, who quipped he was going to give a “seven minute confession of a Congressman.” Israel remarked that the longer one stays in Congress, the more the “tongue tends to cleave to the left or right side of the mouth.” Freedman jokingly responded, “he got out when the getting was good.” “She’s right, being a former Congressman is liberating,” Israel said.
Israel expanded on his decision to leave Congress; “in the odd year when you spend six weeks at home…you think maybe to not run for reelection.” He opined that “I fundamentally believe there comes a time when you need to pass the torch.” And he described his observation that “my colleagues left in one of two ways, either they lost their election or they lost their minds.”
“I discovered I was a writer,” Israel said. Israel published his first novel, “The Global War on Morris: A Novel,” in December of 2014. “I could not stand the screaming…and finally the money. The funding is so bad.” Israel noted that he does miss the collegiality of Congress. He is now the Chairman of the LIU Global Institute.
“The best advice I got, I tell young people when they make a life decision. You should choose two mentors. One you agree with and one you disagree with,” Israel said. He noted he sought advice about leaving Congress from former Republican Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, a congressman he often disagreed with. “My former colleagues, 90 percent are good, decent people. We just disagree on fundamental issues.”
Freedman asked Israel about balancing competing interests. Israel responded that his experience was that of Congressman in a moderate district, one that is not predominantly Democrat or Republican. “The bad news is however I voted I always pissed off half my district,” Israel joked.
“I have two regrets about votes,” Israel noted. “The first is the vote to authorize the war in Iraq. It was a horrific vote… The second vote that bothers me is a vote on a measure that would restrict the number of refugees that could enter the U.S. I still toss and turn about that bill.”
Israel spoke about redistricting and gerrymandering, gun control, his writing career, his 2014 book “The Global War on Morris: A Novel,” his upcoming book ”Big Guns,” and money in politics. The audience, comprised mostly of senior citizens from the community and a handful of students, were invited to ask questions.
Throughout the Q&A, Israel stressed, “people say this is the darkest time we have ever had…I’ve always said I’m not the smartest member, but I do believe I am the biggest student of history.” He asserted, “folks, this ain’t nothing.”
Israel identified several issues that the U.S. is facing, including our need to have a growing middle class. “We have no mobility; it’s why Hillary lost and Donald won,” he said. “We need to build things,” he said as he remarked on the success the building of the interstate highway system in 1956 had on the U.S. economy. He expressed concern for the news media. “The networks, there is no news, its tribal opinion.” He also cited the need for redistricting reform and the need to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case which allows corporations to donate to political campaigns.
When asked whether he stressed patience or activism for students concerned about the government’s effectiveness, Israel chose activism. “There is too much at stake for patience,” he said. He also expressed concern for the growing student loan debt. “We had a meltdown in 2008, but that is no comparison to the trillions in student loan debt.”
Israel served as a U.S. Congressman from January 2001 to January 2017. During his tenure, he served six years in leadership positions within the Democratic party.

Long Island University has joined in a letter sent to leaders of Congress by hundreds of colleges urging Congress to continue supporting Dreamers, children who were brought into the country by immigrants.
University President Kimberly Cline informed students and faculty about the letter in an email on Oct. 20. “It is in that spirit that Long Island University joins nearly 800 colleges and universities from throughout the nation to urge Congress to take bipartisan legislative action to support Dreamers, young men and women who have known no home but the United States of America,” Cline wrote in the email. “Colleges and universities have seen these remarkable people up close, in our classrooms and as our colleagues and friends. Despite the challenges they face, they have made incredible contributions to our country and its economy and security. They should continue to be able to do so. We are proud that students from around the nation and throughout the world have chosen to pursue their education at LIU.”
The Pioneer has already reported this semester on the impact that the phaseout of DACA has had on college students. In “DACA Phaseout affects Local College Students,” by Jacqueline Escobar, on Sept. 26, the Pioneer reported about local students who are among the 800,000 college students who were protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. President Trump has phased out the program and given Congress a directive to take action.
Amid this ongoing immigration debate, the Steven S. Hornstein Center for policy, polling and analysis, which conducts independent polling, empirical research, and analysis on a wide range of public issues, has planned a panel on immigration policy in America.
The panel, which will be held on Oct. 30 from noon until 2:30 p.m., will feature Duarte Geraldino, a special economics correspondent for PBS NewsHour and TED Resident at the TED Talks media organization; Karina Moreno Saldivar, assistant professor in the school of business, public administration and information sciences at LIU Brooklyn; and Duleep Deosthale, the new dean of LIU Global.
Saldivar will be speak about President Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S. – Mexico border. Saldivar will also speak about a combination of new policies on border security, terrorism, crime and voting.
The panel, which will be moderated by Jon Schneider, LIU’s director of public relations, will also address the Trump administration’s proposed travel ban, and the repeal of DACA. The discussion will cover current immigration policy and where it will be going, including its impact on higher education. After the discussion, the panelists will take questions from the audience.
“I think public policy and public conversations about these issues are crucial to informing the public. Any students who go, I think will learn a lot about these issues and maybe get more interested in it. It’s a major topic in the United States right now and I think it will only benefit them to learn about it,” Andrew Batcheller, assistant director for policy and communications at the Steven S. Hornstein Center, said.
According to the LIU website, “The Steven S. Hornstein Center for Policy, Polling, and Analysis conducts independent polling, empirical research, and analysis on a wide range of public issues. Our studies inform the public and policymakers about critical issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.”
The immigration panel, which will be held in the Tilles Center Patrons Lounge, is free and open to all faculty and students. Light refreshments will be served. For more information, contact Batcheller at 516-299-3802 or Andrew.Batcheller@liu.edu

Zeta Phi Beta sorority, a historically black Greek organization founded at Howard University in 1920, began the process of reactivating on LIU Post campus, hoping to become an active chapter this year. The sorority, which was on campus for 35 years, but closed its Post chapter in 2015 due to lack of membership, would be the only current multicultural Greek organization on campus, if revived. Zeta Phi Beta originally colonized at Post in 1980, and hosted Valentine’s Day fundraisers and sisterhood events, while also participating in recruitment to expand its membership.
Joseph Vernace, associate director of campus life, says that the interest to reopen the club was sparked by new students becoming aware of the club’s past presence on campus. “There are now a number of students that wish to reactivate the chapter,” Vernace said.
Bria Taylor, a junior broadcasting major, was the ifrst student to express her interest in bringing back the chapter to Post. “When I first transferred here, Zeta Phi Beta was on campus,” Taylor said. “I wanted to bring back the Zeta Phi Beta chapter because Greek life on campus is lacking for African American students.”
Taylor goes on to say that despite being a historically black sorority, Zeta Phi Beta prides itself on being multicultural. “Everyone is accepted, as long as you meet the other requirements for membership,” she said.
There are currently over 800 active chapters of Zeta Phi Beta around the world, spreading the sorority’s central principles of “scholarship, service, sisterhood, and finer womanhood.” In order to reactivate on campus, anywhere from five to 10 students must show interest in joining.
There is no information on the current status of this revival process, nor any information on how that process works.
If interested in Zeta Phi Beta or reopening another fraternity or sorority in the cultural Greek community, visit the Multicultural Greek Interest Form at www.tinyurl.com/PostGreek.

The speed bumps on Post Lane were repaved over the summer. Although it is not clear whether the speed bumps are the same height as the previous year, they are now unmarked and unexpected. The unmarked and unexpected bumps have caused student drivers to take flight. The bumps are now blended in with the asphalt, with no clear markers or labels to warn drivers to slow down. Some drivers on campus have also claimed that the bumps are lower than they were last year.
The roads on Post Lane have a speed limit of 25 mph to ensure the safety of both cars and pedestrians. While the speed bumps are labeled with signs on the street, the signs are now further from the actual bumps, causing drivers to pause early in anticipation of the bump, rather than being warned just before. A spokesperson for the facilities department stated that this is in compliance with regulations. “The speed bump sign is required to be placed a minimum of 75 feet and a maximum of 90 feet [from the speed bump],” Roy Fergus, head of facilities services, said.
The roads were “repaved during the summer recess period,” and “the bumps have not been moved from their locations,” Fergus said.
Kyhara Jeanty, a junior broadcasting major who commutes to school, has experienced these speed bumps first hand. “My dad and I notice they do come out of nowhere,” she said. “Last year it felt like they were a lot more visible.” Jeanty has noticed how smooth the ride is since the repavement of the street over the summer, but says, “the bumps are kind of hard to see.”
While students have claimed that the east side of campus now poses a problem for commuters, the west side is still clearly labeled. The signs used to alert drivers on the west side of campus come just before each bump, giving drivers a reasonable response time to slow down and not go flying over a speed bump.
To prevent damage to vehicles, drivers are advised to slow down and maintain a safe speed. Fergus has not responded to Pioneer inquiries about marking the bumps in a notice warning color.

On Oct. 31 there will be a one-day pop-up art show hosted by recent MFA graduate Susan Kelly and current MFA graduate student Laura Sweeney. The Halloween-themed event will last from noon to 2 p.m. It will be held outside the fine arts building in the brick wall garden.
Together, Sweeney and Kelly have hosted private art events in the past, but this time they wanted to host an event that could be open to all students.
Anyone can submit work, including staff and students. All works are encouraged from all Post creatives. Artwork, short stories, performances, and stage makeup or costume designs are welcome. Submissions can be sent to susan.kelly@my.liu.edu or laura.sweeney2@my.liu.edu
“It’s a great way for students on campus to get their art work shown and also a nice way to celebrate Halloween,” Nicholas Seiban, senior psychology major, said.
“Hallozine,” a student-produced Halloween magazine, will feature all the submitted work from the show and will be available for free at the event.
“Our campus is full of such wonderful talent, if you are free I think it would be a great idea to stop by to peruse the works and broaden your horizons,” Elizabeth Barcia, senior psychology major, said, “I think the most wonderful thing about art is that it makes you think, and see something in a new light.”
Lunch and Halloween candy will be available at the event. A costume contest will be held with a $25 Blick Art Supply gift card for the first place winner.

Supplies needed:
Procoloring “Bruise” $18.32 (Amazon)
Mehron Synwax $10.56 for 1.5 oz (Amazon) Mehron coagulated blood gel $14.99 for 1o oz (Amazon) Plastic knife
Rubbing alcohol
Tweezers
Makeup brush
Cotton balls
First, ensure your face is clean, dry and free of lotions or oils. Take the entire jar of Synwax and place it in a bowl of warm water for about 10 minutes so the wax can soften. Apply a generous amount of Synwax to your face. Use the tweezers to remove any excess. Allow the wax to dry for about 20 minutes.
Next, pull apart some cotton balls and place them randomly on your face; make sure they’re thin. They will absorb the blood and add more depth.
As the wax dries, use a makeup brush to apply the bruise coloring. Experiment with color combinations until you achieve your desired look.
Once the wax is dried, lightly apply blood gel with the brush included, and don’t worry about putting on too much blood. While this isn’t the cheapest Halloween makeup, it’s very versatile, you can get very creative with this look and it is extremely easy.

“Turtles All the Way Down” is a newly-released fiction novel geared towards young adult audiences. The novel was written by John Green, author of the widely-known book “The Fault in Our Stars.” 
In his first novel since 2012, Green illustrates another seemingly cliché teen storyline. Aza Holmes, the narrator and protagonist, is a high school student dealing with typical teen issues.
As the novel opens, she navigates the world of high school, friends and grades. Yet Aza’s struggles are not solely based on her mundane teenage life. She also deals with severe anxiety and OCD, something Green repeatedly mentions throughout the novel. Aza’s obsessive compulsive behaviors take up a majority of her time, sometimes estranging her from her peers. Despite how it begins, it becomes clear early-on that “Turtles All the Way Down” is not an average coming-of-age story. Instead, Aza and her best friend Daisy embark on a journey similar to that of a traditional mystery novel: the two try to discover the whereabouts of Russell Pickett, a billionaire on the run.
Although the two originally go into this adventure for the $100,000 prize, their efforts lead Aza on an even more profound journey, one that changes her irrevocably. Through her search for Russell Pickett, Aza forms a bond with his son, Davis, and grows from her time with him, a new take on a timeless teen romance.
“Turtles all the Way Down” is a witty, well-informed, touching novel that readers of all ages can enjoy.
ÍIt is currently available at bookstores and can be ordered online at  www.johngreenbooks. com.

Looking for a magical evening this Halloween? The RISE of the Jack O’Lanterns is a popular Halloween festivity with thousands of hand carved pumpkins at Old Westbury Gardens.
The “Garden of Gourds” on Long Island has themed carved pumpkins on display for the community to enjoy. This will be the sixth year Old Westbury Gardens is running the attraction. The garden is set up with over 5,000 pumpkins hand carved along a walkway. The walkway is roped off and pumpkins are off limits to attendees and not for sale. Yet there are areas designated for a fellow pumpkin lovers to take pictures next to these spooktacular masterpieces.
On site, there are several local artists who hand carve the pumpkins. Locals can apply to carve pumpkins on the event’s Facebook page, ‘RISE of the Jack O’Lanterns.’ Sarah Tsang, freshman forensic science major, has visited RISE of the Jack O’Lanterns three years in a row and noticed a difference in the presentation. “Every year I went, I saw that there weren’t as many pumpkins as the year before,” Tsang said.
Olivia Kavanaugh, junior art education major, visited RISE with her boyfriend Tyler McGarvey in mid-October. “My favorite part was at first the Star Wars and Game of Thrones, but this year they had a whole section for the Nightmare Before Christmas which has been my favorite movie since I was a kid,” Kavanaugh said.
If you are interesting in exploring the world of carved pumpkins, go to therise.org to get a ticket in advance. The garden will feature RISE of the Jack O’Lanterns until Oct. 29.
RISE of the Jack O’Lanterns also has a NYC location that displays 1,000 illuminated pumpkins now until Oct. 29.

“Happy Death Day” is a horror movie that focuses on protagonist Tree Gelbman and her experience of reliving the day of her death repeatedly. She must relive the same day until she uncovers the identity of her murderer. However, regardless if she changes her location each day, the culprit finds and kills her. 
The movie is similar to “Groundhog Day,” with the motif of repeating the same day; viewers get that idea after seeing the trailer. The difference between “Groundhog Day” and “Happy Death Day” is that “Groundhog Day” portrays the main character re-living the day to get it right, and “Happy Death Day” depicts the main character solving her own murder.
“Happy Death Day” shadows “Groundhog Day” with their protagonists having a stuck-up attitude and experiencing character development throughout the film. The beginning had a few predictable ‘jump scares’, but the film also had a variety of enjoyable elements. The movie has hints of comedy, action, and an emotional twist with the character Tree. It’s suspenseful and has audience members pondering, “who is the killer?”
Junior broadcasting major Andrew Servedio saw the premiere of the movie on Friday, Oct. 13. “It’s interesting to see how the story played out every time she woke up. It kept you on the edge of your seat to figure out who the killer was,” Servedio said.
Alumna Nicole Bjarnason (’17), also saw the movie during its opening week and loved it. “It was a perfect, light-hearted mixture of comedy and horror and even managed to end with a positive message,” she said.
“Happy Death Day” is playing at Broadway Multiplex Cinemas, AMC Roosevelt Field and other nearby theaters. This movie is great for getting into the Halloween spirit.

Akeem Victor (’16), a broadcasting alumnus, began working as a page at CBS on June 25, 2017. The CBS Page program is an 18 month competitive program that provides an introductory broadcast employment position. After the program, you may apply to any position at CBS, and you have a greater chance of receiving the job because you have worked in the CBS page program.
“On my first day, I had a new hire meeting, received my ID badge, and went straight to work at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Victor said. “Kevin Hart was one of the guest stars that night – watching the show come together was a mind-blowing experience.”
As a broadcasting major at Post, Victor studied film, tv shows, and radio. Victor did not jump right into the CBS page program. After graduation, he did sound engineer freelance work. He went to various locations in NYC to record, edit, and master podcasts for clients. He also spent his free time shooting and editing videos and writing short movies and comedy sketches.
“At the end of August, I began to do freelance work for a company called MicroFame Media. Although I was working, I was not doing what I wanted to do. I mainly wanted to start in the TV field,” Victor said. “With MicroFame Media, I was an audio engineer working on podcast[s]. After a couple of months, I realized I was only working there for the money, but I never had any interest in podcasts.”
He left MicroFame Media for the page program at CBS. He was a part of “If you get a job in your field, take it,” he advises students. “Even if it’s a position you don’t want, what’s important is the exposure you receive from being in your field. Once you get your foot in the door, network as much as possible. Get to know and make conversation with everyone you see at your job,” he said.
“If you don’t get a job right away in your field, that’s perfectly fine too, it takes some time. During that time of waiting, you may feel like you chose the wrong major and you’ll begin to doubt yourself. Remain proactive and positive, and you will find something.”

She’s a LIU Post alumna, professor, filmmaker, writer, director, and scholar of film. Her name? Jean Carlomusto, professor of broadcasting in the department of communications & film. Carlomusto is now the writer and director of “MT Sojourn,” a horror film that is expected to be out for Halloween 2019.
“MT Sojourn” is about a series of unsolved and mysterious murders in a monastery. Carlomusto puts her words into action by not only teaching students broadcasting, but by actively working in the trenches, showing her students how to be successful. “I grew up with classic horror films from the 20th century,” she said. “As a filmmaker, I always wanted to make one. So, I sat down and wrote the script.”
Halloween was not a factor in Carlomusto’s decision to create a horror film. Instead, she was inspired by the underlying issues like racism in society; she used the horror genre as her platform to inform audiences in a suspenseful, thrilling, action-filled film. “Often times you can use horror to talk about more complex issues that are hard to get at in drama or in a documentary. Case in point is the terrific recent horror film, ‘Get Out,’” Carlomusto said.
Directed and written by Jordan Peele, “Get Out” is about an interracial couple that visits the girlfriend’s parents, and while at her parent’s home the boyfriend discovers older white people manipulating young black adults. The socially conscious film made an estimated $30.5 million in its opening weekend, and was number one in ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada.
Even though Carlomusto wears many hats, her first priority is her students. The professor not only ensures that her students can edit, create a script, or tape a production, but she takes it upon herself to ensure that their outlook on the broadcasting industry is realistic. “First I tell them that this field requires commitment and time. It’s not a 9 to 5 banking job. You’ve got to love what you do and devote your time to it,” Carlomusto said.
The professor has had a positive impact on current students and graduates. “Professor Carlomusto is a game changer because she encourages students to find out what they are passionate about within production, and work on honing their skills. She has played a huge role in shaping how I approach production from a technical and creative standpoint,” Brittany Mitchell, a 2016 broadcasting graduate who is now a project manager for Splash Worldwide, said.
Carlomusto has “always loved films” and has been a student of film for years, first as a little girl watching horror films, then “making films as a young teenager,” to being an undergraduate film student at Post, to studying for her master’s degree at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. She is constantly learning, challenging herself, and testing her limits beyond the classroom.
When producing a film, the feeling that comes to Carlomusto’s mind is “excitement and determination,” she said. Carlomusto not only takes chances, but also creates opportunities for herself by expressing her love for the art of film through writing and directing.
“MT Sojourn” is in pre-production and will be available on streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon in approximately two years. As the film gets closer to production, Carlomusto said that she will “be looking to get students involved.”

When it comes to asking for help, many of us hesitate. We think being able to achieve something alone gives us validation. We think needing or asking for help makes us look weak. No matter what your problem is, it can never hurt to reach out to someone.
We tend to assume that when we ask people for help, they will judge us for not being able to handle something on our own. Yes, there are people out there who might judge us for asking for a hand, but often that is only because those people are too afraid to ask for help themselves. Asking for help is nothing to be ashamed of. Don’t let the opinions of others prevent you from getting the help you need. It might shock you that people you go to for help enjoy giving advice and want you to succeed.
LIU Post has many outlets for us to ask for help. Students have success coaches, advisors, professors, and especially classmates. Seek them out for help. Many of them will even be honored that you asked. Surround yourself with good people and asking for help will become something you are no longer afraid to do.
Looking for help from other students in your major can also be extremely useful. As for these two broadcasting majors, Matt Weinstein Sophomore and Luis Viloria sophomore being in the same major helps them when they can work together on assignments and projects. Working together helps them get a better understanding for what they need to do.
Think about these suggestions. Would you rather suffer in silence than ask for help? Find someone you trust, or who seems knowledgeable and compassionate, and ask him or her for help. The outcome will likely surprise you.

Senior broadcasting major Taylor Hill is the proud owner of Lilo! Lilo, almost two years-old, is a sugar glider. A sugar glider, which is in the koala family, has a body similar to a flying squirrel according to     sugarfliderinfo.org.
The Hill family purchased Lilo at “Parrots of the World” pet shop in Rockville Centre over a year ago. Choosing the name of Lilo was easy for the Hill family. “We already have a dog named Stitch, so we were just missing Lilo,” Hill said, referring to the iconic Disney cartoon.
Sugar gliders are nocturnal, making Hill’s pet different from a dog or cat. Lilo is active at night rolling in a coconut and climbing his cage. Lilo stays in a cage and is determined. “He likes to take his toys and put them in his cage or at least try to; it’s great to watch,” Hill said. Hill’s favorite feature about Lilo is his eyes. “They’re so dark and huge for his body,” she said.
Hill is unsure if Lilo is able to learn tricks, but she wants to teach him when she is home. She refers to her relationship with Lilo as being one-sided. She likes to play with Lilo, but he is independent and likes to nibble and roll in a coconut. “It’s not hard being away from him because he’s always going to be the same size and trying to get the next toy in his coconut or bouncing around the cage,” Hill said.

The women’s volleyball team has been on a hot streak, winning 12 games straight since the season began on Sept. 1. The team’s record was 21-3 before falling to their ECC rival Molloy College on September 19.
The team has five freshmen, who have worked well with the veterans on the team. Now at 21-4, they look to bounce back against NYIT, another ECC rival, on Wednesday, Oct. 25.
The team has used its recent loss to Molloy College to build confidence moving forward. “Statistically speaking, we should have won that game,” said team captain Danielle Valenza. “A loss at this point lights a fire under you, it fuels the fire for the next time we play them.”
Rachel Londot, a junior has been standing out, according to Amanda Ostapow, the head coach. “She’s definitely doing her job holding down the outside,” Ostapow said. “It’s hard to pick one person that’s standing out; our setters are doing a great job; Kristin Bendy, everyone is doing what we need them to do,” she added.
A key to the team’s success has been the serving. “We are currently number one in the country with aces per game,” Ostapow said. The team has had 227 aces this season. The weak point in the match against Molloy College was that they missed 12 serves.
“We are going to beat them when it counts; it was a great game,” Ostapow said about the match against Molloy. “There were just a few little things that add up that caused us to lose that game. There’s nothing to say; we can’t win another 13 games against the same teams we played,” Ostapow said.

Last weekend’s football game was one to remember. The football team won against American International College, 70-21, at Abdow Field in Pleasantville, New York. Outstanding performances by the entire team led the Pioneers to victory.
Running back Malik Pierre rushed for 139 yards in total. One of those rushes was a 49 yard run which led the Pioneers to complete their third touchdown of the game. The Pioneers outran AIC, rushing for 424 yards in 42 attempts. “It was probably the first complete game we’ve played all year,” Pierre said. “The offensive line did an outstanding job of creating seams in the defense.”
Quarterback, Yianni Gavalas completed 14 passes with four touchdowns over a span of 184 yards in total. The game marked the team’s second straight win against the Yellow Jackets. In total, the Pioneers advanced the football a total of 605 yards against American International College. “The defense played great, the        offensive line made it a lot easier for the offense to be successful and our special teams were sound. This game gives us a lot of confidence moving forward, and we look to keep our win streak going,” Gavalas said.
The football team, with a season record of 5-2, plays its next game on Saturday, Oct. 28 at Pace University in Pleasantville, N.Y. at 12 p.m. Go Pioneers!
