C.W. Post students were able to express their Post pride with a Pep Rally on Friday, October 21st, at 7 p.m. in the gym of the Pratt Recreation Center. Sponsored by The Association for Campus Planning (ACP), the Pep Rally had a number of events for students to enjoy.
The night included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of the talent show giving an encore of their winning performances. Homecoming banners were proudly displayed, clubs were acknowledged, and the Student Dance Association and Pioneerettes dazzled the crowd with their own performances. And, last but not least, students showed their Post pride to the football team before the big homecoming game. What’s not to love about pep rally?
In addition to the performances, there were also free food and drinks offered to the crowd, along with some green and gold pompoms and foam fingers to cheer with. And, ACP didn’t stop there. It also threw free C.W. Post t-shirts into the crowd and had a D.J. blasting music throughout the event to keep the students pumped up.
Sally-Ann Gaughan, a junior early childhood education major, was surprised by this year’s pep rally. “It was better than I thought it would be. It had more school spirit. It was just awesome.”
Anna Smith, a freshman with an undeclared major, also enjoyed pep rally, saying, “I liked it and thought it was really good. The music was also really good, too.”
This year’s Pep Rally did just what it set out to do: get students pumped up for the big Homecoming game, and allow them to let loose and have some fun.

On Wednesday, October 19th, the Association for Campus Programming (ACP) hosted the Homecoming Talent Show in the Tilles Center Atrium. It was a fun-filled evening, where eight different student acts competed for a winning spot. An open audition was held for all Post students the week earlier, and a different judging panel was in attendance to choose which acts would move on. After all the performances, the judging panel, made up of Jared Ciborowski, the current SGA President, Deirdre Moore, the head coach of the C.W. Post Women’s Basketball Team, and Jennifer Fuoco, the associate director of residence life, decided on first, second, and third place winners. The first place winner received a $150 gift card, the second place winner a $75 gift card, and the third a $50 gift card. However, what everyone was really competing for was a spot to perform at the Pep Rally that Friday. The Atrium was packed with many different people, ranging from Post students to on-campus officials and even a few proud parents anxiously awaiting their children’s performances.
After a brief introduction by hosts Eric Zirlinger, the senior assistant director of the Office of Student Life and Leadership Development, and Sarah Taylor, a Post student, the performances were off and running, all concluding with a wonderful performance by X-Factor, the C.W. Post step team. Although all of the performances were great, the judges picked Nicole Ferdinand for her amazing freestyle rap as the first place winner, Dae Michelle as the second place winner for her rendition of Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield, and Jacqueline Favaloro and Dontae Hawkins, who used his stage name iNTeLL for their performance, as the third place winners for their spectacular performance of Coming Home that they remixed themselves.
After the show, judge Jared Ciborowski said, “I thought the show was a great success. There were many different talents this year, and each of them was original. I enjoyed judging and hope to do it again in the future.” Sophomore education major Laura Fitzgibbons said that she “loved the X-Factor routine; they were amazing.” Freshman clinical psychology major Gabrielle Maldoando said, “Overall, it was a good experience, and I’m glad I went. I would definitely go again.” Freshman forensic science major Kaity Lopez also enjoyed the show, raving,  “Overall, the show was great.”
Third place winners Jacqueline Favaloro, a senior journalism major, and Dontae Hawkins, a junior film major, were ecstatic after their win. “The talent show was amazing! Our performance was great; Dontae and I make a good team. I was hoping we would place because I have wanted to sing at pep rally since I was a freshman. When they called our names I almost died, figuratively of course,” said Favaloro, after her name was called into the winners’ circle. Hawkins was equally as excited.  “I think our performance was great.  We definitely killed it. Third is cool because now we get to go first at Pep Rally,” she said.
It is safe to say the talent show was full of great performances and a happy crowd. It helped bring in the first fun vibe of homecoming weekend.

On Saturday, October 22nd, Long Island University’s C.W. Post Campus celebrated the 50th Anniversary of its radio station, WCWP. The inaugural broadcast took place on October 18th, 1961 at noon by the founders of WCWP: Arthur Beltrone and Hank Neimark. On Saturday night, numerous alumni flooded the top floor of Hillwood Commons to recognize the achievement of the radio station.
For half a century, the Abrams Communications Center has been the “second home” of students at C.W. Post wanting to learn and develop skills in the broadcasting and production fields.
“It’s very family oriented…a lot of camaraderie going on at WCWP,” said Bryan Gallucci, a junior broadcasting major at C.W. Post. “I’ve dipped my feet in all aspects of radio, whether it’s calling games or doing the Sportswire. It’s been a real good experience.”
During the 50 years of WCWP, some of the biggest names in the sports, music and entertainment industries have been interviewed. Several athletes have talked to WCWP members on the radio. Just this past year, New York Knicks starting shooting guard Landry Fields could be heard over the WCWP airwaves. Other notable sports interviews include New York Jets safety Eric Smith, former NFL coaches Dennis Green and Jim Fassell, as well as ESPN analysts Patrick McEnroe and Buster Olney.
WCWP has also made its presence known in in music. Christina Kay, a 2011 C.W. Post alumna and current assistant general manager of WCWP, has had numerous stars within the music business interviewed on her shows including Jordin Sparks, Aaron Carter, Miguel, Push Play, and Blake Lewis, as well as a multitude of American Idol contestants.
“For me, the station has taught me so much about myself and provided me with a great foundation for my career,” said Kay, who has landed quite a few on-air spots on stations such as Party 105 and WALK-FM. “But, I think the thing[s] about WCWP that has touched me the most are the people and the atmosphere.”
Dr. Paul Forestell, the Provost of the C.W. Post Campus, discussed the University’s mission statement of “access and excellence” when referring to WCWP and the impact it has made throughout its 50 years. “You are the ones who have promoted access. You are the ones who have operated with excellence. You are the ones who allow us to feel pride in this place,” noted Forestell. “And, you’ve been pioneers for 50 years, and I have no doubt you’ll be pioneers for 50 more.”
WCWP/88.1 FM has had such a tremendous impact on so many people throughout the years. “To me, this is a very special night,” said senior broadcasting major Matt Soldano. “Being with so many great people and looking back on the past three or four years of my life that I’ve spent at WCWP, it’s really had such a great impact.” Soldano started out as an intern in the sports department of the radio station and is now the sports director of WCWP. “It’s really something I never imagined. I’m just grateful for all the opportunities that WCWP has given me.”
During the celebration, it was announced that the WCWP Hall of Fame was created. The first inductees are the founders of WCWP: Arthur Beltrone and Hank Neimark. Without the founders, none of the amazing things in future years could have happened. Countless lives have been affected by these men, and it is only right that they were inducted into the Hall of Fame.
“I hope that this marks the new beginning and the new era for WCWP,” said Dan Cox, WCWP’s director of broadcasting, who has been a part of the station for nearly 30 years. “All of you, please march with me into the future, and help me do what’s necessary to keep the atmosphere: giving great people a chance to do great work.”

“Going green,” which has been the popular phrase for the past several years, reflects efforts and changes in our daily lives to become more sustainable and reduce our negative impact on the environment.  With all of the conclusive evidence that scientists have provided, such as global temperature rise and retreating glaciers, there is no denying that global warming is real, and immediate action must be taken.  Many programs have been developed to encourage people to make the transition to a more sustainable life.  An example is Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project, which is a powerful organization that aims to present the truths of global warming through webcast presentations and events.  Most importantly, it is not only crucial that we take action but also that we educate others and spread awareness as a university community.  C.W. Post is a significant institution on Long Island. It has begun to make efforts in fulfilling its role of becoming a green campus, but has it done enough?
When asked about C.W. Post’s role in becoming a more sustainable campus, Professor of Geography Dr. Scott Carlin responded by saying, “I have been following the greening of universities for about 15 years.  C.W. Post has a strong track record in energy efficiency, a respected Arboretum, and other parts of our campus are beginning to invest in sustainable education and campus practices.  A growing list of national universities has already made much larger investments in sustainable education, renewable energy, and related practices.”
Carlin continued, “Our challenge is to learn from these national successes, but we must also develop our own sustainable vision.  Students play an important role in all of this. Rather than feeling cynical, students should learn how to be more vocal about their ‘green’ vision for our campus. We each need to share with our peers and campus leaders why this matters to us.  C.W. Post has a lot of resources that we can strengthen: a green Honors track, a sustainability commitment from Aramark, a growing recycling program, and proposals for new environmental sustainability courses and majors.  Right now, we don’t have strong mechanisms for connecting these together.  What I consistently hear is that we should expand these programs more rapidly at C.W. Post.  We also need to develop new mechanisms for connecting all of these sustainable dots.  We are a fragmented campus, and that is not sustainable.  But, these are exactly the kinds of problems that we can analyze, discuss, and creatively solve in our classes.”  Carlin has been very active in achieving goals to make our campus greener.  Displayed with this article is a draft of a map of C.W. Post that he created which includes accomplishments as well as additional ideas that can be implemented to create a much more sustainable community.
Some of the noticeable efforts that have been made on campus include visible recycling bins in the Hillwood Commons, solar paneling on the Public Safety building, and a reusable to-go tray program in Winnick.  In response to these changes, Mayra Montoya, the supervisor of Winnick, said, “We have encouraged students to use the reusable, eco-friendly to-go containers this semester.  We got rid of the Styrofoam containers and replaced them with eco-friendly sugarcane clamshell containers.”   According to the C.W. Post Dining Services website, Aramark has been purchasing its food products locally, which reduces long-distance transporting.  Also added to Post were courses on sustainability as well as the sustainability program offered this past summer, which offers students the opportunity to explore various aspects of the issue including green business investing, cleaner energy, environmental journalism, and eco-art.  During the spring 2011 semester, C.W. Post hosted its first sustainability luncheon.  Professor Carlin hopes to have another one in 2012.  These are just a handful of many changes and additions that were brought to the campus.
When asked his opinion on C.W. Post’s green efforts, senior geography major Abrom Shepard said, “Post still has a long way to go compared to other universities in the area.  But, the recent improvements have put us on the right track to making us a more sustainable university.”
While these efforts are steps in the right direction, we should not be complacent.  For instance, Humanities Hall is one of the main classroom buildings, and there seems to be no efforts in promoting recycling there.  All of the garbage, including plastic and paper, is going in the same trash can.  With all of the newspapers and plastic bottles that are being dispensed in Humanities, it does not make sense not to have recycling bins available.  Also, in the periodicals of the library, the recycling bin is behind the reference desk.  Recycling bins should be visible to students, not hidden.   In most leading institutions and even in many high schools, recycling bins are present right when you walk into the building, making it convenient for students and staff to throw away their plastic bottles or newspapers in the corresponding bins.
There are abundant amounts of ways to make our campus greener besides recycling.  Professor Carlin discussed the idea of providing hydration stations, like the one in the Pratt Recreation Center, to encourage students to use their own water containers rather than plastic water bottles.  Think of the potential amount of plastic bottles a year that would not be wasted.  If that is not convincing enough, think about the amount of paper that is thrown away every day in a non-recyclable bin.  In order to achieve a greener campus, we must take these initiatives, such as those presented by Professor Carlin.  Although we have taken steps to attain an eco-friendly campus, there is still much more that can, and should, be done.  Like with everything, there is always room for improvement.

Rate My Professors is a website where students can find and post professor ratings and read comments from both current and former students about their professors. According to ratemyprofessors.com, it is “the internet’s largest destination for professor ratings with more than 6,500 schools and over 10,000 entirely student-generated comments and ratings.” Students today are not only choosing classes based on prior requirements and what time the class may or may not be available, but they are also referring to this website to see what the professor is ranked and how much students like or dislike the class.
You start off by finding a professor or finding a school. After your narrow down your search and find what you are looking for, you rate the professor on a scale ranging from 1-5, including easiness, helpfulness, clarity, interest level prior to attending class, textbook use, if attendance is mandatory or not, and you may leave a comment.
The question is: “How effective is this website?” Students may read a comment or come across a rating that was low and decide to not take the class. For example, Kate Skoblicki, a sophomore public relations major, said, “I know a lot of people who used this website before picking a class. After they saw a bad review, they didn’t want to take the class anymore.  I feel Ratemyprofessors.com is mostly accurate, and I definitely feel it can help students decide if they want to stay in a class.” Love Ahuja, a political science graduate student, said, “The students who would use this website are the people who had a really good experience or a really bad experience. People should realize this is not always fair because professors need to share their side[s] of the story, too.”
Media Arts professor Carolyn Levin commented on the legal status of RateMyProfessor.com.  She said, “Anonymous speech is certainly protected by the First Amendment.  Students have the right to praise or criticize their professors anonymously, in this fashion.”  However, she feels that students with caution should use sites such as this.  There is a real question about the credibility and accountability for reports about professors that are posted anonymously.
It is clear that technology has become so, especially in circumstances like this. Students must realize that although this website is helpful in allowing a student to figure out what professor was rated as great by certain students and which ones students have said to avoid, the comments and ratings are all based on opinion. All in all, students can agree that just because one student enjoyed the class doesn’t always necessarily mean the other person will as well. Clearly, there are two sides to everything in every situation.

The worst time of the year is that moment during the first week of classes when your professor hands you the syllabus with the required reading. You already knew that you would be dishing out $100 for that class; now, it’s in writing in front of you.  And, that’s just for one book. Imagine taking six classes with a $100 fee on each textbook. It’s not the C.W. Post Bookstore’s fault that textbooks are so expensive.  It is their fault, however, that it is not bringing in enough business.  So, how is business these days in the bookstore with other options of textbook buying?
This semester, the bookstore offered a new opportunity to rent textbooks,which is similar to taking out a library book. You have the option of how many days you need for the textbook, and you pay a fee. The fees can cost up to $60, which is like buying a textbook anyway.
The bookstore also offers used textbooks, but most of those books are discounted by only 10%.  Ray McGale, the regional manager of Barnes &Noble Booksellers, which owns the C.W. Post Bookstore, said the following about the sales: “ Like all college bookstores across the United States, the C.W. Post Campus Bookstore has been dealing with the reality of selling less units of textbooks every year. Our ability at the C.W. Post Campus and other college campuses that we serve is to offer students more choices of textbook options. Offering new, used, digital, and rental textbooks at cost savings in our store and through our website has been very good for our business.”
McGale makes a point; many students have inquired about renting textbooks, but is this going to work in the future? McGale says, “Our future in college retailing is about bringing our customers what’s next.” As for Barnes & Noble, its overall business is soaring, according to McGale. “With the introduction of the NOOK products, our company’s sales of digital books has soared.”
So, what are Post students buying? Senior art education major Kathleen Catterson says, “I don’t even bother going to the bookstore. I get all of my books on Amazon, which is so much cheaper. Amazon has a large selection of used books to buy.”
“I do buy my textbooks at the bookstore because my Professors assure the students that the books are there; it’s pretty convenient as well,” says Junior Carly Stratos.
Whether you’re a book store student or an Amazon student , the books are always going to be expensive.  The campus bookstore has a few advantages over Amazon; it’s nearby, and you don’t have to pay for shipping fees. The bookstore almost always will have the book you’re looking for because your professors have already sent orders for the books they want the students to read. The cheapest way would be to not buy a textbook at all, but is it worth failing the class over? Choose wisely because you could always re-sell your textbooks at the end of the year or give them to a needy friend who will be taking the class after you.

As the weather is getting colder, it might be more tempting to crawl up under a blanket with a cup of tea in front of the television, than to head over to the gym for some exercise. Here are some easy tips on how to keep your motivation for training during winter time.
“Music is my motivation,” said sophomore Nutrition major, Aurora Kronberg. She updates her playlist with new songs at least once a week, so that she always has a variety of good music to motivate herself while training. “Also, I love training in new clothes,” she said. Update your wardrobe with some new running shoes or a pair of running shorts, and you´ll have no excuse to stay lazy. “My sister cuts pictures out of magazines of celebrities with nice bodies, and gets motivated by that,” said Pratt employee, and sophomore business major, Dominic Kulma. Find the little things that make you want to hit the gym, and stay in shape throughout the year.
The Pratt Recreation Center offers fitness classes, an open pool, and racquetball courts. And those are only a couple of your choices. “Everyone can sign up for a free personal trainer at the Pratt Recreation Centre,” says Junior Radiology Technology major, and Personal Trainer at Pratt Recreation Centre, Ryan Tabibi. He encourages everyone to continue with a healthy lifestyle throughout the year. For more information, check out the C.W Post website (http://www.liu.edu/CWPost/About/Resources/PRC/Fitness-Center/Personal-Training.aspx).
Personal training is perfect for an introduction to the gym. But there are other small changes you can make: get off the couch and take your conversation with your friends on Facebook-chat to a walk around campus instead. With some fresh air, and exercise, you will get a real break from your homework, and you will be rewarded with feeling better! “Do a 10-15 minute work-out when you wake up, and before you go to bed, with sit-ups and push-ups, and other easy exercises,” said Kulma. “A little activity during the day will make you feel healthy, and it will give you better confidence.”
Making exercise into a social activity, as well as a daily activity, are some of the best ways to continue with good habits. “I get motivated by watching other people exercise,” said Tabibi, “If you go with friends, you would make appointments to train, you would push each other, and you´ll be social at the same time.” A variety of fitness classes allows you to cool down in the pool with the Aqua boot camp on Thursdays at 6:15 pm, or get your sweat dripping during the total body class on Thursdays and Tuesdays at 12:30 pm, and Thursdays 5:30 pm, or get your abs visible by taking the abs class on Mondays and Fridays at 6.30 pm, and Wednesdays at 7pm.  “I’ll ensure you, there is something for everyone to like,” said Tabibi. A full schedule can be found on posters around campus, or at the desk at the Recreation Centre.
“I´m more focused, I feel better about myself, and I have more energy,” said junior Business major, Kathrine Andersen. She has been taking advantage of the opportunities at Pratt, and she praised the many options: “Pratt is fun, easy and accessible,” she said.  “Use Common Hour for a quick exercise,” Tabibi suggested.
So, who wants to decline a confidence boost, a better-focused head, and a better social life? Don´t let the cold weather scare you away from the gym, and don´t let the fact that summer-season is still months away make you slack off: A healthy lifestyle will get you better focused on your schoolwork, as well as help you fit into those perfect outfits for all the holiday parties coming up. Now you will have no excuses.

As the old adage goes, “Diamonds are a girl’s best friend.” While there is no mistaking the timelessness of diamonds, there are five other fall trends currently proliferating our campus. These trends are bound to bring confidence and excitement to combat the grey, dreary weather that is ahead of us.
The first trend is jewel-toned jewelry. Jewel tones are vibrant colors that mirror precious or semi-precious gemstones. Jewel tones range from emerald green to amethyst purple and everywhere in between. With this fashion, it is the brighter the better! Forever 21 is the best place to find inexpensive jewelry in general, but even more so for jewel tones. For instance, a ring with a jade-colored center stone would be perfect to add a dash of color to the neutral hues of fall.
The thoughts of mixing metals, my second trend for this season, might make a few of you nervous. However, mixing gold and silver jewelry together has a seemingly endless potential to move any outfit from humdrum to chic. Pair a chunky silver watch with gold bangles and you have created a more dynamic look to an outfit. In fashion, sometimes imperfections have a way of working in harmony. This trend is even better than others because of its versatility.
From Native American-influenced necklaces to feather earrings, there is no doubt that a fall jewelry trend this year is all about going tribal. One of the leading brands marketing this style is Free People, which combines hippy-style pieces with tribal ones. Free People’s Horus Pendant necklace is a great example of how mixing orange and golden hues with statement jewelry provides fashionistas with bold, tribal-inspired looks. Wear a necklace such as this one with a cozy sweater, leggings, and boots to highlight the power of bold accessories. “Tribal-inspired jewelry is so in style this season. It goes with all types of outfits and is also a great way to dress up a more casual outfit,” says Public Relations major, Erika Amandola.
Rose gold has become one of the most popular metals in jewelry this season. Rose gold is pinkish, and has a warmer take than traditional gold. There is no better brand than Michael Kors to exemplify the ability of rose gold to add a distinctive touch. Kors’ rose-gold watches are popping up all over on celebrities and fashion mavens alike. “I love Michael Kors’ watches because they are reasonably priced, comfortable, and the size of the face of the watch is perfect,” Junior Public Relations major, Devin Fassberg said. This trend looks good with virtually any skin tone and there is really no wrong way to wear rose-gold jewelry.
Large cuffs are another trend to watch this season. Available in a multitude of colors, cuffs definitely make a statement. Junior Psychology major, Lisa Corbett believes that “Large cuffs and bangles tie an outfit together and make it look like you are more put together without trying.” Grecian cuffs are the most popular form of this trend and can be found in most stores.
Jewelry showcases an outfit because of its ability to make everything look seamless. An entire outfit can hinge upon one piece to bring your style from ordinary to extraordinary. Check out Forever 21 especially to create your own personal style at an affordable price.

It has been all over the news: there is a protest going on down at Wall Street. The controversy is deep, but what’s the real story? The protesters are organizing under the title “Occupy Wall Street.” It is a sit-in protest, which means that the protesters there don’t leave. This protest began as a very small affair on September 17 and has grown to include hundreds of major cities in the United States, as well as in dozens of other countries. The protesters in New York have set up sleeping bags, portable restrooms, and water filtration systems in Zuccotti Park, and they are there to stay until they see change.
The biggest criticism of the movement at the moment is that they do not have one set problem that they wish to have solved.  Some people scoff at the movement for this problem, calling protesters “rabble-rousers.” Mitt Romney feels it is “dangerous,” and calls it “class warfare.” Herman Cain feels it is a conspiracy and said, “I happen to believe that these demonstrations are planned and orchestrated to distract from the failed policies of the Obama administration.”
The Occupy Wall Street website counters the criticisms in its “About” section, and states , “[We are] fighting back against the corrosive power of major banks and multinational corporations over the democratic process, and the role of Wall Street in creating an economic collapse that has caused the greatest recession in generations.” Some may use this to argue that there are so many things wrong at present now that one cannot generalize all of the issues in a single document of grievances.
Whichever side you take, it is essential to recognize that this movement is growing; it is mounting to include college campuses around the country. C.W. Post is organizing its very own “Occupy” protest. It will begin on November 1 at 10 a.m. on the Great Lawn outside of the mansion. The Facebook event states, “A lot of students can’t afford to go to Wall Street…We aren’t making anybody miss class, we’re fighting for education rights so feel free to leave…we’re aiming for a constant supply of students.” The Occupy Post Facebook page is open for wall comments about what students would like to see change at Post as well as within the country.
When asked, many students hadn’t heard about the Occupy Wall Street movement.  Some that have heard about it were unsure if they understood the movement completely. Jessica Mottice, a senior theater major, felt that way. She said, “I figure I’m in the 99% that should be angry with Wall Street, but I don’t understand why they’re the people to blame.” She had also not heard about Occupy Post. Other students, however, are opinionated about the protests and feel they are informed. Elyse Fonseca, a sophomore liberal arts major, said, “I feel like what protesters are doing is right in that the divide between the rich and poor keeps getting wider and something needed to be done about it.”
Occupy Wall Street and the movements that have branched out from it have seen a lot of publicity, and the coverage will be likely to continue to grow. For information about the movement from the protesters themselves, visit OccupyWallSt.org or find “Occupy Wall St.” on Facebook and Twitter. For information and updates about Occupy Post, find “Occupy Post” on Facebook. For more information about the various campuses getting involved in the nationwide protest, find “Occupy Colleges” on Facebook.

            Until recently, most people probably weren’t too concerned with a country called Libya. But, what has brought this North African country into conversation lately?  Well, it has to do with a person named Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi was the ruler over the country from September of 1969 until August of 2011. During his time as dictator, Gaddafi ruled with the figurative iron fist. In June 2011, the International Criminal Court (ICC) put out a warrant for Gaddafi’s arrest for crimes against humanity, specifically citing his brutal massacring of his own people. In August 2011, the Libyan people finally overthrew the dictator and began taking back the country of Libya for themselves and forced their once strong leader into hiding. On October 20th, the reports came flooding in worldwide; Muammar Gaddafi has been killed, and Libya is now on its way to democracy. While it is true that it is always great to hear that places around the world are breaking free of oppression, the big question is what’s next for Libya?
For anyone who has seen Shawshank Redemption, picture the scene when Andy Dufresne breaks out of prison and for the first time feels the rain on his face as a free man. I imagine that is the feeling that is spreading rapidly across Libya. After all, how would you feel if, after 42 years of oppression, you were suddenly free? But, let’s face it; Libya isn’t all of a sudden going to be a full-blown democratic nation over night. That’s too easy. It could take years to establish a proper, stable, and free government. Democracy takes time, patience, and about 10 million tons of hard work. Of course, I’m sure that the United States government won’t hesitate to lend a helping hand, seeing as it always does, even if it can’t afford it.
I digress; I’m not an expert in International Politics or on how to build a country by any means, but I think this much is clear: Libya being free is a great thing for this world. The fall of one tyrant today could mean the fall of another tomorrow. Looking back at it, this all started with a few riots in Egypt to overthrow its now former dictator, and that feeling of rebellion pushed Libya into doing the same. Who knows, this could be the start of a worldwide revolution that ends with the abolition of tyranny as we know it. Now, I’m not saying it’s definite, so please let’s not all get our hopes up, but anything is possible. Well, no matter what the future may hold, today, let us all take a second to smile and celebrate that there is now another free country in our world.

The C.W. Post Women’s Volleyball Team suffered a 3-0 loss at the hands of the Dowling College Golden Lions on Wednesday, October 19th. The loss dropped the team’s record to 11-13 overall and 4-5 in the East Coast Conference, while the Lions improved to 18-3 overall and 9-0 in the ECC. The Lions are also currently ranked first in conference standings.
The first set started off close, with both teams fighting to keep the other within reach. With the score tied at 10, however, the Lions managed to use a series of eight Pioneer-attacking errors to pull away with a 15-4 streak to take the lead 1-0.
The Pioneers seemed to rebound in the second set, playing a much more composed game. Late in the set though, with the score tied at 24, the Lions got the kill to put the finishing touches on the match and widen the gap to 2-0. The Lions went on the dominate the third and final set after breaking away from a 9-9 tie, achieving a .371 hitting percentage and taking the match 3-0.
Dowling outside hitter Bethany Shepard led the match with 16 kills and a .225 hitting percentage. The Pioneers were led by freshman Heather Adams’ three aces and junior Lisa Delfs’ seven kills.
The team will host the NYIT Bears in another conference match this Tuesday, October 25th, at 7 p.m. in the Pratt Center, as they look to rebound.

Looking for a new way to relax and calm your nerves?  Reiki is the newest “technique” in relieving stress.   Known in Japan for helping people heal naturally through spiritual energy, Reiki is making its way around the United States. Reiki energy can flow to any spot in the body that needs healing. I went to my first Reiki session at the Groh Well Healing Center on Merrick Avenue located in Merrick.  It is a great place to do Reiki because it is a quiet office with a great atmosphere.  When I walked into the room, there were chairs in a circle known as the “Reiki Circle” with crystals in the middle.  There are all different types of crystals that have different meanings, but they are all meant to help heal the body.
I was nervous my first time I attended Reiki.  I knew that a trained professional Reiki Master would be passing energy onto me through the use of her hands, so I was definitely skeptical about this.  The class started out with a meditation process that was actually quite relaxing.  After I was nice and calm, I received Reiki. All of the Reiki masters have a certain life force energy that they can pass to whomever they perform Reiki on, just by moving their hands gently over pressure points.  Nora, the Reiki Master at the Groh Well Center, was a soft spoken, friendly woman.  She had a calm aura that was contagious just by being in the same room with her. She was extremely welcoming to me since I was new, and she made me feel very comfortable. I felt extremely peaceful after it was over, like a new radiance was flowing through my body.  I can admit, I would absolutely go back to another class.
The next time you are stressed out over school or just feel the need to relax, try to find a local Reiki class being held near you.  Even if you already are relaxed, it is a great way to develop strong spiritual friendships with others who enjoy Reiki.  Watch out Yoga because Reiki Healing is the new form of relaxation!

The C.W. Post Men’s Soccer Team bounced back after losing its first game of the season on October 18th, against Nyack College. After a 3-1 victory against Queens College, the Pioneers’ overall record is now 13-1-1.
Away against the Nyack Warriors, the Pioneers suffered their first defeat in a game consisting of long passes and not much play. The Pioneers, who are used to getting chances after ground-plays and shorter passes, struggled with adapting to an uneven field. With no goals in the first half, Nyack left the field as the controlling team.
The Pioneers fought back and started the second half with a couple of scoring chances, but with no luck putting the ball in the net. After Nyack scored the only goal of the match, the Warriors stood their ground and closed the Pioneers down in their attempt to change the score. With a 1-0 loss, the Pioneers’ record was moved to 12-1-1, putting pressure on the Pioneers leading into the following game.
“We went to Nyack to try to play them out of the park, but we were not successful in doing that. We used over one half to read the surface and their playing style before we started to fight and play longer balls… just a bad showing from us,” said sophomore captain Eirik Bjornoe.
The win of the ECC regular season was secured with a win against Queens College on Saturday. “Given the loss on Tuesday, we had to come together as a team for the game against Queens,” said sophomore goalkeeper Marco Jorgensen. “I think everyone on the team felt the importance of the game more as a joy than [as] a pressure,” said Jorgensen, describing the team spirit that has led to 12 wins out of 14 possible games.
The Pioneers have suffered a habit of letting in the first goals during several matches in the season, and against Queens College, history repeated itself. After 35 minutes, Queens scored first and took a 1-0 lead. It was another game with a difficult field, making it tough for the Pioneers to continue with their usual style of play. Queens put up a great performance with an energy level and a determination that prevented the Pioneers from making any good plays.
Entering the field in the second half, the Pioneers were eager to bring home the trophy. With one player on each team suspended, the temperature increased, as there was more room to play. After 67 minutes, sophomore forward Cemil Turan scored with a header after a cross from junior midfielder Andreas Olsen. Later, Olsen followed up with the good play, scoring on a 12-yard shot,  giving C.W. Post a 2-1 lead. But, the Pioneers did not settle yet. Two minutes before the end of the match, freshman midfielder Henrik Idsoe served freshman forward Eivind Austboe with a brilliant pass, leading to  3-1 after a fantastic shot, leaving the ECC trophy in the hands of the Pioneers.
“As with the game against Nyack, the field in Queens didn’t really invite the teams to play on the ground,” said Jorgensen. “Therefore, once again, it became a game of battle more than anything else. Good fight combined with some good individual performances did, however, make sure that this one was a win instead of a loss.”
Captain Bjornoe was pleased to see that Olsen continued to score goals, along with the two forwards Turan and Austboe, and is confident that if they keep up with their scoring frequency, the Pioneers will have a good shot at the ECC Tournament Championship. “I’m extremely proud of the team after Saturday’s game. It was hard, both mentally and physically, to take home the ECC Trophy, but we succeeded because we stood together and turned the game around in the second half,” said Bjornoe. “Before we started the season, we had three goals: to win three trophies. Now, we won the first one. The ECC regular season and ECC Tournament Championship are the next big goals.”

The C.W. Post Cross-Country teams swept the competition at the 2011 East Coast Championships on Sunday, October 23rd.

Head Coach Rob Morris was honored as the ECC Men’s and Women’s Cross Country Coach of the Year.
On the men’s side, junior Christian Altamura was first to cross for the Pioneers. He secured the third spot with a time of 26:01.

These three top runners earned a spot on the All-Conference First Team.

The stands at Hickox Field were packed, the crowd was ready to erupt at any moment, but the C.W. Post football team didn’t give them much to cheer about in the first half of their 2011 Homecoming game on Saturday, October 22nd. Kutztown managed to open up a 21-0 gap before the end of the first half, but the Pioneers came back to score 30 points after that. Despite their efforts, though, the deficit was too large to overcome. The 42-30 loss snapped the Pioneers’ four-game win streak and brought their record to 4-4 overall, 4-1 in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference.
The Golden Bears scored on their first three drives of the game, converting a pair of 15- yard touchdown passes from quarterback Kevin Morton, and a three-yard run from Josh Mastromotto gave Kutztown an early 21-0 lead.
It took a while for the Pioneers offense to get going, but right before the end of the first half, they scored a pair of touchdowns to cut the lead to 21-17. Sophomore wide receiver Kyle Hardy caught a pass from redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Laurino for the first touchdown, and then sophomore running back Anthony Brunetti rushed into the end zone for a two-yard touchdown.
Kutztown struck back shortly after to pad their lead, however, with a two-yard run from Mastromotto. By this time, the Pioneers offense had begun to click, and redshirt sophomore wide receiver Joe Botti caught an 11-yard pass for a touchdown to get the Pioneers right back into the game. But, before the Pioneers could get the chance to tie or possibly take the lead, the Kutztown offense struck one last time on a 74-yard drive to give them a 42-23 lead. Sophomore running back Jeff Mack was able to score a touchdown for the Pioneers on a 16-yard rush into the end zone, but it was with only 45 seconds remaining in the game and was not enough to prevent the loss.
The Kutztown offense had 576 yards of offense, 458 of which came from Morton. The Kutztown defense also did its job, sacking Laurino seven times and intercepting three of his passes.
The loss drops the Pioneers to 4-4 on the season, ending their win streak and handing them their first conference loss. Post looks to start a new winning streak this Saturday, October 29th, on the road against second-ranked Bloomsburg University. Coverage on 88.1 FM and wcwp.org begins at 2 p.m., with kickoff slated for 2:30 p.m.

If you walked anywhere near the athletic fields on Saturday, October 22nd, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., you likely noticed that it looked a lot like a carnival. Welcome to the C.W. Post Homecoming.
As you approached the tent to get your tickets to the game, you saw a free carnival, offering a rock wall, a ferris wheel, and an array of bouncy castles. You were greeted by pleasant fall decorations and the luscious smell of barbecue. Eric Zirlinger, the senior assistant director of the Office of Student life and Leadership Development also probably greeted you.  Of course, a lot of work goes into making Homecoming what it is every year, but Zirlinger and his co-workers didn’t seem to feel the pressure.  He said, “There is nothing difficult about it because it is what students wait for.  Everyone turns out; the smallest kids, who could be the future Post generations, as well as the past and current students all together eating candy and enjoying themselves.”
Once you entered the gates to the Homecoming event, you were surrounded on both sides by tables representing dozens of groups from C.W. Post, as well as some fly-away cotton candy from Delta X. Every table had something different to offer and something fun to do. There were even clowns on stilts and performing tricks for attendees to enjoy.
Lynne Schwartz, the Associate Director of Counseling Services coordinator, the C.W. Post Parent and Family Connection, and also a Post alumni said, “The most exciting part about this year’s homecoming is the commitment from the various clubs. It shows positive spirit and a collective pride in the campus.”
Students didn’t seem to mind putting in a little extra work to help make Homecoming special. Chris Kwozko, a graduate student studying secondary English education, was representing SGA (Student Government Association) and P.A.G.A.N.S. at Homecoming, and he felt that it was well worth the effort. He said, “Homecoming is worth the extra work because it builds a sense of school spirit and community. It is a great time to be with family, friends, and alumni who may have been in our shoes not long ago.”
Those students who were not in the parking lot tailgating, frequenting the beer tent, or participating in games and crafts at the various club tables may have noticed the stands at the game. One side was completely full with people dressed in green and gold, all cheering and chanting.  The other side, held what amounted to merely a handful of families coming from Kutztown University in Pennsylvania. If the spirit of the day wasn’t evident in the turnout alone, the attendance at the game surely would have shown any stranger to Post just how much pride there is in the C.W. Post community.

On Wednesday, October 19th,  the chief film critic for the New York Times gave a lecture in the Tilles Center as part of the Provost Distinguished Lecture series. Before  the lecture, Scott participated in a press conference with select members of the C.W. Post student media. The press conference and lecture both contained an “informal conversation” ambiance, where students and other listeners were able to ask questions on any topic they chose.
During the press conference, student journalists  asked questions that demanded answers that would guide them, especially pertaining to the “post-grad” life. Scott told the students that the advice he was given when pursuing a career in criticizing various media was to “maybe think about doing something else”. He said if it wasn’t for his persistence and stubbornness he wouldn’t be where he is today. “When you’re starting out, many doors will slam in your face — keep banging on them!” Scott told the students.
Scott  went on to speak about his career as a film critic.  He discussed what the hardest and the easiest types of reviews to write are; with the hardest being about a movie that you are against, but may be worthwhile to see and the easiest being negative and mocking reviews. “Negative reviews are fun to write and people love them but I tend to think they are not worth as much,” Scott said. The press conference continued with a plethora of other questions for  Scott ranging from his thoughts on graduate school, amateur film critics, and the story of his humble beginning.
When asked how he felt about being offered the position of film critic for the New York Times, Scott said, “It seemed as absurd as someone telling you that they have an open pitching position on the New York Yankees.”
After a short break between the press conference and the lecture,  Scott got ready to deliver his thoughts on “The Importance of Review in Modern Cinema.” The segment turned into  a Q&A period as well, during which, the audience was invited to ask the critic any question they desired. Scott spoke about various topics of the film industry. He said that a common misconception is that the “glory days” of film are in the past, “I don’t believe that age has come to an end — it’s just that the art form is very different in 2011,” Scott went on to say. The lecture lasted about an hour and audience reactions varried. Junior, Alex Parker, stated “He had a few good stories to tell, however, I didn’t take much away from the lecture.” Afterwards Scott stayed to take pictures with members of the audience; he even gave out his autograph to a fan.

            Anyone who walked by the Student Art League Museum in Hillwood this past week may have seen a few very interesting pieces of artwork inside. You may have seen an eerie mannequin made up of hanging limbs, a few ice cream scoops shaped like the heads of babies, or a gigantic set of very detailed and elaborate lips with a full tongue and taste buds. These were just a few pieces of art created by senior art therapy and fine art major Lucy Contreras as part of her senior show.
The exhibit was a very different scene but, at the same time, was also very interesting. The title of the show was “Nice to Meat You,” a clever play on words that intertwined with the cannibal theme of the show. The main project was the giant lips and tongue that Contreras said is her favorite piece. Contreras also said that she was given the idea for her project while “in a photo class.” “Someone told me about a book called Interview With a Cannibal. I read it and came up with the idea,” she said.
Junior art education major Briana Nussbaum attended the show and said, “I really enjoyed this series because it was so outrageous and truly captured my attention.” Many others were intrigued by the artwork and were drawn into the museum curiously and with a hint of excitement. Many took instant note to the sculpted torso that had a hole cut in the middle, where viewers could reach in and grab a piece of cake, something that really drove home the cannibal theme behind the show.
Others were occupied with the giant bed in the middle of the room, on which sat two sculptures, one man and one woman, but they were not quite normal sculptures. The head of the man was just a giant eye watching the woman grab out his heart and prepare to eat it with her lip-shaped head.
Overall, this was a very interesting show that hit a topic not many are willing to do and did a very good job of bringing in viewers.

Is it just me, or does driving totally stink these days?  From those awful cameras at red lights watching your every move, to the cops on every street, it’s like you can’t get a moment alone. Some days the driving part is the only time I have to myself, so I may look a little silly while driving, but it’s my time. This article will explain everything you need to know about driving without getting a ticket or, worse, arrested.
It’s comforting to see those signs that let you know there’s a camera at an intersection, but at most large intersections, there is no warning. You just have to pray that if and when you go through a red light, there’s not a camera flash. I look at every intersection to see if there are any cameras hanging on the poles. If one of those tickets appear in your mailbox, the fine is between $50-$70 depending on the town that issued it. The only thing you don’t have to worry about is getting points taken off your license. You’ll have to pay that pesky fine and not even bother arguing the matter in court because, let’s face it, the picture of your car going through the red light is on the paper. There are those times when we have to go through red lights to avoid accidents, or because our car is behind an 18 -wheeler and we can’t see the darn light, but most courts will take a long time to determine the case and it’s just easier to pay the fine.  This isn’t always fair, but that’s how the state makes its moolah.
Speeding is one of the worst offenses on the road. The fines are ridiculous, racking up close to $200 per ticket, and points are taken off your license. I’ll be brave and admit that I do speed and have a history of getting tickets because of speeding. But is paying a $200 ticket worth being on time to class and getting a good grade?  What about the risk of an accident, serious injury, or worse?  I’ll let you decide that one.
And of course parking, another one of my faulty attributes. Fellow students, if you plan to park in an illegal spot at C.W. Post, you are very likely to get a ticket. Public Safety has been buckling down this year. I have seen the emergency lights on the vehicles and it scares me. Tickets range from $50 to $80 for the offense.
Don’t be a statistic, but learn how to drive well and be cautious; it’ll be easier on both the  authorities and your wallet. So be prepared, look both ways, and of course, safe driving to you all.

Can you believe it’s already time to register for spring classes? With this gorgeous weather hanging on by a thread, it’s odd to think the semester is half-way over. Registration began last week and immediately students raced to the school website or to the administration office to get the best schedule possible. However, what many people don’t realize is that registration is usually more difficult than it sounds. Sure, you may know what classes you wish to take, but avoiding large gaps and getting off on a Friday is never easy.
There are two ways of making a schedule. One, is doing it online by using your LIU account, and the other, is meeting with an advisor. The question is, which way do students prefer? Senior Filomena Pascarella registered online, and said: “You can’t do anything on the website until you’ve paid your bill. It’s very difficult.”
On the other hand, junior Joseph Colletti will be meeting with an advisor to register. “I like meeting with an advisor because I’m always scared of messing up my schedule.” An advisor who knows what your major is knows which classes you need to take and can work around your schedule to make you as content as possible.
So, the choice is yours. Here are just a couple of tips: if you’re going to register online, make sure you know what classes you need to take in order to graduate and make sure you’ve met all the requirements to register at all. If you’re going to meet with an advisor, make sure you schedule an appointment; if you’re a walk-in, make sure to give yourself plenty of time in case there’s a long wait in the advisement office.
Let’s be honest, school is never cheap, so almost everyone would love to graduate as soon as possible. Make sure you’re taking all of your required classes and that you’re on a path that’s right for you. Go about it in any way you want, but just make sure that when it’s time to register for classes to ask yourself “which method of registration is right for me?” To schedule an appointment in the Office of Academic and Career Planning call (516) 299-2746.

I think it’s pretty safe to say that everyone gets a pang of jealousy every now-and-then. Some definitely get it worse than others; for some people, it is an innate characteristic that they encounter every day, especially when it comes to their boyfriend or girlfriend. We all have a friend like this; we’ve witnessed the “green monster” that takes over them. Sometimes people even go so far as to hack into their significant other’s Facebook account, or go through their text messages.
What is it that you are really looking to find? If your spouse is talking to someone else, is that really the way you want to find out? (Not that there is a good way to find out that kind of information.) This is a trait that I’ve seen in my friends, mostly the girls, more than once.  Most of my guy friends that have a jealousy issue usually just keep their girls on a rope so tight that I’m surprised they haven’t lost all their oxygen yet.
One of my girlfriends has done it to every boyfriend she’s ever had because her first love cheated. Now she suspects that all guys are going to do the same thing and  she thinks that by going through all their stuff will keep her one step ahead,  so she doesn’t get hurt like that ever again. But, is that really keeping her one step ahead, or is she setting herself up for a doomed relationship because it is built on all the wrong things?
Trust is imperative for any relationship to work. If you feel like you have to be a private investigator in order to trust your boyfriend/girlfriend, you have a large problem on your hands.  It is also fair to mention that, by doing what you’re doing, you seem slightly insane and paranoid. I understand that problems in past relationships may cause you to feel insecure about current ones, but I don’t see how that gives you the right to go through someone’s belongings. You may be seen as more of a stalker than a boyfriend/girlfriend.

Sweet Tomato, Healthy Eatery & Catering
170 Forest Avenue, Glen Cove
 
Now that we have common hour and can dedicate a specific time daily to grab lunch with our friends, the big question is where to go? Perhaps it’s only me, but the food at Hillwood doesn’t always hit the spot. So, on a search to find good, reasonably priced food near campus, I came across “Sweet Tomato”. It is located in Glen Cove, which makes it only about 10 minutes away – just enough time to grab a bite to eat and make it in time for that 2:00 p.m. class.
The atmosphere is very casual; they actually even have artwork displayed from various high schools around the area. However, the real reason anyone would go out to eat anywhere is for the food! And, here, you won’t be disappointed. The menu is a simple one but has an interesting range of choices. It has a choice of 12 “soul warming soups”, 20 salads, and 40 wraps and paninis daily. Everything is always freshly made and tastes wonderful. The service is also great, but the best part is that few people know about it, so it is almost never packed! You can be in and out in less than an hour. As far as the pricing goes, it is very affordable. Almost everything ranges from $6 – $8. The restaurant even offers a student discount if you show your I.D., but that is only available to select items.
I would definitely recommend this place for your next lunch date. With the combination of a relaxed atmosphere, great food, and affordable pricing it’s a win-win. Enjoy!

The 2011–2012 primetime network television season is well underway, boasting new breakout hits such as 2 Broke Girls, while dust bunnies, such as The Playboy Club, have been quietly swept away. The Nielsen ratings system, which reports audience size and composition, plays a big factor in renewals and cancellations. It is vital that that it tally up views from all the mediums we watch shows on, but it doesn’t necessarily do that.
As of now, CBS has ordered a full season of 2 Broke Girls. NBC is serving up Up All Night and Whitney. Fox picked up New Girl. ABC has given both Revenge and Suburgatory full seasons. The CW has taken a liking to all three of its new dramas, Ringer, The Secret Circle and Hart of Dixie.
“I love Law and Order,” said Adrianna Alvarez, a junior. “I watch the news a lot, Jersey Shore, and a lot of History Channel and National Geographic. I like documentaries. I watched The Real World for the first time…didn’t like it. I watched New Girl. I didn’t like it. I thought it was going to be more witty than it really was. It was surprising because I was really excited for it to come out.”
The CBS sitcom How to Be a Gentleman was cancelled and moved from Thursdays to Saturdays. After one episode, it was pulled completely. NBC’s Free Agents was canned after four episodes and The Playboy Club after three. ABC’s remake of Charlie’s Angels met the chopping block after four episodes but will continue to air.
“I thought Free Agents was horrible,” said Julie Price, a professor of public relations. “It gave a very negative impression of public relations. I was glad that it was cancelled. Up All Night was cute. I am still waiting to see if that takes off and has an audience. I am really looking at how they are promoting the shows rather than content, how they are using commercial media, and how they are looking to engage the audience.”
In the case of The Playboy Club, the first cancellation of the season, network executives wanted an edge in marketing and awareness, so the show depended on its franchise name. To quote an insider, as reported by TV Guide, “It’s a soap, which inherently appeals to women. But, it’s a brand so tied to men.” Horrible promotion before the show premiered did not help its cause. An NBC affiliate refused to air a show with Playboy in its name. Groups such as the Parents Television Council, Morality in Media, the Pink Cross Foundation, Florida Family Association, and the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women all were against what the show stood for and represented. After the first episode, advertisers including Campbell Soup, Lenovo, Kraft Foods, P. F. Chang’s China Bistro, Spring, Subway, and The UPS Store all pulled their ads.
2 Broke Girls had a recent 10.71 million viewers and a 4.3 18-49 rating, while Revenge attained 7.9 million and a 2.7 18-49 rating. On its last airing, How to Be a Gentleman received a preliminary 2.43 million and a prelim 0.7 18-49 rating. Before its cancellation, Charlie’s Angels pulled 5.91 million viewers and a 1.3 18-49 rating.
Next-day ratings include live viewing and previous nights DVR usage. Since DVRs are used by about 42% of viewers, and programs are watched at a later date, numbers are skewed. Fox’s Terra Nova, which earned a 3.1, later received a 4.4 rating. Two weeks after the fact, ABC found out Pan Am and Revenge were the highest-rated drama premieres.
“I have been so busy,” said Bernie Fabig, a junior. “I really wanted to watch American Horror Story on FX, but I haven’t yet. I have heard a lot of really great reviews about it. I am taking 18 credits and work at night.”
Planning for the 2012-2013 season is already underway. Going back to how shows are promoted and engage the audience, it is easy to understand why remakes such as Charlie’s Angels are developed. This summer, TNT is writing a new chapter for the legendary primetime soap, Dallas, bringing back six original cast members. NBC was in recent talks to redevelop The Munsters, a comedy from the ’60’s reminiscent to I Love Lucy of the ’50’s, with a Modern Family and True Blood twist. This would be a disaster. I can’t imagine sweet, innocent, and iconic characters such as these reformed and transformed to meet today’s standards. They already revived the show in the late ’80’s. Critics are already labeling a new Courteney Cox-David Arquette Pilot as Friends 2.0, which chronicles the ups and downs of a decade-long relationship of a recently separated couple at the center of a group of friends.
“I usually watch Law and Order: SVU and cartoons every once and a while,” said Edward Reyes-Benigno, a freshman. “I watch TV around two or three days a week for an hour.”
My suggestion: Watch whatever makes you happy. If you like drama, catch a drama; if you like comedy, catch a comedy. If you are worried about getting hooked on a network show that get may be cancelled, do a quick Google search to see how it’s doing, or gravitate to a cable series. These shows usually air all of their episodes despite cancellation.

The C.W. Post Women’s Basketball Team is looking forward to another exciting season as it comes off of a season in which it finished with a record of 17 wins and 13 losses overall and 11 wins and nine losses in conference play. With 16 games away from the Pratt this season and 12 home games, the team will have to look to put together a successful away record if it really wants to compete.
Entering her third season as head coach for the Pioneers, Deirdre Moore put together her best record in the 2009-2010 season and has to capitalize on the great amount of away games that the team has this season. With only an 11-spot roster and eight returning players, chemistry among the teammates should not be a problem, especially with the return of senior guard Felicia Joyner, who started in every game in the past two seasons and was named to the East Coast Conference Second Team in both 2011 and 2010. She was ranked in the ECC top ten scorers list.
Assisting Joyner will be junior center/foward Nicolette Marciniak, who has played in every game the past two seasons and averaged 8.1 points per game last season and a team-leading 5.6 rebounds. She had the third-best shooting percentage in the ECC.
The girls will kick off their season with six away games beginning at Philadelphia University on November 12th, before coming home on November 30th, for a matchup against rival Dowling College at the Pratt Center.
