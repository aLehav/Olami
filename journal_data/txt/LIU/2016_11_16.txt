On Wednesday, Nov. 9 professors and students joined together to express their feelings about the presidential election by holding a sit-in during common hour in Hillwood Commons.
“The idea behind the sit in was to come together and find positivity and togetherness on a day that wasn’t so happy for most of us,” said Alexandra Mitchell, a senior musical theatre major. She didn’t want to call the event an anti-Trump campaign.
“It was a Pro-people sit-in where we wanted the students of Post to know that no matter who you are, what you identify as, and where you come from, you are important and your voice matters here.”
Taylor Bass, another senior musical theatre major, also partook in the sit-in. “It was a tough day. All of my classes were like funerals, both the students and teachers were in tears,” she recollected. “The majority of my peers are having their rights challenged by Trump’s presidency. It put my heart at ease to know that people were thinking the same thing as me and were just as scared as me.” Although the sit-in was peaceful, Public Safety and Dean of students Abagail Van Vlerah stopped by to make sure everything remained calm.
“I think the biggest part of this movement is that we do not emulate the behavior of our president-elect,” Bass explained.
“We will no longer tolerate those using his platform for violence. We will not be silenced by his presidency just because he isn’t fighting for us, we will fight for ourselves and for our rights as human beings in this country.”

In light of the presidential election and the outrage of many Americans about the victory of Mr. Trump, I think we should all take a step back and relax. Although it may seem like there is a lot to worry about, there isn’t. Not yet, anyway.
Now, I’m not a supporter of either candidate and nor does my opinion matter in this ever so great country. This is probably because I am an international student from Britain, who has contributed to the most…wait…second most terrifyingly stupid thing in current political affairs: Brexit.
One may start to panic if you were Mr. Pearse, you may think, “can’t go home, to ‘Great’ Britain because of the clever foolishness of Nigel Forage and his lies during his leave campaign for Brexit.” But I can’t really stay here anymore, because I’m not an American citizen. Fantastic, and what’s next?
Towards the latter part of a lovely but scary conversation with my surrogate mother Abir, who works in the IMC, which is located in the Library, after she had listened to my vented worries, the beautiful Middle Eastern uttered some words of wisdom, borrowed from Swahili. ”Hakuna matata, Harry, hakuna matata.” And just like that, this soft and gentle notion of ‘no worries’ lifted the coarse veil of anxiety and replaced it with a caressing silk over my head.
The divinity of nostalgia at the “Lion King” reference, and the fact that I am at oneness with words, helped this short phrase shed some philosophical light upon my worried soul. Subjectively, it made me realize that yes we may be in a devastating storm when it comes to politics at the moment, and yes that is extremely major. However, I think we need to stay within ourselves.
Remember, we are students; we have so many other qualms and uncertainties we have to focus on. Within the immediacy of our lives and the actuality of our reality, we need to focus on the present. To my comrades out there…the revolution isn’t going to happen right now, in this moment; things need to get a lot worse.
Remember, nothing is going to change drastically until at least January. And within that time period, imagine how many assignments you’ll get, how many training sessions you will have to partake in, how many arguments you’ll have to construct, how many drinks you are going to pour down that neck, and how many parties you are going to boogie your way through, probably to the sound of “One Dance.”
We need to stay calm, cool and collected and try not to veer in any particular direction away from the priorities we have in our own lives. Now I am not saying don’t talk or debate the issue. I want you to in fact relish this horrendously huge historic moment: ‘2016 the year to remember, the good and maybe the bad’ (in a menacing but coherent voice). And of course it is important to question, critically think and acquire understanding, because it would be devastating if we weren’t doing that.
I find it perfectly peculiar but also fantastic that people who I have never heard speak are now developing a voice of anguish, anger and astonishment at what’s happened. For me, this is revolutionary. On the other hand, we could use this newfound voice that a lot of us have suddenly found and incorporate its enthusiasm into the classroom, and on more philosophical ideas. But, ultimately, I think we need to stay sturdy and not react too hastily.
So take deep breaths, relax and watch “The Lion King.” That is the moral of this particular story.

The DVD players have been removed from classrooms on campus this semester. The university has begun investing in higher-end technology, replacing as many classrooms as possible.
“By the end of the spring semester, we will phase in another 30 state of the art classroom projection/smart board systems to add to the already 75 that are fully operational,” said Michael Fevola, director of Information Technology/Audio Visual. Each system is completely Wireless.
Many students believe this is a huge upgrade for the campus. Jennifer Coley, a senior broadcasting major, is one of them. “It’s always great to see upgrades done in classrooms. It just has this warmth and coziness. We all love new things and being in a classroom with an upgraded system like room 119 in Humanities is great.”
Some professors who use DVDs in their classes disagree. They are worried that they may have to bring in their own DVD players or purchase one in the Browse store in Hillwood Commons.
Faculty members in the Communications and Film department use all sorts of media in classrooms regularly. Many of the faculty members coming into the fall semester were not notified that the DVD players had been removed from classrooms.
“While DVDs may be ‘old’ technology, there is much valuable material that is available only in this form, therefore the department hurried to buy DVD players for the faculty,” said Dr. Barbara Fowles, chairperson of the department of communications and film.
Her department bought DVD players from the Browse store and is making them available to faculty in the department as well as professors from other departments teaching in Humanities.
According to Fevola, the Information Technology Department is actively teaching professors who may not know how to convert DVDs to their hard drives, flash drives or store them in their cloud. He added that the ITRC reports that most professors are eager to learn how to best use the state of the art systems that the university is installing in classrooms.

Academic advisers are commonly available on college campuses throughout the nation. They are meant to lead students to educational, and in some instances, career successes. The majority of students on campus do not have academic advisers; however, they have success coaches.
Success Coaches, located in the Promise Office on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, are offered to undergraduate students upon committing to the school. These coaches follow the standard description of other universities’ academic advisers by helping students schedule their semesters, meet graduation requirements, engage in activities on campus and find off-campus professional opportunities.
Junior criminal justice major and student athlete, Shannon Walter, has a Promise Coach who has been accommodating to her demanding practice and conditioning schedule. “He has helped me find classes that fit in my schedule so that I don’t have to miss practice, conditioning, or anything else,” she said. “Though I only meet with him to do my schedule, he helps me map out whether or not I’m on track to graduate.”
The Promise Program, which began in fall 2013, provides career counseling, assists with enrollment, major selection, scholarships, financial planning, internships, study abroad opportunities, assessment of strengths and helps students become active members of the campus community, according to the Director of LIU Promise, Christopher Salute.
“Your four years at LIU Post should not only be fun and exciting, but reward you with the tools necessary to make the next 40 years just as exciting,” Salute said. “LIU Promise pairs first year and some transfer students with success coaches whose goal is to help students successfully navigate their years at Long Island University equipped with a career choice, major, and extra-curricular activities which will engage them locally and globally.”
Success Coaches act as advisers, yet are not to be confused with the Academic Advisers, who are located on the second floor of Kumble Hall. The Office of Academic Advisers is where most transfer and graduate students are able to find guidance for accomplishing their degrees.
Senior broadcast major, Grace Oshin, was given an academic adviser, not a promise coach, after transferring from Lyndon State College in Vermont. “The original adviser I had when I first transferred to this school was terrible. She didn’t give me enough credits, and she was barely there to help when I needed it,” Oshin said. Fortunately, a new adviser was appointed to her when her original adviser left her position.
“Once I switched to a new adviser last semester, she got me back on track to graduate on time. If I had stayed with the same adviser, I would have been a semester behind.” Oshin said that she will have to take over 23 credits next semester due to the poor advisement of her first adviser.
Although Oshin had a rocky start in the Academic Advising Office, she could not be happier to be in Kumble instead of LIU Promise. “I don’t want someone who is supposed to be there to guide me mess up my schedule. I have had multiple friends in the past complain about that.” Oshin is very grateful for her current adviser’s guidance and efficiency in responding to her emails.

Political Columnist
Today in America people are uncertain and nervous for what the future may hold. Some are excited for this drastic change in politics and optimistic for a Donald Trump presidency. Others are fearful for their loved ones and possibly even for themselves. This is what division looks like.
Members of the African-American, Latino, Muslim and Asian-American communities are feeling worried for what this will mean for their friends and their families. Will Donald Trump follow through on his pledges to deport and prosecute immigrants? And how will Trump’s ‘law and order’ stance affect the inner city communities that have already been divided by police shootings?
Many in the LGBTQ community are anxious about how far Donald Trump will take his rhetoric on transsexual Americans and marriage equality. Will Donald Trump work to overturn national marriage equality, and how will his Supreme Court nomination affect the already disenfranchised LGBTQ community? Women are concerned for the same reason. Will Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nomination swing the court to repeal women’s reproductive rights?
The Republican Party, with the Nov. 8 Election Day victory, took control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Republicans are the strongest they have been in over a decade and this is empowering Donald Trump’s supporters. Will these supporters continue to support the controversial and divisive ideas of the Trump campaign?
A Watershed for US Politics
There have only been five U.S. Presidents that have had no experience in elected office. Three of them came from the military (Eisenhower, Grant and Taylor). One had experience as a judge and as a secretary of war (Taft). And one had experience as secretary of commerce (Hoover). With Trump as president, we are in uncharted waters.
Trump’s campaign was unique in nature; it was not exactly a grassroots campaign, but more a hybrid between a grassroots campaign and a soapbox campaign. Trump used large-scale rallies, apparel and slogans to captivate the U.S. public instead of the traditional approach of media advertisement and large scale ground efforts. Trump’s campaign was much more a movement than a campaign, similar in nature to Bernie Sanders’ campaign; this, in my view, marks the future of campaigning.
One major thing to watch in Trump’s presidency is how he will interact with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This may be a turning point for US-Russian relations as Putin has already been reaching out to Trump offering partnership. Whether this change will be for better or worse will be seen only in time.
The major takeaway from Trump’s campaign, and this election in total is that Americans are fed up with business as usual in Washington D.C. Do not be confused, merely 11 months ago Trump was branded as a ‘protest candidate.’ He was seen as being the product of the government’s gridlock, and now he will lead the government. It’s funny how things work out.
How Democrats should go forward
For many Democrats, this feels like the end of the world, like the roof has come crashing in. However, this is not the end, just a new challenge. The most responsible response to this new challenge is pragmatism. Democrats need to at least make an effort to be pragmatic under a Trump presidency. To say it simply, Donald Trump is now our president-elect and we need to make the best of this.
The Democratic Party needs to put aside distractions and plan ahead. Democrats need to rally the party together for midterm elections in two years. The Republicans retained control over both chambers of Congress after the Nov. 8 election, and Democrats need to focus in order to retake at least one of them.
The Democrats almost retook the Senate, and flipping the House has not been all that difficult in the past under a controversial presidency.
The Democratic Party needs to unify under the leadership of Senator Chuck Schumer, the presumed new minority leader of the Senate. Schumer has been a mainstay in the Senate for years now. In addition, Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, remains a head for the Democrats.
There are other stars in the Democratic party, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and mainstays who will fight for party values such as Dick Durbin, Dianne Feinstein, and Richard Blumenthal. And finally the Democrats have future stars in Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris. There are a whole lot of assets remaining in the Democratic party.
Democrats are going to be asked to work with Republicans to find common ground on less controversial issues, like a new infrastructure bill. However, they will be challenged to defend their progress made in the fields of women’s rights and healthcare at all costs. The fight to maintain Planned Parenthood funding and the Affordable Care Act will be uphill climbs, but it’s a battle the Democrats need to fight.
How Republicans should go forward
The majority of Republicans, whether they supported Trump or not, are celebrating right now. This is the turning of the tide in their eyes, the beginning of a great four years. But the challenge the Republicans must meet right now is to remain humble in the face of this victory. It’s now their job to unite the nation and gloating or being malicious will only divide us further. It will be hard enough to bring the 60 million Americans who voted Democrat to unify together as is.
Republicans need to be aware that they now have a great responsibility. Having control of both the White House and Congress is the ultimate political power; they are now steering the ship. These next two years will be a decisive time for America’s geopolitical position, and the Republicans need to be sure to not blow it.
The Republicans in D.C need to decide if they are going to work with the Democrats or work against the Democrats. Will they try to find common ground and unite the nation or will they deliberately work to take away from the Democrats? The latter will only divide the nation further.
Finally, Republicans need not to get too far ahead of themselves. Can Trump really build a wall that stretches itself 2,000 miles? Where will the money come from and how will he secure it? Will Donald Trump really institute term limits for Congress, and if he tries, how will this affect his relationship with the Republican-led Congress? And how can Donald Trump bring back industry, if he builds the factories that will be mostly robotized anyway?
Where does the unity come from?
America is currently being divided by ill feelings and divisive words. Many wonder if it’s possible to unite; only time will tell if it is or not. But one certainty is that unity will have to come from the top first. Donald Trump needs to be the one who begins the unification process.
Republicans need to reach their hand out to the Democrats and be prepared to work together in a collegial fashion. The divisive rhetoric needs to be ditched and we need to remain not only strong, but smart under the flag of the United States of America. This is our only hope to remain unified.

Education Columnist
Did we choose well? To say that last week was full of tough decisions would be an understatement. Within education, election results begged the questions of civic education, or lack thereof, and school choice. Let us begin with the latter as it includes the former.
There are a multitude of choices for the average kindergartner: charter, private, parochial, and public schools, in addition to magnet programs. Charter schools are publicly funded with taxpayer dollars, but are privately owned and managed; typically they operate as a non-profit on privately owned land.
Magnet schools are public schools with specialized courses pertaining to a particular theme (i.e. STEM, Fine Arts, and the like). However, on Tuesday, MA voters restricted future kindergartners’ choices by slamming on the brakes for charter school growth; the Massachusetts Authorization of Additional Charter Schools and Charter Expansion (Question 2) was rejected by a 62.1 percent margin.
While some say low favorability levels for Governor Charlie Baker influenced the vote, the results resounded as a screeching halt on public choice. Some groups believe that charters add to the burden of traditional public schools, others say they thwart the comforting notion of the “neighborhood public school.”
On the one hand, voters are skeptical of the way charter schools are run. On the other hand, public schools need more funding; a recent Northwestern study found poor children are more likely to graduate from high school if their school receives 10 percent more funding.
The Massachusetts vote on charter schools not only reflects voters on one particular issue, but also echoes public opinion on the notion of choice. Since their start (Minnesota wrote the first charter school law in 1991), charter schools have provided an alternative to public and traditional private schools.
While controversial in the ways they are run and manage to accommodate students’ needs, overall charter schools have steadily grown in the last two decades, especially in Massachusetts. Charter schools exemplify innovation in education; they fulfill a need that stems from a predominantly lackluster public school system.
It seems a bit hypocritical to acknowledge the shortcomings of the public school system while simultaneously sequestering the growth of the alternative; one can even go so far as to say, some people fear having a choice. Indeed it is easier to have everything predetermined; but, easy does not necessarily predicate societal wellbeing. Independent choice is the cornerstone of progress; we cannot rob individuals of their right to choice unless it directly inflicts harm upon another person, as Mill’s harm principle states.
Right to choice begs the question of informed decision makers; would the Massachusetts population have voted differently had they known more about the issues? Would the general population have chosen differently if schools placed greater emphasis on civic education? Perhaps. However, an informed voter does not necessarily translate to a voter that embraces choice.

The Post Theatre Company presents “The Killer,” by Eugene Ionesco, this month in the Little Theatre. The show is directed by Brendan McMahon, a New York-based theatre director, brought in for the show.
“The Killer” begins in a “radiant city,” or so Berenger, the main character, thinks. His elation is short lived. It is only a matter of time before he discovers that the city hosts a killer who is on the loose, luring and drowning victims in a pool.
Oddly enough, all the citizens are well aware of this killer’s presence in their city. Dany, a woman whom Berenger is madly in love with (and believes he is engaged to) is killed as well. Berenger leaves the city and attempts to track down the killer and reason with him. Alas, they encounter one another…and the rest is for you to find out as soon as Nov. 11.
Ionesco is a Romanian-French playwright and dramatist whose work is known to have ridiculed the most clichéd situations, and depicted both the solitude and insignificance of human existence, realistically.
The play is reflective of Ionesco’s personal life, and emotions he felt as a child. Ionesco believed that critics never captured the true meaning behind the play. He suggested that, “It was a very happy city that had been entered by a destructive spirit.”
The cast includes theater majors Marlin D. Slack, Taylor Bass, Brandon Bennett, Tanner Bolin, Matthew Burney, Kaitlyn Curci, Daniel George, Nicole Harley, Kelly Leibman, Claire Main, Audrey Ney and Shabbi Sharifi, in various roles. The cast is made up of a diverse mix of sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
“The Killer happened to fit the cast we had perfectly. I loved the dream like narrative quality of it, and of course how applicable it was to the current elections,” McMahon said. He believes the play is about the fear of the other, the ignorance and indifference of other people. “It feeds into so many different themes like terrorism, immigration, politics and religious values, so on and so forth,” McMahon said. He also enjoyed the professionalism and high level of commitment that the cast put forth. “I think it goes beyond what you expect from people this age,” he added.
Brandon Bennett, a sophomore musical theatre major who plays the killer and several other characters in the show said, “ ‘The Killer’ is about the everyman and his quest to change a problem that no one else is willing to, while overcoming numerous obstacles from outside forces, and everything else around him.” Bennett said that the Killer was the most complex of all the characters he plays in the show because he may be real or he may be in Berenger’s head, and you can never really know. “The Killer is pure manipulation, and I love it.”
“Working with this cast has been a dream,” Bennett added. “Everyone works together so perfectly. That sense of ensemble we have is truly an amazing feeling. We hope that the audience sees this, even when there comes utter chaos within the show.”
The show offers an odd sense of humor and extreme political relevance. The audience is required to pay close attention to the ideas that this play presents in an abstract and rather absurd manner, for which Ionesco is known.
The play opened in the Little Theatre Mainstage on Nov. 11-12. Its run continues on Nov. 17- 19 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 13 and 20 at 3 p.m. Tickets are $15 general admission, $12 for seniors, and $10 for students.
For reservations or purchase tickets, go to www.tix55.com. Post Theater Company can be reached at         post-ptc@liu.edu or 516-299- 2356.

The S.A.L. Gallery in the library and the Sculpture Building on the east side of campus, past the equestrian center, holds student art exhibitions throughout the year. While the Sculpture Building may be less known among students, it is the home of impactful classes, exhibitions and student work.
Drawing, Painting and Sculpture for the Art Therapist is just one class taught in the Sculpture Building. “The Graduate Clinical Art Therapy Program consists of several courses from psychology, art therapy, multiculturalism, social action, counseling, studio art, thesis writing and internship field work courses,” said Ann Charlotte Tavolacci, an artist and adjunct professor in the graduate art therapy program. “For the past several years we have been giving students the option to do course work abroad as well. They have been to Korea and Nicaragua the last two years.”
Tavolacci’s Drawing, Painting and Sculpture for the Art Therapist is required for graduate art therapy first-year students; it is not currently open to other majors but “we may be adding a new course that is similar to ARTH 602 as an art elective open to other majors making for a multidisciplinary studio art course – ‘Personal Art Making for the Creative Thinker,’ ” she said. “This will explore other areas of personal art making, use a new text and explore different studio art making techniques.”
The course is “extremely personal,” as students “have to open up in the class because they will eventually have to do it once they become an art therapist,” Tavolacci added. “As an art therapist, they will have to ask someone to deal with issues in a similar way.”
The students in the class are given projects called “directives,” form of intervention using art. “With a directive, the art therapist has a goal in mind and uses art to talk about issues they are facing. They also help guide the student through the intervention,” Tavolacci said.
This is Tavolacci’s second year teaching the course, which she finds to be the most rewarding she’s taught. “This class gave me the opportunity to work with so many people in an intense capacity and is very invigorating and inspiring,” she said.
In addition to working on directives each week, the students also write a thesis, based on research with psychological perspectives. “It starts out personal and stretches out with research,” Tavolacci said.
One of the changes she made from her first and second year of teaching the course revolved around how students presented their themes. “Last year, the students discussed their themes with me in a one-on-one session if it was therapeutic for them. Now, the students email me the themes, which I find to be more successful,” Tavolacci said, explaining that the email option seems to be working much like art therapy itself. The act of organizing their emotions this way becomes “cathartic” and processed through a controlled outlet, according to Tavolacci.
Thus, face-to-face discussions in the studio from that point are easier, as the personal content is accessible and easier to process through the art making. “Sometimes initially in-person it is hard to get all your words out, so ‘to speak.’ I call this process ‘controlled extension.’ As the professor and art therapist, I need to make sure this process happens organically and allow students to share as they feel comfortable to do so.”
Midway through the semester, the Drawing, Painting and Sculpture for the Art Therapist class holds an exhibition based on the personal thesis themes. “The exhibition allows students to purge their entities before becoming an art therapist to protect clients,” Tavolacci said. This semester’s exhibition entitled, “Me, Myself, and My Dirty Laundry,” runs in the Sculpture Building from Nov. 15-21. The idea behind the theme is that students are cleaning out their dirty laundry and will display their finished work on clotheslines.
Victor D. Franco, a graduate art therapy student in the class, based his theme around the idea of growing up too fast. His work is, “centered on the ideation of ‘Premature Acceleration: Unexpected Roles and Burdens,’ ” he said. “This body of work explores personal fears that have arisen with growing up too fast, and the exploration of layers due to the belief that one self-actualizes through an onion-like ‘peeling’ process,” he added.
A reception will be held on Thursday, Nov. 17 from 6-8 p.m. and is open to the public.

Marvel does it again: another villain, another superhero. Just six months ago the Marvel Cinematic Universe dominated the box office with “Captain America: Civil War” and has managed to wow audiences once again with “Doctor Strange.”
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has become one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. From “Iron Man” to “The Avengers,” “Guardians of Galaxy,” “Ant Man” and now with “Doctor Strange,” the effect after watching them is still the same—it can’t get any better than this.
“Doctor Strange,” directed by Scott Derrickson, stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the title character. Strange is an arrogant, pompous surgeon with an ego the size of New York. He rejects many of his patients throughout the film, whom he thinks are not worth his time, and he takes advantage of his colleague and former lover Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams).
There are several scenes throughout the movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The visuals are astounding; they introduce mirror images and very colorful spaces. You will find yourself turning your head in different directions because of the trippy effects in the film.
After getting into a deadly car crash, Strange suffers permanent nerve damage in his hands and cannot continue his career as a surgeon. Having spent a multitude of research and money to identify a cure, he finds a way to Kamar-Taj, a monastery in Nepal.
While he is there he trains with the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Baron Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to take down a rogue student, Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen).
“Doctor Strange” is just as fun as any other Marvel film released so far. It introduces audiences to magical moments and time manipulation. Derrickson really took this film in a new direction. He made something that seemed impossible to actualize and successfully brought it to the big screen. The movie was dark, funny and each actor played his or her role great. It is a mind-bending film that contains a little bit of love, like the other Marvel films.
This is definitely a movie to watch at an IMAX 3D theater because of its great visuals and trippy effects. If you are not doing anything this weekend, make sure you book your appointment with “Doctor Strange.”
The film is rated PG-13 and is now playing in theaters.

After concluding conference tournament play with a 3-0 victory over Molloy College, men’s soccer came into its NCAA Division II second round battle as the no. 1 seed in the division, nationwide, after holding the second slot for the last three weeks.
The team went out and proved its top-seed, beating Merrimack College 1-0 and advancing in the knock-out stage of the tournament. The team is currently 18-0-1 on the season.
The lone goal from the Pioneer Soccer Park in Brookville, N.Y. on a calm sunny Saturday, Nov. 12, came in the 29th minute from graduate midfielder, Alex Billington. The goal came after sophomore forward Charlie Ledula aggressively got into the box for a long ball, was first to touch it and drew a foul. Billington buried the following penalty kick into the mesh.
The Pioneer defense limited the scoring opportunities for Merrimack, allowing just one shot on goal in 90 minutes, which senior goal-keeper Jesper Malmstrom turned aside.
The win advances the Pioneers to the third round of the tournament. The team faces Adelphi University on Thursday, Nov. 17, at the Pioneer Soccer Park.

One point separated the Pioneers and the Greyhounds from Assumption College in their October matchup. The Pioneers were determined this time around to assure there would be no necessary fourth quarter heroics. Indeed, they defeated the Greyhounds 43-23 in the NE-10 Conference Championship on Saturday, Nov. 13, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows for the football team as it faced adversity right out of the gate. The guests drove down the field and into the red-zone on its opening possession, but were held up at the        four-yard line and had to settle for a 21-yard field goal. After a Pioneer interception, the Greyhounds started their drive in LIU territory and, again, entered the red-zone and stalled at the four-yard line to repeat another field goal.
On the ensuing Pioneer drive, senior quarterback Jeff Kidd tossed another interception and the Greyhounds set up shop 13 yards from a touchdown. Another red-zone trip with the same result; the Greyhounds settled for three points instead of punching it in for a touchdown.
The guests led 9-0 with just over two minutes left in the first quarter.
Although it was early in the game, a key turning point was the defense standing tall and holding the Greyhounds to three field goals and no touchdowns in the first 15 minutes. “I think it was just us settling in,” said Head Coach Bryan Collins. “It’s a totally different game being down 21-0 and 9-0. It’s funny—we did spend one extra day on goal-line defense this week and so it paid off, obviously.”
Seeking a jump start, the Pioneers’ special teams made a play and redshirt sophomore running back, Malik Pierre, almost broke a kickoff back to the house, but was tackled at the LIU 45-yard line.
After a 20-yard rush by senior tailback, David White, Kidd dropped a pass into the bucket for redshirt junior receiver Kyle Ward, who scored the game’s opening touchdown. The drive took four plays and 54 seconds. Even though the team still trailed on the score-board, the score was a confidence boost for the Pioneers who seized control from that point forward.
On its first drive of the second quarter, the host got a second chance with a 15-yard personal foul penalty that kept its drive alive. The possession culminated with a touchdown to redshirt senior receiver, Shane Hubbard, who found the soft spot in the zone for six. The score not only gave the Pioneers a 13-9 lead, but also put Hubbard ahead of former Pioneer, Jim Byrne, for first on the all-time touchdown reception list in program history with 31.
A 41-yard field goal in the waning seconds of the half put the Pioneers up 16-9 at the break.
After a first half that saw the Pioneers come alive late, the home side owned the second half, outscoring the Greyhounds 27-14. The tone was set on the half’s first play. Pierre, who already had a big kickoff return to his credit, ran back the kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown, making it 23-9 in favor of the Pioneers.
Pierre wasn’t finished there; he added two more touchdowns to widen the team’s advantage and put it one step closer to becoming NE-10 champions.
And just for good measure, the Green Machine concluded its scoring onslaught with a 37-yard strike to Hubbard, who added to his historic day with another touchdown. The 43- 23 victory for the Green and Gold earned them the NE-10 Conference Champion title.
Kidd went 14-0f-27 through the air for 203 yards and three touchdowns. On the ground, the Pioneers got 100-yard games from both Pierre and White. In addition to his two touchdown receptions, Hubbard was also a security blanket for Kidd as he hauled in seven passes for 100 yards.
Defensively, sophomore linebacker, Connor Farrell, led the squad with nine tackles, one of which was for a loss. Senior defensive back Jhaleel Oswald accumulated seven tackles and was all over the field making plays. Defensive backs, Jared Chester and Joshua Flowers, each turned in great performances with Chester intercepting a pass and totaling seven tackles while Flowers made six tackles and had two pass break-ups.
Kidd, Pierre, Hubbard and Farrell were all named to the NE-10 All-Championship Team. The win solidified that the Pioneers will play in the NCAA Division II Tournament and host a game. Winston-Salem State University will be the ones visiting Brookville, N.Y., on Saturday, Nov. 19, to play the no. 2-seeded Pioneers.

Just like in their matchup in mid-October, the Pioneers took care of business against Caldwell University on Friday, Nov. 11, winning 3-0 in the opening round of the NCAA Division II Tournament in Garden City, N.Y.
The victory advanced the Pioneers to the second round for the third consecutive season, and improved the team’s record to 15-3-2 on the season.
The opening goal came from sophomore forward, Andrea Huntzinger, in the 12th minute, heading the ball past the keeper. Assisting on the tally was Julia Backman.
Backman wasn’t finished there. She was back less than 10 minutes later, this time scoring on a pass from Klara Berggren to double the lead.
The Pioneers defense was stellar, limiting the opposition to zero shots on net in the first 30 minutes, and just two in the first 45. Freshman midfielder Medina Mulic rounded out the scoring at the 65-minute mark, making it 3-0 to LIU.
Sophomore goalie, Hillevi Eklow, made five saves for the Pioneers, earning another shutout.
Women’s soccer returned to the pitch on Sunday, Nov. 13, against top-seeded Adelphi University in the second round of the tournament, and suffered a 2-1 loss.
The match, played on Adelphi soil, saw its first goal in the 21st minute from Jeanine Nunez for the hosts. Less than ten minutes later, Laura Gomez put Adelphi up two goals with a shot from the left side, which also found the mesh.
At the break, the team trailed 2-0 and was outshot by one. Although the second half saw the shot margin grow larger in favor of the hosts, the Pioneers did manage to cut the lead in half on a goal from Huntzinger in the 71st minute. Even though the team rallied late, it was not enough as Adelphi held on for the win in the knockout stage of the NCAA tournament.
For the season, the Pioneers finished 15- 4-2. The team will look to continue its success next fall.

The equestrian team ended its fall season on a high at home ground on Sunday, Nov. 13. Comfortably looking down at its competitors from its saddle atop in the regional rankings, the team leads by over 50 points ahead of runners-up from Stony Brook.
If holding the position following the remaining 2-3 shows in the spring, the team will qualify for zones competition. Eight individual riders have already qualified for regionals. But the team wants more.
“Maintaining number one in the region next semester is our plan,” said Heather Grova, one of the team captains. “We are hoping to qualify as a team for regionals and then zones. It would be great if we could make it to nationals. As long as we keep up our hard work, anything is possible.”
Jessica Sulkers, co-captain with Grova and Alexis Rand, weighed in. “The ultimate goal would be nationals, however… we don’t want to get too ahead of ourselves. It’s all about focusing on the moment, visualizing the steps that are necessary for success and blocking out the possibilities of failure and keeping positive.”
Many Pioneer riders snatched first spots in their respective classes and divisions. Mallory Slack and Grace Tice tied for high point rider and both won their classes— Slack in intermediate fences and flat events, Tice in open fences and flat.
“I think that the increase in amount of lessons we can take really has put this team in a better position for success,” Rand said. “With more practices coach Brooke and Nicole can focus on fixing the little details that add up when we are being judged in the show ring.”
Regional Stands as of Nov. 6:
1. LIU Post 272          Columbia- 107
2. Stonybrook 221          Adelphi- 88
3. NYU 174                      Hofstra- 62
4. St.Joseph’s- 163            Molloy- 57
5. Suffolk CC- 162         Princeton- 49
