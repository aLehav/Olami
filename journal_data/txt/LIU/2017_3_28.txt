For the past several years, the Department of Communications and Film (formerly known as the Department of Media Arts) has hosted the “Best of High School Journalism Awards,” celebrating the hard work of the finest high school journalists. On Friday, March 24, students and teachers from 21 high schools in Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Brooklyn, and New Jersey attended the annual awards ceremony. Coordinated by professors and students in the Department of Communications and Film, high school students ranging from grades 9 through 12 engaged in interactive media workshops in the Pioneer newsroom, PTV television studio, and WCWP radio station, as well as a Public Relations workshop in Humanities 119, followed by a luncheon and awards presentation.
In the Pioneer newsroom workshop led by Carolyn Levin, director of the LIU Post journalism program and advisor to The Pioneer, high school students discussed and debated the topic of “fake news.” They evaluated a story in the New York Post about an alleged “missing pregnant tarantula” on the loose in Brooklyn, and identified the steps where the reporters went wrong. “The fact that fake news really serves as a threat was eye opening,” Samuel Valentin, a sophomore at New Hyde Park Memorial High School, said.
Levin stressed to the students that it is not only important to be wary of false information or sources from a journalist’s standpoint, but also as a consumer of news. “Have a healthy skepticism,” Levin said. “Don’t believe everything you read.”
Students were also given an inside scoop on reporting on a college campus from members of the Pioneer Editorial Board. “All of our reporting ties back to the campus,” Caroline Ryan, junior journalism major, and Pioneer Editor-in-Chief, said. Pioneer articles are filled with student, teacher, and administrator quotes, opinions, and pictures to connect with the LIU community.
Many high school publications cater to a broader range of topics and publish either monthly or quarterly, so it came as a surprise to some students that the Pioneer published solely campus news and events on a weekly basis. “It is so interesting to see how journalism works at the college level,” Samantha Stern, a Hewlett High School senior, said.
The PTV television studio workshop led by Benjamin Gerdes, assistant professor of broadcasting, and assisted by senior broadcasting majors Grace Oshin and Brittany Mitchell, focused on interviewing skills and other aspects of broadcast journalism, such as what to do when given a short answer.
Students chimed in with solutions of, “ask to elaborate,” “squeeze as much information out as possible” and “break the ice.” Gerdes then asked the students to pair up with someone they did not know to roleplay an interview. The interviewer asked a broad question to get the interviewee to talk, and was then instructed to follow up with a direct question. “That’s how you get the dirt,” Gerdes said.
Many students expressed the desire to be a live news reporter, and to go out and find stories on the streets. “It’s inspiring to see these [high school] students so passionate about journalism and media,” Mitchell said.
Tuning in to the WCWP radio station workshop led by Dan Cox, the director of the campus radio station, students learned the major differences between radio and print journalism.
Both fields include writing, yet print journalism is at liberty to write in full narrative, whereas radio scripts must be limited with straight facts and the occasional soundbites. “You get five minutes to tell nine news stories,” Cox said. “News should be objective, but that is impossible to achieve,” Cox said. Everyone has an inner bias, and in most print news, a narrative accompanies the facts.
To start the awards presentation, keynote speaker Angela Susan Anton, the publisher and editor of the Anton Media Group, reminded students of the challenges facing journalists in the years to come. She also reminded the students how they had to prevail against the fake and biased news today. “There is now, more than ever, a need for true journalism,” Anton said.
The 2017 Best of High School Journalism Awards recognized the best in high school journalism written and published between Jan. 1, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2016.
A record number of student entries were considered this year by a panel of professional judges. Judging was based on overall excellence, including accuracy, adherence to journalistic standards, clarity, and creative use of the medium.
The awards were presented by the editors of the Pioneer and the Bottom Line. For best commentary/editorial, presented by Grace Oshin, Editor-in-Chief of The Bottom Line magazine, first place went to Christine Seo and Nicole Rosenthal from Half Hollow Hills High School West, for their collaborative piece on “Doorways to Community (and Controversy).”
Rosenthal, who attended the summer journalism institute at LIU Post last summer and has written a freelancer for the Pioneer during her senior year in high school, intends to follow a career in either investigative or music journalism. Her goal is to some day work for Pitchfork,an online music review site.
For the category of Best Sports Story, presented by senior journalism major and Pioneer Sports Editor, Shelby Townsend, first place went to Marlie Allen and Megan Konfino from Commack High School, for their piece, “It’s Not the Hype, It’s the Hoop.” A richly reported recounting of the Commack girls basketball team’s championship that did more than just describe what they accomplished, but also gave insight to how they did it.
The popular category of best feature story had several ties out of the record breaking 68 entries received. Presented by junior broadcasting major, journalism minor, and Pioneer Features Editor, Kristina Huderski, first place went to Aamna Arshad from Midwood High School in Brooklyn, for the story, “Taking Notes, Not Pictures, Leads to Lasting Knowledge,” an interesting topic with good research and a great use of student and teacher quotes.
In the category for best news story, presented by senior dance major, journalism minor, and Pioneer News Editor, Nicole Curcio, first place went to Zack Abrams and James Oldham from Commack High School on their collaborative piece, “Zika: The International Crisis.” The judges said, about Abrams and Oldham’s story, “This story on the zika virus sets itself apart from other entries through its solid attributions to scientific statements, fine use of local resourcing, clear writing, strongly worded lead and comprehensiveness.”
The Best Online Publication awards were presented by junior journalism major, and Pioneer Online Editor Marissa Hoffmann and the Pioneer’s former Editor-in-Chief Maxime Devillaz. Two online high school newspapers were awarded first place,The Red & Black of Patchogue-Medford High School and The JerEcho of Jericho High School. The Red & Black, in its first year online since its inception in 1928, “has created an engaging, dynamic online newspaper for the students and community – a compelling, professional news source for their school,” the judges said. The JerEcho, winning first place in the category for a second year in a row, once again, impressed the judge. “Hard- hitting news reporting on school, local and world news, professional quality photographs, weekly polls and more, earned The JerEcho this award for an exemplary online news site,” the judges wrote.
The entries in the Best of High School Newspaper category this year were extraordinary. Presented by the Pioneer Co-Editors-in-Chief Caroline Ryan, a junior journalism major, and Thomas Gillen, a senior journalism major, first place prizes were awarded to Hewlett Spectrum of George W. Hewlett High School and Horizon of Lynbrook High School.
After the presentation of the awards, many of the high school students expressed their enjoyment. “I think it’s great how many aspects of journalism are being shown to us; it’s a very well- rounded experience,” Rosenthal, a senior at Half Hollow Hills High School West, and an award recipient, said.
“It’s really a great experience for the students,” Michael Howley, a journalism teacher at Oceanside High School, said. “Not only for the awards, but the engaging presentations about finding truth in today’s media.”

As the Facilities Department prepares for the departure of its long time director, William Kirker, a transition period is inevitable. Because the department oversees all campus contracting, plumbing, electric, building repairs, gardening, cleaning, and painting, the position necessitates a determined individual, prepared to fill big shoes.
According to Kirker, a transition process for a possible replacement will be taking place over the next two months. Kirker’s 22 years will be coming to a close once the class of 2017 crosses the stage, leaving a short amount of time for a replacement to learn the tricks and trades.
As for the rest of the department “no immediate changes will be made,” Kirker said. However, “when there is a change of director in a department, there is opportunity for things to get reevaluated,” he added. There are no current plans for personnel changes within the department.
Change in the department did occur, though, in September 2016. The positions of grounds and custodial workers, which are usually the workers students see the most often, were outsourced. The workers, now wearing blue shirts instead of green, are part of A&A Maintenance, a custodial company based out of Yonkers, NY. Though they are not wearing green LIU uniforms as the plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and mechanical traders do, they are still overseen by Kirker through their contractor. However, their paychecks and benefits do not come from LIU. Additional outsourcing plans are unknown at this time.
For those Facilities Department employees who still work for the university, Kirker is confident about a smooth transition. “All the guys and ladies have been here for at least 10 years; they all know what to do,” he said. Beth Fungfeld, a secretary in the department, is saddened by Kirker’s departure and curious as to what the future will bring. “We are all heartbroken that he is leaving,” she said.
“What makes it tough is we’ve been together for a long time,” Kirker said. He jokingly said he would like to think that no one could do what he does, but he does not believe in that mentality. “Everyone is replaceable. As soon as you forget that, there will most likely be someone taking your place.”

At this year’s annual Honors Conference, the Honors College will be presenting the thesis work of its students on Friday, March 31 from 9 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. The conference will be open to the public and is mandatory for all 227 students in the honors program.
The Honors Conference has been held on and off since 2004 and “is a simulated professional conference that teaches students how to attend an actual academic conference,” Dr. Joan Digby, director of the Honors College, said. “They will have to learn how to make choices among programs and learn how to pay attention. We engage students with interesting subject matter by students and faculty members.”
One of the 18 presentations at this year’s conference will be the showcasing of six student theses by film majors and film program alumni. Those students include Honors College alumni Juliana Hobbs, Tore Hynnekleiv, and Melanie Coffey and current film majors Lucas Riou; Brittany Ramjattan; and Justin Shultz. The only films that are completed are Hobbs’ documentary on “White Nose Bat Syndrome” and Hynnekleiv’s film, “Mom.”
Coffey’s short film “The Left Light Bias,” is “about an art thief who tries to persuade an artist to let her steal his painting at an art gallery opening,” she said. “The idea was to explore what makes a painting important, is it the actual paint on canvas or the amount of money it’s worth, so both characters take a side and debate.” Coffey began researching the topic and writing the script in the spring of 2016 and recently viewed the film in its entirety after editing the film since November.
Besides the showing of the student films, the conference will include a book discussion by Dr. Margaret Hallissy, a professor in the English department, poetry readings by Honors College students Paola Guzman, Ilana Leviton, Adela Ramos, and Randall Taylor, and a poster session, where art majors in the Honors College will show off their theses in the Tilles Center Atrium.
The conference will “introduce students to faculty they may want to study with and to the electives available to them next year,” Digby said. There will be presentations by several faculty members, including Pirating the Past by Dr. Benjamin Gerdes, an assistant professor in the department of communications and film. The presentation delves into the cultural history of piracy and how the element of pirating relates to today’s issues regarding intellectual property and Internet piracy. “Teaching in the Honors College offers teachers an opportunity to teach different courses that are outside-the-box,” Gerdes said. Other presentations include Re-riding History: A Motorcycle Tour of Peru’s Indigenous Heartland by Dr. Willie Hiatt, an associate professor in the history department, and The Horse, My Muse by Digby.
The Honors Conference will take place in several locations on campus, including the Tilles Center, Hillwood Commons, and the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library and is open to the public.

A celebration of sorts took place the evening of March 22 in the End Zone. The Coalition for Conservation club sponsored an event in recognition of World Water Day.
The event, hosted by club president, freshman geology and environmental sustainability major, Erica Ferrara, was an opportunity for students to learn to look at water from a different perspective. The event kicked off with a lively welcome from Ferrara and introduction of guest speaker Peter Maniscalco, a conservation activist. Ferrara presented a detailed PowerPoint containing facts about water and its necessity to human life. Afterwards, Maniscalco led the audience of about 30 students in a traditional water ceremony.
Ferrara’s presentation contained a variety of eye-opening statistics about how much water people use compared to how much is necessary to use. It also explained how people in other parts of the world are forced to deal with the near absence of this essential element which maintains life. “It’s actually very striking and a little sad that 3 billion people in the whole world don’t actually have access to clean water,” Ferrara said. “We never think about what clean water is to us.” Some people have to walk miles simply to fetch water to replenish their village’s supply. Nearly 40 percent of the water we waste on a regular basis results from something as seemingly insignificant as flushing the toilet. While showing a map illustrating how much of Long Island’s water supply is susceptible to contamination, Ferrara stated, “Water issues are not only global issues; they’re local ones as well.”
Ferrara explained how many cultures appreciate and respect water because of how it is such a vital part of our lives. Maniscalco then shared his own life experiences and the importance water holds to him. Being a conservation activist for over 40 years, Maniscalco has worked on numerous projects and accomplished many things in favor of the environment such as coordinating the “Stop Shoreham” campaign. He was part of “the only people in the world to stop a completed nuclear power plant from opening.” He also taught college students on Long Island about “spirituality of the environment” for seven years, showing them “a different part of themselves that is not taught in our collegiate system.”
After his lively recount of his life as an activist, he led the group in a water ceremony to close the night. Maniscalco briefly sang a song of appreciation to the pitcher of water on the table followed by Ferrara pouring each person a small cup, while Maniscalco instructed everyone to honor and give thanks to the water in a way they personally saw fit before drinking together.
The ceremony was intended to get participants to “think and feel in new ways,” Maniscalco said. Ferrara, who hopes to affect her community by finding solutions to environmental issues, is currently interning at a solar energy company.
Attendees enjoyed the Water Day celebration experience. Marianna Scalise, a Post alumna works for Citizens Campaign for the Environment, a nonprofit organization in Farmingdale. “Our issue right now is about drinking water on Long Island, so that’s why it really impacted me,” she said. “I really loved him saying to love the water and respect it; a lot of people don’t really think that’s important anymore.”

The yearly Pratt After Dark event was held on Thursday, March 23 at Pratt Recreational Center from 10 p.m to 1 a.m. The theme this year was black light dance party. Students were given glow sticks to put around their necks and heads. There were plenty of things to do at this event, including a hamster roll, where students in hamster balls raced one another on a blow up track. There was also mini golf, Ping-Pong, photo booth, Pac-man, cotton candy machine, fuse ball and shuffle board.
Matthew Blanar, the assistant director of campus life, for his first year projects that around 800 to 1,000 students attended. “Surprisingly we get a lot of commuter students, but mostly kids on campus show up,” Blanar said about the large crowd.
This will be Blanar’s second time running Pratt After Dark. Although the event was free for students, donations were taken. The money raised goes to Relay for Life. The event is not a fundraiser, Blanar said, “but to get students out and have little bit of fun after dark.”
The big difference this year was the water pong tournament, senior physiology major and President of Student Activities Board Gabby Sharp, said. “The tournament is to raise money for relay for life, which is the main difference from this year to previous years,” Sharp said. Even though Pratt After Dark isn’t a fundraiser, the Student Activity Board thought it would be a fun way to raise money. They received 20 sign ups for the water pong tournament, which are two people a team and a $6 entry fee per team.
In her first year as President of Student Activities Board, Sharp’s job was to pick the games and activities for the event.
“My team and I have been coming for the last two years and we all have a great time,” Bella Fuduli, a sophomore nutrition health and wellness fitness major, said. “It is nice to have something on campus like this, I think they should do more events for us; students like it.”
Fuduli and her teammates agreed that the blow-up hamster roll was the most fun event. “If you haven’t come to a Pratt After Dark, you should,” Fuduli said. “It is free and a fun time.”

After the March announcement that DNCE, a popular American funk and dance rock band, would perform at this year’s spring concert, students were abuzz with both excitement and disappointment. As many students as there are on campus, there are equally as many differing tastes in music.
While DNCE performing this year may be the best thing to happen to one student, it could also be the worst for another. Yet, a recent student opinion poll of about 30 students conducted by the Pioneer shows a moderate approval rating of 16 percent, with 6 percent disapproving and 8 percent indifferent.
The show will take place on Thursday, April 13 at 8 p.m. in the Tilles Center. Tickets, which are on sale now at $15 for LIU students (LIU I.D. required), and $30 for faculty, staff, or alumni, can be purchased at the Tilles Center box office, or www.ticketmaster.com.
“It’s great that Post is inviting famous groups or individuals [to perform] because it attracts a lot of students. I’m definitely going!” – Andrea Giron, a freshman education major.
“I’m excited for the concert, and I think a lot of students are going to go. [Looking forward to] Toothbrush! When I first heard that song, I was addicted.” – Dondre Lemon, a sophomore journalism major.
“I love the Jonas Brothers, so having Joe here is pretty cool.” – Robyn Beeber, a freshman elementary education major.
“I think it’s awesome! I don’t really care, seeing that I don’t really listen to them that much, but I think that it’s really cool to have such a popular band come to Post.” – William Pope, a freshman musical theater major.
“Who’s DNCE? I would prefer seeing someone like Tory Lanez.” – Brendey James, a freshman health science major.
“I’m not that familiar with DNCE. I feel like we should have a say on who performs for us.” – Matthew Burney, a senior musical theater major.

Abeetza Pizzeria, located just around the corner on Glen Cove Road, is a popular destination for Post students. Abeetza makes everything sold fresh, from scratch. Owner Joseph DeLorenzo, a Post alumnus, emphasizes that nothing is ordered from vendors. “The only product we sell that we do not make are the drinks in the refrigerators.”
Aside from pizza, Abeetza has a large variety on its menu. Options range from salads, chicken and fish entrees, paninis, heros and pasta. “If you are looking for a healthier option, we have fresh cut zucchini noodles as a substitute,” DeLorenzo said. Fresh black linguine is also made on site. “Other pizzerias and even restaurants don’t offer that,” DeLorenzo said. In addition, gluten-free penne pasta is available.
For those interested in high protein meals, fish and chicken dishes are available with a choice of vegetables or pasta. Twelve salad dishes are found on the menu, but can be modified to preference.
A 10 percent discount is given to all students who present their school ID when purchasing food on-site. Jennifer O’Neill, a senior dance major, likes to think of herself as Abeetza’s biggest fan. She has ordered a variety of the menu options. “The salads are great,” she said. “I highly recommend the pasta slices.” O’Neill visits Abeetza so often that the staff recognizes her.
Sophomore musical theatre major Katherine Keaney has only visited Abeetza once but found the        home-style pizza to be a nice option, compared to other pizza places. “They are college-student friendly with their prices and in the restaurant,” Keaney said. “For the buck, their portions are large.” Olivia Lodge, a senior musical theatre major has had great experiences with their campus delivery. “They’ve delivered straight to my door, literally! Knocked and everything,” Lodge said.
Abeetza serves and delivers from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day except Sunday, when they close at 9 p.m. Specials are updated daily, including pasta, fish, and chicken dishes. Catering is available for large outside parties taking place in any location. Orders can be placed at 516-484-3123 or at 82 Glen Cove Road in Greenvale (Greenvale Plaza).
Editor’s Note: The Pioneer has a business relationship with Abeetza, which provides pizza for weekly staff meetings.

Editors Note: The Pioneer learned after the publication of this story in last week’s issue that one of our sources had provided information to us that was not accurate. We have contacted the former university historian, Kenneth Mensing, who wrote and he has corrected those inaccuracies. The Pioneer apologizes to our readers. We always strive for accuracy in all of our work. Following is the correct version of “Landmark of the Week: The Mansion”.
The mansion is where it all started. Built from 1922 to 1929, the mansion has quite a rich history. For many years, it belonged to Marjorie Merriweather Post, daughter of Charles William Post of Post cereals. Kenneth Mensing, LIU Post’s former university historian, wrote a book titled “Hillwood: The Long Island Estate of Marjorie Merriweather Post.” Mensing contributed his research of over 20 years to the Pioneer.
Celebrities and royal families have walked through the mansion. Cars would enter through big red brick gates, located right across from Kumble Hall and the library. They would pass what is now Kumble Hall and drive up to a circular driveway. Stepping out of what would have been ostentatious cars of the 1920s, the guests would enter through the main entrance, which is now an entrance facing Roth Hall.

Every part of the mansion was built on-site. Instead of importing parts from around the world, the mansion was built entirely from scratch by Charles Mansfield Hart, an architect from Freeport, NY. Not many changes to the building have been made since then. Some of the woodwork, floorboards, doorknobs and windows remain from when the house was built. The mansion still has the majority of the original bricks made in a town called Post, Texas. founded by C.W. Post. Restoration of the mansion was possible due to Gary Winnick’s donations to restore the mansion from 2005 to 2008. Only a few individual bricks were moved from the Lower East Side to the mansion later from burnt tenement house buildings.
After entering the main entrance, guests were escorted to the living room, which is now the Great Hall. Unlike most mansions of the 1920s, this mansion’s living room was too small to be considered a ballroom for extravagant parties. It was a quiet place for Post to live in for about six months out of the year. Post used the mansion for charity parties, her daughter Dina Merrill’s wedding day, and after-parties.
In architectural terms, the Great Hall is faithful to a traditional great hall in England. Throughout the room there is imagery of ships, wild animals and hunting motifs carved into the woodwork. Marjorie’s second husband, E.F. Hutton, was a great sportsman. And when he decorated the room, he did so to reflect his tastes. They had large paintings of hunting scenes and animal heads on the wall. Above the piano there was a gigantic model of a ship called an English gallon that lit up. On either side of the Great Hall, there are two portraits, one of Marjorie Post, and the other of C.W. Post. Marjorie is was very fond of the portraits and she wanted to give a tribute to her father.
The andirons, metal supports that hold wood for a fireplace, standing in front of the replace in the Great Hall are original antiques from the house. The long table in the entryway was also acquired by the Post family and was used in their library. The large glass windows on either side of the replace boast the ancestral crests of Hutton and Post on the top, and commemorative lead glass added by the university, in the middle.
Moving into the hallway, leading to what is now a lobby connecting to the office of Alumni Relations and a staircase leading to the Philosophy Department, the wall and ceiling material change. The ceiling features plaster carvings that took about three months to make.
Walking further into the lobby, there is the “American bedroom,” which now houses the office of Alumni Relations. This room was used as a guest bedroom, and was occupied by famous names like Billie Burke and Florenz Ziegfeld. The wallpaper was hand-picked by Post, and hand-painted in the 18th century depicting George Washington’s inauguration.
Within that room is another room that used to be the guest bathroom. Different from the rest of the house’s extravagant walls, this particular wall in what used to be the guest bathroom is decorated with actual Christmas postcards sent to the Post family.
The staircase leading up the Philosophy Department and Honors College portrays detailed carvings of a hunting scene throughout the entire outside of the staircase. Its sharp details include animals and leaves of trees. The ceiling also features plaster carvings of flowers and garden imagery.
Dina Merrill’s bedroom and the nursery existed where the philosophy department is currently located. What is now the philosophy conference room used to be a sleeping porch/playroom for Post’s children. Across the hall, what is now the honors college classroom, was Hutton’s bedroom. Marjorie took the original pine wood and replace with her after she sold the estate. Hutton’s room connected to a dressing room which is now the honors computer lounge. And that connected to a sleeping porch which is now the office of Joan Digby, Director of the Honors College. That all eventually connected to Marjorie’s bedroom, which is now the honors lounge. The colors of the walls are the exact same colors used when Marjorie occupied the bedroom. In the far end of the bedroom is a door that leads to what used to be Post’s bathroom, featuring marble walls different from the rest of the house, which used to have fixtures made of gold. This is now an extension of the honors college offices.
What is now the English department, used to be the staff’s wing of the mansion. “She had maids that would make her maid’s bed because her maids were busy,” Mensing said. This renders a portrayal of Post’s generosity and personality. According to Mensing, Post said, “If I didn’t have my staff, I couldn’t live my life the way I do.”
After the sale of the property to LIU, Marjorie would come up to the campus and “almost cry because she was so happy to see all of you [the students] there learning.”

Meet Spoonky, senior graphic design major Leslie Tincopaonetto’s dog. Spoonky is a 10-year-old dachshund/wiener mix. When Tincopaonetto was 11, she got Spoonky on her trip to Peru in 2006.
“When I get home from work or school, he is always waiting by the door running back and forth ready to play. He brightens my day.” Tincopaonetto said. She and her dog love to cuddle after a long day of work or school, and go out for walks around the neighborhood or to Seacli Beach.

With little over a month left in the spring semester, many students are overwhelmed with schoolwork and deadlines. Students are trying to do well in their classes and still have time for themselves. Whether it is going out with friends, getting a manicure, exercising at the gym or enjoying a sport, many students struggle with finding the time for their social lives.
Time management is key when it comes to balancing not just school, but your life in general. Planning
ahead is always practical because you are able to schedule time for activities that you enjoy. Once you get schoolwork out of the way, you are able to relax and have some “you” time. Time management can also help students get the sleep that they need in order to be energized for morning classes. Personally, I never get enough sleep because my time management is always off. Not getting enough sleep affects my ability in class the next day and also causes me to knock out early on the weekends, when I would have the time to enjoy myself.
Sarah Meehan, a junior early childhood education major who is also on the dance team, tries to balance school, dance, and her social life. With the dance team starting their nationals season, practices are becoming harder and longer, leaving her with less time. For Meehan, time management is very important. “You have to be aware of the time that you have and that you don’t have. I’m the type of person that likes to get things done before I focus on the next thing I have to do,” she said. Meehan makes sure she gets her work done before any of her other activities so that she can focus and have fun. “It makes me feel good at practice knowing I got my work done and am now able to get some sleep when I’m done.”
Many students achieve the proper balance with the help of a planner. Rebecca Torres, a junior arts
management major, uses her planner religiously. “My planner is my friend and keeps me on top of everything, both my school life and social life. Anytime something important comes up, it immediately goes on it, whether it’s a double date with friends or the date for my next English test,” Torres said. Having a planner, both physically and on your phone, helps with time management because you are able to visually see everything that you have to do. Setting reminders on your phone help you remember events and homework that you may have forgotten about.
Even though school should be a priority, especially at the end of the semester, you should always leave time for yourself. “I always try to put school first, but at the end of the day, we need time away from school and going out with friends is a stress reliever,” Torres said. If students pace themselves and don’t procrastinate, they can still go out and enjoy activities that they love. Nothing feels better than going out and enjoying yourself knowing that all of your school work is done.

Immediately after clicking play on Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar’s new single, “The Heart Part 4” the listener is greeted with the ominous sound of crows chirping and ying away in a flock – just as they would do after an executioner handles his business and puts someone away. This is a very interesting foreshadow, considering Lamar (born Kendrick Duckworth) attempts to silence and dismiss any rapper that tries to take his top spot on his hip-hop throne. After the unorthodox intro, Kendrick Lamar does what he does best, which is rap and tell his feelings with a delivery and flow that is tough to match by any other popular rapper today.
Kendrick seized an opportunity with this single, as the timing of the release comes shortly after Drake’s tremendously successful project “More Life.” After staying under the radar for quite some time, Lamar comes out with a vengeance on this single, scaring fellow rappers while raising their eyebrows at the same time. Even his competitors and peers understand how much of a talent Lamar is. Lamar addresses his prominence in the music industry, rapping “The five foot giant woke up out of his sleep.” As with most musicians that have a platform that reaches a wide audience, Lamar didn’t hold back on his criticism of president Donald Trump, and the involvement of the Russians in the election. “Donald Trump is a chump / know how we feel punk. Tell ‘em that God coming. And Russia need a replay button y’all up to something. Electoral votes look like memorial votes / but America’s truth ain’t ignoring the votes. In addition to getting his feelings out about the state of the nation, Lamar also took time to throw shout out to NBA player Russel Westbrook. So much happened in this sub five minute track, but perhaps Lamar saved the best for the very end, teasing the imminent release of his album on Apr. 7.
“The Heart Part 4” makes a few things clear. Don’t forget about Kendrick Lamar, this will prove to be a mistake if other rappers do so in the future. There is a reason Dr. Dre signed him to a record deal, as he did with Eminem. Lamar’s next album can’t come soon enough. Here’s hoping he sticks to that April date.

Drake fan or Drake critic, one cannot deny that the three time Grammy recipient’s following and popularity rank alongside some of the greatest musicians of all-time. Don’t believe me? For starters, check Spotify’s analytics department. According to Spotify, Drake is the first artist in Spotify’s history to reach 10 billion song streams. These numbers do not include any data derived from Drake’s latest piece, “More Life,” which first debuted on OVO sound radio, and then Apple Music on Saturday, March 18.
More Life is not an album, according to OVO Sound Radio Team, a record label founded by Drake and    long-time friends and partners Noah “40” Shebib and Oliver El-Khatib.
The album is simply the bridge between two major pieces, the first piece being Grammy nominated “Views,” released in April 2016.
The 22 song playlist showcases features from Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Young Thug, Quavo, Travis Scott, Lil Wayne, Giggs, Skepta, Sampha, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Jorja Smith, Hiatus Kaiyote, and Black Coffee. According to a report on CNBC on March, 21, “More Life” was streamed 89.9 million times within 24 hours after its release, an all-time record for streaming by a musical artist.
Despite breaking records, “More Life” has not drawn great reviews from Drake’s core group of millennial supporters. “He’s trying to take Jamaican slang approach to his music, and I don’t think that style works for him at all,” junior broadcasting Major Rakwan Hedgemond said. The harsh takes on Drake’s ‘More Life’ didn’t stop there, Senior Nutrition major Nino Tiburzi, was critical of Drake’s new approach to his music. “Look, I’m fine with Drake trying new things; in fact, I encourage it, but I think Drake’s lyrical credibility took a hit on this album.” Tiburzi explained his stance on Drake’s lyrical content. “Take Care, Nothing Was The Same, and Thank Me Later spoke were albums where Drake spoke directly to his audience whether it be about past hardships, relationships, fame, etc. Outside of a few songs, this album does none of that,” Tiburzi said.
Tiburzi’s point is not to be taken lightly. Drake has certainly evolved from his early rap career. Once a scrappy, younger rapper, with clever word-play and an uncanny ability to connect with his audience; Drake has received criticism from, fans, tabloids, and other artists alike for allegedly straying away from his roots as an artist. Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill feuded with Drake two years ago, accusing him of using a ‘ghostwriter’ by the name of Quentin Miller. While some would argue that Drake won the feud with Meek Mill by way of a diss-track titled ‘Back to Back’, there was clearly a crack in the damn when it came to Drake’s lyrical credibility. Jersey-born artist Joe Budden has feuded with Drake for similar reasons, claiming that drake had been guilty of posing to be someone he’s not. “Everything about Drake’s behavior is lame,” Budden said in an interview last summer with Power 105.1 Radio Host, Charlamagne.
Regardless of whether you like the playlist or not, there are still fragments of the Drake that once was. “‘Teenage Fever” is reminiscent of Drake’s “Take Care” days. However, this song makes references towards Drake’s encounters with Jennifer Lopez, even using her chorus from “If You Had My Love” as the sample. ‘Do Not Disturb’, ‘Lose You’, as well as ‘4422’ are some of Drake’s premier songs featured on the playlist.
Given that this playlist is a ‘bridge-piece’, I personally, will not put too much stock playlist being a sign of things to come. For example, perhaps this Drake simply trying something ‘new’, a new style in which he can learn to refine into a style that better reaches his audience ears and hearts. However, if I am being honest, I would like to see the ‘Old Drake’ come back with one last vintage-hit album which can rival his ‘Take Care’ album in terms of caliber of content, in terms of both lyrics, melody and features.

Brought to the Great Hall of Winnick Mansion from the studio of professor AeRee Kim, the LIU Department of Music presented the graduate piano recital of Xiaoyao Che on Thursday, March 23. Over 30 guests filled the hall at 8 p.m., friends, family, and professors of Che, to support and witness her mystifying skills on the piano.
The recital began with “Sonata in D Major, K. 491 & 492,” written by Italian composer, Domenico Scarlatti. The lively and energetic scales accompanying the two sonatas and the clear expression of emotion through Che’s concentration captured the audience. It was a stunning opening piece that had the audience eager for more.
Che ventured through the carefree and “joyous composition” of “Sonata in A Major, D. 664,” by Austrian composer Franz Schubert in allegro moderato, andante, and then allegro. Che’s fingers danced across the keys of the piano, showing off her expertise.
“It takes a lot of hard work and discipline to do what she does,” Harris Becker, Che’s classical guitar professor, said.
Che then descended upon the playful and spritely prelude for “Harp” as well as the shorter, dissonant – yet pleasant – and bright melodies of “Visions Fugitives,” a series of individual pieces, “Lentamente,” “Animato,” “Molto Giocoso” and “Ridicolosamente” by Russian composer, Sergei Prokofiev. Che’s vigorous concentration, along with the whimsical musical vignettes within the series, took over her body as she moved with the music in an intense display of feeling and depth.
The recital ended with “Ballade, Op. 10, No. 1 in D minor” and “Rhapsody in G minor, Op. 79, No. 2” by German composer, Johannes Brahms, which “evoked the sense of a mythological past” with it’s open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies.
Che was met with a standing ovation at the end. She cheered, “Finally, I finished this recital!” She was then immediately flocked by friends and family and buried in various bouquets, including a stalk of broccoli and two cucumbers – an inside joke with her friends.
“It was a very good performance,” Kweon Jung, a sophomore biology major and friend of Che’s, said.
Overwhelmed with excitement, Che could not find the words to express her happiness, and continually thanked everyone for attending.
Che, born and raised in Zhuhai, China, began to learn piano and singing at 12-years-old. She received her bachelor’s degree in music education at Xinghai Music Conservatory in Guangzhou, China, in 2012, where she majored in piano and minored in vocals and double-keyboard. In the fall of 2014, she came to LIU Post to begin her graduate studies, pursuing a master of arts degree in music performance. Che studied both piano and classical guitar, and has grown exponentially in her skills.
AeRee Kim, Che’s piano professor for two years, expressed her happiness with Che’s growth and development. “We are always trying to improve her skills and build her repertoire,” she said. “She put her entire heart and soul into this performance, and I am happy with the results.”

Sophomore music education major David Elyaho was the man of the hour on Friday evening, Mar. 24, as he performed several pieces on both the violin and viola for a very supportive crowd of professors, family and friends. Elyaho looked relaxed – but focused – during his performance. He seemed to get lost in the music, which was evident in the effortless flow of his performances. One piece after another, Elyaho demonstrated his mastery of two orchestral instruments. Elyaho played a few lengthy pieces but kept the audience engaged throughout the night, each piece ended with roaring cheers and applause from his supporters.
If Elayho made any mistakes throughout his performance, they went unnoticed by the audience. The notes the violin and viola created through Elyaho’s bow floated effortlessly over the piano accompaniment. Several times throughout the hour-long performance, the piece seemed to be nearing its completion, only to pick back up again and maintain a fast tempo, until the actual ending.
Elyaho finished most pieces by increasing the tempo, only to slow down once more to end the piece with a brief pause, followed by two thunderous strokes of the bow which signaled the finale.
To the unexperienced listener, the difference between the viola and the violin may seem minute. For Elyaho, it did not matter which wind instrument he was playing. His mastery was on display despite the instrument he held in his hand.
Elyaho prepared for this performance over the course of two months. He believes this performance went well. “In every performance there is always room for improvement, but I think it was a great experience and will serve to be [very beneficial] in my musical development,” Elyaho said. Elyaho said the support of his family and friends and the music department “really pushes me to be my best.”
Freshman music education major and friend of Elyaho, Brandon Allen, plays with him in both the orchestra and string ensembles. “I always hear him practicing,” Allen said. “He’s so dedicated to his work; it’s so great,” he said. Allen was surprised to see a pianist play alongside Elyaho, which according to Allen, “blended it all together.”
Allen said of his friend, “Sometimes people think when you’re talented, you’re also conceited,” Yet, Elyaho “is so nice and willing to help everyone. It makes the experience so much better.”

The LIU Post Baseball team won two of their games against St. Thomas Aquinas College over the weekend in Yaphank, NY, but stumbled in their second double-header against the Spartans. This was their first conference opponent of the season. The Pioneers have had to travel to Baseball Heaven in Yaphank for their last six games that were originally scheduled to be played at the LIU Post Baseball Field because of the recent weather’s affect on their home field.
The Pioneers won the first double header against the Spartans on March 24, 6-3 and 15-7. They returned to Yaphank again on March 26 for the second and final doubleheader of the series, losing to the Spartans 0-2 and 7-2. The two wins Friday broke a four game losing streak. They now hold an overall record 10-10 and a conference record of 2-2.
“It feels great to be back on track, especially seeing the bats heat up after a rough week,” said Anthony Vaglica after the first two games. “There seemed to be more of a focus and we scored early on in the games which helped.”
Sophomore in fielder Jimmy Mendyck, whose RBI double brought the Pioneers in the lead for good during the opener, said that their offense needed to be was more aggressive at the plate. “We knew were were better than what we showed at the previous three games,” Mendyck said, referring to their previous losses against Adelphi and Le Moyne. “Our lineup slumped for a few games, but that happens in baseball.”
Junior outfielder Rob Andreoli collected two home runs in the double header, a solo homer in the opener and a two run homer in the nightcap. Vaglica and senior catcher Thomas Asbaty also hit two-run homers in the second game.
As for the pitching staff, senior Jake DeCarli pitched seven innings of the opening game, allowing six hits, three runs and three walks with seven strikeouts. Freshman pitcher Noah Lorenzo also saw seven innings of action in the second game, allowing nine hits, four runs and one walk with eight strikeouts.
As for the two games on Sunday, according to Mendyck, the Pioneers was “the team that made more mistakes and [the Spartans] pitchers kept us off balance so we weren’t able to drive in many runs.”
The Pioneers are scheduled to return to their home field for the first time in over three weeks for their next game on April 1 against Mercy College. First pitch is at noon.

The Pioneer men’s lacrosse team dominated the Dominican College March 22, defeating them 13-1 at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
The Pioneers shut down the Charger’s defense during the first half, leading the 9-0 going into the break. Four of the first five goals by the Pioneers were unassisted within the first nine minutes of the game. The Chargers were able to score the first goal of the second half, but a strong Pioneer defense shut them out the rest of the game.
Freshman mid fielder Dan Foley tallied two unassisted goals and an assist, and junior attackman also added three points for the home team with two goals and an assist. Sophomore midfielder Michael Licata also added three points for the Pioneer, and junior mid fielder Dylan Harned added one goal and one assist to bring his season point total to 24.
A young Pioneer offense had a shaky start to their season, but according to Harned, they have been working on playing with high energy and aggressiveness for the entirety of each game and they finally saw that during the game against Dominican. The Pioneers outshot the Chargers 28-6 during Wednesday’s game.
The Pioneers now sit fourth in the East Coast Conference, which means they would definitely make the conference tournament and have a shot at defending their title for the fourth year in a row.
“We have a few conference games coming up, so we’re hoping to take advantage of those and move up in the standings,” Harned said.
The Pioneers are now 5-4 overall and 2-1 in the ECC. They return to action April 1 when they take on seventh ranked New York Institute of Technology at Bethpage Federeal Credit Union Stadium at noon.
