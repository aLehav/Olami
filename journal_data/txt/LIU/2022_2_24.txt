National Hockey League Hall of Fame inductee Clark Gillies, referred to as “the big man” and “Jethro” due to his towering 6’3 frame, was a Long Island legend on and off of the ice. 
After notching 319 goals, and 378 assists for 697 points in 958 games and helping the New York Islanders win four straight Stanley Cup championships, Gillies was a staple in the Long Island community. 
After being born in Saskatchewan, Canada, Gillies spent his retired life living in Northport, NY. After he sadly passed away on Jan. 21, 2022, at the age of 67, the entire Islanders organization and fanbase were taken back. Often praised for his kind nature and making every fan interaction a genuine one, Gillies left a lasting impression on those around him. He was the classic “Power Forward” in the NHL, using his physicality to lay checks, yet could score goals as well. It was the perfect combination that helped propel the Islanders to all of their success. 
Shannon Hogan, the host of Islanders hockey on MSG Networks, painted the picture of what kind of guy Clark Gillies was.
“Clark had an amazing ability to make everyone he met feel special,” she said. “His magnetic personality and smile could light up any room, and I’ll really miss seeing him at games. He loved his family so much and was so proud to show me the latest pictures of his grandkids.” 
When thinking about her favorite memory with Gillies, Hogan recalled the last time they had been together before his passing, in November of 2021, highlighting his great sense of humor and all of the fun they had together over the years.
“I’ve done countless interviews with Clark over the last eight years, but he had me rolling with laughter the last time he was on MSG Networks with me,” she said. “I asked him about the new Islanders Hall of Fame wall, and Clark responded, ‘I don’t know about my plaque, it looks like I have wooden teeth.’ Clark had such a great sense of humor. I’ll always remember that show we did together.”
Four-time Stanley Cup Champion Butch Goring recalled his memories of Clark, echoing similar things of his old friend and teammate that many others did, but not many people knew him like Goring did.
“On the ice, I think everybody would be able to tell you pretty much the same thing. During the game, he was a very tough customer, and so when things needed to be taken care of, he did whatever he had to do not only for himself, but for everybody on the team. He was a great protector, and for guys like myself, that was important. He’s a Hall of Famer and deserved to be,” he said. “Off the ice, everybody knows he’s a great community guy, dedicated his life to charities, a funny guy who loved to tell jokes, loved to play jokes and just a really good humored individual. A great family man and just a wonderful person all the way around.”
When speaking of Clark as a friend off the ice, Goring mentioned the character of Gillies that stood out above all.
“You like people who take you for who you are, and Clark knew exactly who I was and what I was all about. When I first joined the team, he took care of me. Even after we finished playing hockey, we still maintained our friendship, and it was just always an honest relationship with one another,” he said. “If I needed him for something, he was there, and if he needed me for something, I was there, so again it just comes back to him being a good person and knowing who he was and knowing that you could have fun with him.”
When thinking about Gillies as a player, Goring chuckled at the fact that his teammates always knew they’d get 100 percent out of him.
“He’s a consistent player, I think his play was dictated by the opposition in some ways. If it was going to be a really tough physical game, he got himself ready to play that type of game. If it was going to be a skating game or the opposition wasn’t going to be overly aggressive, then he would get himself tuned into getting into more of a scoring position or a passing position,” he said. “I think he had that ability to do whatever style of play, as we all did, that was the mainstay for the New York Islanders back in the early 80s. Whatever game you wanted to play, we can all play it, and that would be the same for Clark. Whatever game is going to be played out there, well, he would get himself mentally ready, and then he would show up.” 
Shannon Hogan and Butch Goring were joined by the entire Islanders community mourning the loss of the late Clark Gillies before the game vs. the Toronto Maple Leafs on Jan.22, 2022. There were flowers and an emotional tribute video, as well as the hockey world taking a moment to reflect and remember one of Long Island’s best.

As the LIU Women’s Ice Hockey season nears the playoffs, the team is fighting for its third consecutive conference title after winning it in each of their first two years as a program. The Sharks enter the final week of conference play in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance (NEWHA)13-3-2 and will look for everyone to step up and contribute. It won’t be an easy feat, but Head Coach Rob Morgan has full belief in his group to come away with another NEWHA title. Led by freshman goaltender Tindra Holm, the team is excited to get back in the playoffs and make LIU proud.
Morgan touched upon what has improved for his team as the season unfolded.
“I think we’ve learned a lot about ourselves as a team and just how hard we can compete against some of the top teams that are in the country,” he said. “Being able to find a way to be consistent over three periods, that’s something that we’re learning, and I know that when we eventually put it all together, we’re a pretty fun team to watch.”
Morgan also detailed the team’s goals heading into the season after back-to-back conference championships, highlighting his plan for the talented freshman class.
“We definitely had the goal of finishing first in our conference and winning the tournament. When this class was recruited, they were recruited with the understanding that ultimately, our goal is to get to the national tournament, and we have a plan. This year’s part of the plan, next year’s part of the plan,” he said. “While they’re with us for four years, we’re going to continue to get better. We had a meeting all together, and I said you guys have to be prepared to compete hard, contribute, and be patient. They’ve been that, and along the way, they’ve gotten better, and they’ve now started to have quite an impact on the outcomes of our hockey games.”
In reference to star freshman goaltender Tindra Holm, he recalled the first time he had seen her play at the 2019 International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) U18 Women’s World Championship in Japan for team Sweden. He mentioned how Tindra had been a backup to previous goaltenders, but that coming to LIU allowed her to excel.
“Tindra has been playing at the highest level in Sweden, where a lot of the Olympians will go and play now that the Olympics are over, but she’s been playing a bit behind some of the star goalies that are older and aging out,” Morgan said. “So I think what’s been really special for Tindra is that she came in, she earned the starting job, and all of a sudden, she’s proven that she’s one of the best goalies in the country. Her training habits are as elite as they come, her commitment to getting better each day, making good choices and working out hard. I knew that this would be a great place for Tindra to open the door to the hockey world.”
Morgan said the team has its ambitions for the future, but it’s mostly a week-by-week focus.
“We talk about the big picture, but not often. It’s always about preparing for Friday. You can’t get a sweep on the weekend unless you win Friday, so that’s important to us,” he said. “Ultimately, we want to finish first, win the conference tournament and then take everything that we’ve learned as a team on and off the ice and come up with a plan to find a way to improve.”
Holm said it was former Shark Paula Bergstrom that made her consider playing for LIU back when the team first started.
“Honestly, a big part of me picking LIU was Paula. I played with her back in Sweden, and when she left to come here, she immediately texted me and said ‘yeah, you should come,’” she said. “Ever since then, I’ve been talking a little bit to coach [Morgan] and think this is a really good chance for me. As Coach said, I used to be pretty much a backup goalie in Sweden, but I always knew my capacity, and I feel like this is like me transitioning into a starter.” 
When Holm was thinking about why the group was so successful, it was a simple but clear answer.
“We are a big strong group, we have a lot of fun together, and we can play some really good hockey when we all commit to doing it,” she said. 
Being from Sweden, Tindra likes to spend her Sundays exploring the city that never sleeps.
“I like to go to the city on Sundays. I try to get someone to come with me, so I don’t go alone, but otherwise, I really like it [in the United States]. It’s a little bit of a change. I live in the forest back home,” she said. “My favorite part is probably the people, everyone is so social and welcoming, and I’ve gotten a lot of new friends.”
Holm also spoke on what it’s like receiving so many honors throughout the season, but insisted the results of the games are what matters.
“For me, the most important thing is winning and winning at the end of the season, but obviously, it’s nice to get some recognition for the work that you’re doing,” she said. “It keeps you motivated, and you know that you’re out there competing against the best.”
Holm has started in 26 games for the Sharks in her first collegiate season and has a 1.57 Goals-Average-Against(GAA) and a .941 save percentage in conference games. Holm has many accolades, including NEWHA Goaltender of the Week, NEWHA Rookie of the Week, National Rookie of the Month by the Hockey Commissioners Association (HCA) for November 2021 and has been named to the National Goalie of the Year Watchlist by the HCA.
Morgan also reminded that Tindra is a 4.0 student. Tindra looks to continue her good academics while pursuing an Olympic dream.
“I want to win the national championship here in college, and when I graduate, I want to go play professionally and represent Sweden in the Olympics,” she said.
Led by Morgan and backstopped by Holm, the LIU Women’s Ice Hockey team will look to keep taking strides forward, hoping to be once again crowned NEWHA Conference Champions.

The LIU Men’s Volleyball team is having its inaugural season. In October of 2021, Northeast Conference Commissioner (NEC) Noreen Morris granted championship sport status to men’s volleyball beginning in the 2022 academic school year. The six institutions involved in the NEC are LIU, Fairleigh Dickinson, Merrimack, Sacred Heart, Saint Francis Brooklyn and Saint Francis University. 
On Tuesday, Jan. 25, the Sharks defeated Fairleigh Dickinson to claim their first win in program history. This victory took less than two weeks to accomplish since the start of the season. As a young team, this win certainly sparked confidence and drive among the players. 
Freshman Opposite Luke Chandler was extremely excited to be a part of this moment.
“It was a surreal experience to have a part in the first win in program history, as well as the first win of my college volleyball career as a freshman,” he said. “Our team chemistry was on point throughout the whole match, and we served and blocked especially well. FDU is also a first-year program, so it was exciting to see how we would stack up against them.” 
As a new team, the Sharks have had a natural experience creating a strong team dynamic. Between being teammates, classmates and roommates, the players are able to spend time together to strengthen the bond needed to perform well on the court. 
Head Coach Shawn Patchell has done a phenomenal job leading the new program. The players definitely see him as a mentor and role model. Patchell has matches set up against some of the top teams in the country, which is very rare for a first-year team. 
“Coach Patchell has given the team a great analogy about how we overcome challenges. He told us when a storm comes, buffalos herd together and fight through the storm, making it out alive,” Chandler said. “On the other hand, cows split off by themselves and try to run from the storm, and they do not survive. Our team has to be like the buffalo. If we try to solve our problems individually like the cow, we will not succeed.” 
The Sharks have an independent record of 4-10 thus far. They took on number three ranked Hawai’i for the final time on Saturday, Feb. 12. Although they lost the first set, the Sharks were able to hit .318 percent. Junior Jordan Cooper and Sophomore Kade Frischknecht led the team with seven kills each. 
Sophomore Middle Blocker Hasan Hadzic feels this team has a ton of potential going forward.
“This is the first time this team is together, and our coaches have done a very good job connecting us as a team. By sticking together and putting in the hard work, we will be a pretty strong team that everyone in the nation will respect,” he said.

AEC, AEB, BEG. To many, these are meaningless sequences of letters. To some, the letters represent musical notes. To the great Dr. Dre, these three sequences of letters are the opening to one of his greatest and most well-known songs in hip-hop. 
The moment that “Still D.R.E.” began at the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show, roars of awe and excitement were heard all around the globe. A halftime show that encapsulated every historical and monumental moment in hip-hop for the last 20 years is one that individuals who watched will remember for a long Time.
The show featured an A-list lineup of hip-hop and R&B artists including Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar.
These artists came to the Super Bowl with intensity and a determination to make a statement that transcends mainstream music norms – hip-hop is the new pop. Never has a the crowd of Super Bowl attendees made more noise than when these individuals hit the stage.
When students on campus were asked about their opinions on the halftime show, the reviews were no less than astounding. 
Sophomore marketing major Mike Shapiro attested that the show was the best one he has seen or lived through.
“Demand for hip hop in mainstream media is much more present than it used to be…[the producers] look for artists that people would want to see, and in this day and age the artists are primarily hip-hop related,” Shapiro said. 
In order to portray the birth of Dre and Snoop’s fandom, the stage was set in Compton, California. The spectacle begins with a mashup between Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, performing their hit single “The Next Episode” with such confidence it was as if they were performing it at their primes.
 Following was a tribute to the late great Tupac, in which the two performed “California Love.” 
Shapiro also proclaimed his love for Snoop Dogg’s set.
“[Snoop] was by far the most entertaining person to watch,” Shapiro said.
Next, came the sight to see of the night – Dre and Snoop’s performance of “The Next Episode.” Beginning with a classical piano riff by Dre, he teases the audience before going into the infamous three chord intro. 
With passion and purity, the duo plays off each other as smooth as butter, matching each other’s energy and coming into their parts with force intended to proclaim their permanent existence in the world of mainstream music.
Sophomore finance major Joseph Dowling believes that it’s been a long time coming for hip hop to be included in the halftime show.
 “Hip hop has existed as one of the most popular genres in American music for almost 20 years, and for the entire halftime show to be rap is a big step for America as a whole and a realization from the older population that times are changing,” Dowling said.
Rising from underneath the stage shortly after came the one and only Slim Shady, where he captivated the stage with his performance of “Lose Yourself,” the song that made Eminem known around the globe.
A surprise upside-down (literally hanging from his ankles) cameo from 50 Cent shocked the crowd, while subsequently causing an uproar sing along to “In Da Club,” a fan favorite for many in the stadium. It was no shock to see him alongside Dr. Dre, as he was a primary component in the beginnings of 50’s success.
The youngest in the group of performers, Kendrick Lamar, was accompanied by an immensely impressive performance by background dancers while reciting his massively famous “Alright.” A relatively older song in the repertoire of Lamar, but nonetheless making an impact on the audience.
The only singer on the stage, Mary J. Blige, stunningly and sensually performed some of her most famous hits, “Family Affair” and “No More Drama.”
While the performances were impeccable and inspiring, this Super-Bowl halftime show acted as a demonstration to those in denial of hip-hop’s presence. Anyone who chooses to ignore the impact that hip-hop has had on music in the last 20 years can no longer do so. They are now unable to sit and reject the idea of “pop” being the only genre allowed at the global level. Hip-hop is here, and here to stay.

LIU is a renowned school throughout the country for several reasons. It is known nationwide for its historical campus, once being the estate of C.W. Post. LIU is also known for its direct access to global hotspots such as New York City, the nest for booming businesses worldwide. It’s most impressive feat, however, comes with a 16 year streak. LIU has proudly been selected as a “top business school” by the Princeton Review for the 16th  consecutive year. 
A press release from the university read: 
“The LIU school of business is led by a prestigious faculty whose professional backgrounds include accomplishments at the highest levels of Wall Street and corporate finance.” 
Additionally, the school is accredited by “the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business,” which is a distinction only held by less than five percent of business schools worldwide.
Established in 1916, the organization requires that schools with this accreditation must have excellent career opportunities for graduates, requires that programs seek links within the local community, and is primarily only given to business programs that demonstrate quality faculty and business focused ideals.
In a snippet from the press release, LIU President Kimberly R. Cline exclaims that she is “honored to be recognized as a ‘Best Business School’ for the 16th consecutive year…the recognition is a testament to our expert faculty and LIU’s focus on experiential learning as we continue our proud tradition of educating some of the world’s top business leaders.” 
“LIU takes great pride in the excellence of our business school,” Vice President for Academic Affairs Ed Weis said. Weis worked for Merrill Lynch a managing director in investment banking. 
“[LIU’s] business and accounting programs are nationally recognized for their top teaching, research and job placement for students, and our dedicated faculty opens doors for students through their professional connections in nearly every field,” Weis said. 
Students interviewed for LIU’s press release specified that the faculty at the School of Business are “always willing to clarify content and go the extra mile,” and the MBA program “makes you become more creative and competitive…[students at LIU] can feel the big difference between [students] in other colleges.” 
2021 graduate in accounting Matthew Conry is someone who furthered their career through the university’s job placement skills, and luckily is no introvert when it comes to speaking about LIU. When asked about what skills he felt as if LIU had taught him, he emphasized communication over everything. 
“When I came into school as a freshman, I really didn’t let myself experience new things. I stayed in my room and played a lot of video games. But what this school allowed me to do was push myself to become more extroverted in social situations – specifically interviews – where I eventually succeeded and had myself an accounting job before I even graduated.”

After two years of cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Coachella Valley Music and Art festival has confirmed they will be returning to the Empire Polo Club in Indio California. 
The event will take place Friday, April 15 through Sunday, April 17 and again on Friday, April 22 through Sunday, April 24. 
This year’s headliners include Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, Kanye West and Swedish House Mafia.
Coachella was originally postponed in March 2020 and festival organizers attempted to push the event to October 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was eventually canceled. This was the first year without Coachella in 20 years.
Before the festival was canceled in October, Coachella announced they would no longer require full vaccination for attendees, but after seeing the immense increase in numbers of COVID-19 infected people, Coachella released the following statement, “We feel confident that we can update our health policy to allow for: Negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of the event OR proof of full vaccination,” organizers wrote on social media.
Fans are excited to head back to the desert in California for the weekend to dance and sing along to their favorite artists but some are hesitant about the headliners. 
Adelphi junior Gileen Reyes, discussed how excited she is for Harry Styles to perform.
 “I went to his “Love On Tour” this past Fall and it was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. I am so happy Harry Styles is performing at Coachella this year. He is a well deserved artist and I know he’s going to give it his all during his performances,” Reyes said. 
This will be Styles’ first performance at the event and there are rumors that he may release new music leading up to his performance.
Although many fans agree with Reyes about Styles’ performing there are others who don’t think it is a great idea. 
“I personally don’t hate Harry Styles but they already have Billie Eilish performing who is another popular pop star. When you think about Coachella you automatically think about raves and I feel like they could’ve replaced it with another rock band,” Queens College Junior Lauren Hernandez said.
Though excited at the anticipation of seeing their favorite artists live, some people shared their disappointment at the high prices of tickets.
Tickets for the event went on sale Jan. 14 for $549 and sold-out in minutes. There is currently a waitlist for the first weekend. Prices for the tickets were: $549 for general admission, $633 for general admission with shuttle access, and $1119 for a VIP Pass. 
Tickets from 2020 will be honored.
“As much as I would love to see Kanye West live in concert, $549 is way too expensive. I would rather wait for him to go on tour himself and I could get tickets for $100 instead,” Molloy College Junior Jeorgio Llantino said.
As of now, plans for the festival are in full speed and fans are eager to return and dance the night away.

Over the past couple of months, renowned artist Kanye West and socialite Kim Kardashian have been going through a public divorce centered mainly around their children. Most recently, Kanye West has been publicly adamant against his children using social media at a young age. 
North West, the 8-year-old daughter of West and Kardashian, is an active user of the social media platform TikTok. North West created numerous videos with many alumni of the hit show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” as well as posting some videos by herself. Kanye West in an Instagram post stated his frustration with TikTok and their policy concerning young children on their platform. 
Just a few hours later, TikTok made a statement saying that they would review the account. As of now, the account is still up and running. Sophomore actuarial science major Vincent Randazzo thinks Kanye is in the right. 
“I agree 100 percent with Kanye not wanting his daughter on TikTok. TikTok is an addictive platform, and does Kanye want North to be exposed to things that Kanye maybe as a father doesn’t want her to see at that age,” Randazzo said. “It is also a danger because does North know when to not show private information? It’s a safety concern with her being a public figure.”
This situation of children being unadvised on social media is not an isolated case though. According to a study from the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children’s Health, nearly one-third of parents of children aged 7 to 9 years old reported that their children were using social media apps. 
In addition to this study, another report from the Wellesley Centers for Women and Lynch Research Associates found that children younger than 11 years old who use Instagram and Snapchat are more likely to have problematic digital behaviors like having online-only friends and visiting sites parents would disapprove of, as well as a greater chance of taking part in online harassment.
Should there be a certain age restriction for social media, and is there an alternative social media for kids? 
A majority of social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok already require the user to be at least 13 years of age due to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 
There are alternative apps made for children, but many people don’t trust them. Junior digital art and design major Anthony Hines gave his opinion on these children’s social media options, and how social media is a danger.
“I think the idea of a ‘kid social media’ is kinda dumb and pointless because people can easily just pretend that they are 12 or younger to infiltrate and do horrible things to these kids’ lives,” Hines said. “I feel like if you’re a kid on social media, you gotta make sure to be safe and know what to do and what not to say online.” 
Another cause of concern with social media includes the lack of social connection between children and their parents. According to Wiley Community Psychology, the heavy use of social media and screen time are associated with negative parent-child relationships. Junior marketing major Kyle Etts believes that parenting affects children as well. 
“Kids need to spend more time with parents instead of parents shoving coco melon in kids’ faces to distract them,” Etts said. “Children should not be allowed on social media. It’s shown to be damaging and addicting to everyone.”
With the next generation of children consuming a large amount of screen time, will their future be at risk?

The new Batman movie, titled, “The Batman,” is coming out March 4, 2022 and fans are eager to see it.
      Many people were quick to judge Robert Pattinson when it was first announced that he had gotten the titular role in May of 2019. This was mainly due to the fact that he was notorious for his role as Edward in the “Twilight” film series. However, after his roles in films such as, “Good Times” and “The Lighthouse,” people began taking his acting abilities more seriously.
“I think it was unfair to judge Robert Pattinson so quickly after it was announced that he had gotten the role because people were basing his acting skills off of previous projects he had worked on when nobody actually knows whether or not he was a good choice to play Batman,” sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato said.
         “I feel like Robert Pattinson getting the role created a lot of controversy among the fans; it adds another reason why it will be exciting to see the movie and see for ourselves how he does in the role,” sophomore education major Robert Metzger said.
         On Aug. 22, 2020, during the DC Comics event–also referred to as DC Fanome–fans got the first glimpse of the film in a trailer. Although some fans had a newfound excitement for Pattinson’s Batman, others still held doubts  he could truly portray the role of the superhero well.
         On Dec. 27, 2021, another trailer was released that gave fans more of a look at the footage that would be in the movie. In addition, this was the first-time people saw Zoe Kravitz playing the role of Selena Kyle/Catwoman and Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot/the Penguin.
         Many people are eager to see the film, not only because of the actors in it, but also due to the fact that fans were expecting the movie to come out much earlier. 
The original release date of “The Batman” was June 2021, however, due to the pandemic, filming was delayed and the release date moved to October 2021. However, due to more complications with production delays due to COVID-19, the current release date is March 4, 2022.

In the past month, book bannings as well as a “book burning” have made headlines.
Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer-Prize winning book “Maus” is at the center of the discussion after being banned last month from McMinn County, Tennessee. “Maus,” which was used in the curriculum of an 8th-grade English class was banned on the grounds of nudity and violence.
The book follows an interview Spiegleman had with his father about his experiences during the Holocaust, in which the tragedy is depicted in cartoon drawings, with Nazi’s being depicted by cats, and Holocaust refugees as mice. 
Parents of the McMinn community argue that they should be in full control of what their children are privy to. In contrast, there is the issue of the stifling of educational awareness, in which the banning of books crosses educational boundaries that should be upheld by the constitution.
“Well that’s a big thing in history, everyone should know about the Holocaust and the things that its done to this world. So if they’re banning books about it, who’s going to know about it?” junior criminal justice major Daniel Maldonaldo said. “You shouldn’t be able to block someone else’s education just for someone else’s comfortability.”
In proceeding to learn that the books in question are in the hands of younger readers, his answer changed slightly.
“It depends on what that book is about. If it’s promoting something negative, not educational, especially for a school, I feel like it wouldn’t be appropriate. . . I think you should be able to read whatever you want, whenever you want. But when it comes to young children, I think there should be a limit to what they can access, not only books, but online too,” Maldonaldo said.
The sentiment of keeping children protected, and not exposing them to the current harsh realities is a shared one, but there are many students on campus who feel that banning these books is not a long-term solution. Sophomore game design major Edison Yang has seen the transpiring of banned books once before, and does not like where it’s headed.
“Well considering I’ve been to China a couple times, it’s most definitely the case over there. Do you know how many banned books there are in China? In China there are hundreds being banned, mostly by American publishers,” Yang said.
When asked how he felt when he first heard of books being banned, he noted “Intrigued because I was thinking more about why the books were banned, that now I kinda want to read.”
Another important angle on the issue of banning books is the fact that doing so brings more attention to the book than it probably would have in the first place. “Maus,” for example, has made headlines in online news articles and segments all over the country.
Sophomore digital game design major Lucy Sokolowremembers the first time she heard about banned books: “ They definitely talked about the ‘Diary of Anne Frank, and that was banned. I was probably in fifth grade. . .if you ban it [books] you’re just bringing attention to it and kids are going to look for it themselves.”
Banning books is one of the more bureaucratic ways that people have sought to censor certain books, while others have taken a more drastic approach. 
Christian pastor Greg Locke organized a book burning in Tennessee earlier this month, in which books such as “Maus” were thrown into a fire. Along with books, a number of occult related objects, such as ouija boards were also tossed.
The burning of “Maus,” in its extremity, has been seen as an even more flagrant violation of books, due to both its implications on education itself and to the obvious irony, as book burnings were orchestrated by the Nazi party in the cusp of World War II.
“A book burning is a very serious thing. If you don’t like the book that’s fine, just don’t read it. But I don’t think buying copies and destroying them is a good thing, I don’t think it sends a good message,” Sokolow said. “I think people ban books because the subject matter is uncomfortable to them, they don’t like facing what it is. . . I think we need to face a lot of hard truths, some of these books have those truths.”

It is no secret that snowsports will run your wallets thin. However, with its rise in popularity, the question is, how do individuals get into the sport without breaking the bank? 
Jackie Dorney and Kenzie Ulrich from Woodward Tahoe both give their insight on this issue.
Snowboard instructor at Woodward Tahoe Dorney first got into snowboarding when her parents took her to a resort at around ten years old. At the resort, she had the choice to either ski or snowboard. She thought snowboarding looked cooler, and went with that. 
“Back then it was still super inflated and super expensive,” she said. 
Although it was hard to get into, she fell in love instantly, and began taking lessons. Dorney got involved with Woodward 15 years ago, when she went to Woodward East as a skateboard camper. Throughout the years, she stayed in contact with the company. 
“I enjoy teaching kids, and I wanted to do it with snowboarding. It is a lot harder to do it with snowboarding than skating, since they are mostly first timers. With skating I am usually teaching tricks. I just wanted to expand my teaching experience,” Dorney said. “I think my board was like $600, and my bindings were like $200.” 
It doesn’t stop there either. The gear is one part, there are so many other aspects to riding, such as lift tickets. Lift tickets are incredibly expensive, which is why it’s so beneficial working at a ski resort. 
“I went to another resort called Sugarbowl yesterday and the lift tickets alone were around $100,” Dorney said. 
Those prices don’t include all the winter gear you have to wear to snowboard. Proper attire includes thermals, outwear, goggles and beanies. However, an option for lower-income individuals would be to go to a thrift store or consignment shop. Dorney recommends websites such as Facebook marketplace and Craigslist, although the quality of gear and sizing may not be accurate. 
Snowsports instructor and retail expert at Woodward Tahoe Ulrich started snowboarding at a young age; her brother and family got her into it. As a kid, she had smaller gear which she eventually would grow out of as she progressed with the sport. 
The board Ulrich used as a child was around $600-$700. As she got older, she got into snowboarding every season through middle school and high school. However, she ended up growing out of her kids gear. 
“It’s so expensive because the clothes have very good functionality because it’s such an extreme sport. But why? I just bought a board today that was $500. Just by working, I want to buy a lot of the stuff that surrounds me,” Ulrich said.
With snowboarding, there are so many layers. These include goggles, helmets, thermals and different jackets. For the rentals at the mountain she works at, a single person spends $70 for a helmet, boots and a board. Which is a good option, however the board is not the best quality. 
“Before the season started, my friend had no gear, and we spent around $1,500 for a setup.” 
In the end, snowboarding and other winter sports will always be expensive, since it is an extreme sport.

A lot of months throughout the year celebrate many different things and people. February celebrates Black history, June celebrates those that are a part of the LGBTQ+ community, and this month of March, we celebrate women’s contributions towards history. 
Women’s History Week was established in Santa Rosa, California from March 2 through March 8 in 1980. In 1987, the U.S. Congress permanently declared March as National Women’s History Month. It is also celebrated in the United Kingdom and Australia. International Women’s Day is celebrated everywhere throughout the world on March 8. 
Every year, March is given a theme to celebrate and this year, the theme is “Women Providing Healing, Promoting Hope.” Often, women are given stereotypes and are expected to be accomodating and this theme is to show awareness for the women that are overworked with caretaking duties and are in need of relief. 
Junior film editing major Kathryn Stahl believes that it is necessary to have a special month to celebrate and honor women.
“Women do a lot and are often underappreciated and overlooked. This month is a way to show that women are just as important and can do just as much as men,” Stahl said. 
Senior film major Sofia Coppola wants to dedicate this month to her mother, as she is a significant woman in her life.
“The most influential woman I know would probably be my mom. My mom is such a beautiful and strong woman. She has taught me such important values, and to always have respect for myself and others. She instilled how important family and traditions are,” Coppola said.
This month is not only dedicated to celebrating women, but also being thankful for what women have done for society. 
“I am so proud to call her my mom and I hope to be half the woman she is one day,” Coppola said.
Some women celebrate the women that are around them today and others celebrate the powerful women from our history. Sophomore international relations major Lauren Miller opens up about who she believes is the most influential woman in her life.
“I think that Rosa Parks may be one of the most influential and important women in our history because of how powerful she was in a time when women were not allowed to have power. She didn’t move for man or no one else because she knew she was an equal and stood up for what she believed in,” Miller said.
Women’s History Month means celebrating women’s accomplishments and empowering women. Many students at Post use this time to celebrate the women in their lives.

         Many students were excited about Fashion Week for the fall season in New York, considering the fact that COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted in the state.
         Since the coronavirus pandemic hit America, almost all social events were canceled, therefore, this year’s Fashion Week was a really exciting one for many. The first fashion Week shows that took place in September in 2021 were a major success for the designers who were involved; many well-known designers have been preparing for this Fashion Week.
         With COVID-19 still being a risk, the necessary protocols were in effect for people to attend the fashion shows.
         “In order to have the shows be in person, it is smart to take the necessary safety precautions to allow people to feel more comfortable while watching the shows in person,” sophomore and education major Robert Metzger said.
         CBS New York had released an article, titled, “New York Fashion Week Returns With Live In-Person Runway Shows,” that discusses Fashion Week and the COVID-19 protocols that it consisted of.
         “More than 135 designers are taking part in Fashion Week, and COVID protocols are in place, from having to be double vaccinated to being encouraged to wear a mask in doors,” Cindy Hu included in the article.
         Since there is an overwhelming number of designers taking part in New York’s Fashion Week, safety needed to come first in order to proceed with having the shows in person.
         Some of these well-known designers being featured in Fashion Week include: Tory Burch, Michael Kors and Tom Ford.
         “I think it’s great that so many people are excited about this upcoming Fashion Week and it’s so exciting seeing the designers be able to show off their newest fashions to the public,” sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato said.
         While there are many famous designers who participate, Fashion Week is one of the events where many new designers take the opportunity to show their fashions in hopes of creating a bigger name for themselves.
         Some of these new designers include Bruce and Glen Proctor, twins who created a unisex fashion brand.
         Nylon had released an article, titled, “Meet The 12 Designers Making Their New York Fashion Week Debut,” about a lot of the new designers who will be attending Fashion Week and Bruce and Glen were included in the article.
    “Created by twins Bruce and Glen Proctor, who got their start designing for brands like Sean John and American Rag, BruceGlen is a unisex fashion label known for its vibrant apparel and accessories that unlock the child within us all.”
         What makes BruceGlen stand out is their choice of fabrics, due to its bright and colorful patterns, therefore, it will likely draw much attention from the people watching the runway shows.
         “I think it’s amazing how Fashion Week serves more than just the purpose of showing well-known designers clothing, but it also serves as a great opportunity for new designers to get their foot in the door with having their brand become more popular,” sophomore business major Gabrielle Previti said.
Students are excited to see what new looks designers bring to their shows this year.
         “It’s so cool to see how much success Fashion Week can bring designers and what designs are being debuted at the shows,” Metzger said.
         Fashion Week in New York took place from Feb. 11 to Feb. 16.

Many students are well acquainted with the Presidents’ Day holiday, if only because it means a three-day weekend for them. However, there is a deep history behind the time-honored tradition. 
“Originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington, the holiday became popularly known as Presidents’ Day after it was moved as part of 1971’s Uniform Monday Holiday Act, an attempt to create more three-day weekends for the nation’s workers,” an article on History said.
The holiday was created as a way of celebrating George Washington’s birthday. Back in 1885, it was one of few bank holidays along with Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving. It was also the only holiday celebrating a single person until Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was signed into law.
Eventually, the holiday was moved from Feb. 22 to Feb. 12 in order to ensure a three-day weekend for Americans. Incidentally, February 12 is Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. The move was part of an effort by the government to create a wave of multiple three-day weekends. This decision was supported by not only the private sector, but also the labor unions, and it boosted retail sales.
Different states have a different interpretation of the holiday. Arkansas celebrates Washington along with Daisy Gatson Bates. Alabama commemorates Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Depending on which state one lives in, one will see the holiday celebrated in honor of different people.
Presidents’ Day is often seen by many students as an opportunity to show one’s patriotism and remember fallen veterans. During the Great Depression, Washington’s face would be on newspapers every Presidents’ Day. The date was also used to bring back the Purple Heart, a medal awarded to soldiers killed or wounded while serving in the army. Presidents’ Day is not just a device to honor the first president of the country. It is also a way of honoring all of the former presidents. So it’s not just a three-day weekend, it’s also a tribute to some of the great men that helped build the nation.
Several people on campus have also taken an interest in the holiday, including freshman business administration major Giancarlo Salazar.
“I was taught multiple different things [about the holiday],” Salazar said. “Most prominently, it’s Washington’s birthday which is celebrated annually.”
Washington was indeed one of the most important presidents in the history of the nation. Many school systems mention the significance of Presidents’ Day in their curriculum, if only in passing.
“I look forward to Presidents’ Day for the three day weekend,” Salazar said. “I usually celebrate by getting some work done or having an off day just for myself.”

New York State lifted its indoor mask mandate in public spaces, such as grocery stores and restaurants on Feb. 10. Schools, however, will continue to enforce mask wearing restrictions. The mandate was brought about on Dec. 10, when there had been a great increase in hospitalization numbers due to the omicron variant.
“The Omicron variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Delta variant. . . [its] generally causes less severe disease than prior variants. Preliminary data suggest that Omicron may cause a more mild disease,” the Center for Disease Control (CDC) included in a public website forum.
Even though the new strain seems to be more infectious than its predecessors, New York has been riding a downslope in COVID-19 hospitalizations. According to the CDC, Covid hospitalizations state-wide are down 31.2 percent in January.
New York hospitalization cases are steadily falling, and Gov. of Nassau county, Kathy Hochul, plans to do everything in her power to keep it that way. Hochul, along with Health Commissioner Bassett, moved to instate a mandate where all businesses without mandatory vaccination policies to require all workers, customers and guests to wear masks in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
“I’m fine the way [restrictions are] right now, I know a lot of people think we should decrease restrictions,” forensic science freshman Alexa Sparita said. “But maybe if we decrease it, it goes back up so I don’t know. I might still wear it if we loosen restrictions a little bit just because I feel more comfortable with it. In a case like this the [state] is supposed to protect us and make the decisions that we can’t make.”
In wake of the mandate, backlash from the Nassau county Supreme Court has temporarily upended the mandate as the Nov. 24 ruling was thrown out by Court Justice Thomas Rademaker.
“While the intentions of Commissioner Bassett and Gov. Hochul appear to be well aimed squarely at doing what they believe is right to protect the citizens of New York State . . . [the] law that was promulgated and enacted unlawfully by an Executive branch state agency, and therefore void and unenforceable as a matter of law,” a New York Post article said.
As Hochul awaits the appeal hearing, the Appellate Division has ruled the mandate to stay in effect in the days leading up to the trial. Despite the governor’s concerns, many parents have risen up against the governor’s mandate. On Jan. 24, Micheal Demetriou and 13 other parents filed a case against Basset’s mandate that would change requiring mask coverings within certain settings, as opposed to any indoor public establishment.
“These are my children and it is my choice whether I want them masked or vaccinated. It’s not the government’s choice to do that. They didn’t birth them. I did,” parent Tiara Salkind said in an interview with CBS.
On Jan. 25, parents gathered at a board meeting at Bethpage Union Free School District to voice their concerns about their rights as parents, as well as the rights of their children.
“[Parents] want what’s best for their kids but is it best for everyone, because you’re thinking of the teachers too, and there’s other people in the school, it’s not just the kids. . .I think they have to think about the bigger picture,” medical imaging freshman Olivia Nystrom said. “I think [kids] should have an opinion, I mean they’re people.”
Sparita agreed with Nystrom.
“I think the kids should get a voice in certain things,” she said. “They are the ones who have to do it, it’s not necessarily the parents. They should be able to voice their opinions and using that opinion make the best choice. I know some kids didn’t like virtual so last year the kids really spoke up.”
Some parents who are against requiring the vaccine purchased their children fake vaccine cards, as local clinic Wild Child Pediatric Healthcare had been selling fake vaccination cards under the table to children and parents alike.
“Hypothetically, someone can choose whether to go into a space where vaccines are required, and some people can also choose if they are only comfortable going into a space where vaccines are required. So lets say someone who’s vaccinated and wants to go out to eat, so they choose a place that requires vaccinations. If someone there has a fake vaccination card, it’s not fair to them,” said mental health counseling graduate student Lauren Goldsamt. “They can’t actually make that choice.”
In a scheme that made the pediatric doctors an estimate of 1.5 million dollars, Clinic owner Owner Julie DuVuono and employee Marissa Uraro were both charged with felony forgery 2nd Degree, with DeVuono also being charged with offering a false instrument for filing 1st degree.
 Active school board meeting attendee Teresa Helfrich stated “We will restore our parental rights. I will die on my hill first before I relinquish my rights to my kid. I don’t think you understand the lengths some of us are willing to go to protect our children, but you’re going to find out.”(News 12 Long Island
