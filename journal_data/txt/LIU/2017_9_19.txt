Both resident and commuter students rely on the campus shuttle service to the Broadway Mall and the Hicksville Long Island Railroad station on a regular basis. This semester, a budget cut has been implemented, resulting in a condensed schedule.
The shuttle no longer stops behind Brookville Hall. Students are instead picked up and dropped off only behind Hillwood Commons. Monday through Friday, off-loop service begins at 6:30a.m. directly to the train station, and 9:30 a.m. is the first service of the day to Broadway Mall. Service ends at 10:00 p.m. on weekdays. On Saturdays and Sundays service to both the mall and the train station begins at 12:30 p.m., with the last pickup from the LIRR at 5 p.m.. The on-campus loop has remained consistent with nonstop service every 30 minutes starting at 7:55 a.m.
For some students, the new schedule has proven to be an inconvenience. Matthew Goldstein, a transfer from Dowling College and junior criminal justice major, has started a petition to restore the Brookville shuttle stop. Many students depended on the stop to get to the train station quickly, and the additional time it took to get to Hillwood interfered with their schedules, according to Goldstein. Goldstein experienced budget cuts at his previous school as well. “I would start petition to have my voice heard, and I thought that it would be nice to bring the advocacy I did at Dowling to Post,” he said.
Goldstein has received 50 signatures on his petition. “Resident students have to walk all the way to Hillwood instead of just going straight out to Brookville,” Goldstein said. The expense of occasionally taking transportation methods such as Uber instead of the free shuttle service has also inconvenienced some students. “I think campus life should think twice before cutting something vital to the student body,” he said.
President of the Student Government Association (SGA), Giovanna Domingo, explained that the SGA is responsible for allocating the student activity fee in order to provide campus programs, resources and services. “SGA takes budgetary decisions very seriously and always acts in the best interest of the students,” Domingo said.
“After reviewing the current shuttle schedule and identifying other student priorities, SGA decided to adjust the shuttle funding to create an hourly schedule for 2017-2018,” she said. The association believes the new schedule will allow consistent service while providing other organizations and services sufficient operational funding.
“Based on feedback we received last year where there was a dramatic increase in service, there were many buses that were not reaching capacity, so we scaled back some of our routes to levels that are slightly more robust than they were in 2015-16,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said. “We believe by enhancing service levels, it should result in optimal use of services, providing frequent transportation so students can get around on a predictable schedule, and making sure we can fund all levels of need to ensure a positive student experience,” he added.
If there are any issues or concerns regarding the shuttle bus, email post-sga@liu.edu or leave a comment at the campus concierge in Hillwood Commons.

The Office of Alumni and Employer Engagement launched Handshake this semester, a new job and internship website for students. Handshake replaces the previous job and internship website CareerConnect. The decision to change platforms came from student feedback during the office’s “Tabling Tuesdays” in Hillwood Commons during common hour last semester.
“We found that CareerConnect wasn’t user friendly,” Moreen Mitchell, university director of alumni and employer engagement, said. Students found the layout to be difficult to navigate, and employers also faced issues with getting students to actually apply for their job openings. Only 13 percent of the LIU community was utilizing CareerConnect, and this includes all campuses, Mitchell said.
Mitchell followed the example of other universities in choosing to move to Handshake. “We saw success within other universities and decided that we needed to step up for our students,” Mitchell said.
Handshake has a familiar interface, with layout and navigation similar to Facebook. “You don’t have to be super ‘techy’ to get the hang of it,” Mitchell said. When students log on to Handshake, all of the tools are located on the first page – where to upload a resumé, where to search for jobs, events going on near or on campus, etc. “It’s a one stop shop for jobs and internships,” she said.
Student feedback on Handshake after the first week of the semester led to the discovery of “Amazon tracking abilities” where frequent job searches incite recommendations within that industry of work without the effort of searching. “We take pride in going to our students, hearing what’s not working, and then turning it around,” Mitchell said. “Because we have handshake and it is better (based on successful results at other universities), we our owning this transition,” she added. The alumni and employer engagement team is spreading the word university wide through deans, professors, Blackboard and the Promise Office.
For the first time this year, alumni and employer engagement, which was created this summer when the two separate offices were combined, will be visiting the Riverhead and Brentwood campuses in coordination with Abby Van Vlerah, the newly appointed dean of the regional campuses. “Enrollment services counselors at the regional campuses will be trained to assist students on the new platform, and the website is being advertised to familiarize students with it as a resource,” according to Van Vlerah.
At LIU Post, promise coaches have been meeting with the office of alumni and employer engagement biweekly to cooperate in advertising Handshake. Promise coaches are directing students to upload their resumés, look for internships, job openings, workshops, and other events through Handshake.
A “Get to Know Handshake” information session will take place Thursday, Sept. 21 during common hour in the library, room 227. This information session will kick off the LIU Promise office’s fall 2017 Career Success Workshop Series.
The office of alumni and employer engagement will also be continuing with “Tabling Tuesdays” this semester in Hillwood Commons during common hour. With a new location across from Subway and Twisted Taco, Mitchell and her team hope to attract more students to come and speak with them. The new location is strategically placed where there is the most traffic, as opposed to the previous spot in front of the Gold Coast Cinema. They will also be featuring an outside employer every week for students to talk with one-on-one by appointment only through Handshake. The goal is to bring employers and jobs that would help to build students’ resumés with experience in their field of study.
Part-time and full-time positions for campus jobs, internships, and entry-level jobs for after graduation are coming onto Handshake every day. These resources are made available through handshake.liu.edu. Just sign up with your MyLIU login to get started.

During the school year students email professors for assignment dates, friends about school events, and classmates for help on schoolwork. Students have recently received an email from the Chief of Student Success, Andy Person. If you are not sure as to who he is or what the chief of student success is, you are not alone. Turns out many students on campus are receiving his pulse surveys, yet his identity is a mystery.
Sarah Meehan, a senior early childhood education major, expressed her confusion with what the intent of the surveys. Meehan often checks her school email and she noticed a survey request from Andy Person. “I have never taken the survey because I’m not familiar with who he is or what he does,” Meehan said. The survey consists of three questions asking students if they like their class schedule, if they had completed their financial “To Do” list on their MyLIU portal, and if they have their course requirements to complete assignments.
Where exactly does this information go? Who is it helping? Why is it being collected? “Being able to know who the survey is helping would be important so that maybe I could help more with whatever the issue may be,” Meehan said.
Matt Weinstein, a sophomore broadcasting major, agreed with Sarah. “Most students see emails from people who they do not know and quickly ignore it and delete it,” Weinstein said.
Andy Person, formally named Chief of Institutional Research and E ectiveness since Feb. 2016, works on both the Brooklyn and Post campuses to provide administrative oversight on the universities effectiveness, assessments, and research operations, according to his LinkedIn profile. His plan is for students to have success in three main aspects of their college career. “Taking 15 credits each semester, taking on internships and having a personalized support system to guide you through college and after graduation,” he said.
Person emphasized the importance in taking 15 credits per semester to make it possible to graduate in exactly four years. “Anything less will cause you to be in school longer,” Person said. Taking more than 12 credits is the same cost as taking only 12 credits, so there is no raise in price, according to Person.
The next step in student success is interning while still in school. “Having an internship down once you graduate college places your resume in a different pile from all the rest, and will show your future employer that you have experience,” Person said.
It is also important to put in place a support system when you are struggling with staying on track in school; this is where the pulse surveys come in. “The college experience is very personal and unique to everyone,” Person said. “We are innovating to personalize the experience and help students get the right help at the right time when it matters most,” he added.
Student responses to the pulse surveys are delivered to the LIU promise coaches and advisors. Ultimately, Person wants to be there for students who seem to be falling off the path to success and get things sorted out before it is too late. “I want what is best for every student,” he said.
There will be more surveys sent out to students to check on them throughout the semester.

The office of Employer Relations and the office of Alumni Relations merged in July to become the newly created office of Alumni and Employer Engagement.
The decision to intertwine the two offices seemed to come naturally. Employer Relations was tasked with building relationships with employers for students, and through Alumni Relations, they found that many employers of LIU Post students are alumni. “There was a natural synergy to it,” Moreen Mitchell, the university director of the new department, said. “It was clear that this was the direction higher education was going in,” she said.
Ryan Attard Reilly, a 2003 LIU Post alumna who was the university director of alumni relations and annual fund, left the university over the summer. Mitchell now oversees her former department of Employer Relations as well as the added responsibilities of alumni engagement. Mitchell and her team now manage services and events for a network of over 200,000 alumni. They report to Bill Martinov, head of admissions. Most alumni are already connected to the university through alumni cards, which give discounted access to the Pratt Recreation Center and the Tilles Performing Arts Center, among other services.
The largest window for alumni engagement is through Homecoming in the fall. This year’s Homecoming will include performances by The Bleachers on Thursday, Oct. 12 and Blondie Friday, Oct. 13, wine tasting, athletic games for the alumni, a WCWP radio alumni barbeque, a “So You Think You Can Dance” contest, and a historical tour and breakfast Sunday, Oct. 15. Last year, the Pioneer hosted an alumni event at Homecoming to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the student newspaper on campus.
This semester is a fresh start for the office of alumni and employer engagement. Mitchell and Joan Yonke, campus director of alumni and employer engagement, are going out to the students. They are starting the future alumni committee, and hope to cultivate the interest of current students in philanthropy. “We want a group of people in the planning stages,” Mitchell said. Students who plan to join the future alumni committee will act as a student advisory board to alumni and employer engagement, investing ideas into what they will leave behind. “We want to know what they want their history to look like,” Mitchell said.
An alumni board with several sub-committees is already in place. Mitchell plans to initiate a GOLD committee for “Graduates of the Last Decade,” to connect with recent graduates and promote school spirit for future alumni. When asked to speak with the current alumni committee, Mitchell said she would not be able to give that access to the Pioneer.
Students can join the Future Alumni Committee and learn more about philanthropy, by contacting the office of Alumni and Employer Engagement at postalumni@liu.edu, or stepping into their o ce located in the old bookstore building next to Pell Hall.

Long Island University includes many separate entities other than LIU Post – LIU Brooklyn, the satellite campuses in Brentwood and Riverhead, and LIU Global. Among the many administrative changes made throughout Long Island University before the fall semester began, the LIU Global “campus” has new leadership. The new Dean of LIU Global is Duleep Deosthale, and the new Assistant Dean for Recruitment is Christopher Salute.
LIU Global has international campuses in Costa Rica, China, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Australia available for the first three years of the program. The fourth and final year, starts out with the International Research and Internship Semester (IRIS) in which the student can study in an LIU Global center or program of their choice, and ends with a capstone semester at the LIU Brooklyn campus, where students complete another internship and develop a senior thesis before graduating with a BA in LIU Global Dean Jeffrey Belnap, who was also the Acting Dean of the LIU Post College of Liberal Arts last year, left the university in August. Deosthale, who replaced him at the beginning of this school year, was the co-founder of Admission Table, a Silicon Valley based and funded education technology company that used mobile technology to recruit international students for universities worldwide. Deosthale had been working in international education for over 25 years, in both academics and administration. Some of his accomplishments include his help in building Manipal International University in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a branch campus for Marist College, New York, in Italy, and dozens of study abroad programs and centers for various international organizations in over 40 countries. He has lived and worked in over 10 countries, has traveled to over 100 countries and can speak several languages.
“I am a passionate believer in the global college,” Deosthale said. He believes a global program can provide students with insights into the changing global environment by giving them skills to engage with cultures across the world. “My effort is to give [LIU Global] national and international visibility and to make it grow to its full potential,” he said.
In order to expand the program, which currently enrolls 30 to 40 freshmen students and 5-10 transfer students each year according to its website, Deosthale plans to create both “traditional and nontraditional” opportunities for students. By implementing new short term and semester long programs, as well as internship opportunities in various parts of the world, Deosthale hopes to complement student portfolios and resumés with new academic experiences. Deosthale also wants to create opportunities for faculty to lead some of these programs and to look for collaborative efforts in their academic disciplines around the world that they could bring back to the classroom.
Salute agrees LIU Global is often referred to as the university’s “best kept secret” by students, he said, and that is something that he wants to change. “I don’t like secrets,” he said. “My goal is to share the secret with everybody.”
Salute was appointed head of LIU Promise at the Post campus in January 2016 but left that position in February 2017. He did not disclose his reason for leaving. Before working in “academia,” Salute spent 10 years in the private sector in training, human capital, marketing and technology for large companies like Yahoo! Inc. and BMW. Salute has worked on four continents before coming to LIU, Salute was Program Chair, Assistant Dean and Executive Director at Mercy College, according to his LinkedIn page, where he said that he helped students transition to college and gain internships, as well as develop curriculum, manage faculty and grow all aspects of the program.
Salute enjoys working with his university colleagues, and refers to them as a “hotbed” of talent for their “knack for developing a vision and attracting the best people.” At LIU Global, Salute wants to continue the tradition of excellence while adding his own skills to help grow it. “The great thing about LIU is that we are all a team, so whomever I am partnered with at other departments, our responsibilities are always the same: continue to build a better institution,” he said.

At the beginning of the fall semester, Michael Berthel, the associate dean of students and director of campus life, was promoted to Dean of Students, replacing Abby Van Vlerah, who was promoted to dean of the LIU regional campuses, Riverhead and Brentwood.
Berthel joined the University as associate director of student life in 2013, later merging with resident life to become campus life in 2014, although he has been working in higher education for 10 years. “I am excited to take on a larger role at the University and continue to serve as an advocate for LIU Post students,” he said. He stressed that over the past few years, he has worked to increase opportunities for students to engage with the University and become more active and involved on campus. “As dean of students, I want to continue to create a vibrant student experience and increase student engagement,” he added.
Berthel is enjoying his new role and the opportunity to work with LIU Promise, Campus Life, the Center for Healthy Living and other areas to support students. “I am excited that this new role will allow me the ability collaborate with faculty and staff across the University to identify ways to best serve our students,” he said.
In the past four years, Berthel had worked closely with Van Vlerah, learning much from her. “LIU Post students have been lucky to have her as Dean. She has served as an amazing mentor for me and I look forward to building on the student-centered approach that she brought to the position,” Berthel said.
Van Vlerah is excited to take on her new role as well. “I am able to expand my own portfolio while also serving the university,” she said. The regional Brentwood and Riverhead campuses have full-time and part-time graduate and undergraduate students taking classes in person, and a smaller number of students enrolled in the online programs for the homeland security and terrorism institute.
LIU Riverhead is located at Suffolk County Community College’s eastern campus in Riverhead and Brentwood is located at the Micheal J. Grant campus of Suffolk County Community College. Several clubs and organizations are already in place at these campuses, and Van Vlerah wants to continue to grow student involvement. Van Vlerah replaces Donna Di Donato, who was team of the regional campuses until summer 2017, although Di Donato is still mentioned as dean and chief operating officer on the LIU Brentwood website. It is unknown whether Di Donato had retired or was terminated.
Van Vlerah has confidence in Berthel to succeed her as dean of students. “He has my full support in his new role and I know he will do a fantastic job,” she said. Jean Anne Smith, assistant dean of students, agrees. “Michael is a dedicated, talented and extremely qualified higher educational professional and I am excited to be a member of his team,” she said.
Ashley John, one of the assistant directors of Campus Life, will be replacing Berthel as interim director of campus life until a new director can be appointed.
Berthel has moved his office to the second floor of Hillwood Commons, in the back of the LIU Promise office, room 270. “I encourage students to stop in with a questions, concern, or just to say hello,” Bethel said.

As the new school year begins students are eager to get back in the classroom and clubs are even more eager to get them away from it. The 70 club leaders on the Post campus seek to show students that the LIU Post experience doesn’t end at the classroom door. The club leaders have been hard at work planning for the fall semester and are ready to begin.
The new Student Government President, Giovanna Domingo, is excited to show students what SGA has in store. “The Student Government has been working very hard this summer to prepare for this year,” Domingo said. “At our first annual leadership retreat the SGA planned a commuter student appreciation week for this semester.”
New last year, the Be The Change Club, led by founder and president Adam Silverstein is ready to jump into the new semester. “This year, Be The Change Club has a lot of plans for events and activities that the whole campus can enjoy. We are going to continue our mission of spreading love, compassion, positivity, and kindness and creating a safe, judgement-free space for everyone,” Silverstein said.
Be The Change Club is planning several events this semester that focus on the topics of self-love and confidence, empathy and compassion to others, equality and social justice, and the freedom of self-expression. Silverstein affirmed that the club’s goal this semester is to “continue to make LIU Post and the world a kinder, safer place for everyone and spread love and happiness to all.”
The Rainbow Alliance’s President, Christina Disilvestro, is hoping to keep her club very active. “This semester the Rainbow Alliance is going to follow and celebrate all important LGBTQ dates. We will have tables during common hour showing support to the LGBTQ and allies of Post’s student body all semester long.” Disilvestro said.
“We are also currently planning a drag show at the end of the semester with a Ru Paul’s Drag Race spin off. It will be a semester of support and fun from the Rainbow Alliance to all of Post,” Disilvestro said. “Our main goals this semester is to gain new members and create a strong executive board for the future semesters to follow. Also our goals will be to allow color and glitter in every program we put on. We plan to be the most active club on campus this semester at Post.”
Of course what new semester would be complete without a new dorming experience. Nicole Guillet, the new President of the Residence Students Association (RSA), is looking to enhance that dorming experience. “I’m really excited about jump starting RSA this year and getting all of our resident students involved and active with each other. We’ve got a couple of great programs already in the works and we’re looking to organize some more,” Guillet said.
Guillet emphasized the work that the Residence Assistance have been doing to improve the residence experience. “All of the RAs have been working really hard on their building programs so far. We don’t ever want students to feel like nothing is ever going on on campus.”
Domingo expressed confidence in clubs this semester saying “I believe that all clubs have the resources and tools need to be successful for this upcoming year. SGA is very excited to see what clubs will bring to our campus community this year and look forward to supporting them.”
For students who are interested in joining a club or creating a club, they can visit the Campus Life office in Hillwood room 100.

Chandler Bianco, a nutrition major who is president of Theta Chi fraternity, is the owner of two dogs, Chloe and Lucky. Chloe, three, is an australian shepherd. Since Bianco got Chloe at Shake-A-Paw, the two have developed a strong bond. Chloe has a variety of talents, Bianco said. “ Chloe can herd animals, can solve puzzles, fetch really well, she can ‘sing’ [howl], dance, and cry on command like all the good actresses.”
In addition to Chloe’s talents, Bianco also admires Chloe’s dominance. “My favorite thing about Chloe is her personality and the coloring of her eyes. They are a sky-blue and brown, and she has so much life in her that looking into her eyes shows she’s always thinking and being mysterious,” Bianco said.
Bianco’s other dog is Lucky, a seven year-old cockapoo. Bianco got Lucky at a breeder and was inspired by the Nintendo DS game ‘Nintendogs’ when coming up with the name Lucky. “The really generic dog name in the game was Lucky, and my parents decided that was the name for her,” Bianco said.
Bianco compared the personality of Lucky to a grumpy grandma. Despite that attitude, “she has white paws and a mustache. She is a light and soft dog good for cuddling,” Bianco said. Lucky’s talent, according to Bianco, is ‘barking all day and never getting tired of it.’
Chloe and Lucky compliment each other: Chloe is a high energy and Lucky is reserved. “Both tend to like each other’s company. Chloe is very jealous of Lucky, so if Lucky is [being] pet, Chloe runs to you and tries to get your attention.”
One of Bianco’s favorite activities with his dogs is to play soccer. Having multiple dogs has become a routine that Bianco has taken on with his mother. “Two dogs can be a handful, but it’s humbling knowing that if my mom or I aren’t home that Lucky and Chloe keep each other company,” Bianco said.
Bianco spent time away from his dogs over the summer when volunteering in Africa and found it dificult to be away. “The hardest part of the trip was being away from my dogs. I missed them dearly,” Bianco said.
Bianco is satisfied that his dogs are females, but that if his “pupperonis” [puppies] were boys, “I would do everything in my presidential power to make sure they would be in my fraternity,” he said.

Coalition for Conservation, an emerging club, is making major strides towards creating a sustainable campus.
The club began last fall as the brainchild of Erica Ferrara. Ferrara is a current junior studying geology and environmental sustainability, so sharing her passion for the planet is a natural extension of her talents. She hopes to provide a space for students to express creativity and learn about environmental sustainability. “I especially want students to see how an individual can have an extensive impact on the planet,” Ferrara said. She pursues this mission by organizing upcycling craft events, service activities and contacting representative from the field of sustainability to speak campus. Experimental art projects throughout her dorm room attest to Ferrara’s commitment to finding engaging ways to spread environmental awareness.
Last semester, the club hosted a variety of sustainability-themed events. Ferrara cites to Earth Day Festival as one of the most successful. Students participated in environmentally-friendly activities like tie-dyeing recycled t-shirts, cleaning up the campus, and playing in a drum circle. On March 22, which is World Water Day, the club hosted special guest Peter Miniscalco, who conducted a traditional water ceremony. This event also featured a strong focus on local environmental issues with a segment specifically on Long Island water.
Already, the Coalition for Conservation has planned for a busy semester of campus engagement. To help support the victims of hurricane Irma, a succulent sale will take place in late September. A “Halfway to Earth Day” event, a guest speaker, and a film showing are also planned for the coming months. Most notably, though, Ferrara will be focused on expanding the campus farm. Currently, Post is home to an impressive farm that yields carrots, radishes, kale, romaine lettuce, arugula, mesclun and mustard. But Ferrara has much bigger plans for the future. “Short term, I’d like to extend the farm by two rows each year, but eventually I’m hoping for a one-or two-acre farm on campus.”
Through such ambitious involvement on campus, Ferrara hopes to draw even more students to the club and spread awareness of current environmental issues. “I hope to get more students involved and environmentally conscious,” she said. In addition to the club, Ferrara is also working for the College of Management to build a living-learning community with a focus on sustainability. Eventually, an entire floor or even residence hall will be devoted to students who share a passion for long-term environmental change.

LIU Post is a great place to enjoy life, sit back, relax and enjoy the peace and quiet around you. But what if you want a day of noise and excitement? A day with millions of people at the renowned Macy’s on 34th Street, or a fun day at a Yankees games in the Bronx. Maybe you would like to take a stroll along the world-famous Brooklyn Bridge or experience the unspeakable at Time Square. It sounds amazing, but all these things are located just 29.7 miles away from campus. Here are the three quickest, and cheapest routes to New York City.
The first option requires a car. Drive on Northern Blvd to Glen Clove Road, make sure to maintain the speed limit. Turn left on Glen Clove Road and continue until you arrive at the Long Island Expressway. Merge carefully, and check your mirrors, as you continue on the freeway until you reach the Queens, Midtown Tunnel, and behold you are in Manhattan. Driving to the city is a little challenging and by the end of your day, you might be stressed and ready to pull your hair out.
Therefore, 2nd option is a relaxing train ride. Take the Hicksville shuttle behind Hillwood Commons to the Hicksville railroad station. From there you will take the next Penn Station bound train. Fifty minute train ride away, and you will be with the millions of people in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. The Fare will cost you $13.50 for peak hours and $9.75 for off-peak hours.
The final possibility is taking the NICE n20 bus to Greenville. From there you will take the Long Island Railroad to Penn Station. Not all trains will go directly to Penn Station. You may have to get off at Jamaica Station in Queens and wait for the next available Penn Station bound train. In total this journey will take you 55 minutes at the same fare of $13.50 or $9.75. That is it; Three simple ways to get to NYC from LIU Post. Let us know if these tips were helpful at liupostpioneer@gmail.com, and check us out on the web at www.liupostpioneer.com.

It is the feeling you get when you are reunited with a friend who you haven’t seen in months. When you hug a puppy. When you ace a test you were convinced you were going to fail. This is all happiness.
To me it is much more than just a feeling; it is a way of life. We can probably all say that living a truly happy life is something we wish to achieve. Yet, we allow so many negative thoughts to surround us daily that restrict us from achieving the happy lifestyle we want.
The Pioneer is introducing this column to let people know that there are ways to go about life without allowing negative or upsetting thoughts to ruin a beautiful day. Just like everything you wish to achieve in life it takes hard work and constant practice to be happy. You’ll have to fight the bad thoughts that consume you and allow yourself to view things in a more positive light.
I have recently taught myself to do this by stepping back when I am overwhelmed and look at the bigger picture. Little or big things will make it’s way into your life and create chaos but practicing in mental health activities can help tremendously. If you are facing serious issues it is also great to see help from professionals. Seeing therapist can help you more than you may believe. Such as yoga, meditation, painting, and reading self-help books. It is never too late. Once you realize this you can begin to open up a whole life of possibilities.
Young adults can get so wrapped up in what others day and do, but opinions mean nothing. You have to learn to accept yourself for who you are and know the only version of yourself that you should be happy with is when you are doing the best you possibly can. Friends and family sometimes tend to give us advise, whether we want it or not, but we have to teach ourselves that they often tend to think they know what is best for us when in reality only we do.
Take things with a grain of salt, laugh off the embarrassing moments and laugh with the people you love. Life is too short to be anything but happy. Learning how to live a different lifestyle can be tricky and there will absolutely be days when you fall down and allow the bad to take over, but the next day pick yourself back up and continue believing that life doesn’t always have to be unhappy. We are all capable of happiness.

The 2017 school year has officially begun, and for many women on campus that means one thing- sorority recruitment season. As freshmen begin to acclimate to college life, joining one of the four sororities on  campus is a great way to get involved and make friends. Each panhellenic organization on campus has around 40 members, allowing new students the opportunity to quickly meet people on campus.
Robyn Beeber, a sophomore potential new member who is going out for recruitment this year, is excited about the idea of joining a sorority because she is an only child. “It’s really cool to have sisters who are always there for you- to be able to have someone hang out with and go to the mall with,” she said. Beeber, like many other potential new members, has some concerns going into this new phase of her college career. “Going into pre-existing relationships in groups that are already so close” seems intimidating, but it is all worth it because she is “excited to find [her] home.”
Other young women involved in greek life echo this sentiment. Tianna D’Italia, public relations chair of Delta Zeta, one of the four Panhellenic organizations on campus, reminds women interested in recruitment that “everyone was in [their] position once.” She advises potential new members to “ask questions about any concerns [they] have,” and wishes these students “the best of luck finding [their] home.” As Public Relations Chair, D’Italia says she has a “special opportunity to communicate with potential new members through social media and display Delta Zeta before recruitment.” Katy Caraveo, a senior and president of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority, advised women interested in joining a Greek Organization to “keep an open mind. If you have a specific place in mind, you might still be surprised along the way.” She says that going into this recruitment season, she feels a “fresh start on recruitment as a whole, which is a good feeling.” Lauren DelGuidice, vice president of recruitment for Alpha Epsilon Phi, says of her own recruitment experience, “I came out to recruitment almost two years ago and was nervous to see what it would entail. My recruitment experience was absolutely incredible and I was able to meet the amazing sisters of each organization. I am now a part of a great sisterhood and I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
The members of the four sororities on campus, Delta Zeta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Sigma Delta Tau, and Alpha Xi Delta, have spent time creating a welcoming recruitment experience, and the sisters are excited for potential new members to discover all that sorority life has to offer.

Giovana Domingo, a senior accounting major, and newly elected president of the Student Government Association, is excited for the fall semester. Domingo, who is also involved in Greek Life and the Panhellenic Council, is a Residence Assistant in Post Hall and she served as an Orientation Leader during the summer.
Q- As newly elected Student Government President, what is your assessment of the current state of student a airs?
A- I believe that all of the clubs and organizations have the potential to be successful and to have an impact on our campus community. I have noticed that there is a lot of new leadership, so I am excited to see what fresh new ideas they will bring and what traditions they will build upon.
Q- This new year has brought about a large freshman class. What do you want them to know about the Student Government?
A- With such a large first year class, I would like them to know that the SGA is a recourse that they can utilize throughout their career at Post, because SGA is an outlet for them to voice their concerns and to help them in any way possible. Additionally I encourage first year students to get involved not only in Student Government, but in other clubs and organization to better their experience here at Post.
Q- The position of SGA President is a tough one. What are some of the tougher aspect of the position in your opinion?
A- I think the hardest thing is trying to meet the needs of every student at LIU Post while still not exceeding our logistical constraints. Moreover it’s a challenge to speak for such a diverse student body, but it’s a challenge I am excited to take on.
Q- What are your top goals for this year as the SGA President?
A- My main goal and focus for this upcoming year is for SGA to have more of a presence on this campus. In addition, I want the Student Government to become more transparent and act as a steward of the student before anyone or anything else.
Q- As a senior, what are some personal goals for this year?
A- This being my last year, I have had a lot of time to reflect on my career at Post. By doing so my goals for this year are to embrace all aspects of the Pioneer traditions and to leave a lasting impact on this campus community through the Student Government Association.

As the sun set on Saturday, Sept. 16, live music could be heard coming from the lawn in front of the Kahn Learning Center. The Tilles Center Food and Music Festival was open to the public for attendees to lay out blankets and chairs on the lawn to enjoy food and live performances.
Shari Linker, the event coordinator and director of communications and engagement at the Tilles Center, stated that the idea for this festival was born through a meeting with MAXFM Radio in March to discuss a partnership with Tilles. “The feedback was to create an event that could draw beyond battle of the bands,” Linker said. Thanks to a partnership with Edible Long Island magazine, food trucks were incorporated to attract more students. Trucks present included Blondie’s Bake Shop, La Belle Torte, and OPA! On the Go. Borghese Vineyard as well as Crowdster, a nonprofit digital software company also located in Hillwood Commons, had promotional stands installed as well.
The competitors for the battle of the bands included 1974, Nevrlands, Alibi, Bourbon Stills Band, Grimm Jack and Pine Street. “We secured 3 judges from the music industry including one of the top DJs from MAXFM, Sean Lynch and an executive from William Morris Endeavor,” Linker said. The bands were judged according to categories ranging from musicianship to showmanship, and the overall winner was Bourbon Stills. The grand prize was to play as the opening act for Jefferson Starship and Blue Oyster Cult on Nov. 17 at the Tilles Center. Over 50 entries for the competition were received. The five bands that performed were decided to be the most appealing to the show’s audience. Approximately 200 attendees showed up for the event throughout the evening, “We got a good crowd,” Amanda Dupuy, the operations manager for the Tilles Center, said, “It was nice to see a mix of the students as well as an older crowd come together for a battle of the bands.” Julia Vaughn, a junior musical theatre major, was also pleased by the turnout, “It’s refreshing to see new faces in the crowd, and that our events draw so many different people,” she said.
“We wanted to create an outdoor event and felt this was a great way to extend what we do best, entertainment, beyond our concert hall,” Linker said.

Fritzlyn Hector, seventeen-year veteran of the broadway show STOMP! is the newest full-time faculty member of the department of dance. She is internationally known, having toured to various countries including Europe, Africa, Canada and every U.S. state. Her work with STOMP! currently consists of helping facilitate auditions and training new cast members. When she’s not teaching on campus, she is training new “stompers”. “I train cast members for six to eight weeks for each role. If we have a large group, we start filtering them in one or two at a time per week, and while that process is happening, we’re still training,” Hector said.
Hector was hired by the STOMP! company in 1999 and began her training in New York. The company sends out tours based in five different locations worldwide including London, England and New York at the Orpheum Theatre. “The U.S tour starts in the last week of October. We’re training the new cast members now because we’re going to be shipping them out to different tours,” Hector said. She has participated in each of these tours and considers herself lucky to have done so.
Previously, Hector has been an adjunct faculty member at Hofstra University and was invited as a guest speaker and teacher to Princeton University. In 2013, Hector was invited by Davyd Suber, adjunct professor of dance, to teach a master class on campus. “He and Cara asked me if I would be interested in teaching my work in choreography and showcase,” she said. After being invited back three times, Hector decided to become an adjunct faculty member in 2015. She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and was constantly exposed to Haitian folklore, African and hip-hop culture all at once. Hector teaches a hip-hop dance and culture class as well as an African dance class. She has choreographed the dance student’s senior showcase.
“It’s been a blessed journey. They told me that I was refreshing that I was able to bring new energy to Post,” Hector said. Likewise, she enjoys the energy from the theatre and dance department on campus, “[The faculty] really keep it real about what’s out there for the musical theatre dancers. They see the evolution of how the arts are happening. More musical theatre actors are dancing, so the collaboration is needed more now than ever,” she said.
Hector is also the director of her new dance company, the Fritzation Experience Network. “I performed for the first time at Symphony State. It’s a collaboration of all the genres that I grew up with and that’s what I’ve included in my company,” she said. The company’s genes include jazz, hip-hop and traditional dances from Africa and the Caribbean. Hector is also a company member and rehearsal director at Forces of Nature Dance Theatre Company where she became a principal dancer at age 15. She has been featured on episode 10 of Julie’s Greenroom, a Net ix show hosted by Julie Andrews.
“I feel like this is the era of fusion, and for Post to make that available to students, I think that’s an incredible thing. When they go out it’ll be more realistic in what they find. Post appeals to the diversity of the arts. I feel honored to be part of that process,” Hector said.

As many teenagers can remember, their first taste of participating in sports can be paired on the same pee-wee football or tee ball team as their best friend. Though many years have passed and interests in such sports have faded, there are still people out there who stuck with it and are now college athletes.
One of them being freshman, Brian Cano who is a member of the Men’s soccer team. Cano fell in love with soccer at a young age, playing centerback and rightback for many travel teams while eventually playing both Junior Varsity and Varsity at Sewanhaka High School.
In his senior year at Sewanhaka, Cano earned All-Conference honors while leading his team to its second playoff bid in six years. His liking for LIU Post first came from a student perspective, but when one of the school’s assistant coach’s invited him to train at an ID-camp on campus after watching him thrive in a college showcase, Cano quickly became infatuated.
Cano admits, “having [LIU Post] show that much interest in my skills on the soccer field, as well as myself already having interest in the school? It was a no-brainer.”
Cano is a speedy, crafty and a friendly soccer player. Being a voice on the field is what Cano says he is best at—if a teammate is in need of help or doesn’t see what is coming, Cano will call his teammate to look his way for the pass.
Cano credits Brazilian soccer legend Ronaldinho as his main influence on the soccer field. “I was very young when I began watching [Ronaldinho] play, and whenever he would get the ball he would make plays I had never seen before,” he said. “I always aspired to be like him—spontaneous.”
Just a few weeks into his freshman year, Cano is already enjoying his time at LIU Post and is looking forward to the opportunities that will come. Cano—also fluent in Spanish—is a sports broadcasting major who hopes to land an internship in this field as soon as possible. Working as a sports commentator in the future, “hopefully covering soccer” is Cano’s dream.
Living on campus because of location and efficiency for morning soccer practices, you can find him on the soccer field and in the classroom each day.
“I’m looking forward to doing great things as a soccer player and student. Whatever my coach or teammates need from me on the field, I will always be there to give it my all and come through for the school,” Cano concluded.

A “no- brainer”. This is what the new addition to the Pioneer family, Eric Wolf, claims when referring to both applying and accepting his job as head coach of the men’s lacrosse team. The athletic department welcomed Coach Wolf in June. He replaced former-coach, John Jez, who held the position for 11 seasons.
Wolf played Division I lacrosse at the University of Albany, and has experience in assisting Division I programs including his alma mater, the University of Albany, and Siena College. More recently, for the past two years, he has been a crucial member of the coaching sta at Harvard University, a team that participated in the Ivy League Championship in 2016.
He is excited to be in his first head coaching position, especially on Long Island, where he is from. Not only is he familiar with the location, he is also extremely knowledgeable about the national championship titles that come with this program. He is aware of the prestige that LIU Post lacrosse represents.
Wolf is “optimistic” about the upcoming spring season. It is hard to make predictions about the spring, but he has a mind-set that will guide the team in the right direction towards success: “We are going to work hard, and do things the right way. I am a believer that if you do those things, good things are going to come.”
The confidence that Coach Wolf demonstrates has an effect on the players as well, making the transition to a new coaching staff easier for members of the team of all ages and experience. “From a senior’s stand point, receiving a new coach is very difficult. The way Coach Wolf has come in and shown tremendous positivity and care for us gives me great excitement for the upcoming season. He has handled taking over the head coach role very well and professionally”, Eric Donahoe, a senior Criminal Justice major had said.
Pioneer nation will be supporting Coach Wolf and the lacrosse team this fall as they prepare for their season. This weekend, Wolf will lead them as they volunteer at the 2017 Long Island Heart Walk. The team will be scrimmaging and practicing this fall, volunteering, and supporting other sports at LIU Post. Wolf led them as they volunteered at the 2017 Long Island Heart Walk this past weekend on September 17th.
