If students go upstairs in Hillwood and walk toward the location of the Pavillion, they’ll notice a room with the door propped open. If they peer inside, they will see a couple of computers or people standing and talking while watching people play games on thecomputers. What they’ve found is Hillwood 259, or as it’s known amongst the gamers on campus, the new esports arena.
The arena recently changed locations to a more central spot compared to its previous location, room 226, the semi-circle shaped room in Hillwood above the concierge desk.
The new room sports six Alienware Aurora R7 PCs with Intel i5 8400 cores, each with a Logitech mouse and a 240Hz monitor, which makes for a well-equipped gaming setup, according to esport enthusiasts. In addition, the computers are hard-lined, which makes for minimal lag while playing online.
“The esports arena was moved because the esports program has surged in popularity,” John McDermott, the esports coach, said. “The new room has so much more space and there is a lot that can be done with the room.”
The new arena now has a pair of couches that students can sit on while waiting for a computer to open up or to simply watch other students game. Others use them to lounge with friends or catch up on schoolwork.
Students who use the room,such as Maqueisha Tierra Gillett, a sophomore business management major who is a member of the “Fortnite” team, are enjoying the change of venue.
“I enjoy the new room,” she said, “It’s better for spectators to watch, or if we just want to hang out and enjoy the company of our teammates.”
But not everybody has grown to like the new room. “It isn’t a proper place for them to dump us into,” a varsity team member said. There are a total of six computers in the arena, which according to team members, is just enough to play “Rocket League 3v3’s” and nothing else. “Rocket League” 3v3’s are a 3-on-3 contest between two teams in the video game.
The team members also noted the volume of people, sometimes as many as 16, who visit the room during common hour. With only six computers available, it’s extremely difficult for teams to practice together because they can’t kick off other varsity players who are also practicing.
Vice President of the Esports Club, Tim McIntyre, a senior game design major and a member of the “Hearthstone” team, expressed that the new room has potential to be a real focal point for gaming and esports on campus but a few issues need to be addressed first.
“The current issue with it is the lack of computers…and the TV’s have not been transferred over yet,” he said, referencing the six TV monitors from the old room. Each served as a live feed from a corresponding computer, allowing spectators to watch from anywhere in the room.
The old room had six desks pushed together, each with its own PC, monitor, keyboard,mouse, and headset, creating a gaming conglomerate. Now, in the more spacious room,each desk is separated, creating six different gaming areas.
This is too much room for some varsity members. Andrew Serken, a junior history and philosophy major who also plays for the “Hearthstone” team, noted that the old room “felt more teamly” and that he “liked how close all of the PCs were.”
Coach McDermott didn’t comment on the need for additional computers or what will bedone with the extra space in the room. However, he enjoys the extra space and believes it will benefit the arena moving forward. “There is a lot that can be done with this room,” McDermott said, “It presents a great opportunity to really grow the program.”

Valentine’s Day is just around the corner and students are getting ready for the day of love. Some students have big plans for the holiday, ranging from going on a date with a significant other, buying gifts for family, hanging out with friends, or going to see “Sonic the Hedgehog” in theaters.
Glenn Peters, senior health science major, plans on taking his valentine out to dinner and getting her flowers and a box of her favorite candy, Kit Kats. Glenn prefers to get her Kit Kats over traditional Valentine’s Day chocolates because of the “weird flavors” in regularchocolatess, and he knows that she will like them better.
Some students are unable to spend the day with their significant other. Adreana Lomini freshman speech pathology major, is in a long distance relationship, so they will be mailing a gift to their girlfriend for Valentine’s day this year.
Many students plan to spend the day with family or friends. “I just spend time with family because that’s my love,” Sabrina Anath, a junior nursing major, said.
“I usually get flowers and a teddy bear for my mom just to spoil her.”
Students in the Emerging Student Theater Artists (ESTA) improv group “No Control” willbe putting on their first show of the semester on Valentine’s Day this year. Freshman theatre major Saffron Cooper plans to go see the show with all of her friends. “It’s prettybig for the theater kids to go out and support No Control, so we’ll go and have a good time,” she said.
William Villalobos, a junior criminal justice major, has to work on Valentine’s Day, butplans on meeting up with friends afterwards. “After work, I’m probably going to head to the movies with my friends, probably go see ‘Sonic,’” he said.
Students also offered their advice for their peers looking for ways to spend Valentine’s Day. “If you have a significant other, there is no shame in asking ahead of time what they would be into, or what they like,” Tyrese Bailey, a senior psychology major, said. “Not everything has to be a surprise.”
Bailey also believes that Valentine’s Day doesn’t necessarily have to be about spending time with others. “If you’re celebrating by yourself then enjoy time with you,” he said.
“I feel like Valentine’s Day would be a great day to hang out with your family and yourfriends,” Villalobos said. “I would say go to a restaurant, maybe do something at home like watch a movie. Just enjoy time with the people you love.”

The Bookstore located in Hillwood Commons received new merchandise for the 2019-2020 academic year. The Sharks logo is featured in most apparel, as well as the new slogan “Be True to Blue.”
New items include hoodies, sweatshirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing ranging from $20 to $70. There are also various other items including dorm decorations, key-chains and lanyards for sale.
Jorge Lanas, the bookstore manager, commented on his personal favorites of the newmerchandise. “I like the blue color. It is more vibrant and brightens the store up,” Lanas said.
Other than the school color features, there are also updated styles. “I like the new types of quarter zips. They look very comfortable and also stylish,” Brittany Fazin, a junior health science major and resident assistant, said. “The new flags are really cute; however, they are contraband in the dorms since they are fire hazards.”

The current sports team featured for this semester is Lacrosse, with hoodies available forstudent purchase. Emily Poole, a sophomore sports management major who plays for the women’s soccer team, noticed her sport and team wasn’t featured in the bookstore.
“I like how they are integrating sports into the bookstore so students can support athletics,” she said. “I would like to be able to purchase clothes that represent soccer to send home to my parents so that when they come to watch our games, they have something that says soccer on it.”
Lanas said the store has future plans to include additional teams in their merchandise.
“We are planning to set up other sports on our website [liunet.bncollege.com] where all sports, including those on the Brooklyn campus, will be featured, as well as other departments such as the school of nursing, business, etc,” he said.
The bookstore chooses their apparel based on poll results from Instagram and Facebook. It also changes the apparel seasonally and students can expect to see variations of sports team graphics, according to Lanas.
“Whatever we find is most popular, the vendors will give us a template to pick and choose with the university,” he said.
For any questions, comments or suggestions, Lanas said “feel free to contact me at SM722@bncollege.com.”

A new set of letters are coming in the near future, as Phi Delta Theta (PDT) is looking to become the twelfth Greek organization on campus. The new fraternity was established in 1848 at Miami University in Ohio.
Alex Atkinson, a representative of PDT, said Phi Delta Theta Fraternity will give students a new opportunity to stand out and lead with purpose. It allows individuals to take what they learn in the classroom and apply it within a real-life, entrepreneurial experience.
With PDT being the twelfth Greek organization on campus, it’s important for the organization to differentiate itself from the others. “Phi Delta Theta is a premier fraternal leadership development organization,” Atkinson said. “Phi Delta Theta philanthropy and community service are essential to the Phi Delta Theta experience, and one of the many ways Phi Delta sets itself apart from other fraternities and sororities. In fact, our open motto is: ‘We enjoy life by the help and society of others.’”
The fraternity’s philanthropic focus is to leave Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS) “better than we found it,” according to Atkinson. Baseball legend Lou Gehrig was a member of Phi DeltaTheta at Columbia University in 1921. The Fraternity’s support of the LiveLikeLou Foundation, which supports ALS research, patients and their families, enables it to make an impact on the disease.
Each PDT chapter has the opportunity to create unique events that impact the cause,according to Atkinson. Individuals can work to become Iron Phi which is the mission tostrengthen the Phi Delta Theta International Fraternity and the impact it has on the fightagainst Lou Gehrig’s disease through fundraising and athletic efforts of its members whochallenge themselves to achieve a personal goal and raise funds for ALS in the process.
PDT has been operating for over 170 years. The organization has expanded to over 275campuses and initiated more than 270,000 men. Some students have had various reactions to a new Greek Organization coming to their campus.
“I’m excited about possibly joining because it’s like a clean slate fraternity because they don’t have a tradition here or anything. I imagine they’ll be more laid back and chill,”Jordan Geogiano, a junior history major, said. Since some students are in favor of PDT, it’s important to know what else it has to offer.
“Starting a chapter of [the] Phi Delta Theta fraternity is the perfect opportunity to develop the skills needed to be successful in their [student’s] career,” Atkinson said.
Founding members will be challenged to create a legacy of excellence that differentiates itself from other organizations on campus. PDT has laid a foundation for the success of various careers. Connecting members to the over 6,000 local alumni is just the start to how PDT’s network can set student members up for success.
As of Feb. 11, 2020, PDT has 191 chapters and colonies, along with approximately 178,000 living alumni and 100 alumni clubs in the United States and Canada. The Fraternity operates from its General Headquarters building on South Campus Avenue, across from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. It stands by the pillars of the cultivation of friendship among its members, and the personal attainment of a high standard of morality, according to Atkinson.
PDT will begin its recruitment this semester with the goal to have an established group up and running by the end of the semester. Students interested in joining can look outfor PDT’s scheduled introductory meetings or they can contact Atkinson directly at aatkinson@phideltatheta.org.

In Australia, STA-SAFE, an independent collection of health groups is starting a new program of pill testing at music festivals due to the recent deaths of some young concert goers. This has sparked debate around the world and countries,including America, have organizations such as DanceSafe, that are looking for solutions.
Since 2010 there has been an increasing number of deaths at music festivals. In September 2018, two individuals died at Lost Land in Ohio, one person died atNocturnal Land in California, two people died at Defqon.1 in Sydney and anotherseven died at “Trip To The Moon” in Hanoi, Vietnam. The deaths were related tosuspected drug overdoses.
People in America are no stranger to this problem. Since 2002, 10 people have died at the Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee, and in 2013, seven people died across the country from drug related causes at music festivals, with two of those deaths occurring at EZOO music festival in New York. The festival shut down on the last day as a result. The cause of death for these individuals was not from the drug itself, it is a result of dehydration and overheating.
On campus, students welcome the idea of pill testing. Julia Chanice, junior fashion merchandising major, attended EZOO in 2013. “This was quite a scary and traumatic experience when these two deaths were announced,” she said. Chanice was shocked when she learned that the most common cause of death related to MDMA is actually heatstroke. “I had no idea,” she said. “I attend a lot of music festivals and have seen a lot of incidents related to drugs… the use of pill testing would be beneficial and would help prevent the number of deaths and hospitalizations related to drugs.”
DanceSafe is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that provides information on drug use and drug testing services. However, this organization has not been allowed at many major festivals due to the potential legal and financial consequences related to the RAVE Act. This act grants authorities the right to prosecute event organizers and venue owners for enabling the use, or distribution of controlled substances on their premises.
“From working at EZOO in 2018 I believe that an organization like DanceSafe would have been very useful,” Heather Felix, senior public relations major, said. She worked for Boxed Water at the festival.
“Alone, a medical tent is not enough to care for the thousands of people at the festival site. The only free water was from the refill station, which isn’t adequate when there is just one refill station for the thousands of attendees,” she said.

Students volunteered for the Night to Shine event which took place at Church Unleashed on Friday, Feb. 7. Night to Shine is an annua levent hosted by the Tim Tebow Foundation, celebrating the lives of people with special needs and how unique they are.

The field hockey and football teams volunteered to help at the event. Most were “buddies,” who spent the night with a guest as their date, while some were a part of the welcoming committee.
“It was amazing. I paired with a boy named Peter and it was such a fun night,” Michaela Zabicki, a sophomore sports management major, said. “We danced the night away, had a great dinner and had some nice conversations about our interests and hobbies.”
The church had a wide range of activities guests could enjoy such as karaoke, pet therapy, shoe shining for the gentlemen, and makeup and hair for the ladies.
“The event was great,” Rachel Vellis, a junior criminal justice major said. “Spending just afew hours hanging out with them made them and their parents [or] caregivers so happy, and it also changed my life because it really put into perspective how lucky we really are.”

Like most proms, Night to Shine featured a crowning ceremony to award the titles of prom king and queen, but with a slight twist. In this prom, all of the guests were crowned kings and queens. Their reactions and emotions were full of excitement and joy.
This wasn’t the first time freshman special education major Alexis Ruiz volunteered foran event like this, but it was just as rewarding.
“There’s nothing better than taking time out of your day [and] being there for others,” Ruiz said. “They are uniquely designed by God, and they deserve to feel as special as we do.”

The Wave radio station will host a Galentine’s Day event to celebrate female empowerment and friendship on Thursday, Feb. 13.
Originally inspired by the sitcom “Parks and Recreation,” Galentine’s Day is an annual tradition invented by the character Leslie Knope to celebrate ladies and enjoy decadent breakfast foods.
The event will be held in the End Zone, where two films, “10 Things I Hate About You” and “For a Good Time, Call” will be shown from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
“10 Things I Hate About You” was a comedy released in 1999 and follows the tale of twopolar opposite sisters in high school experiencing love for the first time. One of the sisters, however, is unknowingly with a boy who was paid to date her.
“For a Good Time, Call” was released in 2012 and shows the journey of two reluctantroommates who become phone sex operators.
Everyone that comes to see the showings will receive complimentary popcorn and agoodie bag. There will also be an ice cream bar and other snacks available for purchase.
Tickets for the event will be sold in Hillwood Commons Feb. 10 through Feb. 12, and are $5 for two people.
Tickets not purchased ahead of time will cost $5 per person upon entry. Doors open at 6:45 p.m., and the first movie will begin at 7:15 p.m.
In addition to providing a fun movie night before Valentine’s Day, students who run TheWave intend to promote the campus radio station.
“[We want] to raise funds for the radio station and make students on campus more aware that [it] exists,” Samantha Uebel, senior broadcasting major and WCWP program director, said.
Uebel believes that if the event does well it can lead to more movie nights in the future.
“I hope the event is super successful,” she said. Anyone is welcome to attend the event, not just gals and “Parks and Recreation” fans.

The sculpture gallery housed the Juried art exhibition from Feb. 4-9. Undergraduate and graduate students were welcome to submit their artwork to the show, with no maximum number of pieces they can select for entry.
“We usually ask our visiting MFA professors to be the juror, and it allows students to submit their work, and for someone who has not seen them in classes to judge the work by its merits,” Winn Rea, professor of fine arts, said. Students in applicable programs were informed about the show via email.
The Juried exhibition had a generous turnout as students entered their work for the chance to win awards. Susan Kelly, the exhibition coordinator said the exhibition contained a nice variety of work done by students of varying grade levels. Because of this, students in the beginning stages of their studies got to show work alongside those who are in the final phases of their degree programs.
Each person who visited the art show had their own favorite pieces, but some had a hard time deciding.
“[It’s pretty] hard to say because they’re all so different. [There are] so many different styles, [and] so many different meanings, Madelynn Ehmer, senior arts education major, said.
Ehmer submitted a photo for the exhibition that she took last semester while working at a haunted house. Her favorite element about it was the contrast between the red and green lighting.
“I wander a lot when I take photos and see what catches my eye,” she said.
Olivia Greise, freshman fine arts major, entered three pieces of work into the exhibition and won and Honorable Mention Award.
“This is my first Juried exhibition, I’ve entered during the years. If I had to assume the based off theme and message, I think all of the artwork here is really great,” she said about winning her award at the show. “I am surprised [to have won], but I’m also thankful for the award. It’s very nice, and I really wasn’t expecting it.”
Greise included a digitally designed book in the pieces she submitted. “I have a book here that represents something that should be brought to greater awareness in society: mental health awareness,” she said. To make the piece, she hand-rendered the book and scanned it into Photoshop for adjustments. Since mental health is important to her, Greise’s inspiration for this piece was to bring the stigma some people have about mental health to light.
She also included a photograph. “I have a photography piece of two apples to represent aging,” she said. There’s an older, rotten apple that juxtaposes a ripe, younger looking apple.”
Students can anticipate the next reception at the Sculpture Gallery on Wednesday, Feb. 12 when BFA student Lucia Terry showcases her work.

The retail company Express announced they were downsizing stores when CEO Tim Baxter released a statement on Jan. 22 . Along with CEO David Simmon’s declaration of Forever 21’s bankruptcy on Dec. 11, students might witness these two examples of fast fashion’s current decline.
Margaret Nicklas, professor of luxury branding and fashion media, described fast fashion and lists the top fast fashion retailers as Zara and H&M.
“Fast fashion is a concept that was really invented and democratized by Zara and H&M where they are strongly inspired by looks from luxury players and brands and [they] are able to reinterpret them in cheaper fabrications and get them out to the masses very quickly at very affordable prices,” Nicklas said. This means fast fashion retailers recreate almost identical copies of runway looks at cheaper prices with lower quality fabrics.
This concept took off in the late 1990s and early 2000s when online shopping was born and fast fashion retailers took over, according to “Good On You’s” Aug. 7 article. Stores like Zara and H&M took looks and design inspiration from top design houses and reproduced cheaper and lower quality clothing at an expedited rate. This idea quickly took off and became the huge part of fashion it is today.
Freshman fashion merchandising major, Alexa Jones, has recently quit fast fashion. “Theexcess amount of fabrics and fiber that are not being used and thrown away or have not been bought is very damaging to the environment” she said.
In response to why fast fashion is suddenly declining, Jones said people are beginning tosee the negative effects unused materials have on the environment. Clothing items that don’t sell or are thrown away when the consumer is done with it, the material is non-recyclable and is dumped into landfills. The clothing then can take up to years to decompose.
Nicklas described this affinity for fast fashion “People are considering fashion to be disposable so people will buy just to have [clothes] and wear something once or twice and then discard it,” she said. “As frequently as it gets turned in store it gets turned in your closet.” This lack of value put behind clothes leads to the mass production that fast fashion entails.
When Forever 21 declared bankruptcy, the announcement caused a passionate reaction for fashion students.
“Forever 21 used to be one of my favorite stores because it was always inexpensive andthey had cute things, but that was when I was younger,” Cassandra Cerbone, a freshman fashion merchandising major said. “The past few years, they had so many of the stupid graphic tees and all the cringey outfits you can put together, and they had some really weird collaboraions with Hot Cheetos and United Postal Service.”
Jones shared this sentiment. “I wasn’t surprised at all because they [Forever 21] haven’t been adapting to the changing environment in the fashion industry. They were not living up to those standards and it caught up with them, and they are overproducing bad stuff,” she said.
Forever 21’s bankruptcy was followed by Express’s recent downsizing. Nicklas expectedthis downsizing, having worked closely with students in Generation Z (born between 1995- 2012). Nicklas believes their passion for the environment and preservation of the earth was bound to cause some changes in the industry.
While sustainability might be an ongoing trend for the future of fashion, fast fashion retailers like Zara and H&M continue to cater to a demand that still exists in the fashion world. “I think it’s always gonna have a few players…it does serve a purpose,” Nicklas said.
Some students may take it upon themselves to make the future of sustainability and the end of fast fashion a reality. While Jones has quit fast fashion altogether, Cerbone has started her own shop on the website Etsy.com where she upcycles secondhand college t-shirts. Cerbone takes the shirts and crops them, makes them into tube tops, and she adds personalization details and other design styles. “Basically I take boring college shirts and make them cute,” she said.
“A percentage of the profits would go to an organization based in New York called Responsibility in Fashion,” Cerbone said. Responsibility in Fashion is a non-profit organization that works to make fashion more socially and environmentally ethical.

Students might be familiar with the Grimm Brothers’ tale of “Hansel and Gretel,” alongwith the characters of a cruel witch and the two children she stuffs with sweets in preparation for consuming them.
Having arrived at the Showcase Cinema de Lux on Feb. 4 to see “Gretel and Hansel,” Iexpected a remake of another childhood story. However, students should be prepared to be pleasantly proved wrong.
“I expected it to be a story book exaggeration from the original tale, but it felt like there was a whole other story to be told,” Kayla Halper, junior nursing major, said.
Writer and director Osgood Perkins set the chilling atmosphere of the film the moment it begins by including dark lighting, eerie music, supernatural implements such as the forest communicating, and subdued colored clothing. All is not what it seems from the very start.
In the earliest scenes, the viewer delves into the daily life of 8-year-old Hansel (Sam Leakey) and his older sister Gretel (Sophia Lillis), who is 16 years old. The two siblings quickly have a fallout with their distraught mother and have nowhere else to go, so they resort to exploring the woods for food, shelter or help. After searching for an immeasurable amount of time, the children seem hopeless. At this moment, the audience is expecting a magnificently frightening entrance by the infamous witch, a pure wolf in sheep’s clothing who turns up just when she is needed most.
A house appears in the heart of the woods. The children peek into the windows and see a dining table set from edge to edge with delicious food, a warm fire, and presumably no owners. That is, until an elderly woman immerges, desperate for company and mouths to feed. With the offerings of a warm bed, endless amounts of food, and a figure to guide them, the children could not refuse. However, all things come at a price. A price that a demonic creature would happily impose.

The 92nd Academy Awards (The Oscars) aired Sunday, Feb. 9, and it surprised viewers with historical and record-breaking moments. Although the hostless ceremony received its lowest viewership in history, it consisted of memorable highlights which gave the show an underlying message of unity.
Known to some in Hollywood as the “whitest” awards ceremony around, the academysteered clear of receiving the repeat hashtag #OscarsSoWhite from previous years byawarding five golden statuettes to the South Korean dark-comedy “Parasite” directed byJoon-Ho Bong.
“Parasite” was the first non-English speaking picture in Oscar history to win the Best Film category, beating eight other favorites such as Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” and Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time In Hollywood.”
“It brings diversity to the movie world and inspires other people from across the world to fulfill their dreams; especially the youth of South Korea,” Travis Fortounas, a senior journalism major, said. “It brings them hope that one day they can be like they’re favorite director and or screenwriter.” Bong’s film also took home awards for best directing, film editing, international film and original screenplay.
Former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama also made history whentheir production company Higher Ground snagged the best documentary award for“American Factory.” Although they didn’t attend the ceremony or accept the award themselves, they now hold the honor for being the first presidential couple to win an Oscar for backing a film.
Karen Rupert Toliver also reached a milestone when she became the first black womanto take home the win for best animated short, along with her production partner, Matthew A. Cherry, for their film “Hair Love.” Kobe Bryant was the first African-American to ever win this category.
The late Bryant was also the first to be remembered in the Oscars’ memoriam segmentwhich was backed by vocals of recent Grammy record breaker Billie Eilish who sang her own sulky version of The Beatles’ “Imagine.”
Junior journalism major, Michael Domagala, was touched to see Bryant be the firstremembered.
“Basketball fan or not, Kobe had an impact on everyone. His Oscar for his short film a couple years back just shows what direction he was heading into in his post basketballcareer – a positive one,” he said.
Rap icon Eminem, also known as Marshall Mathers, finally made an Oscar appearance,dropping the jaws of most in the audience. He performed “Lose Yourself,” his Oscar-winning song from 17 years ago which was featured in the film “8 Mile.” While some looked shocked just to see him, the real surprise was that he actually showed up.
“The crowd seemed to be taken by shock. Some faces in the crowd were confused andsome were jumping out of their seats because that’s the music they knew growing up,” Fortounas said.
Brad Pitt, who has hidden behind the scenes over the last few years, was seated in the front row for Eminem’s performance. The actor snagged himself the first award of the night for best supporting actor – a well deserved win, according to Domagala.
“He was a staple in the movie ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ and his character, CliffBooth, has kind of become this cult hero since the movie came out. He and Leonardo DiCaprio were on-screen magic and worked very well together,” he said.
“Once Upon A Time In Hollywood” became one of Domagala’s all-time favorite movies after he saw it in theaters.
“I got the DVD of it for Christmas and have watched it two times since. I’ve told lots of family and friends to watch it because there’s so much 60s nostalgia in it. Tarantino making a movie about the Manson family with DiCaprio and Pitt as the leads is adream come true for movie buffs,” he said.
Pitt took time during his acceptance speech to get political. “They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,” he said. “I’m thinking maybe Quentin [Tarantino] does a movie about it. In the end, the adults do the right thing.”
Pitt received a lot of backlash over the political jab on social media, along with actress Renée Zellweger and actor Joaquin Phoenix, who also used their speech time to acknowledge the world’s current state of affairs. Many viewers left comments blaming the award show’s viewership decline on this very thing.
“I love Brad Pitt, and I understand the political comment he made. I mean, it was funny, but I’m not a fan of politics always being brought up at these award shows. Let’s talk movies; not politics,” Domagala said.

Every Super Bowl, a celebrity performs a star-studded halftime show to entertain viewers at the event and viewers watching from home. Super Bowl LIV was held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Fla., with two main halftime performers: Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. With Miani’s deep Latin roots, choosing two of the largest Reggaeton artists as the main performers stood as a celebration of culture for the location.
“The halftime superbowl showcase with [Jennifer Lopez] and Shakira was amazing. I really enjoyed seeing two latina women as the headliners of the halftime show; that has never happened before,” Haniyah Baugh, a freshman forensic science major, said.
The performance opened with Shakira wearing a fiery red two-piece outfit surrounded by dozens of dancers in similar attire to perform the song “She Wolf.” Shakira continued to perform six more of her songs: “Empire,” “Whenever, Wherever,” “I Like It (feat J. Balvin),” “Chantaje,” and ended on her most popular song, “Hips Don’t Lie.” J. Balvin made a special appearance for the song “I Like It” for a duet with Shakira.
Jennifer Lopez showed off the training she endured for the movie “Hustlers” by entering the performance on a dancing pole in a black leather biker vest, satin pink skirt, and knee-high black boots. She almost immediately removed the skirt revealing the outfit to be a leather one-piece with the boots attached.
Lopez was supported by dancers in matching leather biker jackets, shiny skirts, andmatching black hats with gold trim. She entered into a classic of hers: “Jenny From theBlock,” which progressed into the song “Ain’t It Funny.” Lopez performed five more songs afterwards.
Emme Maribel Muñiz, Lopez’s daughter, and a children’s choir began the song “Let’s Get Loud” showcasing children in luminescent cages and the children’s choir wearing matching sweatshirts with the flag of the USA bedazzled on them. Shakira performed the drum part to “Let’s Get Loud” behind Muñiz while he performed.
Lopez then entered the stage in a feathered double-sided cape to sing “Born In the USA” with her daughter. One side featured the flag of Puerto Rico while the other featured the flag of the USA.
To finish the performance, the duo sang “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” ending indance performances. Shakira danced to WakaWaka, with Lopez proceeding to end on “Let’s Get Loud,” and the duo ended together in the center of the stage.
The performance was heavily influenced by Latin culture, showcasing Puerto Rican andColombian culture.
“The Latina energy was radiating throughout the stadium and could be felt for those at home too,” DeAnna Aguinaldo, a sophomore radiology technology major, said. “A striking performance, definitely more enjoyable than last year’s.”

More than 102 million viewers tuned in to watch Super Bowl LIV on Sunday, Feb. 2. In this year’s faceoff, the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers went head-to-head for the title of Super Bowl Champions.
One of the millions of viewers was freshman acting major William Jahn who had a get-together in his room with some friends.
“We all bet a dollar for the team we thought would win, got competitive, played some games, ordered food from the End Zone and enjoyed each other’s company,” he said. Jahn added that the 49ers had the most votes among his friends, but that he was rooting for the Chiefs.
“When they won, I felt awesome because I won my dollar back,” he said.
Jahn wasn’t the only one feeling great when the Kansas City Chiefs won. Bently Boekhout, a freshman sports management major from Kansas, was excited over the win.
“I’ve been rooting for them my whole life, and it was good to finally see them win. It felt like a very full circle moment for me,” Boekhout said.
But the night was not so lucky for 49ers fans. Tyran Williams, freshman forensic science major, was not happy with the outcome of the game.
“I was rather upset because I did not believe it was a well-earned loss,” he said. The 49ers had the lead for most of the game and some, in my opinion, shaky calls and one bad play messed them up.”
Despite the disappointment, Williams saw one positive aspect with the game. “At the end of the day, it’s good the underdogs got their win, but I think the 49ers should have won,” he said.
Williams watched the close game at the End Zone where a Super Bowl watch party was arranged. The game was viewed on all the TVs in the room, and there were people from all around campus at the event, according to Williams.
“People were there playing pool, watching the game, and eating some wings and pizza,” he said.

The men’s lacrosse team lost to Siena College with a score of 12-14 in their first inaugural game as a Division I program onSaturday, Feb. 8.
Despite the loss, freshman Sean Boll made a major impact in his collegiate debut with five goals for the Sharks. Junior Will Snelders also played a key role adding one goal and five assists.
The Sharks are now standing in front of a long stretch of games before seeing conference action. They will take on St. Johns University on Saturday, Feb. 22 and Hofstra University on Saturday, Feb. 29, and in the beginning of March the team will play against Fairfield University, Quinnipiac University and the University of Massachusetts.
The team’s first conference game is on Saturday, March 14 against the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, N. J. In the NEC preseason coaches’ poll, the Sharks were picked fifth in the NEC West Division. The NEC Division is a particularly difficult one with two-time NEC reigning champion, Robert Morris University as the frontrunner.
Knowing the teams they will play high level competition, the Sharks’ Head Coach Eric Wolf said his team will primarily focus on their own progress.
“We’re really focused on our own growth and reaching our potential as opposed to the external stuff and comparing yourself to someone else,” Wolf said. “Because if we’re doing our best, then it’s not going to matter what anyone else is doing.”
Looking at this season’s roster, the Sharks are returning their top seven goalscorers from last year’s Pioneer team. Three of them are Will Snelders who finished last season with 55 goals, Jake Gillis who finished with 47 goals and Alex Russell who scored 21 goals. In terms of a game plan, Coach Wolf’s isto play aggressively and fast, and as tough as they can for the full 60 minutes. “And if it requires more, then we’ll go more,” he said.
Next up for the Sharks is their first home game of the season against Wagner College on Saturday, Feb. 15 at 1 p.m. at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.

The men’s basketball team defeated the first place Merrimack Warriors in a conference game on Saturday, Feb. 8, walking away victorious in overtime with a score of 67-64. In addition to that, it was a record-breaking day for LIU, as three Sharks hit career marks during the game.
It was a tight-knit game, as both teams went back and forth throughout the first half. Each team used small runs to their advantage, but every lead stayed within single digits. In halftime, the Sharks headed to the locker room with a three-point lead (32-29).
However, it was Merrimack who started the second half the strongest. The Warriors went on a 9-0 run to take a 38-32 lead, and they wouldn’t stop there. They went up by as many as nine points, as they took a 45-36 lead with 13 minutes left to play in the game.
Despite the deficit, the Sharks managed to fight back and answered with an 11-0 run, making it a close game once again. Sophomore Virshon Cotton hit a late basket to give the Sharks a 58-55 lead with 31 seconds left, but the Warriors answered with a three pointer and sent the game to overtime.
The Sharks opened the overtime period with a 7-0 run, but the Warriors answered with a 6-0 run of their own to make the score 65-64 in the final 30 seconds. However, Merrimack needed to foul to keep their hopes alive, and the Sharks were able to convert three out of four free throws to give themselves a 67- 64 victory.
With the win, the Sharks improved their record (6-5) in the NEC with seven games remaining, keeping their hopes alive to get the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. They are currently placed on fifth place in the NEC, just one game behind St. Francis University.
Besides putting the team in a better position in the conference, the win also included broken records. During the overtime period, senior Raiquan Clark became LIU’s all-time leading scorer with 1,874 total career points so far.
Redshirt junior Ty Flowers had 27 rebounds, which is a new campus record for rebounds in a game, and the most in any game ever in the Northeast Conference. The 27 rebounds broke a mark set exactly 37 years prior to the game, in 1983.
Finally, Head Coach Derek Kellogg earned his 200th career victory as a head coach. “It was a really good night to be a Shark,” he said in his post game press conference.
Coming up, the Sharks will head to Central Connecticut State University to take on the Blue Devils on Thursday, Feb. 13 at 7 p.m.
