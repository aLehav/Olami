On April 9 from 6:30 p.m. – 9 p.m., the Post Anime Gaming and Entertainment Society (P.A.G.E.S) is hosting a charity tournament in the fishbowl in Hillwood Commons. The main event will consist of a deck building card game, and then participants will play a Swiss Tournament in 45 minutes, best of two out of three matches. The top eight players will receive prizes. The winner’s prize is “Magic: The Gathering” 2015 Fat Pack; second place prize is a MTG 2015 Deck Builders Tool Kit.
All proceeds from the event will be donated to Child’s Play, a charity that provides children in hospitals with toys and games. Participants donate $5 to Child’s Play to participate in the tournament. For the $5 fee to enter the tournament, participants receive “Magic: The Gathering Intro Pack,” which contains one pre-constructed 60-card deck and two Booster Packs, which in stores costs up to $20. The cards in the pack are to be used during the tournament, but each player gets to keep their cards after the event.
“The event is open to everyone, and it is not a must to participate in the card game – everyone is welcome to come and watch the tournament,” said Ryan Cavanaugh, a senior Criminal Justice and History major, and president of P.A.G.E.S.
The gaming and anime club has been on campus for a long time, and Cavanaugh described his club’s history. “This year is P.A.G.E.S’ tenth year at Post. Although we’ve had different names in past years, it’s always been the same club.”
“We are a big group of friendly people who come together to have fun with [those] who share similar interests. We’re very laid-back people who are into a huge range of video games, tabletop games, TV shows, movies, and anime. We do just about everything,” Cavanaugh said.
Cavanaugh mentioned that the choice to fundraise for Child’s Play during the tournament was a given, as the charity’s goal goes hand in hand with the club’s standpoint. “Our goal is to bring fun to everyone. This is why we often work with the charity Child’s Play, because they bring fun toys and games to sick children who need a [reason] to smile.” According to Child’s Play’s website, their goal is to improve the life of children in hospitals and domestic violence shelters by providing them with games and toys.
“Our club has never done an event exactly like the charity tournament before, however, we have run charity gaming tournaments featuring Super Smash Bros and Mortal Kombat, and have worked with Child’s Play in the past,” Cavanaugh explained. The club’s previous gaming tournaments have had huge successes: “We hope this tournament will turn out even better,” Cavanaugh added.
Ben Doscher, a senior Accounting major who is a member of P.A.G.E.S, said “I’m really excited about this event, I hope to see a lot of participants in the tournament so that we can raise a lot of money for a great charity.”
“I will attend the event and encourage everyone to come, as all proceeds go to a great cause,” said Alexander Najman, a professor of Philosophy and the advisor of P.A.G.E.S, said.
P.A.G.E.S meets every Tuesday at 6 p.m in the Game Room, which is located on the first floor of Hillwood Commons. “During our meetings we usually play some games, watch a few movies or anime shows, and really just chill and have a good time. Everyone is welcome to join us,” Cavanaugh said.

The Humane League, a non- profit animal rights organization, created a petition on change.org on Feb. 28 against Aramark, the company that operates the campus’ food service, for the alleged mistreatment of animals.
Aramark provides food for many other schools as well, and provides the food at venues such as Nikon Jones Beach Theatre. The petition implores that Aramark switch suppliers, like some of their competitors have, and stop the use of battery-cage eggs.
Many students may not be aware of the living conditions of the animals that The Humane League alleges Aramark uses for its food. Aramark has been supporting “farms” that use battery-cage chickens to provide their eggs, according to The Humane League.
“When the public, animal welfare experts, and environmental protection agencies are demanding an end to battery cages, there is no reason for your company to remain on the wrong side of history,” The Humane League said in their petition against Aramark.
“It defies animal rights and is demonstrating a poor sense of morality,” said Samantha Heapps, a sophomore Public Relations major. Many universities, such as Campbell University and Corban College, have joined the petition against Aramark for using battery-caged chickens to provide their eggs.
Aramark strongly denies these allegations. “For many years, Aramark has been working in partnership with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the nation’s largest and most effective animal protection organization,” said Paul Carroll, Director of Operations at Aramark. “We have taken a number of steps in the area of animal welfare over the last several years, including sourcing 30 million cage-free eggs this year, and only gestation crate-free pork by 2017,” Carroll added. “The reality is that less than 10 percent of the total egg-laying hen flock in the U.S. is cage-free today.”
For battery-caged chickens, multiple hens are cramped into one small cage, with practically no room to sit, let alone move, and are often sick and denied veterinary care, according to the ASPCA’s website.
According to the ASPCA’s website, ASPCA.org, “The frustration of living in such tight quarters sometimes leads to fighting. To lessen the problem, factory farms burn or slice off a portion of the each hen’s beak,”
Campaign Coordinator of The Humane League, Taylor Ford, confirms these conditions. “We knew Aramark was using battery-cage eggs because when we initially reached out to them, they responded that they would consider a switch, hence implying that they initially use battery-caged eggs,” she said.
“We also knew this because it is an industry standard, and if a dining provider doesn’t advertise a 100 percent cage-free operation, we can assume they are using battery cage eggs without question,” Ford said.
Along with creating a petition on change.org, Ford said The Humane League launched dozens of campaigns on social media, in advertisements, and created videos against Aramark and some of their clients. “We also connected with student groups to petition on their campuses for Aramark to be removed,” she said.
“Earlier this month, after a campaign and change.org petition from The Humane League, Aramark’s competitor, Sodexo, made a commitment to boycott cruel battery-cage egg farms,” The Humane League said in its petition.
The petition for Aramark to stop using battery-cage eggs was recently updated as a success, with over 78,000 supporters, as of March 12. Carroll said Aramark “will expand its cage-free egg commitment to include all company purchases of liquid, pre-cracked eggs in the U.S. by 2020, or sooner if supplies become available,” and that “it will take suppliers literally years to change to entirely cage-free production.”
The Pioneer reached out to LIU’s Chief of Staff, Jackie Nealon, for comment; however, Nealon has yet to respond.

Astronaut Mike Hopkins concluded the 2014-2015 “Express- Yo-Faith” series with a lecture on April 7, at 7:30 p.m. in the Interfaith Center. His talk highlighted the Catholic point of view of how science and faith complement each other.
“As Brother Guy discussed last semester, the entire Scientific Method was developed within the context of the faith, thus affirming the Catholic position that religion and science are not in opposition of one another,” Father Ted Brown explained.
Hopkins discussed his experience in space with the aid of pictures he took, and how this experience deepened his faith as a devout Catholic.
This lecture was the last for the semester of the “Express-Yo- Faith” series hosted by the Newman Club. Prominent professionals discussed their lives, faith, profession, and how the three intersect with each other.
The series at LIU is modeled after Boston College’s “Agape Latte” series, which now encourages other campuses in America to become their affiliates, according to an article published by Boston College’s student newspaper, The Gavel. “LIU hopes to become an official affiliate of the Agape Latte program and change its ‘Express-Yo-Faith’ series to ‘Agape Latte’ next semester,” Father Brown said.
At Boston College, this is a monthly program that informs students about faith and religion in a social environment. Stonehill College, Manhattan College, and Babson College are just a few universities at which students created events like “Agape Latte.”
“Express-Yo-Faith” has been held every semester since last fall. Last semester, Coach Collins, Kerry Webber, the Associate Editor of America Magazine and author of Mercy in the City, and Vatican Astronomer Brother Guy Consolmango spoke at respective lectures. This semester, the series includes lectures by Dr. Michael Soupios and Hopkins.
Hopkins was in the International Space Station for six months in late 2013–2014. He has a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from University of Illinois, and a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Stanford University. He has received two Air Force Commendation Medals, three Air Force Achievement Medals, and countless others.
Upon graduation from Stanford in 1992, Hopkins was commissioned as second lieutenant in the US Air Force. In 2005, he was assigned to the United States Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office at the Pentagon, where he served as a project engineer and program manager. In July 2009, he was one among 14 members of the 20th NASA astronaut class. By 2011, he graduated from Astronaut Candidate Training, which included preparations for space travel such as intensive instruction in International Space Station systems, physiological training, flight training, and survival training.
On September 25, 2013, Hopkins launched to the International Space Station as a part of Expedition 37/38. While aboard the space station, Hopkins conducted U.S. spacewalks to replace a degraded pump module in 12 hours and 58 minutes. One hundred and sixty-six days later, on March 10, 2014, Hopkins returned to Earth, having completed 2,656 orbits around the world, traveling over 70 million miles.
Plans will begin over the summer to create the program for the next “Express-Yo-Faith” series in fall 2015.

On Sept. 24, 2014, The Pioneer premiered the first issue for the 2014-2015 academic year, featuring a new masthead design. Excited about their new positions as co-editors-in chief, Maxime Devillaz, a junior Journalism major, and Alyssa Seidman, a sophomore Journalism major, decided to take full advantage of their titles, starting with a new masthead design. They received positive feedback about the new mast- head from students. However, they also received negative feedback.
“Several people felt offended by the pioneer in our logo. When we revealed the masthead in the first issue of the academic year, it never crossed our minds that it would be controversial until we heard those complaints,” Devillaz said. According to Seidman, the masthead seemed offensive to some since this pioneer is associated with a negative part of American history.
Prior to Devillaz and Seidman’s positions as co-editors-in-chief, The Pioneer’s masthead featured a weather vane, which is displayed on several buildings, like the one on Humanities. “We didn’t feel like that masthead related to anything we were trying to promote with our paper, or had anything to do with school spirit in any way,” Seidman said.
“When Max and I became co-editors of the paper, we wanted to revamp the entire thing, and that required changing our masthead,” Seidman added. “We toyed around with the design, and eventually kept the old typeface, but created a new logo to use right in the middle of the masthead. We decided to go for [the] angry-looking [pioneer] since it coordinated with the campus mascot.”
Although Devillaz and Seidman did not mean to offend anyone, Seidman explains that they were only looking to boost the image of their newspaper. “I don’t see any problem with our current masthead. We were only trying to exercise our creative liberty as co-editors.”
In an effort to have broad school support for the newspaper, Devillaz and Seidman decided to offer students the opportunity to design a new masthead. They ran a campus contest during the fall 2014 semes- ter, offering a prize for the student whose original masthead design was chosen.
Because only one entry was received, and the contest did not result in a new masthead, The Pioneer approached Professor Charles Conover, the Director of the Digital Arts and Design Program, Seidman explained.
Conover agreed to assign a masthead project for his digital ty- pography course. The project would give the editors of The Pioneer an opportunity to select a new masthead design from a range of options that are created by Post students.
Devillaz feels optimistic over student involvement with the paper. “The new masthead will be student-made, and completely new. We know that we can’t please everyone, but at least it’s a start to get something student-based and creative. I’m open for students to feel free to change the font, or whatever they want to do with the masthead along with the logo,” he said.
Although the search for a new design resulted from backlash, there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel. Professor Conover acknowledges that creating this project has helped his students fur- ther build their portfolios. “For years, I’ve looked at the masthead and thought I [could] contribute some designs that would work [as] a better replacement. I’ve considered doing it myself, but it takes a lot of time, so when The Pioneer contacted me this year, I had the right class that would work on it. It was just perfect timing to get a class that would do this type of work, that’s when I agreed to do it,” he added.
Conover explains that he did not know what the editors from The Pioneer were looking for, but advised his students to approach their designs by giving the paper a traditional look that it needs. He showed his students mastheads used in other magazines and newspapers, and together looked through early advertising art, and old line of art that he thought could help The Pioneer achieve that traditional look.
The course working on the masthead, mainly composed of ju- niors and seniors, has had three weeks to work on their designs, mainly through the use of the Adobe Illustration program. “The students created multiple variations, and with my class I have my students creating more than one version of their designs,” said Conover. “This way, their client [The Pioneer] has options on what designs to choose from. Everyone who has worked on this project has created five or six versions of them, so The Pioneer will get a range of designs to choose from, with different variations [of each].”
Overall, Conover only wants his students to create professional quality work; something that they can include in their portfolios that will land them good jobs.
Devillaz and Seidman are unsure of when the new masthead will be revealed, but are hopeful that readers will be seeing the new design before the end of the semester. “It still has not been decided whether we’re going to keep the design as our permanent masthead, but it’s likely that we will leave the new design if we like it enough,” Seidman ex- plained.
The selected design will most likely be decided based on student votes, according to Devillaz. “The purpose behind The Pioneer is to value student voice, so ultimately with the new masthead, we want to hear from people and hear what they think, and maybe let them decide from there.”

This semester, the campus television station, PTV, has decided to mirror shows like “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation” with their own, “The Station.” As a student-run station, PTV is keen on exploring new programing that would be of interest to other students. With “The Station,” the staff at PTV believes they are on a road to something promising.
Written by senior Broadcasting majors, Thomas Finn and Karoline Onsrud, “The Station” follows the typical work day of the PTV crew in parody style. Apart from the script writing, Finn also plays the lead of the show as the station manager. After only producing news shows on PTV last semester, Finn felt that the station needed to approach something different.
“I came up with the idea because several people in the cast and I enjoy the shows by Mike Shurr and Greg Daniels, ‘Parks and Recreation’ and ‘The Office’. Those are my two favorite shows of all time, and I wanted to follow that, but use it here at PTV,” Finn said. “We have some crazy people here, so it would lend itself to a good show,” he added.
With a screenplay completed and a good number of participants, Finn started production on the sitcom just a few weeks into the spring semester. Finn was able to convince a number of his friends at PTV to hop on board. Most of the cast work on the show during their free time, while the other few are registered in the applied television course and get credit for it.
On Feb. 17, the first episode of “The Station” was posted on PTV’s YouTube channel. Finn explained that the process of working on “The Station” has been a collaborative development and he has always been open to taking the ideas of his cast members into account.
Tom Fruehsamer, a junior Broadcasting major, has served to share his input from the very beginning of production. Fruehsamer said that although he has spent a lot of time on set, he has only gained a lot more experiences through his contribution.
“You make great friends doing shows like this,” Fruehsamer said. “When I’m on campus, I do spend most of my time at the station; shoot days are Tuesdays and Thursdays and we film for roughly two hours. There’s also sporadic filming in between and it can be time consuming, but because there’s so many of us, we can film one person’s part at different times. So as long as there are a few members that are at the station for the most part, it works out pretty well.”
In the show, Fruehsamer plays Kyle, a crew member who is never in a good mood. Fruehsamer explained that overall, working on the show has been fun and has only made him grow more comfortable working in front of and behind a camera.
William Bruner, a senior Broadcasting major, also expressed that working on the show has been a great ride, as a result to the work he has carried out through the character he plays.
“Tom (Finn) and I are really good friends, so he knows the kinds of things to write for my character,” Bruner said. “I play the crazy country red neck and I bring unexpected plot twists. With my character you just never know what I can do on the show. I might spend the station’s whole budget, or bring an automatic weapon into the station, so we really try to bring a comedic aspect in that point.”
When asked if there were any cons to working on the show, Bruner could only point out one. “The semester will be ending soon and I feel like we were really starting to have something good going on here. With more advertising and a bigger audience, it can really go somewhere. It’s a really funny show, so it’s disappointing having to let it go so soon,” Bruner said.
Finn is currently working on the last episode of the season and because this is his last semester at Post, he wishes to conclude the season on a good note. His hope is that the next person who takes on the reigns of the show will do it justice for season two.
“I’m not sure who will be writing the script next semester, but I am setting it up so that we have the characters in place and one that will be taking my role as station manager,” Finn said. “Our season finale will be out-of-control good. We’re making it a double episode, so instead of the typical ten-minute episode that we normally aim for, we’re trying to make it 15-20 minutes long so that we can wrap things up nicely.”
An official release date for the season finale has not been established, but Finn and the rest of the crew will be working on it for the next few days. In the meantime, Fruehsamer and Bruner urge students at Post to give the show a try. “It’s been awhile since PTV offered any student-creative content,” Fruehsamer said. “It’s a good show, filled with fun stuff and lots of laughs. It’s exciting that we’re producing something like this because it’s something new that hasn’t been seen at PTV.”
“Also, it’s a show that takes place on campus,” Bruner added. “And it’s about students on campus, so why not watch it?! We’re in their age range and it’s filled with funny stuff.”
To check out all the previous episodes of “The Station,” go on PTV’s Youtube channel at CWPTV.

Whether you’re a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior, having somewhere to go and relax can help serve as a way to relieve stress and frustration. But having a quiet place to focus on school work can be just as beneficial.
On the second floor of Hillwood Commons, next to the LIU Promise office, is the Career Bar, a new lab where students can come in to relax and work on their assignments.
The space, formerly used as the Recreational Room, is now a place where students can occupy one of five computers, and also print out their work when completed.
Nick Morgasen, a senior Electronic Media major, thinks that the new Career Bar really isn’t serving its purpose, as “it’s just another computer lab.”
Cara Frank, a senior broadcasting major, is confused to why the school is bringing back a computer lab after taking away the one that was available in Hillwood before the making of Browse. “Why add a computer lab when you already had one? What’s the point?”
Instead, Frank had hopes to make it more comfortable for commuters. “Even if it’s a couch, or a comfortable chair, it’s good to make a person feel comfortable, and the Career Bar needs more of that,” Frank said.
Morgasen believes that the career counselors using the Career Bar could use the student vision as a way of improving the project.
Personally, I think that the Career Bar is a little unnecessary. On one hand, it feels good to have a computer lab in Hillwood again. But the computer lab (CSI) that was formerly in Hillwood, should not have been removed. It served as a center for students to work on their assignments and was organized in its efforts.
think the Career Bar is an attempt to create that same atmosphere, but it falls short of its goal. Although I feel this way, I hope to see more additions to it in the future.
Is this Career Bar a good way to attract Post students, or is it missing something? Let us know your thoughts, comments or suggestions at: liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

From the steps of Humanities to the roof of Hillwood Commons, students and faculty can be seen smoking cigarettes on campus at LIU Post. Despite the best efforts of anti-smoking campaigns and the ever- rising cost of tobacco products, approximately one-third of college students smoke cigarettes or use tobacco-based products, according to a 2014 study by ABC News.
According to the LIU website, the current non-smoking policy on campus is dated from C.W. Post, circa 2011. The only forbidden place to smoke cigarettes is inside of a building. As long as a lit cigar or cigarette is not in a building all is right with the world. But what about the steps right outside of those buildings?
Students huddle in crowds of four to five, specifically in front of Humanities Hall, all smoking cigarettes. Students and faculty making their way from building to building must pass through or by the smokers to reach their destinations. There are no rules in place, which, for example, would define how far away one must be from the doors of a building to smoke.
“I guess smoking seems to be an accepted and a common thing on campus,” said Leah Fischman a sophomore Criminal Justice major. “Especially outside of Humanities between classes.”
Fischman recently quit smoking cigarettes and even when she would smoke, she said it would take place in her car, before her first class and after her last. She said that she did not smoke outside of buildings because of her awareness that many students on campus do not smoke and do not want to be exposed to secondary smoke. Fischman believes that smoking is widely accepted and tolerated on campus, however as a new non-smoker, she said she definitely notices smokers a lot more.
Some students on campus are not as accepting of smoking as others. Kaitlin Veygel, a junior Broadcasting major, is highly against smoking on campus. “I feel like if you choose to smoke, my lungs should not have to suffer,” Veygel said. “If you have to smoke on campus just do it in your car.”
The wonderful thing about America is that it is free. People on campus are free to smoke, for the most part, whenever they please. However, there should be more rules and regulations as to where smoking can take place. A rule as simple as five feet from an academic building would go a long way. Students who are non-smokers should not leave campus smelling as though they smoked a pack of Marlboro during the span of their day at school.

Although the New York weather hasn’t helped us too much in the first weeks of spring, we all need to make sure we end the semester on a high note!
Of course, having beautiful sunny days and singing along to Kygo or Thomas Jack (DJs who, if you haven’t heard them, you need to check out!) help when it comes to being happy and having a generally good day. However, there are other ways for us to lift our own spirits.
Getting plenty of sleep is a key to getting a good level of serenity. Last week, “the City That Never Sleeps” really did deprive me of any shut eyes. Mix this with working on my English assignment all night to meet the Monday deadline, and it really created a monster in me for the start of the week.
You can ask the boys; I wasn’t my normal, excited self for 7 a.m. practice. But on the eve of Tuesday night (I know that sounded a bit like Game of Thrones), I caught up on every wink that I had lost over the past few days, which led me to an amazing wake-up on Wednesday, giving me a burst of energy throughout the day.
There are some classes that are most tedious and I find so hard to work for. It’s tough even getting through the hour and 20 minutes
of content they have to offer. Sometimes I even have to deface the dreaminess of a cup of tea, and not put milk in it, just to keep me awake. Once something or someone ruins my cup of tea, that’s just it!
One way in which we can overcome such sleepy and boring times is to set for ourselves something to look forward to, much like a reward after all the hard work you endured over the week. For example: a big night out in the city on the weekend, or maybe extra long mornings
in bed for some of you sleepy heads, such as Johan Kristjansson, a sophomore International Business major, who just can’t wait to get a nap in after a long week.
There are obviously so many more different activities to treat oneself with, such as visiting all the breweries Long Island has to offer and the vast amount of beaches in the Hamptons. Have a think, chat with your friends and get something organized. The front desk at Hillwood has got information on stuff you could partake in.
Although there may be rain, or a brisk breeze hauling over Long Island, try and smile. You always bring your own, or someone else’s, mood up just with one turn of those luscious lips. As I have said in many articles throughout this semester, being happy is a necessity to happiness.
I know it sounds stupid, but think of a dog: when we all see a
dog prancing around with its tongue, not a care in the world, it makes everyone smile and feel good. Now, I’m not suggesting you start jumping about and slobbering all over people in Hillwood, but try to have a good day, no matter what the big man himself throws at you. Have a week filled with smiles, and a happy ending to the semester.

These days, horror films are at a disadvantage – they’re pumped out by major studios at such a rate that it seems theIR quality has diminished, and so perhaps have the expectations of viewers. For every well-rated flick in the genre, dozens of knock-offs, sequels, and remakes receive less than stellar reviews. Alas, despite the apparent cash grab of the mainstream, we are thankfully treated time and again with a confidence-boosting release.
Last year, the cinematic community buzzed over the Australian Indie “The Babadook.” Now, we have yet another flick coming in from off the radar: “It Follows.”
The premise is simple: a 19-year-old girl named Jay (Maika Monroe) is followed by a slow, shape-shifting presence after having a strange sexual encounter. The titular “It” in the film does, of course, follow – constantly, wherever Jay is; she knows that it is approaching and will inevitably reach her. Banding together with her siblings and friends, journeying through a seemingly abandoned Detroit, Jay must find a way to combat “It,” and be ridden of this sinister force that has taken over her world.
This is not a simple tale of a haunting; there isn’t a go-to solution to the problem – no exorcisms, no holy incense. Complicating things, the source of evil can show itself in the appearance of a loved one, dead or alive, or else a total stranger. Everything is uncertain, and that is the truly horrifying element in the story.
“It Follows” hardily depends on a buildup of suspense, a slow grind of tension that creates anxiety for the viewer. Disasterpeace (stage name of Rich Vreeland) weaved in a very fitting score, taking hints from ‘80s films like John Carpenter’s “Halloween,” which does wonders in creating this eerie world, flip-flopping between swelling synth-tones that transform into stabbing staccatos.
The film wears its influences on its sleeve, but that it no way tarnishes the quality. Yes, it pays homage to classic films in the genre and this makes it a more identifiable cut than the vast majority of releases in recent years. There is a handcrafted vibe here down to the minutia of the set design, filled with old-school cars and antique-filled
homes.This is not a scary flick in the sense of jump-scares, which many films seem to rely on all too much. Instead, the film suspends a sense of dread in the viewer, like an ongoing nightmare. Knowing this, it makes a whole lot of sense that the idea of the film, setting a tone of psyche anxiety, is derived from ongoing nightmares director David Robert Mitchell has had, according to interviews. “It Follows” is classic horror. It stays with you.
“It Follows” debuted at Cannes Film Festival in 2014. It had its limited release early this March, and is expanding to wide-release on March 27.
Verdict: A
