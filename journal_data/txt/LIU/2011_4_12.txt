Dormers, you guys have it so easy compared to those who travel an hour to get to school, because face it a lot of people at C.W. Post do commute long distances just to get to class. So we all know how important it is to be on time for a class. You’re fully aware that your grade could drop if you’re late, so commuters how do we get to class on time?
The horror stories I’ve heard about the L.I.E., the Northern State and Route 106-107 can make anybody not want to drive in the state of New York ever again. But these are the easiest routes to get to school. For the morning, I always wake an hour before I estimate my leave for school. Some days it’s harder than others to get out of bed, so if I don’t have time to do my hair, oh well I’m not going to school to impress.
During my time I always check the traffic radar on News 12 or click on the Internet for quicker information. If the traffic is heavy, I’ll take another route or just leave earlier. Is there only one route that you know of to get to school? No problem, on weekends when you have time, experiment with different routes to school or just take your normal route and leave earlier.
Traffic is probably not your fault, unless you’re causing the traffic, but it affects everyone. It’s a way of life, so to embrace it you have to hit it head on. Be prepared before class, leave early, or if you like that morning cup of coffee before school, just cut the line in the coffee shops. Just kidding, if you have to make your coffee at home, it’s cheaper and better for the environment. There are so many cute thermoses for on the go.
Showing your professors that you got to class on time is a huge step. They’ll appreciate you being responsible, and your grade will be better just because you showed up to class early or on time. With these better grades maybe your parents will buy you a new car and then you can speed your way to school on time. It’s just a dream, but hey a girl can wonder.

Hello again all! The semester is coming to a close pretty quickly, and I know that I for one am ready to throw away the books and hit the beach instead.  Anyways, as there are still a few remaining weeks with you guys, I figured I might as well give you something to pass your time with and read.
So this week, I wanted to raise a question that is seemingly worthwhile: why doesn’t Brookville have it’s own fire department?  It seems strange to me that a town that is home to a university (of any kind, not just necessarily C.W. Post) wouldn’t have their own fire protection services, but would instead rely on it’s neighboring towns.  I’ll put it this way, there’s not only one department covering the area like most towns such as Levittown, Wantagh, Hicksville do for their own, but instead Brookville is covered by a combined effort from Jericho, East Norwich and Roslyn Heights.
I placed a call into the Village of Brookville offices, my favorite place in the world, and received this answer: “I’m not sure.”  The clerk that I spoke with told me that in the early 1930’s the village was mostly estates, so they contracted out the three districts listed above and it’s been that way ever since.  The system they have in place seems to work, and the unnamed woman informed me that there isn’t any friction between the districts, “they each know their boundaries,” she told me.
John O’Brien, the District Supervisor for the Jericho Fire Department, seemed to echo a similar message, “From time to time people do cross over district lines when responding to emergencies.  It’s a big road [Rte. 107], and we don’t always get 100% accurate information on where incidents occur, but we’ve never had a problem working together.”  O’Brien also went on to say that the membership of Jericho’s department is proud to serve a portion of the Brookville community, and that they are more than happy to provide aid whenever there is an emergency situation in the area.
So then, having gained the information I have while looking into my question, I want to revise my thought.  Instead I’ll ask this: in a community that seems to be growing, and is now home to more working families than just estate owners, is it okay to keep a system in place just because it seemingly works, or would it be better to start establishing a new system all their own?  Perhaps that old cliché saying really does work: If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.  What do you guys think?

If you have not heard yet, Hillwood will be acquiring the popular coffeehouse Starbucks to replace the Little Shop of Commons next semester. But with every gain, there is a loss.
The Hillwood Art Museum will be affected by the Starbucks. The Museum’s collection storage room will be reduced by fifty feet, due to the particular kind of storage Starbucks needs. “We house more than 3,000 objects from many cultures and it will certainly impact the collection,” says Barbara Applegate, the museum’s Director.  “We have been working closely with campus officials to devise an acceptable plan for the relocation of all or part of the collection.”  Even though Post is a large campus, it is difficult to find space for storing all the museum’s items. “There aren’t many appropriate rooms. We need a lot of space, and the best practices suggest keeping the collection together,” Applegate added.
“I feel bad that the art museum is losing space,” said an anonymous student who did not want to be identified. Some students feel as if this isn’t an issue at all, “I don’t see a major issue with reducing the museum by 50 feet,” said Keith Mannion, a senior art history major.
Although the storage room of the museum will be affected, the rest of the five thousand square feet of the second floor of Hillwood will not be affected. This kind of change does not seem to be a match for the Hillwood Art Museum. “You can always expect change at Hillwood Art Museum” says Applegate. “Typically, we present between six and eight original exhibitions in the museum each year.  It is precisely this dynamism that makes the museum integral to the campus.”

The Sculpture Building, located on the eastern part of campus past the Pratt Center, is a frequent spot for many art majors. However, according to faculty, staff and students, the conditions in the building are not quite ideal. Leaks and cracks in the ceiling have led to mold growth within the building, according to many who work, take classes and visit there.
After a large flood in the basement of the building last year, maintenance was forced to pump 2 to 3 feet of water out of the basement, according to staff.  According to a professor in the art department who preferred that her name not be used in this story, “dampness creeps into the offices,” eventually causing mold to grow. This professor has said that people are getting physically sick from the mold and experiencing respiratory issues.
The C.W. Post Campus was formally the estate of Marjorie Post, and many of the buildings on campus that are now offices were once houses or storage buildings. The Sculpture Building was one of them. The building was formally an old carriage house used to house horses, and, eventually, as time went on, cars were stored in there, turning it into a garage. When the estate was sold to Long Island University, the “garage” was converted into offices and classrooms.
Today, the Sculpture Building is home to the woodshop, machine shop, welding shop and the foundation studios. The mold problem has been a consistent issue. According to an art professor, “Buildings and grounds has tried to get rid of the mold with bleach, but it keeps coming back.” Studio B has experienced the most problems, with walls being re-spackled due to cracks and leaks in them. They were covered with plastic, which covers up the issue. However, there are still cracks in the walls that are causing a problem, especially during storms.
Heather Leonbruno, a junior, said, “There’s mold everywhere. It’s a problem but not more than anywhere else. Go into any other building; it’s the same thing.”
According to William Kirker, the Director of Facilities Services, “Sometimes historic buildings that are located in a wooded setting receive limited sun. As a result, musty odors may develop at certain times of the year. The Facilities Services team addresses issues of this nature in a timely and effective manner. We continue to work with our environmental staff to address these matters, especially as we enter a more humid time of year.”

There are different things we do in order to keep our lives interesting for ourselves. Many people look to spontaneity to add excitement to their lives and relationships. Some people even choose to do this by “sexting.” This is a new term that has been coined over the last two years.
Sexting means sending sexually explicit text messages to someone. Sexting really came into the forefront, mainly because minors were caught doing it. The fact that they were caught sending lewd photos to anyone is highly frowned upon in our society. I take this time today to ask if there is really anything wrong with sexting.
In New York State, there are laws against sexting. If a minor is caught sexting in New York, it is a felony offense. This law also includes creating messages, or distributing sexually explicit messages of minors. In a recent Newsday article, there was huge backlash coming from different readers in reference to the craze about sexting amongst minors. Some of the readers felt that minors were sexting in order to show their “dedication” to someone, while other readers believed minors sexted out of lack of self-respect. These may be true in some cases, but I disagree.
I’m no longer a minor, but when I was, there wasn’t even a term for sexting. What I can recall is having fun with my phone, and, yes, I would get sexts from girls I was talking to, and there weren’t any ill feelings towards it. I don’t think they did it to show any dedication to me nor did they do it out of lack of respect for themselves. These ladies just wanted to have fun; it was just something we did that created added appeal. “Sexting is stupid. We all do it or have done it. So, what? It’s my text… personal stuff. I say what I want,” says C.W. Post alumni Simone Robinson-Clarke. I know we’re speaking in terms of us being legal, but the fact is that we’ve been doing this way before hand.
Sexting should be fun and should be between two people who feel like sending or receiving or both. No, I don’t advocate five-year-olds doing something like that, but when you’re getting older and exploring yourself, if it isn’t harming anyone, I don’t see a need for regulation. Senior Chrystal Baez said, “Sexting can be fun but dangerous; it’s a great way to build excitement and imagination for one another but should only be done with a boyfriend or girlfriend or even husband and wife.” I definitely believe sexting should involve two mature people. Bottom line.
Just like anything else, if you’re going to do this, it should be done properly. Whoever participates in sexting should know the delicate material he or she is dealing with and respect the wishes of others. Keep thing solely between you and the other party. Maintain respect for each other all the while still having your fun. If you ask me, sexting has been blown out of proportion. Younger people need to simply be taught about having more respect for one another and to be more discreet.

Addiction Is A Powerful Thing, and That’s All There Really Is To Say On The Matter.
Homestuck, an interactive webcomic by graphic artist Andrew Hussie, author of Problem Sleuth and owner of website mspaintadventures.com, has taken the Internet in a stranglehold with his new creative project. Barely a year old, the motion comic uses unique storytelling and quirky animation, music and artwork to weave together a genre-busting odyssey, emulating the style of vintage choose your own adventure games. Ready? Aggress or abscond!
Following the adventures of four teenagers as they play a video game that manipulates the real world environment of those who play it, (a mixture of The Sims and Spore, with elements of Earthbound, according to the author), viewers are treated to layers of fascination as the kids become embroiled in the dark secrets behind the purpose of the game itself, and ultimately to something much more transcendent (without spoiling too much). Prankster John Egbert, eldritch enthusiast Rose Lalonde, irony-obsessed “cool kid” Dave Strider and “girl extraordinaire” Jade Harley become the Heir of Breath, Seer of Light, Knight of Time and Witch of Space, who are transported into the Medium where a battle is being waged over the planet of Skaia. Together, they must ascend to the height of their abilities, defeat the final boss and retrieve their ultimate reward, sacrificing their own home planet in the process… that is, until the whole thing is ripped to shreds due to the tampering of intergalactic internet trolls and, as the comic puts it, “weird time sh*t.”
Being a webcomic, it’s primary following consists of science fiction enthusiasts online, and those who do follow it, do it often, religiously- partially due to the rigorous work ethic of the author (roughly five pages of updates in a day, average, if Andrew is not working on a flash animation), and the absolute necessity to pay heed to every single plot detail and joke, no matter how miniscule. It is not a work for one with a short attention span, and its cult following is one to be reckoned with. The amount of talented fan art, fan music, and costume play has reached the amusement of the artist himself, who up until the plot became too heavy, used fan given suggestions within comic and even recruited members of the fandom for the music and alternate art team. As a result of his amazing dedication, the fans are all relatively close knit, and it makes the comic tantamount to an experience rather than a conventional read.
The story is broken up into Acts, all of which are mapped out neatly on the website: Acts 1 through 5.1 and 5.2, and Intermission (which follows the foibles of the Midnight Crew- a group of alien mobsters who fight against another group of alien mobsters who travel to and fro in time). The comic, being a serial, is nowhere near close to being completed either, and is currently undergoing the plot heavy arc pileup of Act 5.2. Perhaps one of the more attractive parts of Homestuck, though, plot-wise; is that the story itself manages to be deep without being preachy- including themes of death, sacrifice, and coming of age. These really are just four 13-year-olds playing a video game together, even when the emotions run high. One of the key points of Homestuck, the emotional maturation of the heroes, is sometimes you forget they ARE kids- that is, until a multiple exclamation regarding the number of irons in the fire (all of them) or an intergalactic rap battle reminds you in the most hilarious way possible.
Homestuck is, beneath everything, a comic about kids and fun. However, that does not mean that it is for kids by any means. The comic is laced with mythological symbolism and math references that will go over the heads of most children, as well as explicit language and incredibly graphic scenes of violence and death. In addition to containing themes not meant for children, it starts out slow, but by the time you meet all four kids, if you don’t love the comic, then it’s simply not for you. However, if you find yourself with enough free time and are willing to tackle something colossal, Homestuck can be experienced in its entirety for free on Andrew Hussie’s website, mspaintadventures.com, along with the other comics, games and music it has to offer. There isn’t word on its completion yet, minus the author’s chronic trolling, but being part of his history can only go to show that his next comic will be even bigger and better, if this is just his warm up.

Name: Sarah Kiser
Major: Nutrition
Sport: Softball
Hometown: All over, since my dad is in the military. But I’d say Tucson, AZ or Cooper City, FL
Sarah Kiser has started in 14 games this season, boasting a 9-4 record.  The C.W. Post Pioneers have an overall record of 22-8 for the season so far.  Kiser was named the East Coast Conference Pitcher of the Week for the week of April 5th.   She has also been selected, out of hundreds of applicants, into the Arizona State University’s postgraduate Master’s Program in Human Nutrition and Dietetic Internship.  The Pioneers will travel to Southern Connecticut State University this Thursday, April 14th to take on the Owls at 3pm.
How long have you been playing at Post?
I have been here all four years, but I have been one of the starting pitchers since my sophomore year.
What did you first think about Post?
On my recruiting trip, I thought the campus was beautiful. I was excited to live in a place with seasons since I had not in so long. The girls on the team really made me feel like this was the place to choose to go to school.
How do you feel about Post now?
I still think it’s beautiful, and my teammates still make me feel at home, but I am ready to move to a warmer area!
Lesson(s) you will take from Post?
Definitely the hard work it takes to succeed. Nothing comes easy, and you will always have someone working just as hard ready to take it from you. That and being able to deal with the ups and downs of softball that translate into the real world definitely stick out to me.
Best memory with the team/of Post?
My freshman year, we made it to the DII College World Series. It was so much fun, and I am hoping we can take a trip to Virginia this year for the Series!
What do you want to do after Post?
As of now, I am planning to attend Arizona State University for grad school and a nutrition internship. After that, well I do not want to think of after that just yet!
What will you miss from Post?
I’ll truly miss everything. Even though there have been times I complain about everything Post does, this is such a great place to go to school. I will miss playing and my teammates, but I am trying to just view it as me never having to do fitness testing again!

You may have been updated on what is taking place during the summer but what about the events taking place on your very own college campus? Students have the opportunity to take classes during the summer sessions, which is a great way to get catch up, or get ahead on your degrees requirements. Taking part in the summer session classes may even help you graduate early! To satisfy students, Post offers three different class sessions from May through August. Other academics during the summer are available to high school juniors and seniors who are looking to start their college studies early. Want to study abroad but not over the school year? “Yes, I would much rather study abroad during the summer vacation, I enjoy living on campus during the school year,” said sophomore Nicole Capranzano. The summer is a great time for travel and Post offers a variety of programs overseas this way students can receive credits while traveling abroad.
This summer C.W. Post is taking on a different set of classes involving sustainability. Students will receive three credits per class and can choose from classes that cover information about climate change, organic food and environmental music. For some students, including Jessica Ritter a sophomore at Post feel differently about the new sustainability classes. “I would not be interested in taking sustainability classes over the summer because I am already talking two courses and its expensive, I’m not an environmental type of person, so it’s not right for me,” said Ritter.
A few different summer camps for children are also taking place on campus during break. The Post summer camp provides traditional camp activities. Children swim at Pratt and do arts & crafts with staff members. Outdoor sports and activities also take place to fill the children’s day with excitement. Staff members of the camp use our campus to their advantage when they take the children on nature trails to educate them while they explore. Post also offers a Gifted Youth summer program which is a four-week program dedicated to children that need to be challenged more than the average child would in a classroom setting. Student athletes take part over the summer break in The Pioneer Sports Academy. Sports like boys and girls lacrosse and non-contact football will all be included in the Pioneer Sports Academy camp over the summer this year.
Student life also has plans going on during the summer.  “We hired conference aids to work with study groups for international students, about 500 people are involved in this event,” said senior Hayley Stewart, an employee of Student Life.  “This creates cultural experiences for all.” A big event that takes place on campus over the summer is orientation for the incoming freshman and transfer students. Freshman orientation dates land on August 1st and 2nd, 5th and 6th and August 11th and 12th, while the transfer dates are August 19th, 30th and September 6th.
During the duration of the school year, the Tilles Center for the preforming arts hosts many concerts and events. Over the summer nothing goes on at the Tilles Center until the school year begins. For students who live close by and commute to school, having events at the Tilles center would create excitement. “If Post offered good performers and events over the summer then I would defiantly go,” said Samantha Gaeta, a sophomore here at Post. Summer concerts with home friends and family would give students something to do over the summer break. Although Post is filled with things to do during the school year, events start to mellow down around campus, except for when the children arrive in the morning for camp! I wouldn’t call post a “ghost-town” during the summer, but it definitely has a more laid back approach to it.

Between April 5th-7th in Hillwood Commons, Japanese students gathered together to pass out origami cranes, and help raise funds and awareness for disaster relief in Japan.  Mio Matsumoto, a senior business major, was one of the students manning the table during common hour on Thursday.  She explained that in origami, a crane symbolizes a wish.
In total over 300 of these tiny paper cranes were folded and Matsumoto says that by the end of the three-day period, there were none left.  Some of the other students also dressed in traditional Japanese garb and walked around campus collecting donations for the cause.
When asked about a total amount raised, Ayaka Katakawa, a senior arts management major, said, “We haven’t even started counting yet, so we’re not really too sure.”
Matsumoto added that though they don’t have a finalized number of how much money they’ve made, they are happy with the results thus far.  She also commented that the funds raised would most likely be donated to either the International Red Cross or the local government of the Miyagi Prefecture, the area worst hit by the March 11th earthquake and tsunami.  The Miyagi Prefecture is home to Sendai, which was the epicenter of the earthquake was located.
The group is trying to organize another fund raising event before the semester is over, but haven’t received the necessary approvals as of yet.  While another fundraiser is not a definite, the students involved did add that those who wish to contribute to relief funds could do so by donating to the International Red Cross.

If you like low-scoring, defensive games, then Saturday’s lacrosse game between the C.W. Post Pioneers and Mercyhurst Lakers was your type of game. The score at the half was 2-2, as both sides had a tough time finding the back of the net. To give some perspective, the total amount of goals scored in the game was seven. The Pioneers entered Saturday’s contest having scored at least seven goals in every game but one. The high-powered offense of C.W. Post has averaged nearly 12 points per game this season, so this game showed that the Pioneers can beat teams in more than one way. This was a defensive, grind-it-out, do-or-die win that moved the Pioneers record to 11-1 and 4-1 within the East Coast Conference.  The Pioneers got the victory 4-3 behind the solid play of ECC Goalkeeper of the Week Mike Giordano. He made 13 saves in goal and never gave the Lakers’ a chance to get anything going on the offensive end.
In the first quarter, the Pioneers jumped out to a 2-0 lead behind the goals of junior midfielder Keith Rodriguez and senior attacker Jimmy Johnston. However, the Lakers sliced the lead in half with a goal as time winded down at the end of the first quarter by Brian Scheetz, which made the score 2-1 still in favor of the Pioneers. Only one more goal was scored the rest of the half, and that was again scored by Scheetz who now has nine goals for the year.
The score was 2-2 at the half, and stayed like this until midway in the third quarter, when junior attacker Eddie Plompen broke the tie and struck the back of the net for his 33rd goal of the season. Goals were hard to come by in this defensive matchup, so when someone took a shot on goal, they had to make it count. That’s what Johnston did as he connected early in the fourth quarter for his second goal of the game, giving the Pioneers a 4-2 advantage. The Lakers would threaten the Pioneers by scoring another goal, but it was not enough to bring down the reigning National Champions.
Mercyhurst outshot the Pioneers 36-26, but the Pioneers made their shots count more than the Lakers did. It was a low-scoring affair, but the Pioneers came out the victors in a nail-biter 4-3.
The Pioneers next game comes on the road against Wheeling Jesuit University at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, April 13th.  WJU is currently 5-4 on the season, and C.W. does not have much reason to worry. The last time these two teams met, the Pioneers won in a blowout 22-5 last year.

The Pioneers kept their winning streak alive on Wednesday, April 6th, defeating the University of New Haven, and then continued on a two game road trip this past weekend.
On April 6th the Pioneers faced the University of New Haven at Hickox Field. It was hard fought game for both teams, and at the end of the first half the Pioneers had just a one goal lead 6-5.
In the second half, the New Haven Chargers controlled most of the clock, but did allow the Pioneers to score four goals. The Chargers would tie the game late in the second, and continued to control the ball, but with just seconds on the clock Nan Mayott scooped up a turn over and rushed down field. Mayott fired a top shelf shot past Chargers goalkeeper Maureen Connolly as time expired to give the Pioneers an 11-10 victory. Alexis Gabbe had 6 goals for the New Haven squad, while Mayott contributed four goals for the Pioneers.
The Pioneers then hit the road, traveling to Pennsylvania and then Ohio to take on Seton Hill and Lake Erie colleges. The team faced a tough challenge in having to play back-to-back games over the weekend, but it didn’t matter. In the first game against Seton Hill University the Pioneers found themselves down by five at half time, but the Pioneers erased the offensive sputters of the first half in the second, scoring a total of nine goals to pull off a come from behind victory over the Griffins.  In the 11-9 victory, Jackie Sileo had seven assists and two goals.
The Pioneers then made the three-hour plus trip to Painsville, Ohio to face Lake Erie College.

Every year, C.W. Post hosts a weeklong celebration in honor of its most diverse students.  This week is called International Week, which features a number of different cultural celebrations every day.  All students are invited to attend and experience a culture different from their own.  Of all of the events that took place during last week’s international festivities, perhaps the most unique was the Holi Festival, nicknamed the “Festival of Colors.”
Hosted on Riggs Lawn by the Indo American Club and the International Students Union on Tuesday, April 5th, the Holi Festival drew the attention of nearly every passerby.  The traditional Indian celebration takes place every year on the first day following the full moon in March, the month of Phalguna in Hinduism.  An upbeat, party-like event, it honors historic events in Hindu tradition and celebrates the coming of the spring season and the end to the gloom of winter.
While the majority of those walking by on their way to class may not have known the background about what was taking place on the lawn, the way in which the holiday is celebrated was no subtle matter.  Gathered around the picnic table, participating students listened and danced to Indian music while spraying friends, acquaintances, and even the occasional onlooker with brightly colored powders and water.  Students covered in paint encouraged peers to join in the celebration and, by the afternoon, the event looked more like one big party than a religious festival.
President Tarun Vasudeo and Vice President Meenal Darak head the IndoAmerican Club.  The Thursday before the celebration, March 31st, the IAC and the ISU raised money for the event by selling henna tattoos to help raise money to purchase the powders and to earn money to send to the Japan relief efforts.  “C.W. Post has a diverse population of students from various countries and such event like ‘International Week’ is the best opportunity for students to know about the different cultures,” said Vasudeo.  The IAC encourages students of all religious and ethnic backgrounds to participate in the club and learn about their culture.  After seeing the fun had at the Holi Festival, who wouldn’t want to join?

Letter from the Editor
 
With only two more issues left of the semester, it is safe to say the Pioneer staff has seen and covered a variety of campus beats – from significant events to breaking news to senior spotlights, we have tried our best to be a part of your lives as much as you are a part of ours.  That is why when it was time for Diane Kennedy, the President of the New York News Publisher’s Association, to present us with an award for the “Re-launch of the Pioneer Newspaper” during our meeting on Monday, it wasn’t a surprise to me that I was as touched as I was.
 
“In September, your school newspaper was essentially non-existent.  There was no staff, the website had been shut down, there were no procedures, no advertisers, basically nothing at all,” Kennedy stated during her lovely speech.  “But you were determined to re-create something worthwhile…And you have done it.  You are all the beneficiaries of that commitment…”  As editor, I am beyond proud of all the hard work and dedication.  Just look at that picture! Sometimes you really don’t know what you have until its staring you right in the face or, in this case, documented in a picture.
 
In this issue of the Pioneer, we are super excited to show our support for International Week.  I am genuinely disappointed that I missed the Indian Ceremony although I don’t think our sports editor was thrilled to have paint splattered on her face.  We also covered a very important issue in news.  Got mold? Don’t miss out on that story!
 
Thanks for picking up the Pioneer.  Don’t forget to purchase a CLASSIFIED AD!  Read our house ad on page 10 for more information! And a huge thank you goes out to Diane Kennedy.  It was truly an honor.

The Student Government Association held its weekly general meeting on April 5th in Hillwood Commons. Many exciting and fun activities were discussed for spring fling week.  Present at the meeting were the executive board which includes President, Jared Ciborowski; Vice president, Alexandra Hochstrasser; Treasurer, Jill Scionti; Executive Officer, Gina Oseguedo; and Secretary, Jerimida Sanders.  Also, the members of the committees of academics, diversity, and food were present.  A representative of each student club was there as well.
There were two prospective clubs that were announced, including a book club and a Christian club known as S.O.S.  The book club was approved by student life and also approved by the SGA executive board.  The Christian club has still yet to be approved by student life but voted mostly as a yes by the executive board as a potential student club.  All students are welcome to voice ideas about these or any future club.
The Alpha Epsilon Phi Greek organization will hold a “Make a Cupcake” event, today, Wednesday, April 13 in Hillwood Commons during common hour.  The diversity committee will be sponsoring a barbeque in front of Hillwood also during common hour today.  This event includes free food, giveaways, and music by DJ Runna.
