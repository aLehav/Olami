The C.W. Post Women’s Soccer team fell to the number-one ranked College of Saint Rose in the Division II NCAA East Region Championship on Friday, November 19th, 2010.
It had been a spectacular season for the girls who were ranked 13th in the nation and rolling off a thrilling 2-0 win against American International College in the second round of the Division II tournament. Against the College of Saint Rose the girls weren’t as fortunate. In a hard fought game, the girls suffered a 1-0 loss in the East Region Championship. The only goal came from Saint Rose freshman forward Sydney Bond in the 58th minute.
The Pioneers had a tough time generating offense against Saint Rose. They were out shot 12-1 in the first half, but thanks to the superb efforts of junior goalie Allie Weiser the game was close throughout. C.W. Post created some opportunities on offense late in the second half, but weren’t able to capitalize. As the time ran out, the College of Saint Rose Golden Nights advanced to the quarterfinals and remained undefeated and the Pioneers will look to rebound next year after finishing their season with a record of 14-2-4.

It may have only been the fourth game into the season, but having lost their last two games the Lady Pioneers needed to find a way to pull off a big victory against Chestnut Hill.
The Pioneers were trailing late in the game, but instead of sitting back and losing a close one, the lady Pioneers stepped up.  Felicia Joyner, who finished with 18 points and five assists, came up clutch for the Pioneers, driving to the hoop to give them the lead with just 5:49 left to play. The Pioneers never looked back after trailing or being tied for most of the game, winning 73-71 to even their record to 2-2.
Post shot .519 from the field, compared to Chestnut Hill which shot just .393. The 73 points from the lady Pioneers was the highest output from the squad since January, 23, 2010 when they beat NYIT 75-50.
While the Pioneers have shot well from the floor, and have played much better then there record indicates, one spot could come back to haunt them. So far in this season the Pioneers have managed to shoot 69% from the free throw line. Not a bad percentage at all, but with all the close games that the Pioneers have played so far, if the Pioneers could get the percentage up to just 75% or a bit higher, it would favor the Pioneers and give them more breathing room.
The lady Pioneers came into the season with high expectations, and have showed why they are expected to fight for the ECC championship. If the 2-2 record is any concern, it seems to be a recent trend that the lady Pioneers start out slow. Look to last season, the Pioneers were 3-3 in their first six games and then found their way winning 11 straight games, going 17-6 after the first six games. There is still a lot of basketball left to play, and if the team can continue to get excellent play from ECC player of the week Janea Akins and the rest of her teammates, the season will be a memorable one.

After a solid 93-82 win versus Saint Michael’s College to begin the season, the Pioneers have dropped their last two games. On November 13th, the Pioneers fell to Stonehill College 76-68 and on November 28th, lost to the Post University Eagles in a tight battle 77-73.
In their most recent game, C.W. Post struggled against Post University. The Pioneers started off slow as turnovers were constantly being forced by the Post defense. The Pioneers ended up having 23 turnovers, which makes it tough to win close games.
However, C.W. Post found a way to creep back into the game off of a solid performance by junior guard Stefan Bonneau. He led the Pioneers in scoring with 15 points and found a way to consistently get to the free-throw line, where he went 7/8. Bonneau’s defense was also solid as he stole four passes and created problems offensively for Post University.
The Pioneers eventually took the lead from with a solid team effort. Multiple players went to the free-throw line in key situations and capitalized. Junior guard Billy Butler, senior forward Aaron Hall and freshman forward Vaughn Allen made clutch shots down the stretch to further the Pioneers lead. Getting to the foul line late in games is important for teams because the clock stops and points can be put on the scoreboard.
But with less than one minute left to play in the game, Post University senior guard Spencer Smith drove through the lane, missed, but put back his own shot to give the Eagles a lead that they would not relinquish for the rest of the game. Smith was the leading scorer for Post with 14 points and was one of four players who scored at least ten points for the Eagles.
The Pioneers had a chance to tie the game after Smith’s late basket, but Post’s defense during the last possession was rock-solid, not allowing the Pioneers to tie the game.
Vaughn Allen continued his hot start to the season dropping 14 points and grabbing six rebounds. Two weeks ago, Allen was named East Coast Conference Rookie of the Week for his stellar play to begin the year as he averaged 14 points and 7.5 rebounds throughout the first two games of the season.

The C.W. Post Cross Country team wrapped up their season on November 21st at the Division II Northeast Regional Championship.
The men raced in the 10K event (6.2 miles) and placed 8th overall in the Northeast Region. Crossing the line first for the Pioneers was graduate student Vince Giambanco who placed 22nd with a time 32:20. Right on his heels was sophomore Christian Altamura with a time of 32:25, good for 24th place. Both Giambanco and Altamura’s times placed them in the top 10 of the all-time 10K list for C.W. Post University.
Following behind them was sophomore Matt O’Keefe who ran a time of 33:37, placing 50th. Coming in fourth for the Pioneers was sophomore Ray Coyle, who placed 55th overall with a time of 33:42.  Next was freshman Joe Lasher who ran 33:48, placing 61st. Rounding out the top seven was sophomore TJ Speicher (34:42) and freshman Mike Fitzsimmons (38:45).
“For the past two years we have really built the cross country program back up.” stated Ray Coyle. “Now as we look to next year’s season, we look to be an even bigger regional threat.”
On the women’s side, the Lady Pioneers ran a 6K (3.8 miles) race and placed 19th out of 29 teams. Coming in first for C.W. Post was freshman Karissa Chiantella who ran a time of 25:24, placing 77th. Second was freshman Jenn McLaughlin who ran 25:26, placing 81st. Then came sophomore Caitlin Smith, who placed 109th with a time of 26:18. Crossing the line after Smith was Angelica Price who ran 26:38 while placing 119th. The fifth spot went to freshman Sara McLaughlin who ran 26:48 and placed 125th. Rounding out the top seven was graduate student and team captain Erin Lusenskas (26:54) and sophomore Katherine Wilkens (27:51).
“As a coaching staff we all agree that as a program we have come a long way,” said Head Coach Rob Morris. “In the future on the men’s side we can be a legitimate threat for a national bid, and on the women’s side can be a true regional contender.”
This was the last race for Vince Giambanco and Erin Lusenkas who will not be returning next year. Overall this season proved to be another success for the Pionner’s runners; the men captured their second consecutive conference title and placed in the top 10 of the region while the women were competitive on both the conference and regional level all season.

University president compensation has continued its rising trend this year as shown by The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual pay compensation report.  Thirty president’s this year earned more than $1 million in compensation in 2008, which is up from the previous year’s 23.
Our very own President David J. Steinberg has also followed this trend with his total compensation amounting to $642,668 in 2008 to 2009, up from $570,981 the previous academic year.  That’s a difference of over $70,000, putting him in the top 22 percent of private university president earnings.
With the downturn of the economy, the ever-increasing pay gap between administrators and professors and a greater number of students struggling to make tuition payments each semester, is this kind of compensation increase at a not-for-profit institution warranted?  How much has C.W. Post’s tuition gone up to account for such increases and, do Long Island University professors deserve to earn nearly six times less than President Steinberg? It is certainly up for debate.
One could also look at the other side of the argument and say that the high pay of university president’s is necessary.  It takes a significant amount of time and effort into finding the correct individual who can not only competently serve his position but also make a proper “fit” for a particular university.  Then it is with this high pay a university entices the right kind of talent to stay in these positions and that talent, quite simply, costs money.
Do you feel such high pay is inappropriate when higher education is becoming further and further out of reach for many young adults? Or are you glad Long Island University is committed in keeping the right people aboard? Sound off in the comments online postpioneer.wordpress.com or write in to cwpstpnr@gmail.com to tell us what you think.

“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government of a redress of grievances.”  As stated in the First Amendment, everyone has the right to speak freely…even on a university campus.
Colleges and universities commonly encounter a problem with  students’ right of free speech.  It is not an easy task for such an institution to balance this American right with  issues concerning civility, dignity and respect.
Problems arise in the classroom, during meetings, on the campus, etc.  However, one of the most common areas of dispute occurs with university student newspapers.  Since there are students running the publication, numerous ideas -both similar and opposite of one another – arise.  When this occurs, certain articles and stories are published that may cause some concern within the administration of the university itself.
When a controversial topic is researched and “in the works,” so to speak, the students can encounter several obstacles along the way.  Members of the faculty and administration may be hesitant or negligent to offer comment on the matter if it is viewed as too contentious.
However, to avoid these complications students often face, many if not almost every college and university has created speech codes.  These rules and guidelines are supposed to enforce acceptable forms of speech that are not offensive to others.  The administrations generate these guidelines and usually distribute them in a student handbook of some sort.
C.W. Post has theirs in several places, including the “Faculty Governance Handbook.”  That handbook supports freedom of speech “without institutional censorship” on the campus.  Specifically, it states
“…Academic freedom is understood to mean the opportunity for each member of the Faculty to discuss subject matter fully in the classroom, to engage in research and publish results without institutional censorship, and to write and speak as a citizen without institutional prior restraint or subsequent disciplinary action when the Faculty member acts individually and does not purport to represent C.W. Post Campus or Long Island University as a whole.”
The idea that a student can freely say what he or she wants and not be punished for his or her statement is also noted in the C.W. Post Student Handbook, “Long Island University/C.W. Post Campus supports the rights of individuals, clubs and organizations, who are members of the C.W. Post Campus community, to free speech and peaceful assembly.”
It is no question that this can be a difficult concept for any university to handle.  However, it is difficult for students to report the news to its campus when they are not given access to the most information possible.  Much of this difficulty stems from a number of bodies and groups at the university.  The Public Relations department and administrative officials may wish to censor what is said or not said by faculty and other officials on campus.  Students on the C.W. Post campus as well, are usually redirected to the PR department in order to receive a comment, quote, or further information.  Why can’t the person directly related to the matter talk about it though.
By rerouting student reporters to just one source, it limits the amount of information and content that is undoubtedly attainable for the story.  Having multiple sources for one article can show the dynamics and different aspects of the story, whether it is good or bad.  “Even Woodward and Bernstein looked to have two sources on all of their Watergate stories,” said Sandra Mardenfeld, C.W. Post’s Head of the Journalism.  Having more than one source can help clarify or confirm a piece of information.  “You never know what is real information or what is misconstrued,” Mardenfeld said.  “That’s why is so important to do your own research. You need to know that the information you send out is as correct as possible.”
Within the past few years, a few universities have shut down their student newspapers all together due to censorship and “loss of free expression,” as one editor of The Cedars (Cedarville University in Ohio) stated.  Cedarville’s problem arose when the newspaper published certain articles that discussed matters that the university viewed as contrary to the private Christian school’s religious mission.  According to the school’s administration, “there were problems with articles that did not necessarily reflect biblical truth, what the Bible has to say about an issue.”  The university administration responded by shutting down the newspaper.
The Dalton School, a private school located on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, also faced a few revision problems. About a month ago, the high school newspaper, the Daltonian, published an edition that was confiscated by school officials before students or faculty could even read it.  The school administrators claimed that the newspapers were taken before distribution because there were incorrect facts in a poll about student drinking that was on the front cover.  Officials then asked the staff of the Daltonian to produce a revised version of the article with the administration’s comments as well.
However, there is a bigger issue than whether a student newspaper was shut down or forced to reprint.  It hinders the campus itself when faculty or administrators neglect to comment on a topic.  This does not give the campus, including students, faculty and staff, and even the outside community, the entire story that it could have received.  There may be important, missing information that someone may have provided, though it was not given since that someone was afraid of a consequence.
The point is that most of the time, especially  in the Pioneer’s case, the students simply want to get the whole story.  They are young, active reporters learning and experiencing how to be future journalists, writers, photographers and editors.  They don’t want to hinder the image of the school or any administrator or faculty member.  They are simply reaching out to the university to gain as much information as possible.
The Pioneer strives to provide the most accurate information and the most obtainable version of the truth to its campus and community.  Without access to the university’s administration, staff, and faculty’s comments and quotes, this is not achievable.

A man once asked the question “What does it all mean?” while looking at a double rainbow. Well, CW Post has its own rainbow and its message is straightforward. The Rainbow Alliance is a club on the CW Post campus that offers a safe place for students who are lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgendered and questioning their sexual orientation. The club’s overall purpose is to create a sense of comfort and tolerance around all sexual orientations.
Rainbow Alliance President Jermita Sanders has strong goals in leading the club. “I started the first meeting of the semester by telling everyone in attendance that our goal for this semester is to make everything bigger and better! So our plans for this semester is to just make our programs more elaborate and over the top and to get as many students to come to our program as possible.”
On the way to that goal, Rainbow provides several events to put itself out there on campus and make homosexuality more widely accepted. One event is a fashion show featuring people dressed in drag called “The Ultimate Drag Race.” Another is “Homosexuality After Dark” where homosexual sex is discussed in a group setting.
“We are also planning to have our gay wedding next spring where we simulate a gay marriage in hopes of spreading awareness of issues of homosexual marriage,” said Sanders. This past summer, the state of California overturned its ban on gay marriage after a United States Supreme Court ruling. New Jersey’s proposal to legalize gay marriage was voted down by state senators. The same proposition was turned down by New York State in December of 2009.
Rainbow held “Coming Out Week” in late October this year. Sanders said, “The theme of coming out week this year is “the ultimate alliance” so we will be cosponsoring all of our events with other campus clubs and organizations.” To commemorate the event, the Rainbow Alliance set up the annual “Coming Out Door” in Hillwood Commons, where people could come out of the closet.
The Rainbow Alliance is more than just homosexuals and bisexuals. It thrives on support from heterosexual students as well. “We also welcome straight students who would like to be allies and would like to come and learn about homosexuality.”
Sanders explained, “I want to help to put on more educational programs so our student body can learn about what it is like to be gay and how homosexuals have sex , or how we are not be able to get married or to not be able to serve in the army because of who you love.” According to a 2001 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 76% of gays, lesbians and bisexuals believe that there is a wider acceptance of homosexuality in the United States. However, 74% said they had faced discrimination and 32% claimed that they had suffered physical abuse because of their beliefs. “I want to kill the stigma of the rainbow alliance being “the gay club” and to make it an overall alliance.”
The Rainbow Alliance meets every Tuesday at 7:30pm inside Hillwood Commons and is open to all students.

What a difference an iPad makes! For some students it is changing the way they take notes, study, and communicate with their professors. Others prefer good, old fashion pen and paper.
We talked to several freshman and transfer students who have had their school-supplied iPads for over two months.
Kyrsten Polanish, a freshman at Post, is one student that found use for the iPad. “I use it to take notes on the books I have to read for school,” she said. “But the thing is, is that it increases the chances of people not paying attention in class.” Lauren Geller, another freshman, said that it’s easy to check blackboard or her LIU account immediately.
For sophomore transfer student, Jessica Cusano, it is not. “I don’t bring it to school, but I use it at home,” Jessica said. “Most people bring the iPad to school to take notes and check their emails and such.” Though Jessica understands the benefit of having immediate internet access and email access, she doesn’t need something like that all the time. She also feels writing notes instead of typing them helps her learn better.
Amanda Coffey, a sophomore at Post, says it is impossible to tell if people are using the iPads productively. She believes, however, that experimentation is a good thing.
Art professor Ryan Seslow believes that the iPads are a great idea for the school. “I teach various courses in fine arts, and the iPad has been a great tool of energetic immediacy,” Professor Seslow said. “My students are constantly inspiring me by exposing me to new things through the use of this device.”
Other teachers don’t think that the iPad is useful in their classrooms, such as English Professor Wendy Ryden. “When I first heard about it, I thought it would be good because I wouldn’t have to worry about scheduling class in a computer lab,” Professor Ryden said.
“But when I actually tried one myself, it didn’t seem conducive to teaching writing at all, so I lost interest in using it in the class.”
Professor Ryden also acknowledges that she didn’t know too much about the iPad and was willing to look into the device more in an attempt to use it in the future.
The administration of C.W. Post came up with an idea. With the help of Apple, Post decided to provide iPads for the new transfer and freshman students of fall 2010. This was supposed to aid in taking notes, checking blackboard, and even organizing the student.
According to Deranged Shaman, a website that focuses squarely on technology and follows the buzz of the industry, Post is one out of only 11 schools that are a part of this experimental, free iPad program. The other universities include Chicago State University, Duke University, and the University of Maryland.

Go ahead and put away your fall attire, because the winter is finally here and it’s time to bundle up fashionably. As the seasons change, so does fashion –so here are some easy trends to follow that are not only stylish, but affordable and easy too.
Leather jackets are a classic piece that are a fashion must-have this winter season. Leather has been recognized for its attainable, edgy, and luxurious sense of appeal that are popular for both men and women. Common colors are black, brown, and camel.
Another jacket college students love is the pea coat, and black seems to be the classiest color for this season. The pea coat provides a casual, stylish, and professional appearance. Not only is it easy to run out in but it puts a finishing touch to any outfit and is excellent to wear on an important meeting. Some elegant and affordable designer pea coats for women are Betsey Johnson, Guess, GAP, and Anne Klein. They are available in all different colors and styles –some are classic black and plain, whereas others contain bedazzled buttons, beads, and ruffles. Guess remains a fashionable brand for men pea coats, as well as Polo Ralph Lauren, Timberland, and Diesel. These eye-catching brands are popular in other colors and materials, such as buttery-soft camel or striking brown suede. Each are embellished with buttons and belts for your perfect fit.
Scarves are also a big part of this winter’s fashion trend. Fringe scarves are full of color and are a great accessory. It goes well with a pair of denim jeans or a simple baggy t-shirt.  Signature designs include plaid, silk, leopard, cheetah, and an assortment of random patterns and designs. Cashmere and cotton wrap scarves are an absolute wardrobe necessity. Although it looks long and seems as if it’s an unnecessary amount of material, it’s lightweight and can be wrapped once or twice for that dramatic draped effect. Popular brands are Steve Madden, Lucky, and Burberry.
Step in winter’s shoe trend. Black leather boots for men and women have become the latest trend. Popular brands for women are Aldo, Forever 21, Steven Madden, and Tory Burch.  Others styles, such as the Steve Madden suede moccasin boot and the Tory Burch Patterson Logo Riding Boot, are not leather however add a stylish charm to your favorite outfit. Men seem to enjoy the Nike SFB Boot, Timberlands, and the new Cole Haan Men’s Air Hamilton Lace. Rain boats such as Hunter and Burberry can be dressed up or down for that casual day look. Of course, the classic Ugg boot never are also an option. The Ugg Brantling Men Rain Boat and the Athleta Millcreek Ugg Boot for women protect your feet on a rainy day or bad snowstorm. Then again, your typical Converse sneakers can be unisex and are one of the hottest shoe styles. Wear them with a pair of skinny jeans, a Hanes t-shirt, and your Ray Ban sunglasses for the perfect, classic winter look.
Cotton and cashmere cardigans add spice to both men and women’s apparel. Some places to purchase them are at Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, H & M, and the newly renovated Forever 21 located right in the Broadway Mall.
 
What’s an outfit without accessories? Big watches are in, making an extremely loud fashion statement. Popular brands are Michele, Fendi, Michael Kors, Guess, and the Toy Watch for women. Men like Movado, TAG Heuer, Fossil, and Kenneth Cole. Although some might be pricey, each brand is stunning and well worth the price.
Evidently, it’s all about being chic and comfortable. The season’s brightest colors and exquisite tastes are the key ingredients to a sophisticated and million-dollar look. So what are you waiting for? Go out and purchase a pea coat, throw on a scarf, buckle up your boots and secure those watches. Soon enough, you’ll create an extraordinary look and give everybody something to talk about!

We all have our idols. We flip through magazines and spot that particular person we only dream to one day look like. “If only I had that body, if only I had her legs, if only I had his abs” –right? We are all guilty of it. “If only” has become a common phrase used repeatedly in our society in situations where we think something is impossible. However, in truth, such a phrase is simply a cowardly way of giving up –a weak and lazy excuse for not trying.
I have always idolized Victoria Secret model, Gisele Bundchen. At six feet tall, having every muscle in her body toned to perfection, I look to her as my “if only” body. When admiring her health and fitness to a good friend of mine who is a professional athlete and trains all over the world, he simply told me the following: “Katie, it’s not that you can’t have that body; Gisele just clearly wants it more.” He explained that those men and women who have perfect figures, have them because they worked day in and day out for them. They didn’t sit and talk about it, they got up and did it. Although they may seem like gods and goddesses, they are just human beings –ordinary people like us who set goals and conquer them.
Let’s not wait for New Years to make a resolution, let’s start right here and now with a toast to our health. A toast to believing in ourselves that we can get the body of our dreams with a little faith and hard work. Throw the negative remarks aside this holiday season and strive to get the results you want. Like said before, there is no reason in the world you can’t be healthy –it is your body, it is your life, and you have the power to make a change for the better.
 
Three little tips to follow along the way:
 
Starting small is OK, just start. After Thanksgiving it seems we have a hard time getting back to our normal eating and exercise habits. We’ve become so accustomed to lounging around with the luxury of leftovers and holiday treats at our fingertips, the thought of a salad and a treadmill seems almost repulsive. Although we refuse to get up and get back on track, force yourself up and get going. Even if it is a minor accomplishment, do something today that helps you get back in the swing of things.
No more negative thoughts. The more you say “I can’t” the less you’ll be able to do. Negative thoughts will damper your ambition and limit your capacity to do better. Believe in yourself, you can do it.
Have confidence and challenge yourself. Believe that you are able to take it to the next level. We are in fact stronger than we think, however we’ll never know our capabilities until we step it up. Donovan Hamlet, a top personal trainer at David Baron Gym in NYC says, “Many lack the confidence in themselves to take their workouts to the next level. They are unsure of their capabilities, so they stay with the same old workouts. Change is essential to a workout to maximize the effects of the effort you put in. When you lose the fear of doing something new, the potential for physical change is endless.
If you want it so bad, then prove it; set goals and go conquer them. And remember, the only difference between our bodies and the celebrities bodies we idolize, is that they want it more. Now YOU go get it.
Until next time, have a happy, healthy and determined week.
Katie!

As her first semester comes to an end Dr. MaryAnn Clark Dean of the College of Health Professions and Nursing took time to reflect on her start here at C.W. Post.
Dr. Clark has just recently settled into her new office in the mansion. The office occupies what used to be called the sweetheart bedroom. Paying tribute to the historical background of her new office, Clark displays pictures of the room as it once was.
Before coming to C.W. Post, Dr. Clark held the position of Associate Provost for Academic Administration at Seaton Hall University. While at Seaton Hall she also taught in the School of Graduate Medical Education. She is taking a break from teaching this year, “There is a lot to do business-wise this year, but in the future I would like to teach again,” says Clark.
Clark says she came here because of the great opportunity to help the college move up in its programs, and to assist the institution with a blended learning experience. “It was a good fit,” she says, “between what I could offer and what they wanted.”
Dr. Clark will be leading the Blended Learning Initiative for the School of Nursing. This program will divide learning, 50 percent at the school and 50 percent online. She says this type of program will be beneficial for adult students, who wish to further their education. “There will always be a need for healthcare professionals, all of our programs a very stable and in demand,” says Clark, “our plan is to help and improve these programs.” Along with this plan Clark hopes to reach out to her faculty this year. She wants to assess their needs, and help them reach their goals.
For right now she’s says, “We are right on target.” The focus is to assist the faculty while at the same time making sure the students are taking care. There will also be a focus on retention and recruiting for the program.
As for the future Clark would like to see online learning expand. She also is looking into the possibility of a partnership with local community colleges. Clark hopes to initiate a program to help nursing students, start their degrees at community colleges and finish their training at C.W. Post.
“It is my responsibility to set the vision for the school, where we want to be in three to five years. We are taking that one semester at a time. Right now the focus for spring is to form a strategy for the future and focus on faculty and students.”

On Thursday, November 18th C.W Post students had the opportunity of listening to speaker, Robert Cassidy, courtesy of the Media Arts Department, a mobile journalist from Newsday. Cassidy shared his journey with prospective journalists as well as those who share a love for the field.
Cassidy was “born into the boxing beat” as he puts it, and has had a love for sports for as long as he can remember. In 1987 he began covering sports and his covering of boxing has appeared in Newsday, LA Times, NY Post, Timeout NY, and The Ring. Currently, he is the Deputy Editor of Multimedia at Newsday. On his journey he has also co-authored six books and written a one act play, which was produced off Broadway. C.W Post students can closely relate to Cassidy because he is a graduate from C.W Post himself, class of ’85.
“When I first started working at Newsday a paper was only so many pages, now I have the ability to change a 400 word story into a 1,000 word story on Newday.com,” Cassidy tells his audience. Throughout his presentation the mobile journalist tried to reiterate that with the evolving field of technology journalists have so many more options and ways to tell a story.
“I never thought as a writer I’d be taking videos and photographs, but it’s all about versatility,” he goes on to say. When asked what his most useful piece of advice for future journalists is, without hesitation Cassidy exclaimed again, “Versatility!” By sharing personal experiences Cassidy thoroughly explained exactly what he meant by being versatile.
He engaged his audience in a story about a morning he was reporting a high school football game and got a call that something had happened two miles away and he was to report there immediately; Cassidy had to become a one man team and take the role of shooting, reporting, and photographing. “As a mobile journalist you are constantly feeding back info.  Every minute counts, however, the principles of journalism stay the same. You have to be accurate,” says Cassidy.
The presentation also included a Q&A period and many students and professors questioned Cassidy about his experiences. One listener asked, “What skills are the most important to take away from college?” Cassidy answered with, “Reporting. Basic reporting is your foundation. It is also important to check your facts.”
Robert Cassidy concluded with saying, “The coolest thing about being a mobile journalist is waking up and not knowing where you will end up. Don’t judge a story until you get there,” he says, “because some of the most interesting people you meet aren’t celebrities.”

Over 200 students, faculty members, and community members came out to the Tilles Atrium Friday, November 19 to view the sold out C.W. Post fall fashion show.  The show, nicknamed “Rouge: A Runway Tale,” featured clothes designed and modeled by Post students. This was the first of two shows scheduled to take place this year.  In addition to the fashion exhibitions, for the first time in Post’s fashion show history guests were also served dinner and treated to performances from both the C.W. Post Dance Team and X-Factor.
According to Nhya East, Vice President of Post’s fashion show club, The Runway, the aim of “Rouge” was to provide a sneak-peak of the show coming this April, the bigger of the two shows.  “We wanted to give the audience a taste of what is to come in April without giving anything away,” said East.
The show began with a fairy tale-themed overture, which lead to a black and white scene created by Khamani followed by Post student Joanna Del Giudice’s eco-friendly collection, assembled entirely from recyclables.  “We focused on fashion basics: patterns, and black and white sequins,” said East.  “I felt the show was a success.”
Every year auditions for the Fashion Show are hosted about two months prior to the show.  At these auditions, students who wish to participate in any way must come prepared to prove to The Runway staff why they deserve to be included.
The Fashion Show is a great way for students to get involved with the C.W. Post campus.  Not only do students get to showcase their hard work but they are also able to make lasting connections with peers also interested in the field of fashion. Students also use this time to make connections within the fashion world.  For more information about The Runway contact the club’s Vice President Nhya East or President Danielle Delsol.
