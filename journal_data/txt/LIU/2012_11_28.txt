	Hurricane Sandy and the nor’easter that followed caused LIU Post to close for a total of 11 days, including weekends. In order for students to complete their fall 2012 courses in full satisfaction with the New York State Education Department requirements, missed classes will have to be made up, according to Beth Carson, who works in Registrar. 
	New York State mandates a specific amount of contact (instruction) hours, explains Carson. For a three credit course, there must be 2,250 minutes of contact hours not including out of class work.
	The rest of the fall semester’s academic calendar has been revised as well. Make-up classes for the hurricane will be scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays and during common hour. It will be up to the professor to determine which days and times will be used. Wednesday, December 12, will be a mandatory make-up day for classes. 
	Classes that were cancelled due to the nor’easter will be made up as follows: evening classes cancelled Wednesday, November 7, will be made up on Saturday, December 15. Classes that were cancelled on Thursday, November 8 (2pm and later), will be made up on Thursday, December 13. Classes that were cancelled on Friday, November 9, will be made up on Friday, December 14. Faculty will be responsible to confirm all make-up sessions, times and locations with their students.  
	Final exams will now be held from Monday, December 17, until Friday, December 21. 
	The extra classes have been reported to add stress on some students. Jacob Maitland, junior business major, said, “I’ve had two rescheduled classes and one that really did me in.” Because of some scheduling issues, his parents are visiting him the week after Thanksgiving instead of during the break. His law class was rescheduled for a Saturday when his parents would be visiting. He said he reacted with “a lot of beeps, hash tags and stars.” The class is also expecting an exam that day. Maitland said that it was too personal to reveal his professor’s name; however, the professor allowed him to reschedule the exam for a later date so he could spend the extra time with his parents. 
	“Students should speak with faculty regarding any conflicts that they have with scheduled make-up classes,” Carson said. She added that if there are additional concerns made by the student that cannot be resolved by the faculty then they should speak with their chairperson or dean. 
Some students understand the need to make-up classes. “It was a whole entire week of classes, that’s a lot of days missed,” said Joe Nicastro, junior criminal justice major. He added that it’s better than extending the semester. 
	Natalie Post, freshman finance business major, said, “Mine didn’t bother me, but if I had a Friday class, I might be mad.” She normally works during common hour and did not mind missing one day of work but still referred to it as money coming out of her pocket. 
Softball players Kaci Hopkins and Nicole Hagenan, both criminal justice majors, were relieved that they did not have any rescheduled classes that interfered with practice. Their Earth Science class was rescheduled for common hour. “I’d rather have it at common hour because people have jobs and practices to go to,” Hopkins said.
Other universities fulfilled their missed days differently. St. Joseph’s College eliminated finals week to have more classes and Stony Brook University professors were just told to consolidate the course material and added no make-up days. 
“We can’t speak to how other colleges are choosing to fulfill their contact hour obligations. Additionally, not all Long Island colleges were closed for the same lengthy period that LIU Post was due to the consecutive storms,” said Carson.

“Someday, I’d like to become the world’s greatest filmmaker,” said Petter Holmsen, 21, the winner of Norwegian Videomarathon 2012, and later, the winner of the Scandinavian version of Videomarathon 2012. In late September, the Norwegian film student returned to LIU, after flying to Copenhagen, where his short film ‘Have You Heard About…?’ was elected winner of this year’s Videomarathon contest, awarding him $17,200. Somewhat jet-lagged, but excited to be back in New York, Petter shared the process of making the short film, what he intends to do with the prize money, and why he decided to study in the U.S. 
At a Hungarian-Czech restaurant in the West Village that serves crusty, well-tasting sandwiches and European draft beer, Petter explained his definition of the “the world’s greatest filmmaker.” Has the world’s dominating filmmaker generated the largest amount of money? Produced the most popular blockbusters? Or is he or she the one with the most trophy’s collecting dust on a shelf? He shrugged his shoulders, as if indicating that he could not define it himself, and replied, “I had a weird dream once. I walked into a store and found a set of plastic miniature figures depicting some of history’s greatest directors. Steven Spielberg was there, so was Charlie Chaplin and Alfred Hitchcock, along with the Cohen brothers. I remember thinking to myself, that one day, I want to be made into a plastic miniature figure and join them in that box.” If he will ever become that famous remains to be seen, however at this point, the young, Norwegian filmmaker seems to have a promising future.
Holmsen was born in Oslo on Norway’s national day, May 17, 1991. His family became very surprised when an 11-year-old Petter, after having watched Mel Gibson’s Braveheart, gave up his dreams of becoming a chiropractor, claiming that film was what he wanted to do. “Our family does not have a pronounced interest in film,” said Kari Skybak, Petter’s mother. “But at that point, it was like a bolt from the blue that Petter wanted to become a director, and since then, he has been very goal-oriented.” 
The 21-year-old graduated high school with good grades. In addition, he always managed to work with film projects outside the classroom. In 2008, he started Purple Cow Pictures, a small film and advertising company, together with two friends. Since then, the three have worked with marketing, produced television commercials and participated in several film festivals, like Amandus in Norway, Strangerfestival in Holland, and Worldfest Houston, Texas, (which they won). This summer, he extended his resume by working in postproduction on reality television in Norway.
During the summer vacation, he left New York and returned to Oslo, where he committed himself to producing a short film for Videomarathon 2012. The contest was inaugurated 12 years ago and aims to discover talented Scandinavian filmmakers. First, contestants participate in the national version, where four pieces are selected by a jury to win a prize. Then, a national winner is appointed and asked to represent the country in the Scandinavian final. Anyone can participate, however the film making process must be executed within frames. Every year, at 12 pm on Friday, Videomarathon reveals a topic that has to be the main theme in every participating film. This year’s topic: Punishment. Thereafter, the contestants must shoot and edit a 3-5 minute-long film in the following 48 hours. The assignment includes writing the manuscript, casting the actors, filming, and cutting. On Sunday at 12 pm, the final piece must be uploaded to the Videomarathon website.
His short film, (exactly five minutes long), was named ‘Have You Heard About…?’, and touched upon the theme of punishment through the conversation between a little girl, Pia, and a man in his twenties, Thomas. Their relationship is undefined, but it is obvious that Thomas is guilty of something. With his guilt comes the little girl’s disappointment in him — with her disappointment, comes disappointment in himself. The story is told from a closet-like space, where the two sit looking back upon a late summer day when they picked apples in a green, summery garden. When reality catches them, the little girl keeps asking: “Why did you do it?” Pia will not be answered, and the audience is left wondering. “I am very satisfied with my actors,” Petter said. “The young girl’s devotion for her part was fantastic. In addition, she chased me between takes, curiously inquiring me what Thomas really had done,” he said. 
After having won the Norwegian version of Videomarathon 2012, he was asked to represent Norway in the final. From the beginning, approximately 300 short films had been sent in. He had recently got back to LIU for the fall semester, but did not mind packing his bags and flying across the Atlantic again.  His professors encouraged him to go, and at Post, they are impressed by his work. “I think Petter has a wide curiosity and a strong imagination, and I am really looking forward to his continued development as a filmmaker,” said Susan Zeig, a film professor at Post.
On stage, after the obligatory long, nervous minutes, his name was called. “I got confused since I had no idea if the jury was addressing first or third place,” he laughed. When receiving the diploma, he understood though. “It said “Winner Scandinavia,” and I realized that ‘Have You Heard About…?’ had won.” 
Winning Norway’s version of Videomarathon, awarded him approximately $1,750. Winning the Scandinavian version, gave him an additional estimated $17,200 prize. According to Petter, there is no doubt what he will use the money for future projects. Next summer will be busy. First, he is planning to make a zombie short film, and later, to travel to Iceland to shoot another project close to the polar circle.
His future projects are still in the planning stage, however, Petter is now back in New York to study, while simultaneously working on starting up a new production company; his “natural next step” after Purple Cow Pictures. His future dream would be to combine working in Norway with working in the United States. “But the Norwegian film market is smaller, and there is not an excessive amount of cinema visitors,” he explained. 
Where he might end up is hard to tell, he simply knows that film is his true passion, regardless of location. It might take a while before he is made into a plastic miniature version of himself, however he seems to be headed in the right direction.

Something Facial
The face brush is one of this year’s must-haves. Face brushes are proven to exfoliate your skin while cleaning out pores. But, unlike most exfoliators, face cleansing brushes can be used daily. According to “Drop a Decade From Your Face,” on the Dr. Oz website on October 31, 2012, “The gentle exfoliation removes the top layer of dead skin that makes your face look dull. It also allows anything meant to treat the skin including creams, serums or salicylic acid lotions to soak in more thoroughly.” When Dr. Mitchell Goldman of UCSD was asked on Fox News what people should do to prevent acne, he responded, “The most important thing is cleaning the skin. We’ve talked about using one of those clarisonic brushes, and that actually cleans the pores out, and you should be cleaning them every day, about twice a day is fine, it takes care of all of the environmental pollutants.” Clarisonic Brushes can range from $120 to $200. But, Target sells brands like Olay, Neutrogena and Pretika electronic face cleansing brushes for under $50.
Something Oxblood
‘Oxblood’ has become the color of this season’s fashion. Celebrities including Fergie and Royal Duchess Kate Middleton have been spotted rocking this trend. According to “Fall 2012 Runway Report” on HarpersBazaar.com, oxblood is one of the top trending colors this season. Oxblood jackets, jeans, tops and lipsticks are definitely in, according to an article by Christina Draper in “Let’s Talk Oxblood – The Luxe Color You’re Obsessed With!” on Glamour.com. Oxblood jeans can vary from $180 at Nordstrom to $49 at DorothyPerkins.com.
Something Faux Fur
Faux fur vests have been in for a while, but now we can have more fun with fur. Incorporating faux fur into our daily wardrobe has become easier. Faux fur jackets, scarves and vests are in this winter. According to “Sexy Winter Styling Tips” by Dawn Davis on Cosmopolitan.com, “Add a fur (we prefer faux) collar, shrug or scarf over your jacket or coat and you’ll instantly look more stylish.” Faux Fur coats and vests can easily cost several hundred dollars, but Nordstrom, Macy’s, H&M and Forever 21 have faux fur for under $100.
Something High
The new wedge sneakers are in! The Michael Kors wedge sneaker was featured on Oprah’s Favorite Things List for 2012. The wedge sneaker can vary in price. Beyonce was spotted wearing Isabel Marant’s wedged sneaker, which is priced at around $700, while the Michael Kors brand is priced at around $200 and Steve Madden ‘Olympiaa’ and Zara’s sneaks are priced at around $100. DSW sells a similar sneaker at around $60.
Something Bold
Reptile, leather or printed is in this season, as well as winter white, according to “Top Fall 2012 Fashion Trends Straight from the Runway” on MarieClaire.com. Don’t be afraid to mimic the runway models with patterned jumpsuits or military style coats. “The new prints turn basic pieces into something worth talking about,” according to “50 Musts: Fall 2012 Trends” on Elle.com. Pieces can vary in pricing according to brands, but for a more affordable buy, try Forever 21 and H&M.
These things are all essential for this winter according to some of the top fashion magazines. From healthy looking skin to a stylish outfit, these must-haves will give you a great look from head to toe.

The question of where God was during the beating of the Eastern Seaboard causing the destruction of homes and lives being taken seems to be one of interest to many people of different world-views. How can an omniscient God allow such things to happen? 
I think the problem here is that we try to invent our own answers to questions like these and out of our limited minds try to delineate the catastrophes of this world, recent and historic. I find huge fault in that, especially when mankind has been wrong about life, the world and human beings numerous times, although we have come quite far. I’m not saying that’s bad, I’m saying instead of looking in the mirror for an answer, we should look elsewhere and have the same hope and faith that scientists and experimentalists have when looking for evidence to base a belief upon and to arrive at a conclusion to which we may or may not understand. The truth about life does not require recognition from us for it to be true. The truth prevails whether it is agreed with, ignored or opposed. 
If God exists and sees all, then he must have seen the hurricane. And if God is who he says he is, then he has the power to stop it, but why didn’t he? Does he have an ultimate plan for us? Can anything good come from such disasters? Where was God? Some students around the Post campus have their own ideas.
Junior Nutrition major, Lisa Samuels, isn’t sure where God was, “but if there is [a God] I think he makes things happen for a reason. It may sound harsh, but I think that people are very resilient and can come out from things like this stronger than ever.” Considering this natural disaster, Samuels states, “I honestly think it’s Mother Nature’s way of telling us we need to take a look at the way we are currently doing things… like disrupting and damaging our environment… and try to change it.” Samuels was without heat and power for 17 days. She believes the only good thing that came out of this tragedy is how everyone united and began to rebuild what so many have lost, “It’s a powerful thing to experience.” Divia Mary James, sophomore Biology major, says, “Life isn’t perfect. We don’t know much, but now living without electric, we can realize what life is really about. We can see the true value of heat, hot water and even the refrigerator.” James was without electric and heat for 14 days due to Superstorm Sandy. She says, “I didn’t even know my neighbors before the storm, all of a sudden we were united.” Continuing Nutrition major, Jenna Sager, questions how theists are so sure that God has a plan for everything, or even the existence of God, “How do they know?” Sager also believes one must have “an understanding of science to give an explanation for natural disasters, or maybe it’s beyond science.” Sager was without heat and electric for 10 days. She says that even if something good came out of the Sandy and Nor’easter chaos, it would not compensate for the damages. 
It is my belief that God is the creator of a once perfect world. Mankind fell and there began the separation between God and man. It is true, and proven that God has the power to create such natural disasters. For instance, the flood in Noah’s time, the plagues of Egypt or even the storm in Jonah’s time were all sent by God. But if we look at these situations closely, we can see that God knew what he was doing and had a plan the whole time. But even if this was not the case, which I don’t believe it to be; nature can have its own mind at times. In the time of Elijah, there was a great wind, but God was not the wind, then there came a great earthquake but God was not the earthquake. Here we can see how God had nothing to do with the wind or the earthquake.
I’m not saying Sandy and the Nor’easter were sent by God or that they weren’t. I’m not afraid to say I don’t know. I’m also not afraid to say that I trust God in whatever he does and whatever he allows to happen. This is not to be mistaken with blind faith. Through my short time of being a believer, I have been convinced, based upon the evidence put in front of me that God knows what he is doing, better than how we feel or what we think about it.  
The lesson to possibly be learned can maybe be about our priorities and what we value in our lives. The truth is, no matter how much money we have or how powerful we maybe, we can still lose it all very quickly. We are not even promised tomorrow, but we hope and live like we are going to be around for a long time. We can’t keep allowing the illusions of the world to mask the truth of life and what must be valued the most. Love, honor, kindness, faith and most importantly God, in my opinion, are what we should keep our focus on. Like the wind, these things are invisible, but they are more real than anything we can see.

 	In the CW’s new drama “Beauty and The Beast,” Austin Basis plays J.T. Forbes, the childhood friend of Vincent Keller (Jay Ryan, “Terra Nova”), who when enraged, becomes a terrifying beast. Catherine “Cat” Chandler (Kristin Kreuk, “Smallville,” “Chuck”) is a homicide detective who would have been killed if the beast hadn’t saved her. While investigating a new case, Cat and Tess Vargas (Nina Lisandrello, “Nurse Jackie”), her partner, discover fingerprints that lead to Vincent, who was reportedly killed but still alive. 
 	Basis has had starring roles in The CW’s “Supernatural” and “Life Unexpected” and guest appearances on shows including “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” and “Life on Mars.” The Pioneer had a chance to speak with Austin via telephone. The series airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on the CW Network. You can follow Austin on Twitter @AustinBasis. 
The Pioneer (TP): How did you become involved with “Beauty and the Beast?”
Austin Basis (AB): Every pilot season you are met with auditions for all the new shows each network is going to be producing. In my experience, you get good scripts if you have good agents. I have been lucky with a couple of them in the past. For “Beauty and The Beast,” I had a reading with my agent and said from my previous experience I had some goals I wanted this pilot season. The audition came because Gary Fleder, who directed the pilot, had previously directed me in two projects, “Life on Mars” and my last TV show on The CW, “Life Unexpected.” He felt like I was the best person for this role J.T. and he brought me in to meet the executive producers and (creators) Jennifer (Levin) and Sherri Cooper. I did the audition and it was a great meeting, very relaxed, very warm, we were laughing. When I left the room, I felt really good about it but I didn’t know exactly how well I had done until basically later on that evening or the next day. Gary emailed me and said that they were working out a deal to test me for the pilot and within a week I didn’t even have to test. It was probably the fastest audition that I have ever had because I didn’t have to go through rounds and rounds of auditions in front of 10 to 20 people and against three or four other guys that look or sound exactly like me. 
TP: Tell us about your role as J.T. Forbes and how you have made it your own. 
AB: J.T. is Vincent’s best friend, confidant, a biochemistry professor and former medical researcher, so you can say way smarter then I actually am. That was a challenging aspect coming into it. The way I feel I tried approach the character is to make the choice that’s most dramatic for each scene and each moment. I feel J.T. is driving me to save Vince and cure Vince. The direction I would like is real, truthful, have a sense of humor, and be approachable for an audience so the audience would say I think I would react the same way. I would like to give the character heart and really bring the better aspect of my own personality to the character, namely a sense of humor and the sense of loyalty to his friends and that love, that bromance between two guy friends. 
TP: The show was recently picked up for a full 22-episode season. What can you tell us about the show’s future plans and what is going to be explored? 
AB: I probably only know just past mid season so I wouldn’t know. We had some interesting twists and turns during the last episode that aired Thursday. It ends with Vincent kind of passing out and waking up on the top of the Brooklyn Bridge so this pattern continues. J.T. and Vincent along with Catherine, namely J.T. and Vincent, start trying to figure out what’s happening, what’s going on. J.T., a scientist chemistry genus, goes into full of effect and he’s doing all these tests on Vincent and he’s trying to do controlled experiments and figure out what’s actually happening. We have this full series of experiments. Vincent’s condition is not a permanent fixture, it keeps changing and evolving and he could be getting worse, he could be getting more animal, more super human. He also could be adversely affected in the same way Parkinson’s or certain diseases degrade your system. It’s going to be interesting to see that. J.T. starts to be inspired by Vincent and Catherine’s relationship to seek his own relationship. In the last episode, you saw he kind of took the risk and leap of faith to ask this girl at school, this other professor, out for the first time and pursue that and see where that leads. I think that throughout the next several episodes you are going to see that coming in and out, where J.T.’s worlds is kind of expanding and he’s venturing out and getting a life of his own which he has neglected for the past 10 years to take care of Vincent. The other thing I could really say is that J.T. starts to encounter other people within the cast a variety of ways at the police station. That’s all I can say. It’s interesting as actors, we are all a cast and having been hanging out in Toronto, we don’t know many other people here. We occasionally go out to dinner or a movie. The only other people I have actually worked with for the most part are Jay and Kristin. Everyone else is at the police station and I really don’t do any of those scenes. The prospect of having the potential to do scenes with those other actors is always fun. 
TP: I found this very interesting, when the pilot was in development ABC was also making a “Beauty and the Beast” pilot. What was said about this alternate pilot early on during production? 
AB: Yes. The only worry or concern was that they both got picked up. The other pilot was an ABC Disney pilot that probably had more of a right to the name and we might have to change our name. Luckily, Gary Fleder’s company, Mojo Films, was the producer of that other pilot so he had all his eggs in both baskets so we had the inside scoop for most of that. That was more of a traditional telling of the “Beauty and The Beast” tale. I don’t know if it was a period piece. We are a modern adaptation set in a post 9/11 New York, a detective procedural/superhero drama with elements of romance and action and comedy. 
TP: In regards to the 1987 “Beauty and the Beast” series, do you consider this show a reboot like ABCs recent “Charlie’s Angels” or reimagination like NBCs “Mockingbird Lane” of “the Munsters?”
AB: This is definitely a reimagination. I would say a more reimaging of the classic fairy tale with references and homage to the ’87 series on CBS. The Catherine and Vincent characters are similar but I believe in the 80’s version, Catherine was a lawyer and in this pilot she was going to be a lawyer but because of her mom’s murder became a detective. 
TP: Did this worry you when you auditioned for the role? 
AB: Yeah. I think you are always worried as an actor. Everything starts out when you audition for something as a job and you become a part of it. Approaching it, I just happened to get cast in this pilot. If I had the luxury of being able to choose things I could do, if I was at that point in my career, maybe I would have had a little trepidation coming into a reboot or a reimaging that has a former versions of it. Once I came on board, I saw that this was totally different. My character doesn’t exist in the original. That was a big relief to me so I didn’t have to live up to a certain expectation that people had. That would be a small portion of our audience because a lot of our audience is too young to have even watched the earlier series. The only people that really have the pressure are Jay and Kristin to live up to and overcome those expectations that people had of what Linda Hamilton did with the role and what Ron Perlman did. They have been relieved of that because the show is so modern and you can never redo that show. They didn’t even try to do it. They have really just created a new show within the same parameters of this fairytale.

	The women’s soccer team ended its season with a 2-0 loss against Dowling College on Sunday, November 11, in the NCAA East Regional Playoffs. But the team can look back at a stellar season, finishing with a 15-3-2 overall record and receiving a sportsmanship award from officials in the New York area.
The women’s soccer team was honored with a prestigious award from The New York Metro chapter of National Intercollegiate Soccer Officials. Every school year the officials vote upon sportsmanship qualities of teams and coaches they have observed and officiated throughout the season.
Junior captain Karina Rizzo was honored to be given the award. “It’s a great acknowledgement for us when the referees and officials that we have had during the season rate us as the fairest team this year. It represents a lot of our values,” said Rizzo.
The 2011 season was a huge disappointment for the LIU Post women’s soccer team. Key players like four-time All-Conference selection Ivana Babic had graduated and the team was left with a young, inexperienced squad. The team finished the season with a 9-5-2 record and lost to Dowling College in the ECC semi-finals.
However, this year the Pioneers bounced back. The major difference was the strength in offense. In 2012, the team scored 49 goals, up 14 goals from last season. Nineteen of the goals were scored by freshman Susanne Vistnes while last year’s top scorer, junior Alexa Niciforo, finished the season with nine goals.
In addition, the defensive line, led by Rizzo and ECC goalkeeper of the year, senior Nicole Fierro, had a great year. The team allowed only 19 goals from opponents on 236 attempted shots.
	There were many strong performances worth mentioning, but a couple stand out from the 2012 season. The 2-1 win in double overtime against Dowling College on September 19 was one of the most impressive ones. Niciforo scored the game winner off a rebound after a Vistnes shot to give the Pioneers the win. Another was the 6-0 win at home against St. Thomas Aquinas College on September 29. Norwegian sophomore Solveig Bjordal scored her only goal of the year, while Vistnes netted her first collegiate hat trick in the game. The Niciforo sisters, freshman Jackie and junior Alexa, also added one goal apiece in the Pioneers’ win.
For sophomore midfielder Heidi Eikeland the win against Dowling was special, but the highlight of the season was something else: “The win against Dowling was amazing. To score in double overtime was the best feeling in the world. Still, I have to say that the moment I remember best from the 2012 season was Susanne’s (Vistnes) goal against Molloy. It was the best goal I have ever seen,” said Eikeland, referring to Vistnes’ first goal against the Lions, a laser from 25 yards in the top right corner.

The LIU Post women’s basketball team is undefeated to start the 2012-2013 season after beating Adelphi University 82-81 back on Saturday, November 11, and winning both games in the Dowling Holiday Tournament against Felician College (0-5) and Goldey-Beacom College (3-5). 
The first game in the Holiday Tournament, held at Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y., for the Lady Pioneers was on Saturday, November 24, against the Felician College Golden Falcons. In this contest, the Lady Pioneers cruised to a 69-54 victory led by senior forward Nicolette Marciniak’s game-high 21 points on 9-13 shooting from the floor. In addition, Marciniak had a team-high eight rebounds. 
Marciniak was actually the only player for LIU Post in double figures in the win, but there was a balanced scoring effort as sophomore guard Chelsea Williams had nine points, senior guard Ashley Caggiano scored eight points, and junior guards Alexis Peters and Kenyatta Sears each chipped in with seven points apiece. 
Overall, the game between the Lady Pioneers and the Golden Falcons was a sloppy one as the teams had a combined 54 turnovers. However, the game was won on defense by the Lady Pioneers. Both defenses forced difficult possessions on the offensive end as both teams shot under 40 percent from the field and under 20 percent from beyond the arc for the game. 
On Sunday, November 25, the Lady Pioneers won its third consecutive game to begin the year as it knocked off the Goldey-Beacom College Lightning 73-64. Marciniak notched her second double-double of the season as she put up 18 points and secured 11 rebounds. Senior center Samantha Kopp scored eight points and also grabbed 11 rebounds. Through the first three games of the year, the frontcourt of Marciniak and Kopp are both averaging at least 10 rebounds per game. 
In this win, the Lady Pioneers shot its best percentage in any game this year as the team shot 7-21 (33.3 percent) from three point range. Williams led the way as she made three triples for the Lady Pioneers. On the flipside, the Lady Pioneers defended the three-pointer perfectly as the Lighting did not hit a single attempt throughout the game (0-8). 
So far in the young season, Marciniak leads the team in scoring with 18 points per game. Caggiano (14.7 ppg), Williams (13.7 ppg) and Peters (10.7 ppg) all average double-figures in scoring. The Lady Pioneers also show balance as Caggiano and Peters both average four rebounds and four assists per game. 
The Lady Pioneers will open up East Coast Conference play in the next game at home on Saturday, December 1, at 1:30 p.m. against the University of Bridgeport (5-1).

The LIU Post men’s basketball team snapped its three-game losing streak on Sunday, defeating the Merrimack Warriors 74-72. Senior guard Tobin Carberry led the Pioneers with 21 points, while sophomore forward Tyuan Williams put up 10 points of his own and shot 4-6 from the floor. Off the bench, freshman forward Dillon Burns had 17 points to help the Pioneers earn its first victory of the year. 
The Pioneers played from behind for the entire game, not gaining the lead until the final moments. The Warriors went on a 12-2 run through the first five minutes of the game. It was not until there was six minutes and 33 seconds left in the first half that the Pioneers would tie the game at 25 off a layup inside the paint by junior forward Vaughn Allen. At the end of the half, the Warriors led 44-34.
The second half would start off in a similar manner as the previous one. Merrimack continued to keep the Pioneers at bay, but could never pull away by more than 10 points.
Down 72-62 with five minutes left in the game, the Pioneers began its comeback. Within less than a minute, the team managed to cut the Warriors lead to five off baskets from Burns, Carberry, and Willams. Burns was then fouled by Merrimack, making one of the two free throw shots to cut the lead to just four.
With two and a half minutes left in the game Carberry was fouled by Warriors’ freshman guard JT Strickland and was sent to the foul line. He made both shots and made it a two-point game. With a minute left in the game, Pioneers’ freshman guard Emile Blackman made a layup to tie the game at 72. 
Following an empty trip for the Warriors on offense, the Pioneers got the ball back and Carberry went to the free-throw line with six seconds left. Carberry made both shots and gave the Pioneers its first lead of the game, 74-72. The Warriors had one final, last-ditch effort, but could not deliver and the Pioneers won 74-72 as a result.
This win comes after the Pioneers dropped the first three games of the year to Franklin Pierce University, Southern New Hampshire University and Post University, all of whom are non-conference opponents.
The Pioneers play its first ECC matchup at home on Saturday, December 1, at 3 p.m. against the Bridgeport Purple Knights. Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org for live coverage of the game.

The trendy atmosphere at Baidu Shabu Shabu in Flushing, Queens, will reel you in. As you walk through the door, it seems like you are entering the nightlife of a hip city in China. Bamboo and silk cloth hang from the ceiling and the entire restaurant has dim lighting with various lights and decorations all around. A waterfall is in the middle of the restaurant with colorful lights inside and a flat screen TV in the center. You are surrounded by lightly colored brick walls, bright red booths and beige tables and chairs.
Bright, flashing lights change color at the foot of the bar’s stools, long poles hang above you from the ceiling with light bulbs at the bottom with balls of twisted white spirals. There is a flat screen TV in the center of the bar with shelves of bottles of liquor and beers around it. 
Baidu has a full Szechuan menu and a full hot pot menu. If you’re trying hot pot for the first time, each person dining gets a pot for themselves to cook their own food at their seat, where there are stove tops. There is an assortment of entrees to choose from and it is a fun experience to watch your meal boil right in front of you. The choice is yours from the broth you cook your food in, entrees of meat and fish, sides of vegetables and different sauces for dipping. You can have your every part of your meal exactly the way you want it. The venue is also vegetarian friendly with numerous vegetable and tofu entrees to choose from.  
Customers can also choose a buffet, where a group can order as much food as they want plus soda or beer within a two hour period for $25 a person. The rest of my dinner party selected the buffet and were very pleased. They consumed plates of strips of beef, seafood platters, chicken, short ribs and vegetables until their stomachs were completely stuffed and satisfied. They thought the Angus beef was a restaurant favorite. They also enjoyed the impressive seafood selection, which was very fresh and included crab, squid, shrimp and much more.
Being a vegetarian, I went in another direction. I had the vegetable combo and was pleased with the amount of food it had to offer at such a low price, $4.25. Most of the vegetables on the menu, noodles and some tofu were all on my plate, ready for me to take a bite. They had to take a visit into the hot pot though, of course.
One by one, I dropped the spinach, corn on the cob, tomatoes, mushrooms, slices of pumpkin and cauliflower into my personal pot with vegetarian broth. Next, I dropped my noodles into the pot. I watched as my dinner sizzled in my pot and steam flowed into my face. I found the experience amusing. The numerous vegetables were extremely fresh, flavorful and filling. The sauce bar pleased me as well; I was able to choose each taste I wanted from homemade soy sauce to sesame oil. The clear noodles were light and tasty. They were much more refreshing and satisfying than the white rice that usually comes with my vegetable platter at a Chinese restaurant.  
If you are looking for delicious Chinese food cooked to your liking at a reasonable price, try Baidu Shabu Shabu. It is an entertaining and satisfying dining experience!
Baidu Shabu Shabu’s address is 37-04 Prince Street New York, NY 11354‎, located in Flushing. Their telephone number is 718-353-9538.

Jane Van Veen (Rachael Taylor) and Henry Martin (Dave Annable), an idealistic young couple, are offered the opportunity to manage the historic Drake residential hotel located at 666 Park Avenue. They unknowingly become one of the many victims of Gavin Doran (Terry O’Quinn), the building’s mysterious owner, and his wife, Olivia (Vanessa Williams). The Drake maintains a dark hold over all of its residents, tempting them through their ambitions and desires. 
 	The show’s main stars certainly have great pedigrees behind them, all formerly starring in ABC dramas such as “Lost,” “Desperate Housewives,” “Brothers and Sisters,” and “Charlie’s Angels.” The pilot was written by David Wilcox (“Fringe,” “Life on Mars”). The new drama, based on the book series by Gabriella Pierce, differs in that the Upper East Side socialists are not witches. The residents of the Drake are ordinary people who made the wrong deal with the wrong person. I was looking forward to seeing this idea transition on screen to make the series a bit more out of this world. 
After initially viewing the pilot, I concluded that the show needed character development as too many of the residents were introduced in a very vague way. As the show progressed, this problem disappeared. There is a great sense of suspense as the modern day blends together with the past creating for an intense mystery that affects everyone in the Drake. Since AMC’s “Mad Men,” set in a previous decade, the networks have been trying to emulate its success leading to last year’s failures “the Playboy Club” and “Pan Am.” However, Park Ave’s formula has not worked as ABC declined to order additional episodes of the series. All 13 ordered episodes have been slated to air. 
 	“666 Park Avenue” airs after “Once Upon a Time” and “Revenge” (which all have a cinematic feel and focus around an epic struggle of good versus evil) on Sundays at 10 pm on ABC. Catch up with “666 Park Ave” on ABC.com and tune in before the series finale airs later this season.

Of Monsters and Men is an indie folk – pop group that formed in 2010. They have eight people in their band playing instruments including the accordion and trumpet, creating a purely unique sound. While waiting in Terminal 5 NYC on November 20, I’ve never seen so many hipsters in one room before. They seemed to gravitate to the back of the room, so I got a good standing spot in the front.
The opener for the concert was Elle King, a raunchy busty blonde who drank beer on stage and sang songs she wrote and played banjo and guitar. She was a very good opener. Next up was an Icelandic band named Soley. Their music consisted of slow, dark melodic flowing songs that didn’t seem to impress the hipsters. I enjoyed their mystic style and the singers’ airy voice.
After 20 minutes of setup and tuning, finally Of Monsters and Men revealed themselves on stage. The crowd went wild as they went straight into playing “Dirty Paws.” The audience went silent and enthralled in the beautiful but powerful soundscapes of the music. Every note was heard, the singing was spot on with no signs of strain or discomfort, and the bass pedal resonated in my chest with every beat. It isn’t often that you see a band that sounds just as good if not better than their studio recordings. What made it better was the interaction and stage presence. Not only did they sound amazing, they also had the crowd clapping and singing along. Normally this alone makes the experience. Of Monsters and Men currently has one album out named My Head Is an Animal. They played every song from the album except for one. However, they made up for it by playing a new song, and it sounded very promising.
If you are looking for a new, fresh band that has upbeat melodies, fabulous instrumentation, serious lyrics, and harmonic duet vocals, definitely check out Of Monsters and Men. They will put you in a good mood, make you reflect on life, and remind you of the first time you fell in love with music.

	When the series The Walking Dead appeared on AMC in 2010, it was an instant success. In a time when the zombie genre has been overused from movies to books, this series, which is based on a series of comics, takes us back to the true horror of the zombie apocalypse theme. Seeing just how devastating this kind of disaster could be and also how it would affect humanity makes this show very edgy and at some points horrific. There is a good mix of blood and gore but also the human drama of surviving as well as keeping their humanity and in some cases sanity in tact. 
	In season one, the main character, Rick, wakes up from a coma to find the world has come to end because of the zombies, or walkers as they are called, that eat the living. There is no place to hide and no matter where survivors go, the zombies keep coming making tensions rise and the fight to survive more difficult. There are plenty of side stories between the characters added into the mix like the love triangle between Rick, his wife Lori, and his best friend Shane. The season ended after finding out that there is no possible cure and the hope of anyone who could have found a possible cure was lost because of worldwide power loss. It was a foreboding end and left us wondering what could be next for the survivors.          
	Season two focused more on the dynamics between the characters, which is all good and fine, but the season was a little bit of a letdown compared to the prior season. One of the issues was that the survivors stayed on the same farm for the whole season, while in the comic they also tried to live in a gated community. Another issue was the drama between Rick, Shane, and Lori seemed to drag on forever. We already knew that there was going to be an intense love triangle but to see it over and over was very repetitive and dampened the suspense. It was also a little disappointing how “safe” everyone was. I would have liked to see more dangerous moments and more serious split second decisions that could tear the group apart. However, there are very good redeeming factors. Shane’s descent into madness and murder was done extremely well and was shocking. It showed how this new world could corrupt even the most selfless of people. 
	But what is there to expect for this year’s third season? If you saw the season two finale, you saw a large prison in the background, which is exactly where Rick and his group end up. Through the first eight episodes, the group secures a cellblock for themselves and finds a group of prisoners who survived but have no idea what’s going on in the world. A few of the prisoners ended up dead. Hershel almost died, T-dog did die sacrificing himself to save Carol, and Lori died when Maggie had to perform an imaginary c-section to save her baby. Michonne and Andrea find refuge in a fully functioning community, which, Michonne ends up leaving because she doesn’t trust the man in charge, and frankly neither do I. In the last episode, Rick finds a severely injured Michonne and she tells them that Glenn and Maggie were taken there. Tune in to AMC on Sunday at 9pm to see what happens once Rick, Daryl, Oscar, and Michonne reach the community.

Last night I was watching an episode of MTV’s 16 and Pregnant which, let’s face it, is one of the best forms of birth control anyone’s been able to come up. Kudos MTV.  Anyway, I was thoroughly disturbed by the sheer idiocy of one girl in particular. She was fortunate enough to have a beautiful little girl named Nova however, she seemed thoroughly surprised when it hit her that her boyfriend or ex-boyfriend or whatever he is, is going to be a dead beat daddy.
The new mom talks about how he was never exactly Prince Charming, treating her with less respect then any young lady feels they deserve. She then went on to say that, right after their daughter was born, he left her at the hospital to go play basketball with his friends. First of all, are you serious? That is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever heard. My question is how in the world did you ever think this guy was going to support you and be there for his child? 
If he was a seemingly crappy boyfriend to begin with, did you think he was just going to majestically change overnight and become world’s greatest dad? Very unlikely. Which was made all the more apparent when he went to her house to see his daughter. He sat on his cell phone texting the entire time, not to mention that he showed up with one of his “bros” and preceded to not speak to his baby mama at all. When the baby started to cry because she was hungry, a look of pure panic ran across his face and you could see that he wanted out right then and there.
I am by no means trying to convey a message of abstinence in this article. I am very aware of how unrealistic that would be. My point is more to the young ladies of LIU Post; choose wisely. You don’t ever want to be put in the kind of position that this girl is now facing; too young for a baby but stuck with one to raise on her own while trying to pursue an education. One of the guys you date in college could be the person you spend the rest of your life with. Make sure you are being treated the way you deserve to be, with respect, loyalty, and love.

	“It’s different I’ll tell you that,” said Emma Asserlind, a junior finance major. With a mission to meet new friends and get experiences from all over the world, the blonde Swede left New York for one semester at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 
	“I decided to come here because China is the place to be when studying finance or business, and also Hong Kong is an international city with lots of diversity and fun places to go,” she explained. 
	Hong Kong is a former British colony that’s now a special administrative region of China, located on the south coast. Thanks to open markets and handling of Chinese goods, Hong Kong has the world’s freest economy. Similar to New York, it’s known for its expansive skyline, and fast-paced lifestyle, but the city has big contrasts, and 60% of it is still undeveloped. The city is a combination of ultra-modern and ancient traditions, with a mixture of Eastern and Western influences. 
	Hong Kong Polytechnic University is on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong, and Asserlind studies mandarin, as well as finance and management courses. Poly U has over 30,000 full- and part- time students, including 300 international ones. The University offers sports and recreation opportunities, canteens and restaurants, and other common facilities. With English as the major language of instruction, the professors are easy to follow. Fellow students and people in everyday life can be more of a struggle. “I meet people from all parts of the world, and I challenge myself every day when trying to get by in a country where a lot of people don’t speak English,” said Asserlind.
	The 20-year-old Swede lives in Central on the Hong Kind Island, a 25 minute bus-drive from the University. Her classes are three days a week, but with large amounts of school-work she usually spends the rest of the weekdays studying in the school library. “The course work is heavier here,” she said, explaining, “The professors like to assign a lot of group projects.” That means a lot of homework and deadlines to follow, but her experience isn’t all about school.
	Hong Kong’s terrain consists of mountains, steep slopes, country parks, and nature reserves, along with the urban territory in the University area, Kowloon peninsula. The long Hong Kong coastline offers lots of bays, rivers and beaches, that can make the weekend feel just like a vacation. Asserlind enjoys the opportunities of various activities throughout her spare time. “Hiking is very big here, and horse racing is a huge part of the culture, both are fun to do, because there’s always a lot of nice people, and a good atmosphere,” she said. With a humid subtropical climate, the summers are hot, the autumn usually sunny, the winter is mild, and the spring is changeable. But the activities do not limit themselves to daytime. For those over 18 there’s also a nightlife to enjoy. 
	“People usually go out in junk boats for parties on the weekends,” Asserlin explained. A junk is an ancient Chinese sailing ship design, a wooden vessel, that’s used for daily boat-trips. Along with the floating party, there’s several clubs and bars on the island. “I feared that the culture would be so different from mine that I would not like it, but Hong Kong is so international that there is something for everyone” said Asserlind.  “Anyone who is open to try something new should definitely go to Hong Kong.”
	Hong Kong is only one of the locations LIU Post offers for studying abroad. Visit www.liu.edu/CWPost/Academics/Study-Abroad for more information about where to go, and how to get there.

Editor-in-Chief
	On Saturday, November 17, the New York Women in Communications Foundation held the 2012 Student Communications Career Conference at New York University’s Kimmel Center. The event was held from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm. The Kimmel Center was filled with about 300 eager young women and even a few men, from all over the country. The Editor of the Pioneer and the Editor of the Bottom Line were invited to attend the conference. 
	The day started with a lavish breakfast held on the 10th floor of the Kimmel Center. While enjoying the buffet-style breakfast, attendees got to take in the sunshine coming through the enormous windows in the room, overlooking the breathtaking New York City skyline. The ambiance created allowed a powerful energy to be formed in the room; it was clear that there was some incredible talent present.
	Many took the opportunity before the breakfast keynote speaker was introduced to network and meet professionals in the field. This was the time to get your name out there and start collecting business cards. Shortly after, Susan Schulz, the President of the New York Women in Communications Foundation and the Cosmopolitan Editorial Board Director gave a short and witty welcome address, which ultimately led to the introduction of the breakfast keynote speaker; Kate White. White is the former Editor-in-Chief of Cosmopolitan magazine, where she worked for 14 years, and an accomplished author.
	“Go Big or Go Home” was the message White was determined to drive home. This was a powerful mantra that White chose to dedicate her career to. “She’s definitely right about that, said Mabel Martinez, a student at LIU Brooklyn, on White’s advice of ‘going big or going home’. “If you’re going to go for something, then do it, what do you have to lose? She inspired me so much that I had to meet her and purchase her book, ‘I Shouldn’t Be Telling You This.’” White told the crowd, “Sometimes when you go big, people wish you went home.” She went on to say, “but I knew I had to go bigger, because I sure as hell wasn’t going home”. It was a powerful speech, with a very meaningful message. In an industry where who you know plays a crucial part in where you end up, it was humbling to hear a story from a very accomplished woman who started from the bottom and got all the way to the top. Her speech was filled with tips on how to make it in such a competitive industry. Listen more than you talk, you can never be over-prepared or overdressed, and learn how to enjoy your accomplishments were some that stood out. 
	After the keynote speech, the breakout sessions began, during which everyone in attendance got to choose one of three panels to sit in on. Sessions ranged from “Magazine Writing for Print and Online” to “Marketing and Advertising”, with some very important people at each. The moderator for the “Magazine Writing for Print and Online” was Michelle Ribeiro, the Deputy Editor of Cosmopolitan. It was a unique way to listen to the ins and outs of the business in a non-formal way. Questions from the audience were embraced and it was evident that the best interest of the young professionals in the audience was at heart. Bottom Line Editor and junior Art major, Christina Morgera, from LIU Post said, “I thoroughly enjoyed the option of choosing what lectures to sit in on. I always love having choices, which I personally thought was a great idea in this case, since everyone has different categories they are more interested in, in this particular field. I felt they basically tended to everyone’s needs.”
	There were two breakout sessions before lunch, followed by one more breakout session and concluding with a closing panel. During lunch, a keynote speech was given by Jenna Wolfe, a correspondent for NBC’s Today and a news anchor of their Weekend Edition. Wolfe talked about her story of making it in the media industry and staying true to who you are. “She is such an inspiring woman and hearing about her experiences and how she made it in the industry was really an eye-opener.” said Martinez. “I connected with her on a number of levels, it’s true what she said, ‘Be you.’ That’s the only person you can be.”
	The information-filled day ended with a closing panel session that included Career Coach and Talent Acquisition Specialist, Delia Camasca, as a moderator, and Adam Goldberg, the Director or Human Resources within the magazine publishing industry, on the panel, among others. Tips about building your resume, writing a stand-out cover letter and impressing your future employer at an interview were all covered. Do’s and Don’ts by all panel members offered a laugh for the audience who were told “don’t include your cat obsession on your resume but do remember to write the correct name of the company that you’re applying for.” Morgera added, “This day was very beneficial to me in every aspect. The motivational speakers really made me realize that I can do anything I put my mind to.The event also made me realize how important networking is.”
	The New York Women in Communications Foundation is an organization dedicated to empowering women in communications. Their main purpose is to inspire young women, create networking opportunities and “nurture future leaders in communications.” NYWICI members have access to many career-building and networking events.

The Newman Club held a fundraiser to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. The club has been collecting items such as baby necessities, socks, and scarves among other things in the chapel. The Mayor of Glen Clove, Ralph V. Suozzi, called and asked for assistance in the aftermath of the hurricane. “His office called me personally…asking if I could get students to help,” states Father Ted Brown. “The first group I reached out to was the Newman Club and others helped on other days… I stopped in at the mayor’s offices in Oyster Bay and Glen Cove, and [wrote] an email to the mayor of Brookville. The mayor of Glen Cove is an alumnus of LIU and responded. He personally thanked our students when he came to the shelter and said ‘he was proud of his school’.”
The collected items will be distributed to the organizations the club is working with, which include The Jewish Community and Catholic Charity. The goal is to aid the victims of the Hurricane disaster with some of the items they will donate. “We just had to help the community,” said Newman Club Vice President Sally-Ann Gaughan, a senior Early Childhood Education major. “Students have been really responsive, faculty and staff as well. Some of the stuff has already gone out [to the charities].” 
“LIU has set up a disaster relief account since the 2005 tsunami,” said Father Ted Brown, advisor for the Newman Club. The University set up the account for emergencies like Hurricane Sandy. “People want to give right away. We can’t say ‘oh wait until we set this up’…so far we have raised $500-$600 [since last week].” For Thanksgiving, the Interfaith Center has collected food and clothing as well.
On November 12, the club held a Coffee House Benefit where participants enjoyed an open mic benefit by candlelight in the chapel and were able to donate money. The club was able to raise around $100 that evening.
“Long Island is part of a community, a community that has given us education and employment,” said Father Ted. “Now we are suffering. It is always important to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable.”
The fundraiser is going to run until the end of the semester, but according to Gaughan, there is no end in sight. “It might take years for us to get back to where we were,” she added. “We open our door to anyone who needs help.”
For those who want to donate, they are accepting items in the chapel.

Lauren Fiore, a social work graduate student at LIU Post, has been helping victims of Hurricane Sandy in Long Beach. She volunteered there for a couple of days during the hurricane and volunteered in Bayport during Thanksgiving weekend. Fiore says she plans on continuing to volunteer in Long Beach. “After Hurricane Sandy struck, words could not describe the emotions and overwhelming feelings of sadness I had for both the victims and survivors whose lives were affected by this natural disaster,” said Fiore.
She did not just donate or volunteer through an organization like others; she did it on her own. “I chose to bring donations on my own and not work through an organization because I knew that people were in crisis and needed direct service and attention,” Fiore said. She revealed that she was compelled to do something after speaking to a friend who had to evacuate from her home in Long Beach. “With a bachelor’s degree in social work [from LIU Post], I knew there were people in great need and I wanted to put my knowledge to work. I knew I had the skills, and I knew I had the ability to execute them appropriately,” said Fiore. 
She wanted to do everything possible to help. “I got right onto the City of Long Beach’s website, a town that is particularly special to me because of its beautiful beaches and atmosphere, and checked for daily updates regarding the most requested items and other important information such as curfews and safety,” said Fiore. She also contacted a firefighter from the area that she knew from a previous job so she could find out more information on how to help. “I started collecting and purchasing donations at my job [in a chocolate shop called Sweet Gourmet] in Sayville, and in just two short days had filled up two truckloads worth of water, clothing, and cleaning supplies,” said Fiore. During Hurricane Sandy, bottled water was the most needed since the water in Long Beach’s water system was not safe to use. “I had one truck full of water and pulled up to strangers’ houses and offered them cases—they needed it, and it was the least I could do,” Fiore said. 
Fiore also inspired others to help the victims in Long Beach. She contacted the president and vice president of the undergraduate Social Work Club at LIU Post through their Facebook page. She informed them that they could help the victims by first individually collecting donations and then as a group when classes resumed. They started collecting donations right away and set up days and times to volunteer at the Ice Arena. “I coordinated with family and friends to bring donations to the Long Beach Ice Arena, which has since been transformed into a mini Costco,” said Fiore. She also volunteered at the Ice Arena by organizing donations and giving out cleaning supplies. 
“I chose to bring donations to Long Beach because of the connection I have with its beautiful beaches and residents,” Fiore said. Numerous locations in New York and Long Island were damaged in the hurricane. “Long Beach sustained some of the most significant damage on Long Island. News media simply cannot capture the destruction in its entirety,” said Fiore.
“The hurricane was the first significant worldly event I experienced as an adult,” she said. During the hurricane, Fiore did not experience any damage to her home in Sayville that she has lived in her whole life. The power remained on at her house and her family remained safe as well.
“There was no conscious decision to help; the thoughts were how to make help available successfully,” said Fiore. She said she saw a woman with five children in her car after evacuating her home and it was crucial to help her as soon as possible. After she and her children evacuated, the hurricane destroyed their home. Fiore said she wanted to do more for those in need after talking with this woman. 
“I saw hundreds of people in desperate need of assistance; the desire to help was innate. I believe that is part of the reason I chose the field of work I have,” said Fiore. She is graduating this May from the Advanced Standing Program at LIU Post. Fiore said she hopes to move to Long Beach where she can find a job in the social work field working with children and families.
