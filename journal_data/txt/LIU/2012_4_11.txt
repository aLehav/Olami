Fall Registration Ambassadors are seen all over Post’s campus lately. They are located in Hillwood, Winnack, Humanities, Pell Hall, the Library, and Pratt. They are students wearing shirts that say “Got Class?” and asking that infamous question: “Did you register for classes yet?” These students are here to inform students how to register and to remind them to sign up for Fall 2012 classes as soon as possible.
Dr. William Gustafson, the Associate Provost for Student Success, created the Fall Registration Ambassador positions at LIU Post. “The goal of being Fall Registration Ambassador is to remind our students that fall registration has started. This time of year is a great opportunity for all students to make an appointment to see their advisors to prepare for Fall classes and log onto my.liu.edu to register,” said Gustafson.
Many universities across the country employ student ambassadors, and Dr. Gustafson thought it would be effective at Post. “Students are encouraged to register for the Fall during the month of April in order to create the best schedule of classes that works for them,” said Dr. Gustafson.
The Student Success Office emailed students informing them of this new job about two weeks ago.. About 60 students went through training with Dr. Gustafson. Fall registration ambassadors started working April 7th and will continue until the end of this semester. The job pays 10 dollars an hour.
Fall Registration Ambassadors describe what they do at their new job. “We talk to students one on one to spread the word, so students register for classes before they fill up,” said Ashley Noble, a senior Print and Electronic Journalism major. Noble works as a student recruiter three times a week from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Fall Registration Ambassadors have gotten all types of reactions from the student body. “I’m friendly and talk to everyone who passes by; that is my personality, but not everyone responds to it,” said Noble.
“Most students that I have approached just keep walking by,” said Abishek Nyayapathi, a sophomore Business major.
Some students appreciate the Fall Registration Ambassadors’ help. “Other students need assistance on where to go and whom to speak to,” said Nyayapathi. “Most people know about registration but put it off,” said Xue Wang, a senior Business Management major. Wang advises next year’s seniors to register as soon as possible, so they can sign up for the requirements they have to take in order to graduate.
Certain students are unable to register. “If you have a block on your account, you are unable to register online yourself. If students have any kind of block on their accounts, they can reach out to us for help by using an email address that was created specifically for this initiative: success@cwpost.liu.edu,” said Dr. Gustafson.
Students can have blocks for all different reasons, such as a late bill payment or being on probation for grades or behavior. “If you have a block, just one email to the Student Success Office will let you register,” said Maria Bivona, a senior Public Relations major.
“If you wait until the last minute to register, you are only hurting yourself because classes will fill up,” said Joe Cipriano, a senior Marketing major.
Since the fall registration ambassador job is brand new at Post, it is still going through changes and adjustments. Bivona said her hours were cut from four hours a day to two a day.
“I think it’s not as effective as it could be. I think it would be better if each recruiter was concentrated in one building a day,” said Cipriano. Currently, some fall registration ambassadors with a four hour shift will go to two locations a day. Most students are now working two-hour shifts a day in one location. For more information, contact success@cwpost.liu.edu.

The theme was Whitney Houston during the final round of Post Idol, which took place this past Wednesday at 9 p.m. in Hillwood Commons. The contestants were Amanda Kelly, a sophomore Adult Education major, Phillip Degaltini, a senior Theatre major, and Steven Makropoulos, a sophomore Theatre major. Senior Assistant Director of Student Life Eric Zirlinger was the host, who started off the evening with a few laughs.
Zirlinger first introduced DJ Mikey, then the judges: Director of Student Life Alerie Tirsch, Briana Turner, and Donte Hardy.  Anny Jules, who was last year’s winner, kicked off the show singing, “I Will Always Love You.” After that, Amanda Kelly was up first. Her first song was, “Where Do Broken Hearts Go?” The judges thought she did a pretty good job overall, but one expressed that she wished Amanda would have made it her own.
Next up was Phillip Degaltini who sang, “I Have Nothing.” The judges agreed that he had a lot of energy but said he was off key at times. Last to hit the stage was Steven Makropoulos who sang, “Shoop….Shoop.” Steven made a bold choice and decided to play the piano while he sang. The judges thought he would have been better off without it, as he messed up the lyrics in the middle of the song; however, he kept on going and made it up as he went.
Then, a curveball was thrown into the mix – a wildcard. Tissan Riely, a junior Criminal Justice major, was brought back from the pervious round. She sang, “Heartbreak Hotel.” One judge said her stage presence was “through the roof.” Nonetheless, her pitch was off at a few points during her performance.
Then the judges deliberated. The contestants were judged on vocals, originality, stage presence, and audience response. Phillip Degaltini and Steven Makropoulos were the first two to be eliminated.
Tissan was up again to sing her final song, “I Look to You.” The judges thought it was a good song choice for her, but she lost the energy she had from her first performance. Then, it was back to Amanda, who sang, “I’m Every Woman.” The judges agreed it wasn’t the best song for her but loved her use of the stage and how she engaged the audience.
The audience voted on whom the last woman standing would be. Amanda Kelly took the competition. As the auditorium cleared out, she sang, “Moves Like Jagger.” Amanda’s prize is to open up at the Spring Fling concert for Ludacris on April 19th.

The Salutatorian for the 2012 graduating class is an Adolescent Education major with a grade point average of 4.0. Melissa Yonelunas will be presented with the “Association of Parents & Friends of LIU Post” Salutatorian Award on May 4th.
Much like the process of picking a Valedictorian, the Salutatorian is also judged on grade point average standing, the number of credits taken, a personal essay and an interview process with a board of faculty and administrators.
This process begins as soon as the May degree application filing deadline is past and a decision is made within four weeks according to Beth Carson at Registrar, who convenes the Valedictorian and Salutatorian selection process. Yonelunas was told she was the 2012 Salutatorian during a meeting with LIU Provost Dr. Paul Forestell on March 20th.
Yonelunas is honored to be the Salutatorian, she said. “My time at LIU Post has been so valuable to me, so to be able to represent the College of Education and my graduating class is an amazing opportunity. I am also proud and ecstatic that all of my hard work has amounted to this great honor,” she added.
Since her freshman year, Yonelunas has participated in an array of activities and events. She was once a part of the Pep Band and the Flute Ensemble. She was a presenter at the 8th Annual Conference of Elementary-Secondary Teaching and Learning, where she was able to share her educational finding with teachers through a formal presentation. She also signed up each semester as a note-take for the Learning Support Center at Post.
Outside of Post, Yonelunas has dedicated her time as a volunteer. She has worked with the Girl Scouts of America. “Volunteering has shown me how the smallest gesture or action can have a dramatic effect on the people around you, and it has taught me how rewarding it is to reach out to those who need a helping hand,” she said.
The Salutatorian does not give a speech during the commencement ceremonies, much to her relief, Yonelunas said. “While I would have loved to address my fellow classmates, the faculty, and the families of the graduates, it would have been a nerve-racking experience. I am excited to see what Sean will say in his speech,” she added.
Since completing her student teaching in December, Yonelunas jumped right into her graduate studies. She is currently reenrolled in a program for a Master’s of Arts in Teaching of Writing and Literacy Studies. “I am also looking for any subbing or teaching jobs that I can get my hands on,” Yonelunas said of her after-graduation plans.
Now that graduation is steadily approaching, Yonelunas will miss everything about Post, she said. “What I will miss most, however, is the beauty and intimacy of the campus. At Post, I was blessed with not only a gorgeous campus but also small class sizes where relationships between the students and the professors [are wonderful]. Wherever I went on campus, I was always met with a friendly and familiar face, and I already miss that.”

The Valedictorian for the 2012 graduating class at LIU Post is a history major with a double minor in political science and sociology. Sean Simensky will be awarded with the coveted “LIU Post’s Academic Achievement Award” and will give a special speech during the commencement ceremonies on May 4th.
The title of Valedictorian is given to a student chosen by a board of faculty and administrators, who judge a student’s grade point average, the number of credits taken, a personal essay and an interview the candidate.
About eight students are nominated according to Beth Carson at Registrar, who convenes the Valedictorian and Salutatorian process. However, this number varies depending on the academic make-up of the graduating class. “Students aren’t nominated by anyone, but those considered are selected on the basis of their overall GPA and the number of credits taken in residence at LIU Post,” she added.
On March 20th, Simensky met with LIU Post Provost Dr. Paul Forestell, where he was told he was chosen as the 2012 Valedictorian.  Despite feeling extremely honored, Simensky said he never thought of the possibility of being the Valedictorian. “I worked hard in all my classes but not because I wanted to be Valedictorian but because I wanted to push myself to be the best student I could be,” he said.
Since his freshman year at Post, Simensky has worked with the Learning Support Center on campus, providing notes from his classes to students who can’t physically attend classes. Simensky has also been involved in plenty of charity work, which includes volunteering at the St. Gertrude’s Parish in Bayville, where he helped to provide food for families in need.
As graduation approaches with less than four weeks away, Simensky, who finished his studies in January, didn’t think he would miss Post. “It’s hard to put into words what I miss because it is more than the professors and the classmates; it’s the overall feeling every Post student has when they are on campus. I suppose the best word for it is the sense of community,” he said.
On May 4th, approximately 9,000 people will gather on the Great Lawn for the graduation ceremony, where Simensky is scheduled to deliver his valedictory address. “The hardest part for me is that I want to make sure that [my speech] is not about me as an individual. Graduation should be about all the graduates; I don’t think I am any different than any of my classmates, and I think we should all be happy about what we have achieved as a class,” Simensky said. Maintaining a G.P.A of 3.99 was not difficult according to Simensky, who attributed his high average to developing strong work and study habits.  After graduation, Simensky plans to attend law school in the fall. Simensky is also a member of the Honors and Merit Fellowship Program.
“I don’t know which law school I’ll be attending yet,” Simensky said. He’s been accepted to Touro College. “I’m waiting to hear back from St. John’s and Hofstra and then I’m going to make a decision.”

Wearing hooded sweatshirts to show their love and support for young Trayvon Martin, LIU Post’s NAACP chapter held a candlelight memorial in his memory on April 2nd in the Winnick Center’s Long Island room.  A group of about 20 students came out to the event.
Trayvon Martin was 17 years old when he was shot and killed by the self-appointed neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in Florida.  The altercation took place on February 26th, in Sanford, Florida, where Zimmerman claims Martin looked suspicious and then tried to attack Zimmerman.  Martin was approached by Zimmerman, who then shot the young man because he allegedly feared for his life.  Currently, Zimmerman is facing no charges or jail time.
 
The Trayvon Martin case has caused a national outcry for justice.   Many college campuses are holding memorials, rallies and marches in hopes of bringing about justice for the young man and his family. The NAACP chapter at LIU Post is on the list of colleges and organizations trying to spread awareness and demand legal action.
Arielle Thomas, a senior Public Relations major, said, “I’m really glad NAACP did the Trayvon Martin Tribute.  I truly hope this tragedy brings awareness to the public and the Post community.  I just wish more Post students would have been in attendance to truly support.”
 
NAACP organizers asked everyone to stand in a circle with his or her hoods up as they began to discuss their feelings about the case.  Some students began to speak about the comments made by FOX News Channel host Geraldo Rivera, who was quoted on the show “Fox and Friends” as saying, “I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin’s death as George Zimmerman was.” According to Rivera, young black and Latino men who wear hoodies are asking for trouble.  He said hoodies make you look suspicious; therefore, expect trouble when wearing one.  The group of students commented on how ridiculous that was and noted that a hoodie is not a legitimate reason to kill someone.  Many pointed out the fact that each and every one of them stood in the room that night all wearing their hoods.
 
Some other topics of discussion were that Martin had nothing on him other than a bottle of juice and a bag of Skittles.  Students were left questioning how the young man could have possibly made Zimmerman fear for his life when he had Skittles and juice in his hand.
Students began to briefly speak of racism, stereotypes, and their personal fears for themselves and for family members, and shared some of their own stories.  The group also spoke about the impact the case has on the members’ lives and what makes them so passionate about fighting for justice for the young Florida teen.  At the end of the discussion, the group lit candles that spelled out the initials of the young man and had a moment of silence.
 
Students, like Shakira Wheatle, a freshman Early Childhood Education major, spoke about what the case means to her and how it makes her worry for her family members.  “The candle-lighting that NAACP held really touched me because it is focused on the Trayvon Martin case, which I feel very strongly about.  I feel this way because I feel like no justice is being served.  The fact that Trayvon Martin was innocent makes this case even bigger than it is.  I have a little brother and that could happen to anyone, including him.”
 
Chardonnay Smith, a freshman Sociology major, talked about being an activist for a cause versus just hitting the “Like” button on Facebook or re-tweeting on Twitter.  “Unlike social networks, stuff happens in the world, and it keeps going on in other peoples lives.  So, if you’re going to start the support, then finish the support,” Smith said.

On April 3rd, students, families and faculty came out to support the 16th Annual Breast Cancer Awareness Fundraiser Basketball Game, which pitted students against faculty and staff in the Pratt Recreation Center. The fundraiser was for the Hewlett House, where people with cancer and their families can become involved and receive support from people who are going through similar experiences. Many student clubs and organizations came out show their support, including ACP, Anointed Voices, Latin American Women’s Society, PAGANS, PEACE, The Runway, SGA, and the Student Pre-Health Professions Society. Each club set up a table with its own type of fundraising, like selling baked goods or bracelets, to help benefit the Hewlett House. Along with the clubs, Post had companies, like Apple, Best Buy and Victoria’s Secret, help to contribute to the clubs’ donations.
Playing on the faculty and staff team were William Clyde, Gresford Douglas, Rick Hamilton, Carlyle Hicks, Carlyshia Hurdle, Tremaine Johnson, Omar King, Chris Lomonaco and Whitney Murrer. Playing on the students’ team were Matthew Applewhite, Matthew Brooks, Lewis Cabibi, Kellie Finn, Andrew Jackson, Dominic Kulma, Joseph Marinello, Mike Nesto, Rayana Phillips and Nick Scotto. The faculty/staff team’s uniform was a black shirt with the pink ribbon for breast cancer on the front. The student team’s shirts were green and also featured the pink ribbon on the front. At the start of the game, the faculty/staff team came out strong, dominating the first half, but the students pulled through with a lead of 15-22 at the end of the first quarter. However, after the first quarter, the faculty/staff came back with a lead of 34-28 by halftime.
By the end of the benefit game, the students had won with a final score of 80-65. When asked why she played in this game, Women’s Assistant Basketball Coach Carlyshia Hurdle said, “Because it gets all the kids active and involved. It helps them support a cause, and it’s a lot of fun.” Along with Hurdle, student athlete and Education major Kellie Fin, a junior, explained why she played in this game, saying, “I played in this game to have fun and sup- port a great cause [and] also to support my aunt Karen, [who] passed away from breast cancer when she was 39.” LIU Post had a three-dollar admission cost along with an extra two-dollar fee for a t-shirt, the proceeds of which went to help the Hewlett House for Breast Cancer.

I’m not sure if I have mentioned this in the past but I waitress part-time. You may wonder why this is relevant to a relationship column. Well, stop doubting me because it is.
I see dozens of couples that are out to eat and/or on first dates come through the restaurant on a Saturday night. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that they make up the majority of our guests on “date night.” I’ve seen some really awkward first dates, guys make total fools out of themselves, girls blabber on endlessly while the guy looks like he would rather stick a fork in his eye then listen to her, I’ve even had a guy ask me to hide an engagement ring in a dessert. You name it, I’ve seen it. The one thing that I can’t get past, the thing that drives me absolutely batty is couples that sit across from each other, on their cell phones for the entire meal.
Have we truly reached the point that we can’t bare to sit at a table and eat a meal, which takes all of about an hour, without taking that damned thing out of your bag/pocket? WHY? Who is so important that you absolutely must talk to them at that very second? Besides, one of the most important people in your life should be sitting right across from you.
Even if you’re not texting, what are you doing? Playing games? Really? That is unbelievably rude and obnoxious. You’d be surprised at how often it happens too. If I were to put a number on it, I’d say that at least one out of every five couples that I come across are looking at their phone. It’s almost like they can’t stand to be around each other. They sit, I take their order where they may exchange a few words, and once I leave they whip the phones right out and begin typing away. The art of conversation is withering away. It is almost obsolete at the point.
These people obviously aren’t on first dates, they’re over the “honeymoon phase,” but to sit for over an hour and barely exchange ten words to each other is just beyond me. If I was out to dinner with someone and they were on their phone the whole time, I would probably just leave. I don’t see the point in going out to a nice dinner if you are not even going to attempt to enjoy each other’s company. You may as well stay home and get take out, save time, energy, and money.

America is the land of the free, or so we are told. The First Amendment guarantees all Americans five freedoms—speech, press, religion, assembly, and petition. As far as religion goes, you are free to practice as long as you don’t break any other laws. For example, many decades ago Rastafarians, a religious group who use cannabis as part of their spirituality, were told they could no longer do so because it broke the law. Well, that’s not very free now is it? Ok, fine, maybe I can understand it; if you let a religious group use weed in their rituals, odds are there would be a major influx of people saying they were Rastafarians just so they could smoke what they want.
Freedom of press is also quite questionable. Professional newspapers such as The New York Times can publish almost anything they want as long as it is accurate.  The courts have maintained that bloggers can do the same. However, most high school newspapers are controlled by their schools to make sure the students aren’t reporting anything overly controversial or that could cause some kind of issue at the school.
Colleges, too, unfortunately, including our own LIU-Post administration, seem to have a bad habit of ignoring “freedom of the press” by not giving student journalists proper information so that certain topics can’t be covered or not covered properly. This impairs our ability to actually report stories, thus taking away our First Amendment rights. So now the guaranteed freedoms of the First Amendment are down to three, speech, assembly, and petition. The thing is freedom of speech is also not quite that free either.
Of course, the basic thing is you can’t just say things that could cause panic, for example, you can’t scream fire in a movie theater. The panic that would incite could result in a herd of people racing towards the tiny doors and could cause people to get trampled, seriously injured, or killed in the process. However, if you yell fire when there is a real fire, the same affect could occur, but that’s perfectly fine, just one of those things that doesn’t quite make sense.  You are also not free to threaten people either; this one is fair and self explanatory. So is the fact that you can’t say things that are false in court and/or could greatly harm the reputation of another person. But you can express your view of the president, even if it is negative, right? Well according to the United States military, you can’t.
If you don’t believe me, just ask Sergeant Gary Stein of the United States Marine Corps.  Sergeant Stein has recently been reprimanded by his superior officers for expressing his views on Facebook about President Obama. According to an article posted on the BBC News website on April 6, 2012 entitled “US Marine faces dismissal for criticizing President Obama,” Sergeant Stein got in trouble for putting President Obama’s face on movie posters, such as the movie “Jackass.” Ok, so this Sergeant who is putting his life on the line to defend our freedom and our country is being told he is no longer free to create fake movie posters that insult the president. If the people fighting for our freedoms aren’t free, then what in the world are they fighting for in the first place? The military has single handedly taken freedom of speech away from someone who fights for freedom. If anything, shouldn’t his dedication to our country entitle him to a bit more freedom? According to this same article by BBC News, Stein could be demoted or face an “other-than-honorable discharge” for his actions. The article also reported that Stein had been warned several times to stop these posts because they are “in breach of military regulations.” Stein, who has been a marine for nine years, says that he has his own opinions and has even gone as far as putting a disclaimer on his Facebook that says so. I personally don’t see the big deal. He warns his readers; he should have the constitutional right to speak his mind, but here we are with proof that freedom of speech is not so free.
It is still unknown as to what exactly will happen to Sergeant Stein but here is what we do know. If he is penalized for speaking his mind, we take a step in the Soviet, the Cuban, the Chinese, and the North Korean directions. If we dare to limit what we can say about our President, we might as well start calling him Dear Leader Obama. For the sake of the Constitution, the rights of the people, and our beloved freedoms, I do hope this case is thrown out. Otherwise the military has seriously cut our personal freedoms and we have a whole new set of issues to worry about.

Now that finals are coming up and the trees are starting to blossom as the first really nice days of spring begin to roll in, it’s impossible not to come down with summer fever.
You’ll start to see students sprawled out tanning on the lawns in between study sessions just hoping to get that sun kissed look that they’ve been deprived of over the winter months. If you already have tanning on the brain, you might as well take it a step further and start planning your beach trips for the summer months. Besides you’ll need something to look forward to with all of the studying for finals beginning soon.
Fortunately, Long Island is home to some of the most amazing beaches in the world. So if you’re not from around here, but are sticking around for the summer, here are three locations you’d be a fool to not check out.
1.Long Beach
I admit I’m a little biased seeing as Long Beach is my home town but I must say compared to any other beach I’ve been to, Long Beach sand is the best. This beautiful, fine white sand feels amazing under your feet and is perfect for playing volleyball, sleeping, building sand castles, and digging. Long Beach is easily accessible. The station is the last stop on the Long Beach line of the LIRR and the beach is a 2 minute walk straight off the tracks. What is also special about Long Beach is the beautiful 2.2 mile-long boardwalk that borders the beach where you will always find people running, biking, or just watching the action on the beach below.
2.Fire Island
One of the more difficult beaches to get to because there are no cars allowed on the island, Fire Island offers a more secluded and laid back vibe. The island is 32 miles long and is home to many charming hotels, restaurants, summer rentals, shops, and more. Compared to the more crowded atmosphere at Jones Beach, Fire Island beaches offer a more romantic setting for those looking to just get away.
3.The Hamptons and Montauk
On the easternmost part of the south shore of Long Island, you’ll find the famous Hamptons and Montauk Point. And although this scenic spot is great for celebrity spotting, it offers a lot more to the public than you would expect. The Hamptons has amazing shopping, dining and nightlife. And Montauk is notorious for some of the best fishing spots on the East Coast and you can even go whale watching. If you decide to make the trek out here make sure not to miss the around 200 year old Montauk Point Lighthouse, you won’t be disappointed.

One of the good things about Long Island University is that it accepts students from all over the world and gives them the opportunity to study together and international connections. Students can become acquainted with each other’s cultures and traditions, explore new mentalities and lifestyles, and exchange ideas, opinions and views on different subjects. It is abundantly clear that students become educated not just during their class time, but also in their free time, communicating with other students from countries all over the world. But, unfortunately, on campus, international students appear to be noticeably segregated from American students.
Dasha Bazanova, a Russian Fine Arts major, agrees that there is international student segregation and that students from Sweden, Norway, Russia and other countries form their own small communities. However, she tries to communicate with everybody, regardless of one’s  nation of origin. Bazanova thinks that Americans are very welcoming and it’s very easy to talk with them and make friends, and she even feels uncomfortable speaking Russian here. She believes it’s better to form a community based on common interests, not on a common nation.
Bianca Rahimzadeh, a Swedish freshman Public Relations major, also notices International students to form their own communities. “I think there is so much segregation in this school and it’s crazy.” According to Rahimzadeh, it is because she and some other Swedish students came here in a group. “So, when we got here, we knew each other, and in unknown surroundings, it was more comfortable to speak with people who are from the same country as you are.” As they continued hanging out with the same people, “it could seem difficult for people not from this group to approach it and talk to you, because you are always sitting with 10 people of your nationality.” But Rahimzadeh adds that now she has more American friends than when she first came here and maybe it takes some time to form connections.
Nina Wikstol, an international student from Norway, also notices the trend. “I definitely think international students are segregated here at LIU Post, mostly because we have an orientation together where we are in the same program for a couple of days. We quickly find people that are in the same boat, and it is especially easy to talk to people from your own country. I think people with the same nationality tend to hang around each other because it feels safe. It’s always easy to cling to what is familiar. Also, a majority of people who live on campus are international students and it is often more difficult getting to know commuters as they don’t live next door or spend much time in Winnick.”
Azamat Doszhan, a Social Science and Anthropology major from Kazakhstan, said, “Before, I used to feel more segregation in terms of playing activities, like sports, soccer, but now it’s more question of ‘causality of mentality’. Doszhan said international students come here for school but also to meet new people. However, it can be easier to bond with those from your own country. “But later, you start communicating and hanging out with students from other countries as well.”
According to Frida Bengtsson, a Swedish freshman, one of the reasons for international student segregation is that “people want to be a part of their own culture at the same time as they are here, because it feels safer for them.” It’s just a question of common culture and mentality. As for Americans, Bengtsson considers them friendly enough, but “they have their life and we have our life, and it’s not interconnected, because most of them don’t live on campus and go home after classes while we stay here, on campus, where there are no places to go out and to relax in an informal atmosphere and make friends.”
As for the last statement, I absolutely agree. I think for making friendly connections with Americans just “common hour” on campus is not enough. What is needed is some relaxing place to go out after classes and talk informally, without thinking about your next class, assignments to do or a quiz to take. And that is what we don’t have on campus, because it’s quite isolated. Also, Going to the nearest shop or bar can be difficult and take some time because you have to wait for the bus or train. It’s a real problem if you don’t have your own car. Therefore, you have just small opportunities to exchange a couple of phrases with your American classmates before or after class (and then they go home and you are stay on campus). It’s definitely not enough to make friends with them. And during the weekends, the only way for you to go out is with people from your own country, who live here on campus in the same situation as you are in.
International student segregation seems to be because they make communities among themselves based on a common nationality and language and the forced separation between commuter and resident students. To tell the truth, it’s kind of frustrating, because international students all come here not just for pure studying, but also for improving our English and for communicating with American people and students from other countries, for knowing their culture, tradition, and lifestyle. All of this is also part of education and is what we are lacking.

While I sit in the waiting room of an overcrowded doctor’s office, I try to take my mind off the nervousness I’m feeling. I run through a list of things in my head that I haven’t even begun to complete for the week: the pile of homework sitting in my backpack, the emails for work that need to be sent, countless errands, and the move back into my recently remodeled bedroom. But it is exactly all these thoughts that contribute to the anxiety and stress that my doctor tells me is the reason for my ongoing nausea.
Every college student experiences some stress during his or her time at school. It’s your body’s way of responding to an unbalanced nervous system.  When you leave an important assignment till the last minute because you worked at your part-time job all week, or even when you have a disagreement with a friend or significant other, your body goes into emergency mode. As we come to end of a semester with final exams looming, multiple stressors can mount.
“Common problems and issues that cause stress can be family dynamics (problems at home), problems with relationships, trying to balance their academics and outside work responsibilities, not having enough time to get everything completed,” Lynne A. Schwartz, Associate Director for Counseling Services, said. She added that family illness and financial issues, not having enough money for school, paying the bills and health insurance, along with “not having a safe place to live, not having a place to get their work done, issues with alcohol or other drugs, either with the student or a family member,” can cause severe stress, she added.
Sometimes, that stress can help motivate you to complete whatever tasks are at hand, or even better yourself as a person. More often than not, however, it will come to a point where your body and mind suffer real physical effects.
Fatigue, moodiness, irritability, and unhappiness are only some minor feelings that can be associated with stress. There are far more severe conditions and illnesses that are caused by stress.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 7.8 percent of men and 12.3 percent of women ages 18-24 report frequent mental distress–a key indicator for depression and other mental disorders.
Physical symptoms can also appear when stress is at its peak. Body aches and pains and periodic colds can keep you out of commission if they persist, but from personal experience, nausea and digestive problems can be particularly debilitating.
Alicia O’Leary, a senior at LIU Post, dealt with the same frustration her junior year. “I was taking 18 credits, working part time, in a speech club, volunteering, on kick line, and I had to complete 25 hours of observation,” she said, remembering the difficult semester.
“Whenever I would eat I would get either nauseous or exhausted and had to lie down for a while,” she added. “I went to my doctor but they didn’t know what it was.” Dealing with the same problem, I can say that being unaware of the root of the illness causes an excessive amount of stress, only making you feel worse.
This year, Alicia’s schedule has winded down, and her condition has taken a backseat in her life. She gives the credit of her recovery to the fact that she “relaxed during summer.”
But full-time students don’t always have the time to relax when it comes to stress. Schwartz and fellow counselor Sarah Boles offered some tips on how to lower your anxiety and keep your body fit.
“Finding healthy outlets such as exercise, spending time with friends, counseling, hobbies or interests,” are some ways Boles says can help students cope with stress to prevent illness. “Also, eating well and having good sleep habits are helpful when dealing with stress.”
Time management is a skill all students should master to keep up with healthy sleeping habits and rest. Schedule enough time to work on that term paper or presentation as soon as it is assigned so you don’t have to pull an “all-nighter.”
Along with the Student Health and Counseling Services provided on campus, the Pratt Recreation Center offers nutrition counseling as well as many stress-relieving classes like yoga that you can take to help relax your body.
When all else fails, talk to someone! If those pesky symptoms persist or you just can’t get your head straight, see a doctor or counselor to put your mind at ease. “Sometimes it pays to see the doctor on campus or their private physician,” Schwartz said. “They can guide a student to help identify what is going and then refer them to the next step.”
“We have many services right here on campus to help students stay healthy,” Boles said, referring to the Student Health and Counseling Center. They are there whenever a student is feeling frazzled or upset, or even when a student just needs someone to listen. Don’t let stress take over. When life gives you too many obstacles, just take a deep breath, and remember that help is nearby. The Student Health and Counseling Center is located in the Life Sciences building, room 154. For more information, call 516-299-2345.

Hello there, fellow commuter drivers! I wanted to take a break on the serious stuff and focus on how important summer will be. For those brave enough to drive to the beach this summer, you should take precautions because the cops are all over the place.
For starters, always bring a cooler filled with beverages. I’m not talking about alcoholic beverages although I am guilty to bring a few beers to the beach. If you really want to, be careful. Bring cups and pour it in the cups so you can keep the labels from the cops that are always scouring the beaches. Even driving with booze in your car could prove to be fateful especially if you’re underage.
When driving to the beach, always have your license and money ready. It’s awful that we have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for parking. When getting to the booths, it’s so much easier to have everything ready. Especially if you’re carpooling, have everybody produce some cash to give you.  Jones Beach is the worst because you have to stop at the booths and produce a ticket at the field as well.
Tailgating is always fun as well, but once again, keep the booze out of the picture. I have known many people that have gotten screwed by the cops. In my opinion, I would save the tailgating for a Mets game, especially if it’s a Mets vs. Yankees game. Keep the partying for the beach. Why pay all that money to relax in the parking lot. The sand is more comfortable.
So for those deciding to go to the beach before season, it’s a good idea because you won’t have to pay just yet. But it’ll be cold, so maybe tanning is all it’s good for right now. As always, I wish everybody safe driving from the beach and to wherever you may end up.

Sunglasses are a great accessory to add to your ensemble for so many reasons. Whether you are trying to conceal the fact that you were too lazy to put on makeup that morning or you think you are cool enough that you can wear your sunglasses at night, there are numerous fashion forward options to choose from this spring season.
Cat Eye: Although this trend may seem a little farfetched or even unattainable, you might be surprised to know that cat eyed sunglasses are flattering on nearly all face shapes. There are two different degrees on the market currently: traditional 1950s swoopy ones and wider, softer 1980s versions. Celebrities such as Kourtney Kardashian and Scarlett Johansson are notorious for sporting these vintage-inspired spectacles.
Wayfarer: These sunglasses are popular in virtually every season for the past couple of years. Made especially popular by Old Hollywood actors of yesteryear and of course Tom Cruise’s character in “Risky Business”, wayfarers are an extremely classic and timeless option. Therefore, I would suggest investing your money in a trusty pair of Ray Ban wayfarers because they will last you practically a lifetime. The best part about wayfarers is that they are available in almost every single color you could possible think of. These are the perfect sunglasses for those fabulous sunny 80-degree days at the beach.
Rounded: This trend may not be for everyone because rounded sunglasses have the ability to make some of us appear like bugs. However, after some digging through your local Forever 21 or H&M, you may get lucky and find ones that suit your face just right. As with most of these different types of sunglasses, you can always adapt this trend to fit your personality and lifestyle. That’s why they have mirrors all over clothing stores after all! Emulate John Lennon’s signature shades or air more on the trendy side like Lady Gaga, who is known for the round Mickey Mouse-looking sunglasses from her “Paparazzi” music video.
Gradient Lens: Gradient lens mean that they begin with a very dark tint like black or brown and then gradually lighten to almost clear. For those of us that enjoy sunglasses that completely shield your eyes, these might not be the option for you. This trend is definitely a different and more unique take on typical sunglasses. These sunglasses are more a fashion statement then protection from the sun.
Aviators: Recently, I picked up my first pair of Aviators and now I know what the “hubbub” is about. My favorite Aviator translation has silver frames and mirrored lens. While Aviators can make you look like a police officer or a pilot, this trend can still be quite stylish. Check out RayBan for the perfect pair of Aviators.
Sunglasses are all about mixing convenience with a dose of effortless glamour so have fun with your shades. It’s a great way to add a pop of color into an outfit without looking too over the top or as if you are trying too hard. If you are looking to invest in a pair of great quality sunglasses, I suggest RayBan, Marc Jacobs, and Chanel. These higher end brands stand out amongst the others for producing great eyewear. Additionally, I would also recommend Target and Forever 21 for affordable, inexpensive sunglasses to fit your personal style.

Beginning on April 9th, students and facility of the LIU Post community have the opportunity to work with international Eco-Artist, Roy Staab! Together, Staab and the students will create an outdoor installation on the hill in front of the Fine Arts Building. Staab will be on campus between April 9th and April 23th, 2012 building the sculpture that will become “Stack/Flow”.
Roy Staab has traveled across the United States and even around the world working in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Italy, Finland, France, Canada, Costa Rica and Brazil. Staab has created his environmental installations in numerous universities, museums and cultural institutions. His work is widely recognized and he has received many grants and awards including a National Endowment of the Arts Fellowship, Gottlieb Foundation Award, and the Nature Art Prize at the Guemngang Nature Art Biennial.
Staab works with natural materials to build on-site installations inspired by nature itself. He looks at his pieces of art as “scientific”, to try and find what is discovered after the piece is complete. Every installation is an experiment and he uses inspirations from patterns and forms found easily in nature. Staab applies these natural forms to his art to create a new, unique piece.
As the installation is being built, Staab will be hosting a lecture on April 16th, 2012, between 12:20-1:30PM in the Hillwood Commons Cinema. He will speak about his work in an image lecture and is open to the public. We invite all students and facility to attend the lecture and find out more about the artist.
Upon completion of the installation, there will be a ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate the opening of the work. On Monday, April 23rd, 2012 at 12:30, everyone is invited to come to the front of the Fine Arts Building and honor the work of Staab and all those who have been a part of the installation process of “Stack/Flow”.

As busy college students, most of us rarely have time to sit down for a meal. Instead we grab a quick bite to eat, usually some prepackaged food loaded with salt and lacking anything that can keep your energy going throughout the day. However, here at LIU Post, there is an abundance of food options that are provided at many of dining locations.
First, everyone should eat breakfast before his or her first class. Eating breakfast can help your concentration and increase your problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and alertness in class.
Try to start off your day with protein. At Hillwood, you can get two hard-boiled eggs for around $1.40. One egg contains six grams of high-quality protein and all nine essential amino acids, which can only be obtained from your diet because your body doesn’t make them naturally. Eggs contain the right kind of fat. One egg contains just five grams of fat and only 1.5 grams of that is saturated fat. Eggs are one of the only foods that contain naturally occurring vitamin D.
If you’re craving something sweet, instead of grabbing a cookie or a brownie, grab some fruit. You can find fresh apples, bananas, pears, berries, melons, and grapes at any of the dining locations on campus. Fruits are naturally sweet, but are packed with the nutrients you need that you aren’t getting when you snack on cookies and brownies. Fruits are great sources of numerous vitamins, minerals and other natural substances that may help protect you from chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Be sure to look in the refrigerated sections or in a fruit bowl at the dining locations to find fresh tasty fruits.
LIU Post does sell some pre-packed foods that can be a healthier alternative in comparison to a bag of chips or a candy bar. In the P.O.D, you can purchase Fiber One Chewy Bars Oats & Peanut Butter.  At 150 calories per bar with nine grams of fiber, this nutty bar contains about one third of your day’s recommended fiber intake. Eating fiber can help you feel full, which can help control your appetite when you’re in a three-hour biology lab.
At the Humanities Café, you can grab a KIND Bar. KIND Bars boast that they are all natural whole nut & fruit bars that are loaded with nutrients like fiber, protein, calcium and iron. Just the other day I enjoyed the Almond & Apricot variety, which is packed with whole almonds, apricots and coconut and only 190 calories and 5 grams fiber and 4 grams of protein. It was absolutely delicious, and way more satisfying than any candy bar I’ve ever eaten.
Be sure to be on the lookout for KIND Bars in all different types of flavors and varieties on campus. Remember, when it comes to On-The-Go eating, try to get the most “bang for your buck” by eating foods that will help your get the most nutrients you need.

Spring is here and along with it comes the perfect time to start your own garden! There is a lot of research that shows exposure to natural environments can have a positive effect on your health.  In study published by Roger S. Urlich, it was found the recovery times for post surgical patients were shortened when they were being exposed daily to images of nature, in comparison to those patients looking at images of brick walls.  There has also been evidence of electrical activity in the brain that responds to natural images.  This brain activity is said to cause a shift in emotions, leading to a boost in immunity.
It is not hard to grow your own garden.  Simply pick a plot of land that has exposure to sunlight and is hit by a sprinkler system or is easy to water.  The size of your plot will determine the fruits and vegetables you can choose to grow.  For smaller spaces, stick to plants like tomatoes and peppers, which will grow upwards on cages, taking up minimal space for multiple plants.  If you have more space, add in cucumbers, summer squash and eggplant.  These plants have large leaves and grow more outward, needing space to stretch.  Work a layer of topsoil or other organic material into the plot that is roughly a foot and a half thick.  When planting, dig a hole that is about two times the size of the plant’s diameter generally ensuring enough depth for the plant.
The physical activity of gardening gives you a nice workout, as well as being exposed to the Vitamin D in sunlight and fresh summer air. Taking care of your garden gives you the opportunity to enjoy fresh produce all summer long and gain some other health benefits while you enjoy!

When it comes to Michael Jackson, opinions of him are often varied. Some people loved him, believing that he was full of passion and kindness and was misunderstood by society. Others loved to hate him. One thing that cannot be disputed, however, is that Michael Jackson was a man of unsurpassed talent and creativity — a star so bright that no other could outshine him. He was known for drawing crowds of all races, genders, ethnicities and ages into a room and making them feel like one, and it was no different at Madison Square Garden on Thursday, April 5th, when Cirque du Soleil’s Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour rolled into New York City.
The show was an endless parade of captivating choreography, riveting acrobatics, wonderful theatrics and attention-grabbing pyrotechnics. From mimes to instrumentalists to a one-legged acrobat, who wowed the crowd with his talent and drew in the loudest cheers, Cirque du Soleil brought the entertainment it is famous for and more.
The two and a half hour show featured medleys from Jackson’s most famous songs, including his hits “Smooth Criminal,” “Billie Jean,” “Thriller,” “Bad,” and “Man in the Mirror,” among his Jackson 5 hits and many others. Footage from his music videos was often displayed in the background, as dancers flawlessly reenacted his legendary dance moves alongside acrobats, musicians, pole dancers and contortionists.  As an introduction to some of the flawlessly executed routines, audio clips of Jackson saying his most famous quotes echoed through the speakers, giving the chilling feeling that he was among the audience in the packed arena.
The details entailed in this performance were incredible. Between the acrobats’ light-clad costumes to reflect stars in the sky, the replica Neverland Ranch gates, the life-sized, dancing Michael Jackson glitter glove and a dancer dressed as MJ’s former chimpanzee, Bubbles, it felt as though Michael Jackson’s world had truly come alive. It seemed the only thing that was missing was Jackson, himself, but his creative spirit and energy were alive and well during the whole performance.
From parents with their young children to teenagers with their friends and adults reminiscing about yesteryear, Cirque du Soleil’s Michael Jackson: The Immortal left nearly everyone with a smile on his or her face. The show even attracted some famous figures, like former Real Housewives of New Jersey star Dina Manzo, who tweeted that she was in the audience of the show and shared a picture of her favorite performance scene with her Twitter followers.
Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour is currently making its way throughout the United States and stops next at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale before heading off to Pennsylvania. It’s worth seeing for any Michael Jackson fan or for anyone looking to have a fun night out.  It doesn’t disappoint.

The Art Loft of Port Washington is a non-profit cooperative for artists where work space can be shared. It provides a creative working and teaching environment where all are welcomed. The venue has various types of art classes for all ages.
“Communities need a place to show people’s creativity without an expensive price tag,” said Jan Conant Jamshidi, the Director of The Art Loft. “We are not looking for a profit; all we want is to pay our rent and let people utilize space at a reasonable rate.”
Last year, Jamshidi and her co-owners, Rita Wilmers and Barbara La Motta, were looking for a new, bigger space when their new location, in the Community Chest Building, opened up. “It’s about the best deal in town,” Wilmers exclaimed.
Wilmers teaches a mixed media and acrylic painting class and a fashion drawing class for children ages nine through 12. She creates art using various mediums. Her ongoing exhibit of paintings was featured as Alison Humphrey’s on the first season of the CW’s Gossip Girl.
“On Wednesdays, a group gets together to paint and critique each other’s work. We learn from each other and appreciate each other’s point of view,” said La Motta. In this type of meeting, several independent artists work on their own pieces while in each other’s company. It is cheaper because each person just pays to use the space, not for a class. The Art Loft overlooks the water and has a scenic atmosphere, which can inspire artists. “It is a social environment, has wonderful lighting, and is an amazing atmosphere for ideas,” said La Motta.
Jamshidi has the only private studio in the coop because her work consists of mostly glass. She creates plates and vases, designs them by cutting shapes out of bronze paper, paints them, and then places them on the glass. Jamshidi teaches a mixed media collage glass workshop.
The founders of the Art Loft have worked together for five years and are like a family. They all work as a group, and they encourage people with similar spirits. “We are planning to expand and are looking for residents to join us for shared space,” said Jamshidi. A few more residents are needed. Both teachers and independent artists are welcomed. They volunteer in Project Independence, which keeps senior citizens living in their nursing homes. The Art Loft will also have a table at Port Fest 2012.
“We should interconnect the arts, visual arts with poetry and music; they are all connected,” said Wilmers. The Art Loft wants to start teaching classes in writing and journalism as well. “Art is all influenced by the world and inspired by culture. Nothing is isolated,” she said.
Both students and faculty from LIU are invited to join. The Art Loft is located at 382 Main Street, 2nd Floor in Port Washington, New York 11050. The telephone number is (516) 767-8804.

The resort town of Cabo San Lucas, named for the slender cape extending eastward from Baja’s southernmost tip, gradually developed into a tourist hot spot over the last 40 years. Today, Cabo is an ideal destination that captures the essence of Baja Peninsula through its many resorts, championship golf courses, world-class dining, and amazing outdoor activities. The area is considered the second fastest-growing resort destination in all of Mexico and is particularly busy with visitors during the winter high season: November to February. With some of the best all-around sport fishing in the world and every water sport imaginable, Cabo is the ultimate destination for travelers looking for outdoor adventure.
Airport/Getting There: Cabo is served by Los Cabos International Airport, which is located outside of San Jose del Cabo. It will take approximately 30-45 minutes to travel to Cabo San Lucas. All the major American airlines fly to the airport, as well as Aereo Calafia, Aeromexico, Alaska Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Interjet, Mexicana, Volaris, Canadian Air Transat, and WestJet.
Hotels/Lodging: Whether you are looking for a place to stay with the whole family, a romantic hotel, or that perfect home away from home, Cabo accommodations have something for anyone looking for peaceful solitude, high adventure, world-class fishing, and golf.

Junior attacker Ashley Olen scored a career-high nine goals on Saturday, April 7th, to lead the fifth-ranked LIU Post Women’s Lacrosse Team to a 20-10 victory over No. 11 Merrimack College.
The win boosted the Pioneers’ overall record to 8-1 and dropped the Warriors to 4-5.
Less than 10 minutes into play, Post took the lead 2-0 on a pair of goals from Olen and senior midfielder Nan Mayott, who recorded a hat trick in the game.
As the half drew to a close, Merrimack was able to score three straight goals to bring the score to 9-6 before Olen scored her fourth goal of the game with 50 seconds left to play in the half.
Merrimack notched the first goal of the second half, but its momentum was cut short when the Pioneers responded with two goals from Olen and junior Abigail Ross, who finished the day with six goals of her own. Post hung on to this momentum, allowing just one more Warrior goal before initiating its own 8-0 streak to pull ahead 20-8.
The Pioneer offense slowed down after the team’s 20th goal, while the Warriors managed to put two more points on the board in the final eight minutes to finalize the 20-10 score.
Junior goaltender Dominique Mosca made 12 saves for the Pioneers before switching out for sophomore Katie Hannan, who allowed one goal and recorded one save in the final 2:51 of the game.
Women’s Lacrosse will be back in action on Saturday, April 14th, when the team faces Molloy College at 3 p.m. on Hickox Field.

Within the past week, the LIU Post Women’s Softball Team has won four games and lost two, sweeping New York Institute of Technology two days in a row and losing two games to the University of New Haven earlier in the week. LIU Post defeated NYIT by scores of 11-0, 8-0, 11-3, and 10-1. Post was defeated by New Haven by scores of 6-5 and 2-1.
On Saturday, April 5th, the softball team took donations during the doubleheader against NYIT for “Score For A Cure,” which donates money to fight Multiple Sclerosis. Fans in attendance were able to pledge small donations for every run scored by both teams throughout the game. All of the money collected was donated to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
LIU Post did not disappoint on Saturday, scoring 21 runs between the two games.  Both games were shortened to five innings each due to mercy rules. The four wins in two days propelled the Women’s Softball Team to 25-13 overall and 13-1 in East Coast Conference play.
In the first game of the day, the Pioneers were led by freshmen Catherine Havens and Alyson Dzierzynski in addition to senior Krysta Palazzo, each of who walked away with three hits in the game. In the second game, sophomore pitcher Liz Weber earned her 11th win of the season when she allowed just one run and three hits over the span of four innings pitched in addition to notching five strikeouts. Weber leads the Pioneers in strikeouts with 80 on the season so far.
Up next for the Pioneers is a home doubleheader against Mercy College on Thursday, April 12th, at 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. at the Softball Complex.

LIU Post’s Baseball Team currently has a record of 15-13 after defeating Molloy College 9-1 on Wednesday, April 4th, and getting swept in a doubleheader against Saint Thomas Aquinas College on Saturday, April 7th.
In the home contest against the Molloy Lions (12-18), the Pioneers jumped out to an early 5-0 lead after a five-run outburst in the first inning. The first runs of the game were produced by junior catcher Anthony Corona as he drove in sophomore centerfielder Rich Maccarone and sophomore third baseman Tom Tolan on a two-run triple. Junior shortstop Keith Herring and junior right-fielder Gabriel Santos followed Corona, each contributing with RBI singles in the inning. Freshman outfielder Anthony Brunetti continued the hot hitting for the Pioneers, as he knocked in a run on a RBI double.
Pioneers’ senior starting pitcher Glen Hudson was dominant on the mound as he went eight strong innings, allowing only two hits and three walks to register his second win of the season.
Three days later, the Pioneers traveled up to Sparkill, New York, to face the Saint Thomas Aquinas Spartans (22-10) in a doubleheader. In the first game of the day, the Spartans had the upper hand, as they knocked off the Pioneers by a score of 9-5. Pioneers’ junior starting pitcher Bo Budkevics had a rough day, as he threw six innings, surrendering nine earned runs on 13 hits.
The Pioneers’ offense was unable to get anything going for most of the game, as they had a total of five hits all game long and did not reach base once via a walk. Spartans’ senior pitcher Matt Marotta remained undefeated (5-0) with the win, throwing a complete game, striking out three batters and allowing only two earned runs.
The Pioneers tried to salvage the second game of the doubleheader against the Spartans but had a poor showing, getting shut out 7-0. The Pioneers actually had the same number of hits on offense (five) as they did errors. Pioneers’ senior starting pitcher James Stone threw four innings, giving up three runs, still keeping LIU in the game. Freshman pitcher Joey Arena relieved Stone by tossing two scoreless frames, holding the Spartans in check. However, the Pioneers were unable to muster any offense against Spartans’ sophomore starting pitcher Eric Cooper as he threw six shutout innings.
The Pioneers’ next game is on Friday, April 13th, at home against Dowling College (17-12) at 3:00 p.m.
