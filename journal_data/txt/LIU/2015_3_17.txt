A food truck will arrive on campus shortly after spring break, according to Paul Carroll, Director of Operations for Aramark, the campus food provider. Caroll said that The Pioneer Food Wagon will essentially be a fortified golf cart, serving beverages, snacks, coffee, and hot and cold grab-and- go products. These items will be priced similarly to the food sold in the Hillwood Commons cafe. Carroll said that he is still in the early stages of finalizing the menu for the wagon.
According to LIU Post’s website, there are approximately 4,429 undergraduate students attending Post. With common hour lasting only an hour and a half, Hillwood Commons and the Winnick dining hall, the most popular areas on campus to get food, fill up quickly, causing long lines.
“I usually wait until an hour into common hour to get my lunch [at Hillwood]. That way I avoid the lines,” said Melissa Weisman, a senior Electronic Media major. Although Weisman is able to avoid the lines, she is then left with just 30 minutes to eat her lunch and meet with friends before her next class.
The Pioneer Food Wagon will minimize the lunch lines, and create opportunities for students and faculty members on the go to grab a quick snack between classes or meetings, according to Carroll. He said the food wagon was chosen for its versatility, and its ability to be moved around campus easily.
As of now, Carroll said the wagon will be parked on south campus at Lorber Hall, and have alternating routes throughout the academic week. The hours of operation are still being discussed; however, Carroll said he expects the hours of operation to be mornings, afternoons, and evenings Monday through Thursday, as well as limited hours on the weekends. Specific times are still pending due to employee availability.
“I think a food truck on campus would be an interesting feature,” said Paul Palacios, a junior Technology major. “I have a weird schedule where sometimes I don’t even have a common hour. A food truck would make things simpler than going into Hillwood and waiting on a long line for a water bottle and cup of fruit.”
The Pioneer Food Wagon is anticipated to be a student run business. Aramark will be employing students to operate the wagon and serve Aramark products. Carroll said he is looking for responsible students, with driver’s licenses, to operate the truck for the hours that it will be open.

On Friday, March 20, from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., LIU Post will host its annual Pratt After Dark event. Exciting games, cool prizes, fun contests, along with food and music, will be available for all students.
Pratt After Dark is an indoor carnival that will take place in the Pratt Recreation Center, and is hosted by the Office of Campus Life. For this year’s Pratt After Dark, Campus Life has decided on a Dave & Buster’s theme. There will be slot machines, a large selection of casino tables, and arcade games. Campus Life will also be raffling off and distributing prizes, but there is no say on what the items will be.
“Last year was my first year at Pratt After Dark. I think it was a good experience to get the commuters and dormers together, because I feel like the commuters aren’t really involved,” said Casey Koster, a sophomore Broadcasting major.
The goal for the event is to offer a variety of activities that appeal to all students. The activities slightly change each year, but this year will be a completely fresh look from the past.
“We were committed to giving the event a facelift this year. Our job in Campus Life is to make it an exciting experience regardless of how many times a student has attend[ed] the event,” said Michael Berthel, the Director of Campus Life.
Stephanie Ruhle, a senior Broadcasting major, is looking forward to this year’s Pratt after Dark. “It’s nice to be around everyone, take the night off, and just chill,” she said.
There is no charge for LIU students to attend Pratt After Dark. Students are required to bring their LIU ID cards to present at the door. For more information on Pratt After Dark, students can visit campus life in Hillwood Commons Room 102, or contact them at 516-299-3594.

Dear Editor:
Regarding “Fire Alarms Disrupt Classes” posted on Feb. 24, 2015, we would like to clarify that on Feb. 4, the Life Sciences building’s heat and thermal detectors were triggered causing the first alarm. There was no fire and after the alarm was reset, a second alarm went off, possibly due to a faulty unit. At that point, the decision was made to replace the detector in case the original unit was faulty. There has been no inadvertent alarm since.
It is important to note that once a fire alarm goes off, LIU Post cannot allow anyone back inside the building until the Roslyn Fire Department deems the site is safe. The health and safety of LIU students, faculty, and staff remains our top priority, and we thank the LIU community for their continued cooperation.
Regards,
William Kirker, Director of Facilities Services at LIU Post

A group of 14 students and two staff members traveled to Washington, D.C. on Friday, Feb. 27 and Saturday, Feb. 28 to help feed the homeless citizens of our nation’s capital. Students worked alongside various non-profit organizations doing service work throughout the city. The trip was sponsored by the Office of Campus Life to provide a meaningful community service opportunity for students, according to Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life.
Berthel explained that Campus Life partnered with the Youth Service Program (YSOP), an organization that is committed to helping young people participate in service projects. Campus Life has worked with YSOP in the past, during last summer’s first-year service project in New York. YSOP connects the university with local non-profits and individuals in the area that might need their help.
“While in D.C., our students worked with individuals who are hungry and homeless,” Berthel said. “They participated in a group dialogue led by social workers that are employed by YSOP about these important issues, and how there are so many [people] in need right in [D.C.].”
The Office of Campus Life wanted the trip to be affordable for students, and subsidized the cost of it, according to Berthel. Students who were interested in participating had to complete an online application, and pay a $50 registration fee. “We had 20 spots available, and all were filled within the first day. It was extremely popular, and we hope to run even more of these trips in the future,” Berthel added.
On Friday, Feb. 27, the LIU Post delegation was in charge of preparing dinner for guests in the immediate area of the YSOP headquarters. On Saturday, Feb. 28, the students traveled to various sites including local shelters, soup kitchens, and churches throughout D.C., and served hundreds of individuals in the city. The students stayed overnight in a gymnasium operated by the YSOP located in the heart of D.C., and returned to campus on Sunday.
Olivia Grillo, a sophomore English major, who went on the trip, thoroughly enjoyed her experience. “I would like to say that nothing compared to the feeling of knowing you were making even the slightest impact on another person’s life. Even something as small as seeing a genuine smile fills you up and makes you feel warm and whole,” she said. “While I was on dish duty, I heard my name being called, and I turned around to see Alan, one of my new friends who I had served food for, standing in the doorway. He told me he didn’t want to leave without saying goodbye, and that he’d miss me so much. I almost cried as I wrapped him into a hug. Later that night, not only did I cry, but I bawled like a baby,” Grillo said.
Berthel believes that it’s important for students to participate in projects like this. “By participating in service projects, not only are students able to serve as ambassadors for the LIU Post student community, but they are able to learn and participate in dialogues about important social issues that face our society by interacting with homeless [people], and getting to see how they can help them,” he said. “Our students are caring and thoughtful citizens, and our service programs on-campus and off-campus help highlight all they do.”
Tiffany Messing, a senior Musical Theater major, believes that it’s great that Post is offering these types of trips. “Unfortunately I work, and wasn’t able to sign up for this trip, but I think it’s such a great idea,” Messing said. “I’ve done service projects like this in the past, and I think they are such eye opening experience[s], and you [can] get so much from them.”
Messing also thought it was great that the trip filled to capacity. “That just shows how there are people who are really willing to give back,” she said. “Especially since a lot of times college students are perceived as not really caring about things like [this]; it’s important that they show that they do care and they do want to make a difference.”

The deadline for applications to study abroad during the fall 2015 semester is March 30. To date, the fall semester has a smaller number of students registered to participate in one of LIU Post’s international study abroad programs.
“I think many students are not aware of the financial aid and scholarships they can apply to for studying abroad, therefore they tend to stay away from the possibility,” said Patricia Seaman, Director of International Studies.
“We usually always receive a good amount of applications during the month of March,” Seaman said. “If someone is interested, they are more than welcome to set up an appointment to get all the information and explore all their options.”
On average, LIU Post sends 75 to 100 students to study abroad each semester on one of the affiliated international campuses. “We are always looking to increase the number of students who go abroad,” Seaman added. “England and Australia are two of the most popular countries that our students go to, but Spain is becoming a contender.”
Seaman suggested that more students study abroad in the spring semester than the fall semester. “Spring is usually more common because they can travel after the semester is over into the summer. Although interest in short term summer programs is growing.”
One reason fewer students may be signing up to study abroad is that credits do not always transfer over. Some students have complained that upon returning to LIU Post, they had repeated credits, or their classes abroad wouldn’t count towards their major requirement.
“I have heard that a lot of people don’t get all of their credits transferred over,” said Mariel Bourie, a freshman Music Education major. “It definitely would scare me away because I wouldn’t want all my hard work from previous semesters to be wasted.”
However, Seaman said this is not the case. “If you study abroad with an affiliated program, you are still registered with LIU. Therefore you are still receiving credits as if you were taking classes here,” she said. “If you study abroad through an approved non-affiliate then your courses have to be approved by your major department and study abroad office before you go, so you will know exactly what courses you’ll be getting credit for once you complete them.”
To register for one of the study abroad programs, students can make an appointment to meet with Patricia Seaman in Winnick House, Room 221. “Coming to the office to find out all the options and aid available is a great way to start the adventure,” said Seaman. There are currently 12 programs students can choose from, including Thailand, the United Kingdom, Australia, Bali, and Morocco. More information can be found on liu.edu/Global.

Professor Lauren Sassenoff’s College 101 class during the fall of 2014 created a service learning project called “Purify Your Mind” to promote sustainability on campus. The “Purify Your Mind” motto created by the class has now grown on campus, and is being used to promote sustainability among students.
The service learning projects can be ways to improve campus life, or to improve life outside of campus, like the environment. Students must find a theme for their service learning project to create a concrete plan for what they desire to accomplish.
The campus Sustainability Committee is trying to incorporate ways that freshman can promote going green through their College 101 classes, according to Sassenoff, a Professor of English. “Our College 101 class carried [out] an original idea that will hopefully pave the way [for] other aspects of sustainability, as well as awareness about sustainability on LIU Post’s campus,” Sassenoff said.
Although “recycle, reuse, and refresh” is a familiar mantra, the awareness of sustainability needs to be spread among students. The Sustainability Committee, composed of students, faculty and staff, promotes sustainability on campus, and has been helping with the service learning projects.
Sassenoff, along with the peer mentor for her College 101 course, Stephanie Frobin, a junior Psychology major, asked the students in their class to find a few facts about how Post maintains sustainability.
“Most of the facts were about how Post [has] clean water and filtered water fountains,” Sassenoff said. This assignment made the students become more intrigued with the idea of promoting sustainability more efficiently.
“As they found out more information from myself and Professor Sassenoff, they [seemed] more ready to be[come] involved. They were very interested in the activities we would be doing,” Frobin said.
Sassenoff and Frobin contacted William Achnitz, Campus Life Coordinator, who is a member of the Sustainability Committee. Achnitz has been sought out several times by several College 101 instructors after the addition of service learning projects to the College 101 curriculum.
Sustainability is a common theme chosen for these projects, according to Achnitz. With the assistance of Achnitz, Sassenoff made maintaining sustainability on campus the service learning project for her College 101 class; this partnership became the basis for “Purify Your Mind.”
Achnitz assisted with the creation of design for promotional buttons distributed on campus. “Purify Your Mind” is meant to educate students as well as faculty and staff of how one can maintain sustainability. “Many people who see the buttons often stop and ask the meaning behind them. This campaign often inform[s] people of how many ways Post wants to remain environmentally friendly and continue to remain friendly for the future,” Sassenoff added.
“Purify Your Mind” is not only a slogan for sustainability, it is also a motto students can live by. The goal of “Purify Your Mind” is to “make yourself knowledgeable, take action for yourself and your well-being,” Sassenoff said.
Frobin added that it is a way to encourage people to rid themselves of actions that are harmful to the environment, and learn how to make the community better. “It spreads to using less paper, refilling water bottles, and help keeping our campus clean,” she said.
As part of the “Purify Your Mind” project, Sassenoff, Frobin, and the College 101 students planted a crepe myrtle tree outside Suffolk Hall on Nov. 25, 2014.
“Since we live in a digital age where most people go online in order to learn about issues involving our environment,” Sassenoff said, “our class decided to spread environmental awareness the old fashioned way: go outside and become one with nature.”
Planting a tree directly ties into the goal of the “Purify Your Mind” by creating “physical awareness for students to create physical awareness about the environment literally surrounding them,” Sassenoff said. “Purify Your Mind” buttons are still being distributed on campus. “The College 101 students responsible for coming up with this idea have been key figures by handing out buttons, directing other students to where they can learn more about sustainability, and raising awareness about being the first group of students to help create this campaign, as well as plant a tree on campus,” Sassenoff said.

On Feb. 13, LIU Post sent an email to students informing them about a confirmed measles case in N.Y. The email is a proactive measure, and was sent to reassure students that the university is prepared for a potential outbreak.
“Long Island University seeks to enforce strict compliance with New York State Public Health Laws 2165 and 2167, which requires proof of MMR vaccination, or proof of waiver/exemption from vaccination,” the email stated. The MMR vaccine is for measles, mumps and rubella, and students are required to show proof of these vaccines when enrolling.
“Submission of completed MMR/Meningitis Form is preferred prior to or at the time of registration,” according to the LIU Post webiste. “Registered students who are noncompliant with NYSPHLs #2165 and #2167 on the first day of classes will have an H02 and/or H09 block placed on their accounts. These blocks will prevent any additional enrollment activity until missing documents are received.” The website explains that if the University does not receive a complete immunization documentation within the 30 first days of classes, students with such blocks will be suspended from campus and not allowed back until cleared by the Medical Services Office.
“If a student is vaccinated and, more importantly, if the entire student body is vaccinated, it makes it very difficult for the virus to spread, because few people are susceptible,” said Dr. Brian Harper, Medical Director at the Academic Health Care Center at NYIT. “In N.Y., there is a New York State Health Department mandate for students to demonstrate immunity to measles prior to entering college. Although rare, it has occurred whereby a person was vaccinated and still contracted measles.”
“While Post is compliant with state vaccination regulations, as they relate to our students, the campus experiences any number of visitors each day, thereby making it impossible to state with certainty that our campus is not at risk for an incident of measles,” said Gale Stevens Haynes, Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, and Legal Counsel.
The student health center, now located at NYIT, has not treated any LIU Post students with measles this year. “We have not seen/treated any students with measles. In the U.S., measles is fairly rare, due in large part to any active national vaccination program. It is more common in Europe, Asia, and Africa. However, there was a record number of cases (644) seen in 2014 since 2000, and in 2015, there is a current outbreak in the U.S., mostly associated with an amusement park in California,” Harper said.
There are symptoms that students should be aware of, generally appearing between one and two weeks after the infection, according to Harper. It typically begins with a high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis).
“Two or three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots (called Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth,” Harper explained. “Three to five days after symptoms begin, a rash breaks out. It usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, arms, legs, and feet.
There are several ways in which measles can spread. The two main ways is through coughing and sneezing. “If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected,” Harper added.
“You are the only one who can prevent yourself from getting it; be smart,” said Nicole Andre, a junior Art Therapy major. “If you have had the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination, it is extremely unlikely you will contract the disease if exposed,” according to the University’s email to students.
“If a case of measles is confirmed, the protocol requires isolation and identification of those that the individual has been in recent contact with,” Haynes said. “A Post student who experiences a rash and a fever should first contact the nursing staff either at NYIT or at Post via telephone and share symptoms. The nurse will conduct a telephone triage and will be advised on the appropriate next step,” Harper explained. “The most important message is that we seek to avoid any potentially infectious patient sitting in a waiting room where they can potentially spread the disease. There is no cure for measles, so treatment is based on symptoms (e.g. antipyretics for fever, cough suppressants, etc.).”
If a student feels like they have been exposed, they can contact the Center for Healthy Living at 516-299-3468 for assistance. They may be referred to the Health Center at NYIT. “Thankfully, our doctor is down the road,” said Jackie Miller, a sophomore Radiology major. “LIU is prepared to manage confirmed cases,” said Haynes. Harper agreed. “The nursing staffs of both institutions consistently communicate with each other. Things are discussed in an advisory capacity; we have no medical or legal authority over the Post Student Health Center. The most important step is notification of the local department of health in the case of someone suspected of having measles,” Harper said.

The global Earth Hour event falls on Saturday, March 28, from 8:30 p.m. – 9:30 p.m. During Earth Hour, which is organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), participants are asked to switch of all lights for an hour. Since 2007, Earth Hour has been held on the last Saturday in March.
Earth Hour is a lights-off event that started in Sydney, Australia, and has attracted more and more members around the globe every year. Their goal is to raise awareness of our energy usages and to attain greater energy efficiency. In addition, they want to raise consciousness of climate changes in the long run.
On the WWF website, Earth Hour is described as a symbolic celebration to engage a mass audience to stand behind environmental issues in a positive, hopeful, and inspirational way.
In 2014, 162 countries and territories participated, according to the WWF website, with 60 of those countries participating for a longer period of time, beyond the hour. Over 7,000 cities and towns participated, therefore achieving the greatest participation since the event started in 2007.
In 2014, Earth Hour became the world’s largest mass participation event in history. Hundreds of millions of people turned the lights off, all from individuals, organizations, corporations and governments. According to CBS New York, the Las Vegas’ strip, San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building in New York City all switched off last year.
Earth Hour is set to start at 8:30 p.m local time around the globe. Because it is near the time that both hemispheres simultaneously have sunset, it creates a bigger visual impact.
In the U.K. in 2014, two million students across 4,600 schools learned about Earth Hour, according to WWF. In the U.S., 11 Colleges and Universities have signed up to join the movement at WWF website. Some of the schools include, Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Penn., Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, Cali., and Yale University in New Haven, Conn.
Therese Lydsdottir, a senior International Relations major, thinks the event is a good initiative. “It is a cozy experience, I let my lights stay off for longer than an hour,” she said.
Dr. Scott Carlin, professor of Geography and the Chair of the Sustainability Committee, said that Earth Hour is a great project.
“I hope some dorms takes this up as an event,” he said, explaining that the sustainability committee on campus is looking to broaden their green programs on campus for next year’s Earth Hour. “hopefully we will have more participants on campus.”
A few LIU Post students have shut their lights off before. “I participated last year, in the dorms. I used the time to meditate and pray in my room,” said Jeremiah Aviles, a junior Childhood Education major.
The event is not organized on campus, but students can participate in groups or individually. To learn more about this year’s Earth Hour on March 28, visit www.earthhour.org.

Rock climbing and zip lining are only a few of the adventures that the members of Delta-X participate in. If you are interested in thrill- seeking and daredevil trips, then look no further than Delta-X, a club located on campus.
Delta-X brings LIU Post students on trips to rock climb, ski, snowboard, camp, hike, and many other outdoor activities. This club challenges students mentally and physically, helping participants boost their confidence and enhance their community involvement. In the past, the club has gone paint balling, skiing, white water rafting, and zip lining. Richard Theodule, a junior Film major and president of Delta-X, said his favorite trip they went on was zip lining.
“The odds of falling off when zip lining are pretty much zero,” he said. “But when you’re up there looking down and you have to jump off the platform, it doesn’t feel like it!” This trip gave him the thrill he was seeking. Delta-X members get discounts when they attend the trips. Theodule described how zip lining is usually around $100, but the club’s budget makes it easier to pay for the the adventures, resulting in participants paying roughly half the normal price.
Junior Business Administration major and member of Delta-X Shekofeh Gholamreza agreed that zip lining as well as their white water rafting trips were her favorites. The white water rafting trip was done in groups of three to four students.
“We all learned how to communicate and cooperate in an efficient way in order to reach our destination,” Gholamreza said. As a result of this trip, and many others, participants became closer friends by working together in fun, engaging, and unique environments.
“People should join the Delta X club because it gives them the opportunity to go on exciting trips and make new friends with people they probably wouldn’t have met otherwise,” Theodule said. Delta-X
is planning on doing another paintball and ski trip. The club currently has 10 members who regularly attend meetings, but always welcomes new members. Delta-X meets in Humanities Hall Room 121 at 1 p.m. on Tuesdays.

Brooke Eversman, a sophomore Psychology major, and member of the LIU Post dance team, has just received the offer of a lifetime. Eversman has been asked to join the Universal Dance Association (UDA) as an instructor, an opportunity not many get to experience.
The UDA started off as one dance summer camp, but has grown to host several camps for high school and college dance teams. It has also been featured on ESPN and the members participate in fundraising events. The UDA dance camps also qualify dance teams for their national championship competitions during the year, which the LIU Post dance team recently attended.
“Dance affects my life in so many great ways. It isn’t just a hobby for me; it’s a life style,” Eversman said. “I schedule my life around dance because it is a major priority next to school. It is a way to relieve myself from stress and it’s a beautiful passion. I guess in simpler terms, dance is my outlet, and I wouldn’t be who I am today without it.”
Eversman said that it isn’t common for someone of her age to be chosen to work for the UDA. “They have an image they like to maintain with their dancers, however, UDA is always looking for young eager dancers to represent them in a positive way.” In order to be considered for a job by the UDA, individuals have to be over the age of 18, a high school graduate, and have extensive dance experience. LIU Post dance team coach Chris Pitsicalis elaborated, “It’s a pretty competitive job, to be honest. They have instructors from dance teams all around the country but only a few from each state.”
In order to receive an audition by the UDA, applicants must apply online. If given the opportunity to audition, applicants must be able to attend training, and must be willing to teach summer classes.
“I never expected to be chosen to audition, but after I did it was very clear why. The UDA is looking for dancers with a fun personality and a strong passion for dancing, which I have,” Eversman said.
“I pretty much knew she had it in the bag,” Pitsicalis said, “I knew she was going to make it.”
There were multiple parts to the audition process. Everyone auditioning first had to learn a “demo” routine, and perform it in groups of three to display their level of skill and ability to quickly retain dance routines. Following this, all participants had to teach prepared routines to other dancers to prove they would be suitable in a teaching position. To prove their level of skill, Eversman, and others auditioning, had to perform certain dance routines. Finally, each participant is interviewed on why they want to be part of the UDA staff. Eversman, who is currently 19, has been dancing for 17 years, and loves jazz and contemporary style dancing.
Eversman is very excited for the chance she has been given, and the opportunities the UDA offers. “UDA is like my first step into the real dance career world,” she said. Eversman elaborated that she chose to be a psychology major over a dance major so she would not have any restrictions on her dance career.
“Starting in late May, I will begin my traveling to Chicago for my week long training session and from then on I will be traveling all summer long performing, judging, and critiquing dance teams around the Northeast,” Eversman explained.
While she is currently set to work with the UDA this summer, it is more than just a normal summer job. If Eversman should decide to stay with the UDA, she could travel internationally with the UDA in years to come. “The UDA is an amazing opportunity to bring out the best in dancers, and to explore a nationwide dance community,” Eversman said.

President Obama was accused of not loving America. How about you? Do you love America?

Mayor Rudi Giuliani, according to Politico, during a dinner on Feb. 18, said, “I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.” Giuliani’s comment led to an intense debate, which has inspired the Pioneer to ask whether we all really love America?
I received a lot of unclear answers to the question. Most students just answered with “Eh…” while others had to actually think about the question. However Patricia Mygas, a junior Art Therapy major, was clear about how she felt. She recalled the first time she heard the statement that America is the greatest country in the world.
“I was in my sixth grade social studies class with my teacher Mr. Dixon, and I remember arguing with him in confusion,” Mygas said. “I had always thought of countries like people: different with unique backgrounds and histories, but all equal. So the idea that one country was greater than others didn’t really make sense at the time.”
Mygas still stands by this idea, but she doesn’t mean she feels hatred toward her country because of it. “Now that I’m older, I still love my country for the same reasons I did back then, not because it’s the ‘greatest’ or ‘most powerful,’ but because it’s mine,” Mygas said. “It’s the place I have lived my whole life and it’s my home. I love America regardless of how great it is or isn’t.”
A lot of people may not realize that it’s possible to be critical of something you love. To say that someone doesn’t love something just because they might criticize it is ridiculous. Criticism is not necessarily a negative thing; sometimes it is needed to make the thing you love stronger and guide it in the right direction. As Mygas said, “It is quite possible to love something and not be happy with everything it does.”
Not only do Americans feel love for their country, but people from other countries also see America as a place to seek out better opportunities.
“I decided to come to America because I wanted to pursue education and swimming, successfully,” said Seren Jones, a junior English major from Wales. “Back home, I would have had to sacrifice one for the other, and I knew I definitely wasn’t ready for that. So moving out here was my best option.”
Jones doesn’t regret her decision though; she states that she is very happy with her move to America.
“I’ve met some people who are going to stay in my life for many years to come,” Jones said. “I ‘ve also met a lot of different people — some good, some bad, and some ugly — but these experiences with them have made me a more open-minded person, which I’m thankful for.”
Jones couldn’t make up her mind about whether she loved America or her home better or equally. “I much prefer the British culture, but I prefer living in such a large city like New York, in such a large country like America. There is so much here in that aspect,” she said.
Loving America is something that we are taught to do from a young age. People from other countries may see it as the greatest country in the world and may move here with the hope of getting a better life.
Or America may not be the greatest country in the world. There is no such thing; every place has positives and negatives. Acknowledging that your country is not perfect sounds to me more like loving it and accepting its imperfections than pretending that everything is perfect and there is nothing wrong with it. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want a president who pretends everything is ok. I’d rather have one who sees the problems we have as a nation and does something to try and change this.

During common hour, students flock to Winnick and Hillwood Commons to eat lunch. Finding a seat, and deciding what to eat seem like more complex issues than knowing where to go. Subway, Hillwood Commons Café, and Winnick are the most popular places for students to eat on campus. However, just how popular are they? It seems as though students have their own go-to location on campus, but when it comes to picking out their food, that is another problem.
Anthony Chung, a junior English major, commutes to campus and therefore only eats lunch here.
“I usually end up eating at Subway because I don’t want to go off campus just to get lunch,” Chung said. “Some days I don’t eat, because I get tired of eating the
same thing every day. So I’d rather wait and eat when I get home instead,” Chung said.
Russell Weinstein, a sophomore English major, is a second-year dormer. During his first semester, he ate his meals at Winnick, but now in his second year, he is fed up with their “toxic” food. He explained how students have gotten sick from eating there. This year, he refuses to enter the building and only eats at Hillwood Commons. He is dissatisfied with Aramark, the provider of food on campus. “Get rid of Aramark,” he said.
Other students choose to go off campus to eat lunch. Some popular places near campus are Moe’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King, just down Northern Boulevard.
Rachel Haas, a commuter and junior Design major said she usually brings her own food to school. “The food on campus is expensive and doesn’t taste good. I bring my own food because there are not that many healthy options provided at Winnick or Hillwood Commons.”
Haas said that she doesn’t miss eating every meal at Winnick, as she did last year when she dormed. “I didn’t like their opening hours, because they didn’t work with my schedule, as I had night classes that ended at 11 p.m. By the time I was done with class, Winnick was closed,” she said. “Now that I commute, I can eat a good, nutritious meal at home for dinner, and bring lunch I prepared at home or eat a power bar.”
Keely Burns, a sophomore Art Therapy major, commutes to campus. “I’d go off campus to eat if I knew that I could find a parking spot when I get back,” she said. “I don’t like going back and forth once I’m on campus. I usually eat the crispy tenders at Hillwood Commons.
In fact, it is the only thing I like to eat of the options provided.” Salvatore Ciulla, a sophomore Arts Management major, commutes to campus as well. He eats his lunch at Hillwood Commons. “It’s the same thing every day, the menu is monotonous and never changes,” he said.
The Director of Operations at LIU Post Campus Dining Services, Paul Carroll, is aware of the students’ feedback in which they would like to have more options to choose from.
“Our menus are created by our team of professional and certified chefs and are created based on feedback we receive from students,” Carroll said, explaining that they survey students each semester and use their feedback across their operations. Dining Hall menus are then designed to provide a diverse assortment of food options.
“Over the past few years, we have introduced more new entrees and side dishes, featuring international flavors and more seafood, vegan and vegetarian entrees,” Carroll added.
He urged for students to be patient, explaining that new additions are coming to campus.
“We are also adding some exciting new food venues such as the Pioneer Food Truck that will be driving around campus and for the first time servicing the south campus at Lorber Hall,” Carroll said. “Next year we will be introducing Bleeker Street Café in the Library and a Twisted Taco concept to Hillwood Commons.” When it comes to the handling of food, Carroll said, “The Nassau County Department of Health inspected campus last April and does so annually at approximately the same time each year.” However, students remain unaware of what the outcome of the results from health inspection was, that was performed almost a year ago.
Students seem to crave more options, and to be provided with them a bit sooner, as well as hoping that the new additions would be healthier. Students don’t want to be forced off campus to be able to enjoy a meal. If Post is a great place for students to study, why can’t the food be equally as good? After all, providing students with nutritious meals is the primary factor related to students’ health and is crucial for learning.
If you have any comments on the food at Post, send us an email at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

The annual Spring Fling is quickly approaching, and has become the topic of excitement and anticipation in its timely arrival. The Spring Fling is a concert that is held every year in the Tilles Center, located on campus. At this concert, popular and well-known artists come to perform for the Pioneer community.
Every year, anticipation builds up around this time, surrounding the reveal of what Spring Fling artist will be performing that year, and who was voted for the most. The Association for Campus Programming (ACP) raises the bar every Spring Fling. Success from previous years ensures the student body that Spring Fling is sure to be a success, and a night to remember.
Recently, there was a survey sent out to the student body as to whom their preference would be to come and perform. Artists such as The Weeknd, 2 Chainz, and Nelly were on the survey. There’s a high demand for R&B and rap artists.
“I would like a rap artist such as Migos to perform at this year’s Spring Fling,” said Adam Gedeon, a freshman Radiology Technology major. Gedeon is one of many students who would prefer a rap artist to perform. In the past, artists like Trey Songz, Jhene Aiko, Miguel, Big Sean, and Jeremih have performed. However, Spring Fling wants to provide a wider diversity of music due to the pattern of solely having rap and R&B in prior years.
Nelly is a musical choice that many students would appreciate because of his number of throwback songs that students remember listening to in grade school. If Nelly were to come and perform, some songs that students might recognize are “Just a Dream,” “Dilemma,” “Ride with Me,” and “Na-Nana-Na,” just to name a few.
In light of the music and energy Spring Fling brings to LIU Post, this event does not only provide an electric, fun atmosphere, but also a sense of spirit for
our school. Music has the power to bring everyone together, in spite of differences in music taste. It is a night of pride for our Post Pioneers as we celebrate the opportunities this university gives its students, such as experiencing a night to converse, jam, and have fun every year. Performing this year will be Ke$ha: the pop, rock, and electronic sensation! Come out, have an unforgettable night with your friends, and save the date for Wednesday, April 29.

In recent times, gun control has been a recurring theme and lasting debate that have many people divided in view and perspective. Aside from recent international and domestic affairs, the talk of guns has taken on a new plan of action: one that could affect how students protect themselves on college campuses.
“Arming female students will help reduce sexual assaults,” according to Alan Schwarz’s article in the New York Times from Feb. 18, “A Bid for Guns on Campuses to Deter Rape.”
On the opposing side, the article said, “University campuses should remain havens from the gun-related risks that exist elsewhere, and that college students, with high rates of binge drinking and other recklessness, would be particularly prone to gun accidents.”
With the idea of guns possibly serving as a protective tool for students on campus, what do Post students think of it?
“I don’t think guns on campus will help in the effort,” said junior Broadcasting major Kaitlyn Veygel, who is not attracted to the idea of allowing firearms on campus. “If security are the ones who are in control of the weapons, it’s not going to help the girl or boy in the moment that they’re being assaulted,” Veygel said.
Sophomore Accounting major Mike Nicosia agrees with Veygel’s notion. “I don’t think guns solve the rape and assault issue,” Nicosia said. “It’s one thing to own a gun and flash it off, and another to own one and not be afraid to pull the trigger without thinking about the consequences.”
As the government is hoping for public approval in this debate, they’re not wasting any time making moves towards that direction. “This year, lawmakers in 10 states who are pushing bills that would permit the carrying of firearms on campus are hoping that the national spotlight on sexual assault will help them win passage of their measures,” according to Schwartz.
“Guns are taking a huge leap forward when there are already services in place to help, and could lead to more unintended violence,” said Charlie Moerler, a junior Broadcasting major.
Veygel believes there are other tools of protection that would be less harmful for the campus environment.
“Instead of guns, I would recommend pepper spray or even taser guns,” she said. “They’re less lethal, and, in my opinion, more effective.”
Nicosia believes that guns on campus could only work only if these were in the hands of trained security guards, but even that would not make the environment safe.
Moerler also believes in other ways to keep students safe, preaching for more circulation of public safety guards, and occasional local police patrols at night. He also suggests more lights and emergency call buttons be set up on campus.

Since the dawn of institutionalized education, students have been thinking of new excuses for not showing up to class. Whether it’s an ‘imaginary’ death, dog ate the homework, car won’t start, or someone’s make believe sibling needs to be picked up from school, students will always be searching for that excuse that will tug at their professors heartstrings, and ultimately earn them an excused absence. Well hey, at least it’s not a generational problem, but professors have noted that excuses have become more unique than ever before.
“I believe it was last semester, which one of my students told me their cat was run over by a lawn mower,” said Cristina Bowser, a former English professor at LIU Post who retired last semester. “The cat was fine, of course, but the student “had to be there” for his cat.”
This is an awesome, ‘lights out’ excuse. How could a professor, unless he or she is half robot, not sympathize with their poor student and his cat and simply not excuse this young man’s absence? Did she excuse his absence? Yes, she did. She awarded him the benefit of the doubt. However, she was not going to believe another cat story from this particular student ever again.
In a conversation with sophomore chemistry major, Ismael Nehhas, he disclosed to me his wildest excuse. “I couldn’t show up for lab, I did none of my homework and I had to think of something quick. So I told my professor that I had to take my dog to the hospital because she was in labor with five puppies and that if we didn’t get Cornflake (his dog) to the vet within that hour she would die.” Did it work? Of course! Nehhas’ professor even texted him later that evening to check in on Cornflake, who was resting comfortably in his bed — yes, his bed. Cornflake was not even a female.
What about professors? Well, they give excuses too, just more ‘mature’ excuses. In an interview with Professor Sandy Held, a broadcasting and media arts professor, she disclosed the most memorable excuses she had heard from a fellow colleague.
“The student explained that her brother was in the Olympics and the family was going to support him. The story was true, but the professor was unmoved by the once-in-a-lifetime scenario and told the student the absences would affect her grade.”
Now, this is just unfortunate. Imagine someone in your family was partaking in the Olympics. What are the odds of that? Yet again, what are the odds of your professor not accepting that excuse? That’s the textbook definition of a let-down. Held, reminisced on a more comical excuse.
“I do recall a student claiming to be sick, then returning to class with sunburn. I wonder where she was.” Held said, jokingly, before getting back on a more serious note. “I do believe there are things in life more important than class. I did miss class last spring due to an emergency appendectomy. Sometimes students and teachers need a mental health day.”
Ah, don’t we all professor, don’t we all!
With this said, if you simply don’t feel like coming to class, just be honest; nobody likes a liar. However, if you’re going to ‘fib’ on why you won’t be attending your 8 a.m. class, at least be original. Although your professors sometimes assign you massive amounts of homework to do over break with seemingly no remorse, they just might show a little emotion, and excuse you of your “absence.”

Do you ever feel the urge to glance down at your phone to read messages while your professor is teaching? Do you tend to gaze at the wall waiting for a boring lecture to end? Does the manner in which a professor handles his class determine the success level of a student? What types of classes have the greatest impact on students?
LIU Post students have differing views on the type of class environments they feel most comfortable in. Many students have taken classes on both sides of the spectrum: some purely interactive, others in a more traditional lecture format.
Robert Riepe, a freshman Broadcasting major, likes both teaching styles. “Math classes are visual, but the way you go through a problem can be interesting. Other classes like video production, where professors will take the camera and assist you, are more physically interactive,” Riepe said. “Media arts classes are more conversational, but you don’t use actual technology. So it’s interactive in a different way, which can be boring because only a few people might actually talk,” he added.
“I feel like some people don’t talk in class because we were taught in grammar school to be quiet during class,” Riepe said. Yet, he feels that it’s okay to speak up in class because he enjoys hearing what others have to say.
Other students feel that they get more out of lecture classes, and that interactive classes can typically be very distracting. “I’ve taken more interactive classes, but I prefer lectures. It’s more relaxing and easier for me to absorb the information,” said Alec Matuszak, a sophomore Journalism major.
Chris Jerman, a sophomore Business Administration major, also gives the edge to lecture classes. “I’m not a big fan of participating in class, so I’ll tend to take many more lecture classes,” he said.
Lecture classes don’t always get people involved, but they can allow students to focus on the message of the lecture and potentially learn more in that kind of setting. Think of it as studying for a test: when you study with your friends, you will be more interactive and help one another, but there can also be other distractions compared to studying alone.
In the end, it’s not what the class gives to you, but it’s what you take from it. The goal of college is for students to use their minds. Benjamin Gerdes, Assistant Professor of Media Arts, said that making classes fun and helping students improve their skills is his favorite part about teaching.
“In interactive classes, my teaching philosophy is students discovering through questions, projects, working, and it’s ultimately more satisfying. I teach mostly production classes, which tend to be more interactive,” Gerdes said. “I feel that when teaching lecture classes, you’re competing to hold students’ attention because they’ll start playing with their laptops and cell phones. In interactive classes, students can absorb more, but they need to put work into it,” he continued.
Regardless of what classes people take, the goal is to take something from it, and use it in everyday life. Everybody has a different taste and style of learning, so it’s important that students choose the right path and take classes that are beneficial to their academic success. Students can meet with their advisers to register for the right classes to meet their needs and learning styles.

Masculinity, feminism, and identity are all issues faced by all people, both young and old, in society. “Daddy’s Boy,” written and directed by graduate student, Cristian Avila, emphasizes these issues.
“It’s about a boy named Milo; [he’s] a 17-year-old wrestler, but he’s also gay. It’s not necessarily two things that go together,” Avila said. “Daddy’s Boy” is a part of Avila’s graduate thesis, and it will run from March 20-22 at the Rifle Range Theater on LIU Post’s campus.
“Daddy’s Boy” is Avila’s first major production as a playwright. The UC Berkeley undergraduate is combining both ancient Greek methodology as well as modern ploys, such as Twitter, to tell a story of mental and psychological battle, as well as a physical battle.
Milo, a wrestler son of two gay men, faces challenges throughout the piece. While writing it, Avila was inspired by viral videos, and how comments came through Twitter and other social media outlets, both good and bad. Mostly bad, he said. “A theme that I’ve traced back from ancient Greek plays is a man’s responsibility to provide,” Avila said. “It’s a lot about gender constructs.”
“In the play, we have a Greek chorus (a gathering of performers) reading from their phones, as if [they were reading] tweets against Milo after he wore a pink singlet to a televised wrestl[ing] match,” Avila said. “It’s a very heavy story.” Avila started writing the play last summer and started rehearsing only a few weeks ago. The cast of ten actors consists of undergraduate and graduate students from LIU Post’s Theatre Company.
The play itself, he says, is constantly commenting on society.
“[Daddy’s Boy] comments on the U.S.’ struggle with the conformity of gender performance as a male, and what it means to break the mold of gender performance as a male,” said Paige Borden, a first year graduate student, assistant director, and chorus member. “It’s always a way a man should act. He should watch football, etc. In the play, Milo is struggling to come out with his own identity,” Avila said. “He’s been sheltered a lot in his life, but now, he faces comments and criticism as his family’s history repeats itself.”
Avila is aiming to pitch the play to festivals around the country, and says he’s gotten promising feedback from the Sundance Festival, with a play that he calls contemporary and recent. It touches upon issues that are very much in the spotlight today, he said.
“Daddy’s Boy” will be performed on March 20 – 21 at 7:30 p.m., and March 22 at 3 p.m. Prices for “Daddy’s Boy” are $10 for adults, $5 for students and seniors. For more information, visit www.liu.edu/post/ ptc or call 516-299-2353.

What do you think of when you hear the term heavy metal? Do you think of thrash coming out of the Bay Area in the ‘80s, the New York hardcore scene, or maybe grunge from Seattle? Certainly not Black Metal from Jerusalem. Melechesh has been pumping out dark, characteristic music inspired by their home culture since the early ‘90s. Their latest release, Enki, marks their sixth studio album.
Where the world of metal can sound static, Enki is a breath of fresh air. Taking the name of an ancient Sumerian god, the album is full of contrasts, ranging from full blast beats to the poetic, fragile sound of a sitar. Melechesh does not set their music in traditional major/minor scales, pentatonic, or even the more colorful scales found in jazz music. Their basis is the double harmonic scales, to you music majors, and Arabian scale, to everyone else, found in folk music from their home region. It’s a unique sound, not found in many other metal bands.
The contrasts are obvious. A groovy single track, “Lost Tribes,” incorporates the western groove metal, giving California power ensembles such as Machine Head and Slayer a run for their money. A legend is also appearing on the track. Metal icon Max Cavalera, not unfamiliar with incorporating his home culture into metal, makes an appearance with his distinctive voice and groovy riffs. Cavalera came into fame with his Brazil groove metal in the ‘80s and ‘90s. “Lost Tribes” is one end of the spectrum – a six-minute thrash song. On the other end, there is the eight-minute melodic instrumental, “Doorways to Irkala.”
The track itself could very well be found in a movie or TV show – It’s atmospheric, trance inducing, and downright beautiful. That’s what makes this album great. The sounds found on “Doorways to Irkala” are making their mark all over the album. It’s exotic, but not out there. It’s unique, but not weird. It’s heavy, it’s thrashy, it’s full of dialogues between instruments, and it’s bringing a new culture and sound into the metal world, with a well-engineered album.
From now on, you can think of black metal from Jerusalem alongside hardcore from the streets of NYC or true Norwegian black metal. “Enki” puts Melechesh on the map. The album was released on Feb. 27.

Dr. Catherine R. Larkin, an associate professor, is the head of the Digital Arts and Image Library that is tucked away in the basement of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library on campus. The library is a resource for students and faculty members to find rare and valuable information that may be unavailable elsewhere.
Larkin, who has worked at LIU Post for 22 years, oversees the extensive collection of more than 100,000 images of art media, ranging from prehistoric times to the present day. The collection is valued as a place for art research, open to all students who are fulfilling course requirements.
“We explore, develop, and implement projects that convert [LIU Posts’] signature collections and academic resources into digital collections with permanent research value,” Larkin said. “Our most recent project was a partnership with Frick Art Reference Library called Gilding the Gilded Age: Interior Decoration Tastes and Trends in New York City.” Materials from New York City’s Frick Art Reference Library and Archive, as well as The William Randolph Hearst Archive at LIU Post, comprise this new collection. For more information on this particular project, regarding collection and exhibitions, visit gildedage3. omeka.net.
Hearst is known for his publishing dynasty, but Larkin noted his obsessive art collecting. “Inquiries come to us from all over Europe and the U.S. from scholars investigating works of art he once owned,” she said. “This has generated numerous academic publications that give recognition to the archive and LIU Post.”
Archival materials at the Art Image Library consist of: digitized versions of sales record; photographs; artworks, including a PreColumbian collection in collaboration with the Hillwood Art Museum and paper-based materials like Civil War newspapers; maps; atlases; illustrated song sheets; and more from the Cedar Swamp Historical society.
“We are also a service department,” Larkin added. “We offer research assistance to individual art faculty members and their students, as well as art information literacy classes for groups.”
The Art Image Library assists with presentation technology, and has developed a library guide to help find prints and electronic resources. The guide is found at liu.cwp.libguides.com/visualarts. The Arts Image Library is a hidden resource for researching museum work and art collection, particularly from a historical perspective. According to Larkin, students are always welcome to use the facilities for research on thesis paper topics; and, the service is free.
“Librarians love to share their knowledge and help students,” she said. “Moreover, the space is open and comfortable and conducive to learning. In the library, you can get the academic support you need, do independent research, study, socialize, and grab a quick bite to eat at our Bookmark Café.”
The Digital Initiatives and Arts Image Library, room 109, is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, contact post-digislide@liu.edu or call 516-299-2928.

Coming off two convincing victories against Dominican College, the No. 11 ranked LIU Post softball team fell to Caldwell College by a score of 10-5 and was defeated by Saint Leo 14-1 on Saturday, March 14, in their final games in Sunshine State, Fla.
In their first game against Caldwell, the Pioneer offense got going early and was able to score runs in the first inning. After an RBI fielder’s choice, senior catcher Aly Dzierzynski doubled to score sophomore outfielder Mackenzie Buckley. Later in the inning, sophomore first baseman Kayla McCoy ripped a single through the left side to plate another run for the Green and Gold. The lead increased to 5-0 by the end of the inning thanks to junior catcher Paige Swantek and sophomore infielder Melissa Peet.
The Cougars from Caldwell held tough though. They did not allow another run and they got on the board in the bottom of the fourth inning. A two-RBI single and a two-RBI double quickly put the Cougars within one. Two more singles ended the latter half of the inning and the Cougars held a 7-5 advantage. A home run by freshman third baseman Marisa Monasseri helped secure the 10-5 victory.
In the second game, the Lions from Saint Leo grabbed the early lead in the first inning and increased it in the second inning, 2-0. The Pioneers cut it in half when senior outfielder Catherine Havens doubled in a run in the top of the third. After the Pioneers cut the deficit to one run, the Lions exploded in the bottom of the fourth inning for 12 runs. Their double-digit run output put all hopes of a Pioneer comeback to sleep.
While at the St. Leo Invite in Florida, the Pioneers went 3-5 overall. Due to unpredictable weather, LIU Post’s home opener against Le Moyne College has been cancelled. The Pioneers return to action tomorrow, March 20, facing Southern Connecticut State in New Haven, Conn. First pitch is slated for 1:30 p.m.

After dropping his first match at the 2015 NCAA Division II Wrestling Championship, freshman Joe Calderone fought his way to two wins to advance to the second day of the tournament.
The other Pioneer qualifier was senior Chris DiIorio who came in as a regional champion in the 197-lb class. DiIorio, like Calderone was sent to wrestle-backs after a loss in his first matchup.
In Calderone’s next two sessions, he defeated Jordan Gurrola of San Francisco State 4-2 and seized the opportunity and was able to oust Aldon Isenburg after trailing 6-4. In DiIorio’s next match, he fell in a hard-fought bout that ended his season.
On the second day, Calderone was one of eight wrestlers still competing at the 133-lb class. Calderone drew red-shirt freshman Nick Crume and won a 5-3 decision and guaranteed a spot in the consolation semifinals, and at worst a sixth-place finish. In his next match, Calderone faced Dakota Bauer of Maryville who proved to be too much to handle. Bauer won the bout 9-2 while Calderone came home with the sixth-place finish.
Calderone finished the year with an overall record of 29-11. He had the most victories of any member on the Pioneers and was never pinned during the five-month season. Calderone’s performance earned him the Pioneers’ first All-American distinction in the program’s first season back in almost three decades.

Q: How long have you been playing lacrosse?
A: I’ve been playing lacrosse since second grade.
Q: What first got you into the sport?
A: I started playing through one of my neighbors who played men’s lacrosse. Also, one of my friend’s dad started a Redskins lacrosse team where I started playing with some older girls.
Q: What are some areas of strength for the team and things that need improvement?
A: One area of strength is that we have a lot of attackers that can do different things. We also have a really strong defense. I think working together and being focused have kept us all on the same page, but I think we just need to work on our ride and being together throughout the season.
Q: What goes through your mind while on the field?
A: Just playing my game. I try not to let anything get in my way and I concentrate on what needs to be done. If something happens, I focus on the next play.
Q: How was playing with teammates who had a lot of championship experience beneficial to your game?
A: Playing behind them was awesome, but seeing how they played and looking up to them has made me and the other girls the players we are today and I’m hoping we could do the same for our underclassmen.

A: They’ve prepared us well and all three of our coaches are taking the little steps and working with us on what we need to improve on from each game.
Q: What brought you here to Post?
A: Definitely the lacrosse program. I knew their lacrosse program was amazing and capable of winning championships and that’s the type of person I am. It’s also close to home and everything about the school is great.
Q: What’s the key to getting back to the NCAA Tournament and making another run at a championship?
A: If we just stay focused, take it game by game, and not let it get too far over our heads, I think it will all fall into place.
Q: Who do you most admire?
A: My parents because they always have my back through everything. They’ve always been there for me though the ups and downs by bringing me back up through tough times.

On Saturday, March 14, the men’s lacrosse team improved to 5-1 on the young season after coming out on top in a back-and-forth battle against Molloy College. The Pioneers won by a score of 12-8 from Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
The duo of senior attackman Chris Caiazza and junior midfielder Anthony Berardis gave the Pioneers a 3-0 edge late in the opening quarter. Berardis and Caiazza each had one goal and one assist as they accounted for two of the three man-up goals for LIU Post on the afternoon.
In the second quarter, the Pioneers recorded four consecutive goals to extend their lead to 7-1 over the Lions. Junior attackmen Matt Bellando and Matty Beccaris, along with Caiazza and Berardis, all found the back of the net during the stretch.
However, the Lions reduced the deficit to 7-3 at the intermission, as sophomore attacker Connor Slane and senior attacker Joe Leonard both scored in the closing seconds of the period.
After heading into the fourth quarter with a 9-4 advantage, the Pioneers allowed back-to-back, unassisted goals by Leonard to make it a 9-6 contest with 13:25 to go in the final session. As Molloy put on the rally caps, the Pioneers absorbed the run and put it in the books as Beccaris and Caiazza each responded in a 17-second span to seal the deal.
The Green and Gold dominated in shots (39-25), and scooped up 31 ground balls compared to Molloy’s 25. In addition, the hosts were 14- of-20 on clears and converted on 3-of-7 extra-man opportunities. Junior goalkeeper Adam Winne made five saves in the cage for the Pioneers, while his counterpart, Ryan Toomey totaled 11 stops for the visitors.
Head Coach John Jez and his Pioneer squad will close out their three-game home stand on Saturday, March 21, when they will face off against Chestnut Hill College. The opening draw is set for 11 a.m.
On the same day, the women’s lacrosse team concluded its visit to the Sunshine State with an 11-9 loss to sixth-ranked University of New Haven in Melbourne, Fla.
LIU Post controlled the tempo for the entire opening half, jumping out to a 3-0 lead, while keeping the Chargers scoreless for almost 25 minutes. Junior midfielder/defender Honey Roche was quick to enter the stat-sheet scoring just 22 seconds in. She also dished out assists to sophomore attacker Stefani Vagelatos for the other two first half goals. Freshman goalkeeper Ollivia Kirk denied six of the eight shots she faced in the first 30 minutes. The Pioneers held a 5-2 edge at the half.
New Haven, however, fought the uphill battle and took over in the second half. After trailing 6-3 early on in the latter stanza, the visitors tallied four unanswered goals in under four minutes to take a 7-6 lead with 20 minutes remaining in the contest.
Pioneer sophomore defender/midfielder Cara Douglas evened up the ongoing chess match at 7-all, on a free-position score for her second tally of the game. With just ten minutes remaining in regulation, junior attacker Maya Syzmanski racked up three unassisted goals for the Chargers, good enough to secure the victory.
Vagelatos totaled three goals in the loss for the Green and Gold while Douglas and sophomore midfielder Connor Bird added two goals apiece. Roche had a solid outing with one goal, two helpers, and two ground balls. Red-shirt sophomore attacker Emily Delaney also pitched in with two assists.
The Pioneers are back in action Thursday, March 19, as they return home to host Philadelphia University, which marks the start of a three-game home stand at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. The opening face-off is set for 3 p.m.

Nine All-American honors and a total of 184 points — the Pioneer outcome after four days of racing at the 2015 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships. The seven members of the LIU Post swimming team marked the highest school finish ever, placing seventh at the IUPUI Natatorium in Indianapolis, Ind.
“It was the most intense and surprising competition I’ve ever had, [I] really did not expect to finish my collegiate career on such a great note,” said Carolin Rademacher, the senior breaststroke specialist, who splashed through with five All-American honors.
Rademacher brought home a silver medal for her 400-yard breaststroke race, and the 200-yard version ended with a personal best at 2:13.61, over a second faster than in her qualifying time, which lead her to the bronze.
Two-time national champion Joyce Kwok did not suffice all the way for the third consecutive year, but snatched the silver with a personal best of 53.59 in the 100-yard butterfly. Later on in the double distance, Kwok secured a third place finish, as well.
Rademacher and Kwok teamed up with junior Meghan Brazier and senior Johanna Pettersson in the 400-yard relay competition. The squad raced to a 3:41.79 showing, earning All-American distinctions and fourth place on the run.
The relay teams went strong all throughout the four days. Among others, the 200-yard freestyle event saw freshman Laura Bendfeldt, senior Courtney Delehanty, Brazier, and Pettersson earning a top-10 finish with a time of 1:34.19. The double distance with relay squad Bendfeldt, Rademacher, Kwok, and Brazier polished its qualifying time and finally managed an All-American sixth place finish at 3:24.90.
But for the LIU Post team, the accolades
do not finish in the pool. As it turns out, the determination and mentality have led the Pioneers to the best team in the Nation behind the school bench, nonetheless. The Pioneers earned the highest GPA (3.71) in the country, according to the College Swimming Coaches Association of America, who named the team Scholar All-American for fall 2014.
For all senior team members, it is now time to move onto the next chapter in their lives. Some will have to cut back on the sport that has shaped their years up until this point to give room for new activities. But even though the paths are endless, Rademacher hopes to follow the water.
“Swimming is too time consuming to continue at the level that I have competed in,” Rademacher said. “But I know that I won’t be able to stay away entirely.”
