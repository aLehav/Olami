In his third year as the Head Coach of the men’s basketball team, Erik Smiles has led his team to a 13-5 record. The Pioneers currently sit tied atop the East Coast Conference with St. Thomas Aquinas College. Smiles is very familiar with the ECC as he spent his collegiate career playing basketball at the University of Bridgeport. Prior to becoming the Head Coach at LIU Post, Smiles was the guy in charge at Farmingdale State College from 2004-2013.
Q: When did you first develop an interest in coaching basketball?
A: I probably knew I wanted to be a coach back in high school. Back then I kind of realized that I wasn’t going to be a professional basketball player.
Q: What went through your mind when you were named the Head Coach here at LIU Post?
A: Oh, it was very exciting because this was a program I grew up watching. I grew up in Huntington down the street and my dad used to take me to the games back in the old gymnasium when Coach Galeazzi was coaching back in the ‘80s and early ‘90s when I was little kid. This place has always had a special place in my heart because of that and this was in some ways my hometown team, so I was really thrilled to become the head coach. It was a job I always wanted and in a lot of ways a dream come true.
Q: Now in your third season as Head Coach, is there anything different we should expect to see from the team this year?
A: We’re a lot bigger. We got three tall forwards in Barrington Alston, Michael Phillip, and Hunter Powell that we recruited. Plus, we got two 6-foot-6 guys back in Nick Kahn and Greg Dotson, so we’ll be a little bit bigger. In year three, you’ll see a lot of guys who have that experience factor, in terms of moving the ball, understanding the concepts better and understanding our stuff, so I think we have a chance to have a really good year.
Q: Can you describe the chemistry between you and your players both on and off the court?
A: We have guys like Jared Hall, Aary Bibens, and Dillon Burns, who have all been together for two to three years now, so it’s definitely a group that knows me, knows my staff, and knows what we’re doing on the court X and O wise. They’ve been living together in the dorms for two to three years now, so those seven to eight guys we have returning who know each other, know the system, know the school, have very strong bonds with one another. Also, the four new guys have kind of molded right in with everyone else.
Q: You’ve been working with some of these players for the past two years or so and have two returning starters from last year in Burns and Dotson. What have you seen in their growth and development?
A: Yeah, Burns and Dotson both started a lot games for us the past two years, but we have a lot of other guys who have started for us this year who have been in the program for a long time. Hall and Bibens are both seeing a lot of action, so yes we have those two starters back, but we have four or five other guys who have been in the mix and have seen a lot of significant minutes. Chris Orozco is another guy who started around eight to ten games last year and is back, so I think we definitely have a solid core back that we’re building off of.
Q: We’ve seen some coaches get into trouble recently due to unethical behavior. What are your thoughts on this issue?
A: Unfortunately it’s a part of business. I wish it wasn’t, but coaches for whatever reason take things a little too tight to the vest when they’re hungry and want to win and maybe do some things they shouldn’t do. I don’t think things like that serve the purpose of being a good role model, but unfortunately it happens.
Q: Have you ever experienced these issues as a student or as a coach?
A: I mean I’ve kind of been sheltered. The coaches I’ve played for never got involved in anything. I played Division II and coached Divisions II and III, so some of the stuff you see happening at big time schools like in the SEC, the Big East, or the Big 12 doesn’t really filter down to this level. Those kinds of things don’t really happen at the levels I’ve played and coached.
Q: Do you think how an athlete performs in the classroom translates over to how they perform on the court?
A: Oh yeah, I definitely think there’s a correlation with kids who have good grades and kids who are high IQ players. It’s not true 100% of the time, but I definitely think there’s a correlation between the kind of kid you recruit and how he is as a student and as a person in terms of how that translates in their performance on the court, so I believe there’s a strong connection there. Thankfully, we’ve had some pretty bright students and good guys who have gotten the job done in the classroom, so knock on wood.
Q: What would you consider to be the keys to excellence for these young men?
A: One of the biggest things for us is time management. We got practice, weights, conditioning, and film. Our guys have class, their families, social lives, and study hall, so I think learning how to be disciplined and dedicated to managing your time and sticking to your schedule, whether it’s going to class from 9-12, then going to the library and studying, eating dinner, having practice and then spending another hour studying after practice. I think time management is really one of the most important things our guys learn. We try to instill into them how to be dedicated and disciplined and how to keep your day organized because that’s how the real world is. A lot of different things go on at once; multi-tasking is what it is, so having that skill is critical for us to instill into our guys.
Q: What is one interesting thing people may not know about you?
A: I’m a huge history buff. I recently went to college to become a history teacher and I’m pretty big into geography. When my wife and I go on vacation, it’s more to go see monuments and history trails.

Junior guard Jared Hall may have had a career-night scoring 27 points, but it wasn’t enough as the LIU Post Men’s Basketball team (13-5) fell short last Wednesday against the University of the District of Colombia (8-9), 84-73, at the UDC Sports Complex in Washington, D.C.
This East Coast Conference battle had the Pioneers on their heels as they found themselves playing from behind the majority of the night. After trailing 21-16 in the first half, the Pioneers went on a 12-5 streak in less than three minutes to grab a 28-26 edge over the Firebirds. Senior guard Dillon Burns ended the run with a go-ahead lay-up at the 5:26 mark of the opening half.
Although the Pioneers shot the ball well during that stretch, the hosts reclaimed a 40-37 lead heading into the locker room. Hall led all scorers with 11 points.
In the latter stanza, the Green and Gold went on a 7-0 burst to tie the game up at 46, but the Firebirds took complete control from that point on as the hosts improved to 6-3 in ECC play.
In addition to Hall’s performance, junior forward Greg Dotson collected 14 points, four rebounds, four steals, and three assists in the defeat. Burns chipped in with nine points, three boards, and dished out two helpers. The Firebirds were led by junior guard Martin Campbell who logged 22 points and six rebounds. Fellow junior guard Kasim Chandler totaled 21 points and eight dimes, with 16 of those points coming in the second half.
After falling to 8-2 in ECC action, Head Coach Erick Smiles and his LIU squad will take the floor tonight when they square off against the University of Bridgeport in Bridgeport, Conn. The Pioneers won the first meeting back on Dec. 9, 62-54.
LIU senior guard Akosa Maduegbunam shared his thoughts on tonight’s matchup: “The key to slowing down Bridgeport is sticking to our defensive principles that Coach Smiles has instilled in this program. Our goal is to play solid half-court, man-to-man defense, which forces our opponents to take low percentage shots.”
In their previous matchup, the Pioneers struggled from the eld. “It’s a long season and shooting is a scal thing that comes and goes. As a team, we try to play off our bigs and share the basketball. Our defense is our offense, so we try to get out and run after forcing shots on the defensive end,” Maduegbunam continued. LIU has used their size to their advantage all season long by playing inside out and off their bigs like junior forward Barrington Alston and senior forward Michael Phillip. “Those guys can both score and pass out of the post, so if we play off of them we’ll be able to dictate the tone of the game,” he concluded.
Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

During the 2014-2015 school year, LIU Post reinstated wrestling, a sport that had a long history at the university. Before last year, the last wrestling match at LIU was in 1988. The comeback has sparked great feedback from alumni and former wrestlers alike.
Warren Hannas was a wrestler for the then C.W. Post Pioneers when their wrestling program was in its hay-day in the 1960s. Hannas, now 70 years young, felt proud to see the program revived in Brookville, “Long Island wrestlers have dominated New York state high school programs for many decades!”
Hannas, who wrestled for Post as a senior, previously wrestled at Franklin and Marshall for a couple of seasons before transferring to Post. At that time, his coach was Jim Davey. Davey was the man responsible for catapulting Hannas’ wrestling career. “He encouraged me to join the team in my senior year having demonstrated my abilities in the wrestling room in my junior year.”
The importance of a coach to his wrestlers cannot be overstated. Hannas stressed how important Davey was to him. “He drew talent and cultivated both technique and disciplined athletic tness. He was a man that you wanted to push yourself to your optimum and deliver for.”
After he graduated from Post, Hannas still had a desire to be a part of the sport he loved. He had been very successful on the mat, but wanted to instill values in the younger generation of wrestlers. So, when he became an English teacher at Village School District in the Stony Brook region, he mentored seventh, eighth, and ninth graders and taught them how to wrestle. Even to this day, Hannas still has the itch to coach wrestling. He assists a wrestling program in Madison, Conn., where his two grandsons are beginning to hone their skills.
Hannas, who has seen his fair share of wrestling matches, gives young wrestlers a piece of advice: “Never underestimate your opponent and nd out your biggest weakness and work on it.” How can you expect to get better when you’re never willing to improve? Hannas was and still is open to constructive criticism of the sport he loves.
The wrestling team, with a roster of 21 members is currently coached by Joe Patrovich. They still have plenty of matches left this season. The team is currently ranked in the top 10 in the latest D2wrestle. com Super Region I rankings. “Wrestling is like a chess match with your body,” Hannas said fondly. Each move has a bunch of possible counters and there are then counters to those counters. “If skills and training are equal, the victory can depend on a slight nuance or a stronger desire [to win].”

Since our departure from classes just before Christmas of last year, there have been a lot of storylines in each sport that you may have missed.In the NFL, Odell Beckham Jr. had an eventful meeting with Panthers cornerback Josh Norman. What started with good old fashioned hard-nose football turned ugly when Beckham launched himself head first at Norman with the likely intent of trying to injure the defensive back. The result was a one game suspension for perhaps the most talented wide out in the NFL.
Staying in MetLife, the Jets, who had the opportunity to sneak in the playoffs with a week 17 win, were shown the door by former coach Rex Ryan. Ryan handed the Jets their second loss this season and nally captured that elusive “Super Bowl?” Yeah, sure we’ll go with that.
Whatever, we’ll move on from the New York teams. Carolina keeps on winning, even though their top receiver (yes top receiver) is Ted Ginn Jr. Oh yeah, they also have CAMMMMMMM, who will most likely win the MVP award for his incredible season which featured 45 total touchdowns. Another place that is used to winning and keeps seeing it is New England. The Patriots and Belichick grabbed the second seed and seemed to be on a crash course with the Panthers in the much anticipated 50th Super Bowl. That was, until old-man Peyton Manning stepped up and spoiled that party.
Here’s a public service announcement to all defensive backs when facing Aaron Rodgers when your team is leading and it’s the last play of the game: BAT DOWN THE BALL. Rodgers completed his second Hail Mary this season, this one against the Cardinals which tied the game at 20 in the divisional round of the playoffs. Perhaps more dramatic than his first one, Rodgers completed the pass under heavy pressure and launched the ball nearly 60 yards down eld where Je Janis played the role of hero, hauling in the prayer to keep the Packers season alive for about five more minutes as the Cardinals won the thrilling match in overtime.
While the NFL has seen its fair share of great games and fantastic plays, the NBA is no slouch. We have to start where last season ended and that’s with the Golden State Warriors. Do they ever lose? The answer is yes, but it doesn’t seem like it. A team with their record at this point is just unheard of. The only team that can compare to where the Warriors stand right now is the 95-96 Michael Jordan led Chicago Bulls who went a jaw-dropping 72-10 en route to another banner being raised at the United Center.
Now, I may be a little biased here, but I don’t care. Kristaps Porzingis has been one of if not the best pick of the draft. The 7-foot-3 Latvian forward has provided a spark for the Knicks and they have already surpassed their win total of last year. (That’s not saying much, but still). The talented rookie has averaged a hair under 14 points per game to go along with eight rebounds and electrifying dunks that get the fans in the Garden on their feet.
Some other NBA storylines have been the retirement tour for Kobe Bryant which seems to hit a di erent city for the last time every game. (Congrats to Kobe on a great career). Another man, who is actually older than Kobe and keeps chugging along, is Tim Duncan. The Duncan-led Spurs are a well-oiled machine that doesn’t let up. In a western conference that is very top heavy with the likes of the Warriors, Spurs, Thunder, and Clippers, the Spurs will be a tough out against any team and that includes the Warriors.
In the baseball off-season, other than pitchers getting insane amounts of money, there has been a lot of movement. (Some of those pitchers getting absurd amounts of money include David Price to the BoSox for $217 million, Zack Greinke to the D-Backs for $206 million, Johnny Cueto to the Giants for $130 million, Mike Leake to the Cardinals for $80 million, and Scott Kazmir to the Dodgers for $48 million). These five pitchers named account for $681 million dollars, but the best sta in baseball doesn’t even come close to that number.
The New York Mets staff will get bolstered this year when Zack Wheeler returns to the rotation as the likely no. 4 or 5 starter. He will join a staff of amethrowers headlined by Matt Harvey, which also includes Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Steven Matz and Bartolo Colon (I had to throw him in there because he’s hilarious). The Amazin’s lost postseason hero Daniel Murphy to the Nationals via free agency, but upgraded defensively with Neil Walker and Asdrubal Cabrera patrolling the middle of the eld. Also, he’s baaaaaaaaaaack! Yoenis Cespedes is back in Queens on a three year deal with an opt-out after the first year. There’s the big bat this team needed.
One borough over, the Yankees had quite the off-season. Looking to build o a 2015 campaign where they made the playoffs for the first time in two seasons, the Yankees added Starlin Castro to upgrade second base. The former Cubs middle in elder was part of a youth movement which also included the addition of ame-throwing Cuban left hander Aroldis Chapman. Chapman now joins a bullpen that led baseball in strikeouts with studs like Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller.
Some other notable free agents to switch teams include: John Lackey, Ben Zobrist, and Jason Heyward, all of whom went to the Cubs. Jordan Zimmerman will now pitch with Justin Verlander in Detroit and Wei-Yin Chen was somehow able to convince the Marlins to give him $80 million. Chen went 11-8 with an ERA in the mid-threes last year. Maybe this is why the Marlins are never in contention. Because of these contracts.
College football always seems to be Alabama vs everyone else. And by everyone else, I mean everyone else. After dismantling Michigan St. in the first round of the much anticipated College Football Playoffs, Alabama then went on to face the no. 1 team in the land in Clemson. In the championship game, the Crimson Tide showed why they are national champs. Powered by a 24 point fourth quarter, Nick Saban and his team won the shootout 45-40. In a year full of running backs who tore it up in college football, Alabama’s Derrick Henry took home the coveted Heisman Trophy, then proceeded to win a national championship, then declare for the NFL draft where millions of dollars are waiting for him. Not a bad deal if you ask me.
That’s a small recap of some things that happened in the sports world over the break, and just think about all the other things coming up. The Super Bowl is right around the corner, NBA all-star weekend, March Madness, MLB spring training, the list goes on. Prepare for a great year in sports.

Kyle Felice has a chance to become world champion, in a sport that would have many shake their heads unwittingly. The freshman biology major is a competitive Irish dancer who floored his competition in the men’s under-18 Mid-Atlantic Region Irish Dance Championships in Philadelphia on Friday, Nov. 27.
The “Oirechtas”— in Irish dancing terms referring to an annual championship — featured dancers from Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. The first-place earned him a spot in the world championships that will take place in Glasgow, Scotland in March.
“I beat some very good competition, and I got to wear the blue winner’s sash around all weekend,” Felice said. “But really I immediately started thinking about my next challenge.”
Felice describes the sport as requiring “the exibility, endurance, strength, and drive of all athletes, plus the rhythm, skill, and footwork of talented dancers.” He therefore puts a lot of energy into core and cardio training, and underlines that “I drill my steps a lot.”
Usually, practice is scheduled three times per week, but to bulk before major competitions like Scotland, Felice doubles the hours in the Dorothy-Petri dance studio, which has locations in East Northport, N.Y., and in Belfast, Ireland.
As a Longwood High School graduate, acclimatizing to college life has not been an easy feat.
“I decided to rush a fraternity this semester,” Felice said, “so it’s not uncommon for me to bring my school books or my TKE handbook to practice.”
But Felice finds many sources of inspiration to keep up with the dancing: his teachers, Lisa and Karen Petri, for pushing him to improve every day when hitting the floor; his parents, Jim and Sheila Felice — his mother, as a former competitive Irish dancer herself, specifically for introducing him to the sport at the age of 6; and Shia Labeouf, the American actor, performance artist and director, whose “Just Do It” motivational speech on YouTube has over 8.7 million views.
While there are lots of bene ts with Irish dancing, Felice said, he describes the best to be travelling for competitions throughout the world with friends, and exploring new places.
Other than being given that experience when he flies to Scotland next year to compete in the world championships, Felice expects to “come out of the trip a stronger and better dancer than I am now, regardless of how I do in the competition.”

After su ering their fourth straight loss one week ago to the University of the District of Columbia in our nation’s capital, the women’s basketball team found itself 14 games under .500 and sitting at 2-14 on the season.
In that matchup against UDC, the Pioneers were seemingly out of it in the second quarter. Once UDC started hitting their shots and locking down on defense, they took off . The low point for the Pioneers was a 16 point hole before the half.
The double-digit de cit was too much for the Pioneers to overcome and they ultimately fell 70-47. Senior guard Khea Gibbs dropped 16 points while junior forward Melsha Messam nished with 11 points and eight boards off the bench.
On Wednesday, Jan. 27, the Pioneers are back in action and are seeking their first win away from the Pratt Recreation Center as they are taking on the University of Bridgeport from Connecticut. In their earlier matchup this season, the Pioneers lost a close game 58-52 and that one was at home.
In that aforementioned game, senior guard Jalyn Brown was the catalyst for the Pioneers, leading them in the scoring department with 17 while also dishing out three assists. Senior forward Nyasia Davis also played well, adding seven points, 10 rebounds, and accumulating four steals.
The key to victory for Bridgeport was points o turnovers. Bridgeport outscored the Pioneers 25-5 in that category. In addition to that, Bridgeport was also led by a trio of double-digit scorers. The Pioneers will be seeking redemption when the game tips off at 5 p.m.

All incidents that take place on campus are, by law, a matter of public record and can be found at the office of Public Safety. The Crime Blotter is provided monthly by the Pioneer as a public service for the campus community.
Petit Larceny
On Nov. 4, 2015, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, reported that a map of the ocean oor that had been pinned to her classroom wall in Pell Hall was taken on Oct. 20. The professor spoke with a custodian who was on duty on that day. The custodian claimed to have seen a female student of one of the professor’s enter the room, turn o the light, and remove the map. He then said that the student proceeded to her vehicle which was parked on the walkway east alcove and vacated the scene.
The student was identi ed and when confronted by the professor denied taking the map. The professor reported that this same student attempted to take a lab manual from the classroom on Nov. 3. The professor stated that although at first, the student denied taking the manual, she then produced the manual from her bag.
The map has not been returned. The professor stated that she will use an older map until a new one arrives.
Lost or Stolen Items
On Dec. 2, an Aramark employee who works in the Doll House Cafe on Riggs Lawn opened at 7 a.m. and found that the refrigerator was ajar. Up to $25 worth of food items were reported as missing. There were no signs of forced entry and all windows and doors were secured. The items that were missing included: 1 cookie, 4 mu ns, 4 Italian sodas, 1 brownie, and 1 jar of Nutella. There was no physical damage.
On Dec. 5, a wallet was reported missing from the Pratt Recreational Center. A student who is a member of the track team stated that he had his wallet in the bathroom of Pratt at 2:30 p.m. on Dec. 4, and noticed it was missing an hour later when exiting a charter bus from Post to a track meet at Fordham University. The Pratt sta stated that no one has turned in a wallet.
Vehicle Damage
On Dec. 11, in late afternoon, at a 7-11 near campus, a student made a right turn into the 7-11 lot and said that she did not see the low-hanging chain blocking the entrance. She struck the chain and panicked, dislodging the pole. There was damage to the right front fender of the vehicle. The report stated that the area was well lit by natural light.

For the second spring semester in a row, Post has been hit by a crippling snowstorm in
the first few weeks of the term. Last semester, winter storm Juno resulted in a day and a half
of canceled classes. Although this time, winter storm Jonas hit its hardest on Saturday, it could be conceived that some kind of alternate schedule should have been arranged.
Other Campuses according to nbcnewyork.com:
• SUNY Old Westbury- Canceled
• Adelphi University- 2hr delay
• Hofstra University- 3hr delay
• Molloy College- Canceled
• Nassau Community College- delayed
• St. Johns University- Delayed
According to weather.com, a total of 30.5 inches of snow fell at John F. Kennedy airport. Several other locations on the eastern seaboard accounted for the largest snowstorm ever. The snow has made an impact on the Long Island Railroad as well. Far Rockaway, Hempstead, Long Beach, and the West Hempstead lines were closed on Monday, Jan. 25.
Although most of the snow fell on Saturday, Jan. 23, it was still di cult to maneuver around the campus on Monday, Jan. 25. This was especially important for those who had 8 a.m. classes. Walkways were extremely narrow and icy between the parking lot and Hillwood Commons, as well as between Hillwood Commons and Humanities Hall. In addition to the walkways, the “reject lot” wasn’t very clear either. Cars were scattered in an uneven, crooked line that curved around the mounds of snow. The same could have been said about the Pratt Recreation Center parking lot as well. Although conditions did slightly improve towards the middle of the day, it became obvious why other local campuses had an alternate schedule.

During the fall 2015 semester, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) club made its return to campus after a year of absence. The club’s mission is to help the advancement of colored people, like its name says, but on a smaller level suited for Post. The club is also working as an avenue to push the message of ‘Black Lives Matter’.
The club went dormant last year, when the former president left school without notifying any of the other members. Current members are unsure exactly why the former president left. It was only last semester when current President Antonette Dauré, a senior forensic science major, decided to step up. “I just wanted it to start back up, and I didn’t see anyone doing anything about it,” Dauré said. Keeping the campus aware and educated about what is going on in the black community is at the top of her agenda for the club.
She plans to do this peacefully, but, in a way so that the club’s message is heard loud and clear. On Dec. 7, in the lobby of Hillwood Commons, the NACCP club did just that. Approximately 15 members of the club and supporters held a silent sit in, while holding signs that read #STAYWOKE, #WEARENOTALLCRIMINALS, #EVERY28HOURS, #BLACKLIVESMATTER. These are all popular hashtags on social media that are about raising awareness of what is happening in the black community.
Kevin Guardia, a senior forensics science major who is the Head of Public Relations for the club, is aware of the negative anti-white perceptions that come along with the NAACP and Black Lives Matter. As a countermeasure, Guardia said, “Normally we try to have a welcoming environment and invite everyone, not just black students.” He added, “We give everyone a chance to give their input at the meetings.” Guardia, who is from Peru, is a walking example that the club is not only for black students. Guardia joined because of his several black friends and Dauré reaching out to him.
‘Black Lives Matter’ is a phrase that has grown from a hashtag to a movement over the past few years. To most, the first time they heard the saying was most likely through a trending hashtag on social media. The motivation to start this organization came when George Zimmerman, who was charged in the murder of 18-year-old Trayvon Martin, was acquitted, according to blacklivesmatter.com. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, shot Martin, who was an unarmed black male, after he was instructed by 911 not to pursue, according to the New York Times. Zimmerman acknowledged that he shot Martin, but claimed that it was in self-defense. This case led to a national debate for the months leading up to the decision.
The sign that said, #EVERY28HOURS is paying homage to the statistic that every 28 hours a black person is killed by a police officer, according to the Huffington Post. On Dec. 7, the club wanted to send a message, and they did. Although #EVERY28HOURS can sound anti-law enforcement, club treasurer Jessie Pierre, a senior psychology major, said, “We push more of a social awareness rather than anti-police.” During their silent sit in, members noticed how people were looking in admiration of what they were doing. When Dauré saw members of the office of Campus Life, she thought that they were going to be shut down, but in reality it was quite the opposite.
After about 20 minutes of sitting in silence, the group gained quite a crowd and took a break. People came up to them to tell them how they appreciated what they were doing and others stopped and took pictures. Due to the unexpected amount of support and observers who wanted to join, they did another 15 to 20 minute sit in with several more people joining. “Afterward I was really proud and honored to have you guys do this,” Dauré said. “People were just blown away by this; we are really touching home here.”
Some of the additional people who came were from the Campus Life office, which never actually approved the event. Earlier in the fall semester, the club had planned to march around campus raising awareness, but the event was canceled because it was deemed unsafe by the office of Public Safety. The idea of the march falls in line with what was done after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. Brown, who was an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed on Aug. 9, 2014, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, a suburb in St. Louis, according to the New York Times. As a result it ignited a working-class suburb of about 20,000 residents. Hundreds of people gathered at the scene of the shooting to question the police.
This semester, the club is attempting to put an event together called Bury the N-word, which will shed some light on the use of derogatory terms. The event is still in the developing stages, but the concept will be physically burying some of society’s derogatory terms.
The club is planning its first meeting of the semester. Last semester, meetings were on Monday nights in either the Hillwood Cinema in Hillwood Commons or in The Endzone in Hillwood Commons. For more information, email the president at antonette.daure@my.liu.edu.

From Friday, Jan. 29 through Sunday, Jan. 31, Post will be holding a 48-hour long Global Game Jam. The event is being held for the rst time, and will take place in the Long Island Room located downstairs in The Winnick Student Center.
Once participants arrive at the annual Global Game Jam, you are given a theme. After you get into a group, you and your teammates work together in designing and creating a digital or non-digital game.
“The Global Game Jam is an opportunity to meet new people, so participants are strongly encouraged to work with people they didn’t know before they came to the event,” said Ramiro Corbetta, Director of Digital Game Design and Development.
During the 48-hour weekend, one free meal will be provide for participants as well as snacks and water throughout the day. Upstairs in the Winnick Student Center the cafeteria will also be open during normal Friday through Sunday hours of 10-7. According to Corbetta, there will not be a lot of sleeping at the event. “Others might bring a sleeping bag and just catch some sleep at the Global Game Jam location.” The focus is to design and create a game, they can sleep when they get home.
Participants that attend have the opportunity to meet and work with others who share the same passion and interest of gaming as them. Eric Guadara, a graduate digital game design major, said, “The only payment is the time it takes to register on the Global Game Jam’s website.” The website to register is tiny.cc/postgamejam.
Since this is the university’s rst year hosting this annual event, and it is the only location on Long Island hosting Global Game Jam, the school is expecting between 30-50 participants, but are hopeful for more. Participants can be students, or people from around the area that are interested in the event.
“We decided to host it because we believe that the Global Game Jam is a great opportunity for both LIU Post students and for the Long Island game development community to come together and create something in a short amount of time,” Corbetta said.
Awards will be given out at the end of the 48-hour event, but the goal of the Global Game Jam is to work together. “While the award is an honor, the real goal of the Game Jam is to make something interesting in a short amount of time,” Corbetta added.
