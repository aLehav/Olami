During the 2014- 2015 academic year, WCWP, the campus radio station, broadcasted a majority of the school football, baseball, and basketball games. In 2013, LIU sports broadcasting occurred regularly, on a daily radio talk show called the Sports Hit List. Once the students broadcasting the show graduated, sports coverage became minimal.
Senior Broadcasting major Deandre Wilson was among one of the few who raised sports broadcasting from the proverbial ashes during this academic year after the crew of sports broadcasters graduated in Spring 2013. Wilson didn’t think he would get into radio, but he became interested after broadcasting his first football game on Sept. 27, 2014.
“I think if you ask Mike Nicosia, he’ll say it was one of our best games too,” Wilson said. “Just from there, that was the point we knew we could do this. And for the rest of the season, we just got it—we had to do our research, but once the plays get going and you’re in the game, it’s amazing.”
Sophomore Accounting major Michael Nicosia attended a meeting in spring 2014 for anyone interested in doing sports broadcasting. Nothing came to fruition at the meeting, especially since the sports broadcasting department was practically empty. As Nicosia’s interest in sports broadcasting grew, he tried to bring more people into the program. The team started with the fall football season, broadcasting almost every game.
“After week two [of the football season], when we found out we couldn’t send our past play-by-play and color commentators on the road, [alumni] Peter Belotti asked myself and Deandre to step up and take over those roles,” Nicosia said.
“We traveled to Merrimack with the team and we were in the stands,” Wilson said. “After that game, we kept going to every game and were even able to interview coaches.”
Nicosia broadcasted play-by-plays, and Wilson covered color commentary during the games. “After our first football game, the sports broadcasting began to boom,” Wilson said.
Dan Cox, WCWP’s director, picked the sports that were broadcasted this semester. He felt football was the most important, especially with Homecoming and LIU Post’s newly built stadium. This year, the department brought in alumni Jeff Crowl and Phil Lebowitz to broadcast the Homecoming game because of it is of great importance to the university.
Every football game, and most home baseball and men’s and women’s basketball games were broadcasted. “We have done every Pioneer game, except for two basketball games versus NYIT, and a couple that overlapped with football season,” Wilson said. Wilson hopes that the team will broadcast more games next year, especially away games.
Wilson and Nicosia said that they see this program growing. Although many of the establishing broadcasters are graduating this semester as well, including Wilson. “Mike is the cornerstone for the sports department to keep going,” Wilson said.
All students can join the broadcasting team, regardless of major or area of interest. Just head on over to the WCWP station and inquire about becoming a broadcaster. Everyone must go through training, including voice training, learning the board, and how to deal with malfunctions.
Peter Belloti, a WCWP alumnus who currently works at CBS News, “came in and helped us out, training us from the ground up on how to broadcast games, how to look at a play, and then call it,” Wilson said. Stay tuned next semester for more coverage of LIU sports games from WCWP.

In late March, LIU Post’s The Treat Shoppe, located across from the Campus Concierge desk in Hillwood Commons, faced health code violations from the Nassau County Department of Health for lacking a required permit.
“A business that wishes to provide food service in Nassau County is mandated to have a certain amount of sinks and other amenities in order to sustain an adequate mark of health and cleanliness,” according to Lawrence E. Einstein, the Commissioner of the Nassau County Department of Health. “According to our records, at the time [of a recent inspection], Post’s Treat Shoppe was not meeting our standards.”
Tamir Dayya, the Special Projects Manager who manages The Treat Shoppe, and his team were taken back by the news, and worked quickly to remedy the issue. “We had work done in the back of The Treat Shoppe. The university itself installed the number of sinks needed,” he said. With the necessary instillations made, Dayya was puzzled by the violation until he realized that the appropriate paperwork had not been filed with the Department of Health.
“Due to a bureaucratic error, The Treat Shoppe’s permit was never processed,” said David Sollors, LIU’s Assistant Counsel and Compliance Officer. “LIU became aware of this during an inspection by the County’s Office of Food Protection in the ordinary course of business that resulted in a violation for lacking a permit.”
“LIU provided the Nassau County Health Department with all necessary documentation to obtain a permit,” Sollors said. “The Health Department found the papers to be in order, and issued a preliminary permit to continue operating The Treat Shoppe. A final permit is expected to be issued, pending a final inspection of The Treat Shoppe.”
“We simply never received the proper documentation. However, after notifying the university, we soon received all the proper documentation from Post and the instillation company. Post has always complied with our health standards,” Einstein said.
Dayya said that he believes in operating a business built on integrity and honesty. He said that he manages his business for one sole purpose: to provide students with the opportunity to work in a small business, and see exactly what comes with running a business.
“Most of the students working [in The Treat Shoppe] want to go in to business for themselves one day, and this Shoppe, this program, allows them to gain hands-on experience with running a business and everything that goes with it such as overhead, dealing with consumers, and marketing a product; [these] are some things our students work hands on with,” Dayya said. He also mentioned that any profit the store makes goes to Post’s scholarships funds.
The violation never caused The Sweet Shoppe to close for business. “[The Treat Shoppe] is doing better every day, and next semester we are looking into adding a smoothie maker,” Dayya said.

Dear Readers,
If you had told me a year ago that I would’ve been the editor-in-chief of a college newspaper as a sophomore, I would have laughed at the concept a little too hard. And yet, here I am, signing off as editor-in- chief of The Pioneer, on to bigger and better things (like head copyeditor for The Bottom Line!!).
When I came to Post in the fall of 2013, I signed up for this little known course called Journalism 41, which I was really excited about taking since writing is what I had come to school for. Little did I know that staying the course (pun intended) would give me the opportunity to move up the ranks of The Pioneer’s e- board, eventually becoming its new co-editor-in-chief the following fall.
The whole reason I’d deferred my transfer application to Hofstra that winter was because I was offered an assistant editor’s position in spring 2014. Due to outside circumstances, I was then promoted to news editor shortly after, and it was the most difficult yet rewarding experience I have had thus far in college. Being a section editor as a freshman is no easy feat, yet my efforts were realized when I was pulled into a room mid-March with this blonde, Swedish boy who I had never spoken to before that day (he sat in the “sports corner” of the newsroom – foreign territory (pun intended) for yours truly). We were told that together we’d be the new co-editors-in-chief.
A year has gone by, and that blonde, Swedish boy is now one of my best friends. Undertaking this leadership position with Max has been worth every late night layout, faculty complaint, and overblown staff ego combined. I couldn’t imagine spending so much time with anyone else. I truly feel that we’ve raised this paper to unimaginable heights – from designing a new, fresh (and controversial) masthead, to improving story content, and attracting more readers than ever before.
I have accomplished so much as editor-in-chief of The Pioneer. I’ve reported on the BRAVE initiative, Local 153’s fight for fair contracts, and even interviewed the hardest working man in show business, Jay Leno (which I’m still getting over). Aside from journalistic experience, I’ve been able to communicate with my fellow students and members of the administration in ways I’d never thought possible. This position has strengthened my presence as a student leader at LIU Post, and has given me invaluable experience to last a lifetime. Thank you, and keep reading!
Sincerely yours,
Alyssa Seidman

Since it’s primarily a commuter campus, many LIU Post students drive their own vehicles. For those who don’t have access to a car, if they need to travel outside campus perimeters, the only options they have had in the past are taxis, the off-campus shuttle, or the N-20 MTA bus. These options often come with complications, usually concerning time and money. However, the university has expanded their transportation options with the Rideshare Portal.
The Ride Share Portal is a service LIU Post began offering on Monday, April 13, in partnership with 511NY Rideshare, a ride matching service for travelers and commuters. LIU Post students, faculty, and staff can register and create a profile online where they can find people to carpool with. The purpose of this service is to have individuals use an accessible service that finds other commuters who have similar travel routes and patterns, and with whom they can share a car. All of this, while helping the environment.
William Achnitz III, Coordinator of Campus Life and LIU Post Sustainability Program, said that the planning for this service began a few years back. “I was able to connect with representatives from 511NY Rideshare. We’ve always stayed in contact with one another and one thing about the ‘sustainability community’ is that we are always looking to build partnerships with each other to bring forth a more sustainable world. The rideshare portal was something we discussed way back when, and I’m happy that it’s been implemented here not just at LIU Post, but also at LIU Brooklyn, and all of LIU’s satellite campuses. It’s a Long Island University initiative,” Achnitz said.
The service is beneficial, Achnitz said, because it not only cuts your environmental footprint in half, but it cuts your commuting costs in half too.
The Rideshare Portal isn’t the only new travel service on campus. As The Pioneer reported on Jan. 27, the university now offers Zipcar, a car rental service for students who have a driver’s license but no car. According to Achnitz, many members of the Post Sustainability Committee, students and faculty, advocated for Zipcar. The administration was receptive, and recognized it was a service that the students wanted, and with the Student Government Association’s support, Zipcar arrived on campus this past October.
“Zipcar is an alternative to car ownership. Students may reserve a car hourly or daily by becoming a member of Zipcar. There is a cost to utilize the service, and [the campus] currently has two cars [that are] available to students. The Rideshare portal is an online matching database. It’s essentially a mechanism to find a carpool partner that has a similar commute. Although different, they are both sustainable alternatives to commuting by yourself,” Achnitz explained.
As a campus resident, junior Psychology major, Ileana Lado, believes that the Rideshare portal will be beneficial, and would not be opposed to trying it. “It definitely has potential to be more convenient than the transportation on campus since the shuttle doesn’t run as frequently or as late as it should. I have experienced hectic schedules, which the campus transportation doesn’t accommodate, so I would gladly give this new service a try. If implemented correctly, it can be a success, but there must be enough people registered and willing to participate for it to actually run efficiently,” Lado said.
Lado also said that because the university is a rural campus, there are many other places students would love to go to, but they are too far away, and other transportation methods won’t take them there. “If I use this service, I’m sure I can find others who are willing to go the distance, and I also won’t have to pay for the over-priced taxi services in Long Island,” Lado said.
The Office of Campus Life, in addition to Post’s Sustainability Committee, have been hosting events throughout the course of March and April to promote sustainability. Representatives from 511NY Rideshare have visited the campus multiple times this semester to discuss the resources that they provide to commuters. The Rideshare Portal can be accessed 24/7 at https://ridematch.511nyrideshare.org/ newyork/LIU. Zipcar is also available 24/7. You can make reservations online through www.zipcar.com/liupost once you have become a member of the service.

LIU Post participated in RecycleMania from Feb. 1 to March 28. “Nearly, 4.5 million students from 394 schools recycled and composted 80.1 million pounds,” according to the RecycleMania website.
The goals for RecycleMania were to “motivate students and staff to increase recycling efforts and reduce waste generation, generate attention and support for campus recycling programs, encourage colleges to measure and benchmark recycling activity in their effort to improve their programs over time, and have a fair and friendly competition” according to the RecycleMania website.
LIU Post also competed in the RecycleMania 3R challenge, where students and faculty on campus took pictures while recycling. Submissions included different hashtags such as reduce or recycle, and could be tweeted to the RecycleMania group page, or sent to the organization via text.
For eight weeks, the schools participating were ranked by RecycleMania depending on the amount of recyclables they collected. The program was also divided depending on the size of the school. Last year, LIU Post finished the overall challenge in 192nd place out of 256 schools, recycling 47,580 pounds of materials.
This year, LIU Post was ranked in the medium division for the RecycleMaina 3R challenge, and came in sixth out of a total of about forty schools. LIU Post collected 67 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, which is enough energy consumption to power six households or 13 cars. Overall, this year Post came in 229th out of 232 schools, and collected 40,140 pounds of recyclable materials. The University of Albany won first place in the medium division; they collected 150 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, which measured to be the consumption of 13 households, or 29 cars.
The LIU Post Sustainability Committee, which consists of faculty, students and administrators, helped run the RecycleMania event by being in charge of the bottle-shaped recycling bins around campus. William Achnitz, the Campus Life Coordinator for Riggs Hall, applied for and won the recycling bottle bins through a contest that Dasani was holding in 2013.
Although the event is over for this year, recycling will continue to occur as the recycling bins are present in academic buildings all year round, to promote continued recycling efforts. This is the fourth year LIU Post has competed in the RecylceMania competition, and it recycled more this year than in previous years. The Sustainability Committee did tabling events in Hillwood Commons, and promoted the event via social media. The goal of the event was to get the entire student body to become aware of their recycling habits.
“It made people think about what they were doing with their used bottles and cans and paper before they threw it out. I think if a handful of people chose to recycle instead of throw something out, then we made a difference,” said senior English major Melissa Colleary.

Before we say “adios” to spring semester classes and say “hola” to finals week, it’s only right to give some study tips that might raise your chances of acing your exams.
Tip #1
What you might want to do before you start studying for your finals is to make a list of classes that you want to spend the most and the least amount of time on, depending on how important each class is, or how difficult the material is. This way you can spend more time studying for a class you have trouble with.
Tip #2
You can’t memorize the whole book the night before the final. Even Einstein wouldn’t have been able to do it! And, by doing that, are you actually learning anything? Think about it for a second.
Tip #3
Have you realized that when you hear a song on radio a couple of times, the next time it plays, you know the lyrics to it? Believe me, if you read your notes at least 3 times, everything you read will come back in your mind.
Tip #4
As a child, many of us wrote on chalk boards and that is how we learned our alphabets and numbers. Sometimes, when you write down your material, it is much easier for your mind to memorize it.
Tip #5
Often, we get so nervous before the exam that we end up forgetting everything we learned. Therefore, try taking self-tests. Time yourself while you take the test and note down what you know and what you still need to work on.
Tip #6
“All-Nighter.” How many times have you heard your friends use that word? From my personal experience, I would never suggest anyone to pull an all-nighter! You might be learning extra material by pulling one, but during the exam, you brain will not have the capability to remember anything and will lose its ability for alertness. Lack of sleep makes your brain not function well. Believe me when I say this!
Tip #7
Reading through your notes and jotting down new ideas you want to remember a few minutes before the exam is never a good idea! Whatever you learn during that time just messes up your brain and makes you forget everything you learned previously. This also increases the feeling of desperation, which leads to panic and then to test anxiety.
Tip #8
Many students use their laptops for all their assignments and also for studying. But let’s be honest here, how many times are we being distracted by the Internet? For example, were you researching the stock market and ended up on a “How to make chocolate brownies” video on YouTube? Try keeping yourself away from your phone and laptop while you’re studying as much as you can. You will end up learning faster and better.
Tip #9
Always remember that your brain needs a few minutes to relax before it starts absorbing all of your notes again. Take a 10-minute break at least after every hour! Reward yourself for dedicating an hour of your life to your studies. Seriously, you deserve it! If you continue without taking breaks after a certain time, your brain would give up, your eyes would start hurting, and you won’t understand anything.
Tip #10
Find your study zone. Everyone has a specific place where they best concentrate. Some prefer to be isolated in a room, so that they don’t get disturbed. Others find the sound of people and music in the background soothing while trying to concentrate.

When you buy a food labeled “All Natural,” what exactly are you getting? Quite frankly, when this term is printed on a food label in the U.S, the word “Natural” has no regulated definition. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to develop a definition for the use of this term, which means any package can bear the term “All Natural” without having to answer to any regulation.
It’s easy to get pulled into buying a product based on what the label says. Most of us do this every single day. After all, that is what a label is intended to do. Some label claims are regulated by the FDA or monitored by the industry and have a clear criteria. However, others have almost no meaning at all; it’s simply marketing tactics. Unfortunately, consumers are exposed to numerous misleading labels everyday. This article will help you navigate through your grocer with ease and have you interpreting the food label like a pro in no time.

With the semester coming to a close, and one more year of college under our belts, our eyes are focused on the future and the opportunities that lie ahead. However, for some students, this semester will be their final one at Post. Thus, with graduation looming, a simple question arises. Where’s the best place to celebrate?
Truthfully, there is no one answer to this question. As a matter of fact, it can be answered in ten different ways, since everyone has a different perspective on graduation and how this accomplishment should be celebrated.
Lisa Schwartz, a senior Chemistry major, stressed that the best place to celebrate graduation is wherever your family is. “I owe a lot of my accomplishments to my family,” Schwartz said. “My family has been there every step of the way; therefore, it’s only fitting I celebrate this accomplishment with them.” So where will she celebrate? Well, Schwartz and her family are still deciding between a backyard barbeque or a catering hall located on the banks of the Long Island Sound, but location isn’t a premium for Schwartz.
Some students take a more, let’s say, “festive” approach to celebrating graduation. “Yeah, I’ll probably go to dinner with my family,” said Dom Argonesi, a senior Business Administration major. “But me and the crew already booked a vacation to Aruba right after graduation.” He said the flight is scheduled for noon, the day after graduation. “College was awesome, and my friends are a huge reason why I had such a great time. So that’s who I’m going to celebrate it with. One last hoorah in Aruba!” Argonesi said.
Other students, such as Omar Nehhas, a senior History major, are taking a simpler approach to graduation. “My family and I are going to spend the weekend after graduation at our beach house in Montauk,” Nehhas said. “It’s affordable, plus I’m going to bring a few friends out, so it should be fun.”
A graduation celebration doesn’t have to be an overly expensive event. A backyard barbeque allows you to enjoy good food and good company in the comfort of your own home. Even a night out at a club or a bar is affordable, especially when you compare that to a trip to Aruba.
However, regardless if you’re celebrating graduation in Aruba with your friends, at a catering hall with your family, or even at a club with your friends, the best place to celebrate graduation seems to be with the people you love the most. After all, we are all reflections of the people we surround ourselves with, and if it wasn’t for friends and family, the road to graduation might just have been a little bumpier than expected.

In recent years, trends such as tattoos and piercings have become mainstream on the streets. Particularly in fashion, these trends come and go. What’s up next, one might wonder? Well, ‘apparel’-ly, men’s accessories.
Sales have gone up by 9 percent, counted over the year from May 2013 to 2014, reaching an annual $13.6 billion affaire, according to The New York Times. Retailers have noticed this change with some of them now working to make us buckle up for the summer.
“We see many people strolling around with rings, wristbands, and other types of jewelry,” said Erik Berthagen, a junior Economics major. “We feel that belts are forgotten in this trend.”
Berthagen is a newly recruited employee of Beltology, a monotype business that, since it was founded in early January 2014, focuses solely on belts. Berthagen says that the company’s vision is to explore the changing market by trying to take advantage of people’s generally more accepting views in society.
“Socks, particularly colored socks, were up,” co-founder Andrew Heffernan told the Wall Street Journal in 2014, “gloves were up, scarves were up, even ties were up. We thought, surely this is a sleeping giant.”
The company has developed a Platonic style of men’s belts, according to its website. It is a niche influenced by popular Italian works with elastic, 1- to 1 1/4 inch-wide woven strips that see over 40+ different color styles after preference.
Retailers of fashionable men’s belts may often sell for a hefty price, and so Beltology is using less cost-efficient ways to promote its product that ranges from $55 – $65. With offices at Lower Manhattan, the company bases its products solely online. But while lots of its promotion is done via uploads on social media sites, the significant strategy to building a trend, Berthagen believes, is part of an already spinning wheel.
His job involves countless visits to the many coffee houses in New York City, but not for coffee per say. “The coffee culture in New York has expanded, and so I meet with these managers, give them a belt and promote our product,” Berthagen said. “Our goal is for all trendy coffee house employees to work wearing our belts.”
But fashion sometimes does not match itself. With more pants being created with adjustable buckles, there’s a chance your new pants don’t really need a belt at all. But maybe it’s not the need of a belt that is governed as trendy, but a want to stick out.
“When I’m in more fashion-forward neighborhoods such as SoHo or Williamsburg,” Ileana Lado, a junior Psychology major, said, “I’ve come across some men who wear belts to add an extra touch to their outfits and it looks great with tucked-in shirts.”
Although Lado has not yet seen any outstanding belts on college students at LIU Post, she’s ready to give the upcoming summertime a chance. For now, the one student that does get something out of buckling up is Berthagen.
“I get to work with economic analyses, how to set up a budget and consider marketing strategies to better promote our product,” Berthagen said. “It’s great to be able to relate the skills of my major with one of my great interests.”

With 2015 nearing its midpoint, it’s time to start planning and preparing for the holidays already. However, that’s not the only thing to mark your calendars down for. It’s almost time for a new presidential race of primaries that will take place next year.
Leading for the Democrats is former secretary of state and Obama-adversary, Hillary Clinton. As for the Republicans, and third- party candidates, there is no word on who’s running just yet.
Ryan Cavanaugh, a senior Criminal Justice and History double major, is tied between his thoughts on the matter. “I’m unsure of if she will be a good candidate for the job,” Cavanaugh said. “Mostly because of how screwed up the foreign policy was under her as Secretary of State. I honestly couldn’t care who is elected president as long as they do the job well.”
Meanwhile, sophomore broadcasting major Brittany Mitchell thinks that Clinton is a worthy candidate for president. “Clinton has had a lot of experiences in this area and she’s run for president in the past so I think that puts her at a safe advantage,” Mitchell said
“If she’s elected president,” Mitchell continued. “I hope that she can help with issues pertaining to college, especially when it comes to student loans and the actual pricing of an education in America.”
On the other hand, Cavanaugh said, “If she were to be elected I would like to personally see more pressure on the United Nations to enter into peacekeeping and enforcing international law.”
Cavanaugh believes that Hillary Clinton’s gender is going to have less of an effect on the election than some people seem to think, and that it is really too early to say if she’ll be considered since preliminaries have not yet been held. “It is still possible another democrat could steal the show from her,” he said.
Personally, I think that Hillary Clinton announcing her campaign for president is great news. Even though America as a whole has its share of problems, I believe that it’s moving in a progressive direction and even more so than before. We see developments like this beginning to unfold more in recent times, like Obama becoming the first African- American president, and I think that if handled right and with care, she could definitely help to positively contribute to U.S. policy and law.
What do you think about Hillary Clinton running for presidential elections? Email us at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

The campus at LIU Post is filled with trees, bushes, and other vegetation that improves its outer appeal. The professors are some of the most accredited professionals in their field of study. This is all appealing to prospective students and even some of those who attend the university, but how is the inside of the campus? What goes into making Post so appealing?
The major source of income for the university is, of course, tuition. As of now, Post’s undergraduate tuition is at the steep price of approximately $33,000 per year for commuters. The cost rises by the thousands for those who dorm. According to the Admissions Office, tuition typically increases one to two percent every year. The cost of higher education is out of control and it is possible that years from now college degrees will become an unobtainable accomplishment.
Higher education comes with high costs, which could be understood in a capitalist society. If Post’s tuition increases one to two percent each year, Post’s 100th anniversary in 39 years will almost double the current tuition. It is hard to see how many people will be able to afford to come to such a well-known school on Long Island. Of course there are scholarship opportunities to be had. Some scholarships are worth a couple hundred dollars whereas others are a couple thousand. According to LIU’s website, the average amount given for individual scholarships is approximately $17,000.
This may not seem like a big deal for those who have their tuition paid by wealthy family members, but for those who have taken out loans by the thousands to get them through school, this is a huge deal. Most people who go to college are doing so to earn a degree in a specific field to go further in life. The cost of colleges, and especially universities, are making students who find education valuable to put off schooling. The student loan debt from Post can set people back years into their post- graduate lives because of nearly $100,000+ worth of debt.
“I am not naïve,” said junior Broadcasting major Kaitlin Veygel. “I know that I picked an expensive school to earn my degree at. I just didn’t think of how much more expensive it could get.”
Tuition does not even include the amount of money students spend annually on books. At the bookstore on campus, the books needed for courses can range from $9 to more than $180. A full time student taking 15 credits per semester can easily spend approximately $1,000 per year.
“I pay for school myself,” said Leah Fischman, a sophomore Criminal Justice major. “I also do not live at home, so I have rent to pay on top of tuition and books and occasionally food on campus when I have a long day.” For those who already live in the adult world, with bills to pay as well as tuition, universities are making it harder for people to further educate themselves and move up in life.

According to WebMD.com, “Adderall is a combination of stimulants (amphetamine and dextroampetamine) which help combat the side effects of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder).” This drug, which can only be provided by prescription, helps the consumer concentrate, pay attention, and also subdues any fidgeting the consumer may have before taking the drug.
So if you don’t have ADHD, why may you be offered it in the future? Ask Richard Sherman, an All-Pro NFL cornerback, and Super Bowl Champion. Sherman, who graduated from Stanford with a degree in Communications, as well as a 4.0 G.P.A., was suspended for four NFL games in 2013, under the NFL’s P.E.D. [Performance Enhancing Drug] Policy. Sherman’s suspension was later overturned for lack of evidence, but NFL has made it clear that Adderall provides an unfair advantage for any player without ADHD.
“It gives players an unnatural and drug induced sense of concentration, allowing them to study hours upon hours of game time, it’s cheating in my book,” said New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin in a December press conference.
Cheating in sports is no surprise, but there is growing concern among students across the nation, even among students here at LIU Post, that Adderall has infiltrated college campuses.
“I’ve seen some of my classmates take Adderall hours before a final exam once,” said Tanner Anderson, a freshman English major. “I asked why they took it, and they’ve all said the same thing, you don’t lose focus.” Anderson also said that none of his classmates had ADHD or any form of attention deficit disorder when they were taking Adderall. This frightened me, in large part because Adderall is only provided by prescription, and students are potentially putting their health at risk, just to pass a test.
According to WebMD, side effects of Adderall may include “Nausea, lack of sleep, loss of appetite, and in some cases a decrease in kidney function.”
“I’ve taken it for two days before my calculus final in order to prep for the test,” said Jack McAllister, a Post alumni who graduated during the Fall Semester of 2013. “Am I proud of it? I’ll be honest, I’m impartial about it. I wanted to pass, I had to pass, and I passed. Did Adderall help me? Yeah, but did Adderall take the test for me? No, I did.”
With all this coming to light, it’s evident that colleges are not immune to the Adderall Epidemic sweeping the nation. How are students getting their hands on Adderall? “Some just steal it from a family member, other’s get it from a friend, it’s all over,” McAllister said.
It appears the fear of failure drives students to the brink in order to pass their classes. Thus, are we pushing our students to hard? Or are our students just using Adderall as a wonder drug, sacrificing two days at the end of the semester to binge study on notes, as opposed to studying periodically throughout the semester. Is Adderall cheating? The NFL views it as such, and personally, I do as well.
My parents always preached that honesty and integrity were what really defines a person. I believe Adderall, when used without a prescription, is cheating. It provides students who are not prescribed this drug with an unnatural and unfair advantage when it comes to studying.
Studying for three hours can be challenging, but studying for eight hours straight without breaking attention, all thanks to a drug, is ludicrous, and made possible because of this drug. It’s also unfair to the students who chooses to study drug-free, because now, the playing field for students is unequal.
You will begin hearing whispers of students earning not just better test grades, but scholarships, because of Adderall use. This will leave students who choose to study drug-free unmotivated to further their education, or worse, lead other students to use Adderall illegally.
I believe Adderall is an issue that is turned a blind eye to by our education system, and will ultimately destroy not just our education system, but worse, our youth, if it is not banned from educational institutions.
On one last note, it is worth mentioning that I grew up idolizing ball players such as Alex Rodriquez, Barry Bonds, and Roger Clemens. After I discovered that these men used performance enhancing drugs, and essentially cheated, I turned my back to the game of baseball. Others, like me, followed suit. Now, one may argue that baseball has been severely handicapped by the use of steroids within their ranks, and according to television ratings and revenue, one can come to the conclusion that baseball’s popularity, and people’s faith in the game, has suffered as a result of steroids.
I’d hate to see people lose even more faith in our education system here in America. I would also hate to see students’ lives be destroyed, or handicapped in any way by the use of illegal prescription drugs, just for the sake of “earning” better grades.

What would you do if you knew that your name would be thrown into a Russian Roulette lottery system that would reveal your impend- ing fate? Can you picture yourself having to fight for your life — to kill innocents to survive? These odds are unimaginable, unthinkable, and unsettling; yet millions rave over these fictitious circumstances that are portrayed in the popular film franchise known as “The Hunger Games”.
“The Hunger Games,” along with many popular film franchises such as “Divergent,” “The Giver,” “The Host,” and “Maze Runner,” all have one common thread: their plots unravel in dystopian futures. In this day and age, the idea of a dystopia seems to intrigue many viewers, which is why these films have become so popular. “Mockingjay: Part 1” alone made $123 million in the box office for opening weekend according to Brent Lang’s Variety article, “Box Office: ‘Hunger Games: Mocking- jay: Part 1’ Scores Year’s Biggest Opening With $123 Million” on Nov. 23, 2014.
Why are viewers across the globe so enamored by these films? Perhaps the characters in these films drive their popularity because they are easy to identify with, according to Tina Schwartz, junior Early Childhood Education major. “I love Beatrice (“Divergent”); we both are soft-spoken but when the time comes, we face our fears and enter the unknown without hesitation,” Schwartz said.
Perhaps it is because the hero in these movies are in fact not male, they are female, which is why Julie Abbruzzese, a junior Public Relations major, loves “The Hunger Games.” “I like how it’s a girl that’s standing up to the government, not a man. She’s standing up for some- thing even though she doesn’t necessarily want to be the face of the re- bellion—she does it for the good of the nation. She’s an inspiration.”
Perhaps the reason many people find these films so relatable is because of the several characters that make the story, “The characters themselves are very relatable [in “The Hunger Games”]. Each one has different personality traits and feelings that people can identify with, whether it’s courage, anger, vengeance, or even fear. This reason alone is why I was so eager for the next movie to come out; I was able to feel what the characters were feeling” Schwartz said.
“Divergent” and “The Hunger Games,” along with several other films, revolve around individuals who have no control over their lives due to the lack of free will. One may argue that each of these movies have governments who control the fate of the public, which is what makes these films so enticing. “I think society loves movies about the world ending, or revolutions and dystopias because I think we are all fascinated with the idea of having such harsh and tyrannical governments,” Ab- bruzzese said. “I think we are sick individuals and we find [these films] interesting,” Abbruzzese added.
It is possible that some moviegoers are fascinated with living in a true dystopia; others, however, may not be. “I don’t find the idea of a dystopia appealing. The graphic nature of [“The Hunger Games”] is very depressing,” said Schwartz. That being said, the curiosity results in suc- cessful box office gains. “Divergent” grossed around $250 million world- wide according to Jefferson Grubbs’ Bustle article, “’Divergent’ Grosses $250 Million Worldwide, but How Does It Compare to Other YA Films?” on May 6, 2014.
Will this overwhelming trend of success last for dystopian fic- tions? It’s hard to tell; it’s even beginning to annoy the older generations. “Every time a movie comes out when the world ends, or there’s some sort of dystopian future, my dad always asks ‘who even wants to see this? Not me’,” Abbruzzese said. Is it because these films have a similar theme? Maybe living in a society that revolts against government will no longer appeal to audiences if it becomes a commonality in the theatres. As for now, we can still look forward to “Mockingjay: Part 2,” and the rest of the “Divergent” franchise to be released.

We only have a couple weeks left of the spring semester, and as summer rolls in like the badass it is, we have to remember what we have gone through in these columns over the semester: Staying healthy, fit, and always trying to have a happy vibe!
When we leave school for the summer, we won’t have free access to the gym that some have indulged in throughout the year. This means one of two things: we either have to tone our summer bodies RIGHT NOW, or we have to join a gym when we are back home. Although many of you might think, “Yeah, summer is for chilling. Gym? No way!” Think again.
If you are going to partake in alcohol-infused shenanigans and eat all of those juicy burgers on your travels or while in the Hamptons when you’re cruising on the beach, you have to make sure you somewhat maintain a level of fitness or exercise. You might not ‘bust your balls’ seven days a week, but one or two sessions on the cross trainer, or a core session a week, goes an extremely long way.
Another factor to consider when venturing out in the world throughout July and August is to sustain a half-decent diet. I know summer is the time for relaxation, feet up and enjoyment. But you want to look good on the beach, right? You don’t have to look like those lingerie models, who are hauled by paparazzi cameras on Panama Beach, but just enough to uphold the level of balance in your diet, so that when you are back in school it isn’t as difficult to reach your normal levels.
I don’t mean having a tiny slice of pineapple with your Pina Colada or a slither of orange with your tequila sunrise. Although these little things do help, it’s just not sufficient enough. But, what you can do is having water with most of your meals and keeping topped up on your fruits and vegetables. Maybe eat a bowl of mango while you are catching the rays on your sun bed?
Both of these factors are to not only making sure you look good for the sun and heat — and the opposite gender, of course. No, having these factors incorporated into your life and daily routines will just increase the happy karma!
We all know that with the sun comes a much happier self, but let’s add to that. By making sure we keep a good level of diet and exercise, we will just feel much better all around. You know what they say about a happy person, right? They are so much more attractive and radiant!
If we have a good positive frame of mind, when it comes to (starting and) finishing that assignment in the last week of the break for that class we all have on the first day of the semester, we can get it done much more efficiently and easily. Let’s win this game of happiness and health, and say…Namaste!

Having grown up in a house where cursing was a big no-no, I refrained from saying curse words until the ninth grade. Now, I curse like a sailor, just never in my parents’ home. A tale as old as time, curse words are “big people words” and should never be used because they are not nice.
“Oh my God” was considered a curse in my house. My mother would repeatedly say, “God has nothing to do with it!”
As recently as 15 years ago, children were having their mouths washed out with bars of soap for cursing around their parents and especially their grandparents. That is now a rare sight. Children can be heard in lower level middle school classes and even elementary schools cursing on the playground. One can assume they are not going home to eat a bar of soap for dinner.
In grade school, when a teacher would slip and say words like “hell,” or “crap,” or things of that nature, the whole class would crack up laughing. Now, it is the kids who are slipping!
Moving to New York from Iowa for school, Shelby Townsend, a sophomore Journalism major, was in culture shock after moving to Long Island. “Of course, at home there are people who curse, it is just a rare thing to hear kids do it,” Townsend said. “But here, everyone uses profanity. When the tours of Boy Scouts would come through the school, they couldn’t have been more than nine years old, and they were whispering curses to each other!”
Most of our grandparents would frown upon hearing their grandkids curse. But some parents are definitely growing more accepting.
Fifty years ago, curse words were used as a derogatory language and to degrade or offend someone. Today, profanity simply enhances a story, kind of like using a thesaurus. If one uses a curse word in front of an adjective, the story just got more interesting.
I do not think that curse words are shocking anymore. I think at one time everyone would have wide eyes upon hearing someone curse, but now it is just expected by certain people, especially in the media. Hearing a song on the radio with no curses is almost like finding innocence in society.
Even TV shows on TeenNick and Disney Channel allude to curse words but instantly cut the character off before they say the profane word, and kids laugh! They understand what almost happened. In a university setting, it is not uncommon for professors to use profanity and most students do not find this odd.
There will always be a time and place where profanity cannot be excused. Of course, when addressing the country or even the world, the President of the United States will never be expected to use profane language. However, that is not to say that if someone hears the President curse during a golf game his entire reputation will be crushed.
Curse words having any negative effect on a persons’ character in real life situations will soon be a thing of the past. In job interviews, people will walk in and have a SpongeBob moment, “How the *$%* are yah?”

As summer is approaching in this world, winter is coming in another. As Jon Snow, Arya Stark, and Khaleesi prepared for the Long Night, eight million people sat down to watch the first episode of the popular series Game of Thrones that aired April 11 on HBO. The series is based off of George R.R. Martin’s fantasy book series “A Song of Ice and Fire,” which consists of five finished books, and two more expected to be released. Here, The Pioneer gives you all the goods for your journey into the realm of Westeros.
This show is not short on plot twists and in depth stories, and as it enters its fifth season, expectations are higher than ever. The show has several intricate parallel story lines, and over 300 talking characters, so it’s easy to be confused. The main stories are as follows:
• Jon Snow. Ned Stark, The Hand of the King’s, bastard son, who’s having trouble finding his way in the world. In previous seasons, he’s been fighting for the Night’s Watch, hung out with the Night Watch’s enemies, and made more enemies than friends. The Night’s Watch is a small group of convicts and volunteers dedicated to protecting the seven kingdoms from the common enemy, the White Walkers.
In the upcoming season, Jon Snow faces challenges as to what to do about his own situation. Avenge his father’s death, find his sisters, avenge his mother, stay with the Night’s Watch or go with the “wildlings.” The wildlings are the free people living north of the Wall, and they oppose the kingdoms and bureaucracy of the seven kingdoms. Jon also has to cope with the presence of Stannis Baratheon, dead king Robert’s brother, who is now on his way to claim his throne from the Lannister’s. Jon’s family, the Stark’s, sided with Baratheon, so there is something to look out for as the season progresses.
• Arya Stark. Jon’s sister, who left the seven kingdoms at the end of last season. She’s on her way to Braavos to find her old friend Jaqen H’ghar, who helped her escape earlier in the series. H’ghar is one of “the Faceless Men,” an effective squad of assassins. Arya is on a mission to avenge her parents and her brother. “Cersei, The Mountain, The Red Woman…”
• Daenerys Targaryen is, to many, the big protagonist. She’s a strong, independent woman, full of principle, but most importantly, she has dragons, and dragons are cool. Her goal in life is to claim what is rightfully hers, the Iron Throne of the seven kingdoms. Her father was the king, until one of the Lannisters killed him, and made the “Usurper,” Robert Baratheon, king. She is currently building an army on her quest to glory. Currently, she’s in Meereen, across the great sea from the seven Kingdoms, after liberating the slaves there. The liberated slaves now call her Mhysa, or mother.
• Tyrion Lannister, “the Imp,” is one of the more complex char- acters on the show. His family are the main antagonists in the series – they’re rich, selfish, evil, and cynical. Tyrion on the other hand, is none of these. He’s also accused of killing the king, Joffrey Lannister, which was one of the most celebrated scenes of last season. Tyrion also killed his father and his bride to be, while he was having a breakdown.
Tyrion is a rightful, misunderstood little guy that has had to live with discrimi- nation and hate since he was born. He is a dwarf in a world where size actually does matter. Now, starting season five, Tyrion has escaped his family, and especially his sister’s wrath, and is on his way to meet Dae- nerys Targaryen, after being persuaded by his companion to forge the great escape. What that will look like is likely to be seen as this season develops.
• Lastly, we have the queen, Cersei Lannister, who, at this point, hates everyone. She was forced into marriage with the Usurper, Robert Baratheon, had three children with her brother, Jamie, and had her son, Joffrey, and father, Tywin, murdered by Tyrion. She also has an agenda against all Starks, whom she blames for the rise and fall of the kingdoms, as well as general disputes and hatred. She now hunts Tyrion, while she has people searching for her daughter, who she sent away to a foreign land.
Season five started with its first episode on Sunday, April 11, and is set to run for 10 episodes. The realm of Westeros will most likely see a lot of twists and turns. Game of Thrones plays on HBO, Sundays at 10 p.m., and is also available on HBO Go and HBO Now.

You may not know who James Bay is, but I am sure you’ve spent some time listening to his newest hit, “Let It Go” every time it comes on the radio. With his unique, husky, rugged, and gruff voice, the British singer-songwriter has been gaining popularity, with most of his upcoming shows in the UK and the U.S. being sold out.
Not only does Bay sing and write his own songs, but he is also a guitarist. He is inspired by artists like Bruce Springsteen and Miles Davis. On his official webpage, he states, “I’m trying to make songs that make people feel something and, if I’m lucky, even move them.”
That’s exactly what he does with his latest album “Chaos and the Calm,” which came out on March 23, consisting of 12 tracks filled with raw emotion. Bay opens up with this album and his talent shines right through it. “Hold Back The River” is the first single to come out of this record, and perhaps his most popular song. A nice mix of instruments, Bay’s unique voice, and the precisely composed lyrics make this song a standout.
His current single “Let It Go,” which was released along with the album, exposes the complications of a relationship that is going nowhere. He sings, “Trying to fit your hand inside of mine, when we know it just don’t fit.” The song allows listeners to understand what it’s like when a relationship isn’t going anywhere, and when it’s time to, as the title says, let it go.
But Bay’s hit singles aren’t his only good songs; in fact, the album is filled with amazing tracks from beginning to end. The album transitions from more of an upbeat indie rock sound that we hear in songs like “Craving and Collide” to slower songs featuring acoustic sounds, such as in “Incomplete and Move Together”.
Bay has a very similar sound to other British singer-songwriters like Ed Sheeran and Passenger, but still maintains his own individuality. Although Bay has toured with Hozier and has won a British excellence in music award, there are still people who are not aware of who he is. “I’ve never really heard of him,” said Doug Robinson, a senior Theatre major. “I do like that singer-songwriters are getting more attention though. I like when artists are able to be unique and original, but still be themselves at the same time.”
Ileana Lado, a junior Psychology major, on the other hand, knows exactly who Bay is, and she has been obsessing about him for the past few months. “I really love his sound,” she said. “My favorite song out of the album has to be ‘Need the Sun to Break’. It automatically puts me in such a good mood.”
Personally, as someone who likes to listen to music that is filled with emotions, I have to say this album is amazing. I am glad I came upon this new artist. Living in a music era where pop and hip hop are dominating the charts, it is very rare to find someone who is still making this kind of deep and emotional music. So don’t forget the name James Bay, because I am sure we will be hearing more from him in the future.

As the calendar turns from March to April, and the snow mounds finally give way to the warmth of spring, the end of the semester is finally insight. With our eyes set on the much anticipated arrival of warmer weather, we unknowingly have entered the final ‘Dog Days’ of the spring semester.
Let’s face it, we’ve all shown signs of spring fever by zoning out in class as we fantasize about a day at the beach, relaxing by the pool, or playing basketball at the park. With that said, students at Post all face a grim and sobering reality. Final exams are just four weeks away, and now is the time to really buckle down and focus during class.
How does one remain focused in class during these final days of the semester?
“Stay the course, show up to class, pay attention, and get what you need to get done, done,” said Nathaniel Reisenberg, a Professor of Calculus who has been at the university for over 20 years. “I see students all the time day dreaming in class as the weather gets warmer. Heck! Some stop showing up to class. As a result of this, their grades suffer.”
This is a professor’s perspective, and, it’s helpful to take this advice because after all, they’re the judge and jury when it comes to your grade. However, some pundits will respond, saying, “Ah well that’s a teachers perspective, they’re not 20 years old in 2015.” But many students also agree Reisenberg’s advice.
“I get invited to parties every weekend, sometimes even during the week, but I have to turn them down,” said Lisa Ventura, a junior Chemistry major. “Yeah I want to go out, who doesn’t? But at the same time, I want to pass all my classes, going can wait a few more weeks.”
“You get what you put in,” said Dan Cox, a Media professor and LIU Post graduate. Can it be any simpler?
College courses are tough, especially as the semester comes to a close. However, when it comes to successfully finishing that course, you hold the key to your destiny. If it means trading off a night at a friend’s house for a night at the library to study for an upcoming final, it’ll sure be worth it at the end of the semester.
Personally, taking full advantage of common hour has helped me a lot through my first two years at Post. During common hour, I, on average accumulate an extra five hours of study time during the week. The school also offers affordable and free tutoring services for students who may feel that they need that extra boost from a peer. Even asking your professors a few more questions in class can help turn that B into an A, and have you on your way to maintaining that 4.0 GPA.
So there you have it, pay attention in class and try to add as much study time to your day as possible, because, after all, “You get, what you put in.”

To LIU Post students, the definition of a “good book” varies. “One that is hard to put down,” said Stephanie Mocerino, a sophomore Broadcasting major, “one that is entertaining and funny and leaves each chapter on a cliff hanger to make me want to keep reading it.”
For others, a good book is defined by its emotional reaction. “I like books that make me cry,” said Samantha Fare, a junior Public Relations major. “In my opinion a good book is one that touches you emotionally, or mentally sparks your interest in ways you never have before,” said Mariel Bourie, a freshman Music Education major.
For some, a good book is characterized by how it resonates with them. “For me, a good book is defined by the lessons taught,” said Stephanie Lozada, a junior Broadcasting major. “I enjoy books that will make me think about the bigger picture, maybe have a hidden message.”
Based on their definitions of a good book, LIU Post students recommend some of their favorite books. “I like ‘Tuesdays With Morris’ by Mitch Albom,” said Lozata, “He interviews one of the wisest people, and this older man gives him advice about life.” “My favorite book is ‘Night Road’ by Kristin Hannah,” Fare said. “It’s emotional and life-changing.” “The Great Gatsby” is a popular book among most of its readers, as it is widely read in schools across the world. “I love the storyline, and it’s a classic novel,” Bourie added. “’The Things They Carried’ by Tim O’Brien,” said Kayla Mahoney, a senior Forensic Science major. “It gave me a look into a soldier’s life while they are away at war, and it’s very well written.”
Some books are valued more by society, and are considered to be beneficial for people to read. Some books that are held in high regard by public opinion are made into movies, such as “Eat, Pray, Love”, by Elizabeth Gilbert. “In present day, I believe a lot of people hold “The Hunger Games” series to a high level, and believe the books to be well written and highly addictive,” Bourie added.
With technology and social media becoming increasingly popular, one may believe that reading and books are becoming less so. “I believe a big deal of why people do not have an interest to read anymore has to do with the technology craze that we have all become obsessed with. Reading a book takes time and concentration, and we want everything fast and at our hands the second we want it,” Bourie said.

As the actors mingle, technical talk fills the room, and the band sets up. Director Brian Long calmly paces around on stage, organizing the some 20 people involved with the production. The Port Washington Play Troupe and LIU Post’s WCWP radio are rehearsing the first live radio play of the semester. The show, “Meet Me in St. Louis”, is an adap- tion of the 1944 musical, and was recorded in the Hillwood Recital Hall on April 18.
“Meet Me In St. Louis” proves to be a throwback experience, reminiscing the mid ‘40s. The play is about four sisters living in the city, where they’re confronted with the struggles of being teenagers. One of the sisters is beaten up, and the older sisters confront the bully. The father of the sisters also announces that they’re moving to New York, which creates tension in the family. The sisters have romances, educa- tional plans, and friends, as every kid does, that are now impossible to pursue. After lots of conflict and upset daughters, the father eventually figures out that they won’t move to New York, as he sees how much they appreciate their hometown.
“The play is based on a show, based on a movie, which is based again on a book,” said David Barnett, the musical director of the play. The troupe has been rehearsing for the play for three weeks, and the 17 cast members consist of every age group from children to retirees. The cast is a part of the Port Washington Play Troupe, where they do other plays, musicals, and children’s theatre. There are also three current LIU Post students involved, and one alumnus.
This semester, WCWP and the troupe are working on three plays. “WCWP is recording it now, and when we’re done with all three, they’ll put it together and air it,” said Pam Meadows, the president of the troupe. The troupe has done six plays with WCWP through last year. “Meet Me In St. Louis” will air on WCWP at a later date, which has not yet been decided.
On May 17, they will set up another live production, “All About Eve,” and on June 14, they will record “The African Queen.” These are held in the Hillwood Recital Hall, where WCWP will record it. The plays will air at later dates. The remaining two plays are open to the public. For more information, visit www.portwashingtonplaytroupe.com

Steve Gruse is a senior Physical and Health Education major hailing from New Fairfield, Connecticut. Gruse is one of the key defenders for the men’s lacrosse team and has helped LIU Post jump to No. five overall in the Division II rankings.
Q: As a senior, how do your leadership skills pay off on the field?
A: I think it has a lot to do with experience, being through the program for the past four years and passing on that experience I’ve had to the younger guys.
Q: What would you say is the strongest part of your game?
A: I think my leadership and communication. My job on the crease is to direct the defense and tell everybody what’s going on, so I have to be a really good communicator.
Q: How has your team bonded and developed good chemistry?
A: It’s been great. We got a really talented group of young guys coming in. We have a lot of transfers and everybody has meshed together very well.
Q: How did last week’s victory over New York Institute of Technology boost your confidence moving forward?
A: It’s huge, not only because they’re a really good team, but also because they’re ranked higher than us. That’s our biggest rival, so any time we could get a win against them it’s huge.
Q: How do you feel your performance in the East Coast Conference tournament can potentially propel you guys to another run towards a National Championship?
A: We don’t know what the seeding’s are yet, but hopefully we’ll have a home game. We’re just looking to go into it like we did last year and come out by winning our last two games, then the conference championship and go on to the national playoffs from there.
Q: What brought you to LIU Post?
A: Academics was a part of what brought me here because of the Physical Education program, but the main pull was the lacrosse team and I wanted to go somewhere I was going to have a chance to win a national title. We’ve had a history of winning here, so I’m just hoping to get that ring before my time is done.
Q: What do you think is needed to win a national championship?
A: I think we just got to keep working hard, staying committed, have everybody keep showing up and doing their job by owning their role. As long as we do that, we all come together as a team and we have the talent to get it done. If we continue our hard work, we should be fine.
Q: As a defender, do you use your position as an advantage to see everything on the field?
A: I like being down there and being able to dictate what the other team has to do based on how we play them on defense. We’re just aggressive and go after our opponents.
Q: Have you always been a defenseman?
A: I’ve always played defense. I started playing lacrosse in third grade and never played anything else.
Q: If you were to play another position, what would it be?
A: I definitely wouldn’t be a goalie; those guys are crazy. I’m not standing in there and facing those shots. I’d probably be an attacker because you get to score the goals and it’s not as much running as midfield.
Q: Which athlete do you most admire?
A: My favorite athlete is Tom Zbikowski. Most people don’t know him, but he’s a safety in the NFL and he’s the definition of tough. He’s a hard- hitting safety and was a professional boxer; he’s just a tough guy.
Q: What is your plan after graduating from Post?
A: I plan on going through graduate school and I’m trying to get a graduate assistant job and start coaching. My goal is to coach lacrosse at the college level.

Coming off a doubleheader sweep of Pace University on Thursday, April 16, the softball team continued its winning ways against St. Thomas Aquinas College on Saturday, April 18, taking both games in enemy territory.
In the first game, both sides seemed to struggle at the dish, as neither team plated a run in the first three innings. In the top of the fourth, the Pioneers began their assault. With freshman outfielder Samantha Marrone on base, fellow freshman, catcher Emily DeVito, sent a shot over the fence to make it 2-0 in favor of LIU. In the next inning, junior catcher Paige Swantek doubled the Pioneer lead with a two-run homer of her own.
The Spartans managed to squeak a run across in the sixth inning, but it was answered with another RBI by Swantek. In the circle, sophomore pitcher Ashley Martin went seven innings while striking out six and only allowing one run. She improved to 12-2 on the season.
In the second game, the Pioneers continued their stellar hitting en route to their 8-3 victory. The Green and Gold totaled 13 base knocks to go along with eight runs. The Pioneers fired the first shot and got on the board in the second inning. The Spartans, however, responded with a run of their own in their half of the second inning to tie the game at one.
Swantek continued her spectacular day with another RBI single in the third inning while freshman infielder Jaclyn Hahn added to the Pioneer lead and made it 3-1 with yet another run scoring single. With the score tied in the top of the seventh, the Pioneers exploded for five runs. Senior catcher Aly Dzierzynski doubled in two runs while junior infielder Maria Palmeri, senior outfielder Samantha Miller, and DeVito all brought in single runs to cushion the lead and eventually make it 8-3.
Junior pitcher Isabella Corrao earned her sixth win in relief going 1.2 innings and striking out one. The Pioneers returned to the field again on Sunday, April. 19, and put their 10 game winning streak on the line when they faced off against the Knights from Queens College. They extended their streak to 11 with a 3-0 win in game one, but could not complete the doubleheader sweep as they fell in game two by the same score.
The Pioneers grabbed the lead in the second inning on a single by senior outfielder Catherine Havens which plated Palmeri. Already up 1-0, the Green and Gold added to their lead in the third inning with some help from the Knights defense. Because of the error in the field, both Swantek and Dzierzynski scored to make it 3-0 in favor of LIU. Ashley Martin dominated to earn her 13th win of the year. The sophomore struck out seven over a seven inning span and held the Knights to just two hits.
In game two, the Pioneer bats couldn’t seem to get going and the Knights won 3-0. Even though they only totaled four hits, the Knights still won the game thanks to great pitching from senior hurler Monique Roberge, who went seven innings and struck out eight.
Head Coach Jamie Apicella and his squad return to the field on Thursday, April 23, when they play host to the University of New Haven. First pitch is set for 3 p.m.

On Saturday, April 18, the women’s lacrosse team (12-2) clinched a playoff berth with a 13-5 victory over St. Thomas Aquinas College on Senior Day at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. The hosts locked up the No. one seed in the East Coast Conference playoff picture.
LIU Post closed out the opening half on seven straight goals to grab an 8-1 lead. Sophomore attacker Stefani Vagelatos started the streak off of a pass from fellow sophomore midfielder Cara Douglas who scored the following marker. After cruising to a dominant first period, the Green and Gold kept the wheels rolling and pulled away from the visitors, which boosts the Pioneer’s momentum heading into postseason action. Midfielder Jenna Pierro, and senior defenders Kali Maxwell and Emily Hanifan were all honored along with three other seniors in the pre-game ceremony.

Coming off a win against Bridgeport on Friday, April 17, led by sophomore pitcher Jake DeCarli, who tossed seven innings of shutout ball, the Pioneers looked to make it five straight wins and two in a row against the Purple Knights. In game one of the doubleheader on Saturday, April 18, the Pioneers suffered a gut-wrenching loss in extra innings by a score of 3-2.
The Pioneers got the scoring started in the second inning as junior infielder Matt Bowers connected for a base hit through the left side to score senior infielder Anthony Brunetti. The pitching held up strong for the Green and Gold as sophomore hurler James Long scattered his nine hits over eight innings and allowed just two runs. The Purple Knights evened up the score and took the lead in the seventh on back-to-back RBI singles.
Trailing by a run in the bottom of ninth inning, the Pioneers plated the tying run thanks to a throwing error by the Purple Knights. The Pioneer bats managed a measly six hits over the 12 inning contest and gave up 14 to the opposition. The big blow game in the top of the 12 inning as junior infielder Dave Egeland ripped a double to give his squad the 3-2 lead and the win.
In the second game, the Pioneers suffered a similar fate as they lost 10-0 and committed seven errors. For the Purple Knights, junior pitcher Rob Anderson remained undefeated on the season after earning his sixth win. The righty tossed seven innings while striking out nine and allowing just three baserunners all game.
On the eight scoring plays for the Purple Knights, seven of them came because of sloppy defense by the Pioneers and they were unearned as a result. Senior first baseman Tim Bickford smashed his first home run on the year in the win as well.
The Pioneers returned to action on Sunday, April 19, looking for a split in the four game series. They earned the victory thanks to their offense, which put up 11 runs and 15 hits.
After the Pioneers and Purple Knights traded runs in the first inning, the Pioneers jumped ahead 2-1 on an RBI single by junior outfielder John Bellock. In their half of the second inning, the Purple Knights came back to tie the game at two and take the lead thanks to a two RBI base knock from freshman infielder Jose Negron.
Trailing 4-2 heading into the seventh inning, the Pioneers responded and put a four spot on the board and led 6-4. Looking for some insurance runs, LIU added five runs their half of the eighth inning, essentially putting to bed any hopes of a Bridgeport comeback.
Sophomore outfielder Kenny Daley drove in five runs on the afternoon while graduate outfielder Vinny Iacono totaled three hits and two runs scored. Sophomore pitcher Dan Jagiello improved to 4-1 on the season, striking out eight over eight innings and giving up four runs.
Head Coach Mike Gaffney and his squad return to the diamond on Thursday, April 23, when the visit Franklin Pierce University. First pitch is set for 3 p.m.
