It might not feel like it’s spring time, but in the fashion world, it is officially spring season. The stores have switched their hats and boots for sunglasses and sandals. According to InStyle.com, this year’s spring trends are all about self-expression. LIU Post students spoke about what they are most excited to see in spring fashion.
One of the newest trends is statement chokers, just like back in the 90s. Whitney Arnow, a freshman fashion merchandising major, claims she is really excited to start wearing them this season. Arnow likes to keep up with everything that is going on in the fashion world and she believes that there are a lot of fun trends for this spring. “Denim is a huge trend right now, so I’ll be wearing a lot of that,” she said. “Also, lace is always a must.” For Arnow, spring is the bridge to summer so she is also looking forward to wearing flowy dresses and shorts.
Spring trends are not only available for women; more and more men are starting to pay attention to fashion trends. Jeniel Terrero, a senior broadcasting major, believes that spring is the perfect season to explore with your wardrobe and try out different trends, especially when it comes to street style. “My favorite trends this season are pastel clothing, from caps to sweatshirts, and sneakers,” Terrero said. “I’m also loving suede jackets which have been making a splash across many high end retail outlets.”
“Do-it-yourself” is also something Terrero sees as a trend this season, “loose ft jeans with DIY raw hems has become popular this season,” he said. “I love this trend because you can style it grunge or urban, and still make it look cool and laid back.”
The Student Body Boutique in Hillwood Commons has been preparing for this season as they decorate the shop with flowers and put emphasis on their spring items. Sandra Angilletta, a junior art therapy major who works at the boutique, said that as of right now they don’t have a new spring line. “It’s hard to order clothes now since it is the end of the semester and we are not open over the summer,” she said. “However we do have a large mix of clothes out right now that includes some spring essentials.”
The boutique has taken out more shorts and tank tops for the spring, Angilletta said. “One item that sells really well this season are the graphic tees,” she said. “We also have a basic soft hoodie that sold really quickly.” The Student Body Boutique will be open through May 6 and will close until the beginning of the fall semester.
As fashion is not revolutionary but evolutionary, it’s always changing. Therefore, it can become a bit overwhelming. This season seems to bring back old trends and incorporate them to the modern times. So, if you have an old choker from when you were little or if your mom still has her denim overalls, take them out and add them to your wardrobe.
Many more trends from the past are definitely making a comeback. Tying a shirt around your waist is a trend that was quite popular in the 90s that we are now seeing again. Using bandanas, whether it is in your hair or around your neck like a scarf, is another big trend adapted from past decades. Remember those round sunglasses from the 90s? Well, those are back too, so go looking for your old pair. Hopefully the weather will work in fashion’s favor so people can start to break out their spring outfits.

Land of the free, home of the brave; America, although great, is not perfect. A nation of immigrants, America was founded on the sole purpose of for allowing its citizens to exercise their God given right to pursue happiness without higher powers, in this case government, intervening. It’s a fantastic premise for government, one that’s done us extraordinarily well since our constitution was written in 1787 by our founding fathers.
Undoubtedly, America, like the rest of the world, has changed since late 18th century, however, we still recognize ourselves as; ‘one nation under God,’ where ‘all men [and women] are created equally’ so on and so forth. American’s take these words extremely serious, especially when it comes to issues like abortion and whether or not an unborn child has a right to life, or that the mother of that unborn has the right to choose what goes on inside of her body. The abortion dilemma eventually made its way to the highest court in the land in 1973, America’s Supreme Court, in the infamous case of Roe vs. Wade. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court found that it’s a woman’s ‘fundamental right’ to decide that she wants to terminate an existing pregnancy, and since then, there have been “more than 54.5 million abortions through 2011,” according to the National Right to life committee, via politcalfact.com.
Pro-choice advocates will argue that Roe vs. Wade was a landmark case, a triumph of some sorts, claiming that abortion has saved the lives of women who would have sought out for illegal abortions, and that the case advanced and preserved women’s rights. According to Elisabeth Ahman and Ibqal Shah, of the World Health Organization, an “estimated in 2004 that unsafe abortions cause 68,000 maternal deaths worldwide each year, many of those in developing countries where safe and legal abortion services are difficult to access.”
Pro-choice advocates argue that allowing abortions benefits women financially. According to a Sep. 2005 survey in the peerreviewed Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health asking women why they had an abortion found that 73 percent of respondents said they could not afford to have a baby, and 38 percent said giving birth would interfere with their education and career goals.
With all that said, abortions are not conducted solely for ‘financial’ reasons. Women of rape, incest, abuse or life of the mother are leading contributors to why women decide to have an abortion. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that “pregnancy-related deaths increased from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1987 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2011.” It gets worse. According to Andis Robeznieks, of Modernhealthcare.com, “U.S. women are more likely to die during childbirth than women in any other developed country, leading the U.S. to be ranked 33rd among 179 countries on the health and well-being of women and children.”
The statistics provided above help shine a different light on abortion, one that rarely gets recognition in regular abortion talk; hence, why I believe in the use of contraceptives. Why wouldn’t people who are sexually active, while not wanting to get pregnant use contraceptives? Not only would be banning contraceptives lead to the spread of disease and unwanted is pregnancies alike, but banning contraceptives, and ‘defunding’ organizations such as planned-parenthood is irrational. Again, why defund a government based program that’s designed not just to provide contraceptives, but to sexually educate both men and women on how to manage sexual activity and ultimately a pregnancy.
I titled this article ‘Abortion: A Wound that Still Stings America,’ because it does. Just two weeks ago Donald Trump was eviscerated by the press for his on women being ‘punished’ for having an abortion if abortion were to be outlawed in America. One can even make the argument that those comments lost Donald Trump the Wisconsin Primary. In light of the the controversy, I realized that the notion of being pro-life or pro-choice is ludicrous, all it does is divide America in two and that’s not right. Granted, I was raised a catholic, and ultimately pro-life, but over these past two weeks I realized that our main priority should be educating the American public on sex, pregnancy, the pros and cons of being sexually active and when the is ‘ideal time’ to be sexually active. Growing up in Queens, I’ve met many young people, both male and female, who were faced with pregnancy, and one thing I took from these people is that most of them weren’t irresponsible, but they were simply uneducated on the risks of being sexually active. As a closing statement, I would just like to say I do see both sides of the abortion debate, but as a nation, we should be focused on creating a solution to the issue of abortion, instead of being forced to pick a side.

Everyday people use drugs for a variety of reasons. Some may use prescription drugs, as prescribed by a doctor. Others may use drugs like marijuana recreationally, to enhance a good time or become more social with friends. For whatever reason people use drugs, they can be found within almost any community, including college campuses.
According to a 2015 University of Michigan news article, student drug use, especially marijuana use, has signifcantly increased since 1991. The percentage of daily marijuana users has increased from 3.5 percent in 2011 to 5.1 percent in 2013. Why the increase in usage? There could be many reasons. First, according to Pew Research Center, about 69 percent of Americans believe that alcohol is more harmful than marijuana. Second, the increase in daily marijuana use could be due to how easy it is to obtain. A 2009 Columbia University study found that 40 percent of teens could get marijuana within a day, with some even stating it is easier to get marijuana than cigarettes.
Although these statistics may seem quite troubling, the fact is that marijuana is safer than many of the other drugs that college students could be taking, like Xanax or cocaine. According to DoSomething. org, a website for young adults to inspire social change, about two in three college students are ofered prescription drugs by their senior year. According to addictionhope.com, cocaine is more popular at clubs and parties, and is used to increase euphoria and pleasure.
Rich Grillo, a junior psychology major, admits that the possibility of drugs on LIU Post’s campus scares him a bit. “Some people behave a little diferently when times are tough, especially around fnals week,” he said. “I could see how the stress could get to them and make them do something like that, but I would never do it myself,” he said. Grillo’s solution to the problem? “Make fnals easier,” he joked. “Honestly, I think [Post] does a pretty good job. I think they could be a little more open about it. Talk to people; see what help they need. I feel like they kind of forget that we’re people and also students,” he said.
Charlie Moerler, a senior broadcasting major, feels uncomfortable around students who do drugs. “It’s a little sketchy. I have no problem with the people who do [drugs] but I don’t like when people walk around campus and you can clearly smell that it’s on them,” he said. Regarding Xanax and Adderall usage during fnals week, Moerler thinks there is a line that shouldn’t be crossed. “I don’t have a problem with people [using], I have a problem when people overuse it,” he said. “I think it kind of gets in their head that fnals may be a little too difcult and that taking Adderall and other stuf like that is the only way to pass them, and get through them easier,” he said. Finally, Moerler believes that drug cases on campus should be carried out on an individual, caseby-case basis.
According to the LIU Post campus drug policy, “The Campus supports federal, state and local laws regarding illegal drugs, narcotics and other controlled substances. Possession or sale of such drugs is a violation of applicable laws and Campus policy.”
Associate Dean of Students, Adam Grohman stated that LIU Post supports all state and federal regulations related to the possession or personal use of illegal substances. Grohman stated that the Office of Community Standards assists students “in addressing matters as related to the use of illegal substances so that they can ensure success both in and out of the classroom environments.” The LIU website states that the “mission of the Office of Community standards is to promote student understanding of rights and responsibilities as individuals and as members of the Campus community.” This office is responsible for the handing down of punishments to students who violate the Code of Conduct.
According to the LIU Annual Security and Fire Safety report, which is publicly available on the LIU website, there were 193 drug and liquor arrests, on Post’s campus in 2014, the most recent year reported.

Ever wonder what it’s like to run your own fashion blog? Well, that’s exactly what Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior public relations major and fashion merchandising minor, is doing. Bray started the blog, themodwear.com, in October 2015, collaborating with her best friend Sara Sherman, who is a senior broadcasting major at the New School in New York City. Since then, things have really taken of.
Prior to starting the blog, Bray attended Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, to pursue a pre-med degree. She realized that was not her calling in life; fashion was. Bray decided to come back to Long Island, where she then spent two years at Suffolk County Community College, before transferring to LIU Post in 2015.
Bray worked for Sam Lehr Designs Ltd., a high end jewelry company, from 2010 to 2011 as a sales associate and said the experience she gained from that was wonderful. It introduced her to fashion merchandising, as she was able to help choose pieces for the store. Bray prepared jewelry for showcases, and even got to help prepare a showcase for the Oscars.
In 2014, Bray worked for Saks Fifth Avenue as a sales associate, while attending Sufolk County Community College, and said that was definitely a major push for her to go into the fashion industry. “It was a great experience. I definitely learned a lot about how to style people, and it definitely pushed me more to be in the fashion industry,” said Bray. However, her mom is her biggest fashion inspiration. She explained that she grew up alone with her mom “in a very female house, and we just loved clothes and to go shopping.”
What inspired her to then start her own blog? Bray explained that she saw a lot of blogs that showed clothes that are not wearable or affordable for most. She wanted to change that. Bray said, “My blog is very fashion forward, but is wearable clothing that people can relate to and actually afford and buy.” Bray and Sherman do post some designer pieces on the blog, but they will always make sure to mix in affordable pieces as well. Bray and Sherman include a description of the outfits under the pictures, making it easy for the readers to purchase the clothing being pictured and posted. They also post links to some of their favorite pieces on the blog.
Bray also started the blog to inspire girls. Bray wants girls to feel comfortable in what they are wearing, and to show it of. She explained that when you are wearing an outfit that makes you feel good, you have an added boost of confidence. “Put on that leather jacket, and just believe you can rock it, because you can,” she said. “I just want people to feel beautiful and inspired and ready to take on the world,” she added.
Bray said in the next few years she hopes to be able to collaborate with retailers and other fashion bloggers, and build her brand. She said this experience has helped her learn a lot about not only the fashion industry, but herself also. “It’s been a journey of excitement and fun, and it’s been a crazy ride, but I completely enjoy all of it,” said Bray.
Bray’s blog is at www.themodwear.com, and her Instagram ‘themodwear’.

It’s 11:17 a.m. on Thursday, April 7. Ladders, tape, and laser measurement tools huddle walls and floor at the Steinberg Museum of Art. “Everyone’s got a bit of OCD here,” said Carrie-Anne Gonzalez, one of the twelve graduate students preparing the “Nexus for 12” art show that runs from April 11 to May 6.
The dark-haired woman suddenly wanders of to pick up her camera, walks to various colleagues’ sets to blast a few clicks on the shutter, before getting back to her own installment.
A Bronx-native, Gonzalez moved to Central Islip in her teens. By then she was a vocalist who made results in auditions but struggled to ace the necessary exams to break through. Meanwhile her friends hit college, and she asked herself, “What can I do that I can survive on? That can bring food to the table?”
Joining the marines was not an option, her father insisted, and yet, at age 17, she found herself afloat on a Navy base ship. “We were history-recorders,” Gonzales said, explaining her role as a photographer in the public affairs department of the military. Passing the required exams, Gonzalez had to learn everything practical about the new medium. “I had never logged a film before,” she said.
Yet, during her five years of active duty, Gonzalez worked her way up to become a “star photographer,” the ones that were sent out to do the crucial tasks; jobs where you were only given one try. “The admiral coming to visit the ship, or capturing the fight deck operations, or dealing directly with the Captain and XO of the boat,” Gonzalez exemplified.
The days were split into two shifts, 12-15-hour days for some, and the same at nights for others. For Gonzalez, this meant early morning showers, and breakfast with her fellows at the “mess deck.” She then visited the photo lab, where she was a “worker bee,” jotting down what was written on the assignment board.
Gonzalez was the digital technician, in charge of all studio photography, maintenance and equipment for the public affairs office on board. “I was responsible for editing all of the images that came back, sending them of to various places, and making sure everything was catalogued,” she said.
The assignments didn’t only include photography, however, but varied among all respective public affairs workers: some photographed, while others were mixing chemistry; a third group painted or deepcleaned a space, and someone else was waxing the floor. In fact, “all of these things could be done by a single person in a day,” according to Gonzalez.
After two years of active duty, Gonzalez was sent to design school. Graduating with an associates degree in commercial design from Nassau Community College, and a bachelors of technology in visual communications from Farmingdale State University, her Navy experience had opened up a new life path within photography.
Gonzalez remained in the Navy reserves for an additional seven years. In the spring of 2014, she eventually decided to attend graduate school at LIU Post. As an MFA student in Studio Art, with a concentration in photography, Gonzalez aimed to explore her artistic repertoire—trying ceramics, painting, and printmaking—to ultimately see photography through a wider lens.
Although Gonzalez recollects arduous effort on a daily basis in the Navy, she believes the friendships among veterans made the time worthwhile. As a civilian, she also learned that nothing would ever be as meaningful as working on a warship, documenting and truly being responsible for other people’s lives. That’s why she started the project, “Today’s Veteran: Telling the Stories of Veterans,” which can be accessed at https://todaysveteran.squarespace.com/confg#/|/.
“This project is super important to me, because Vets often feel like they are alone…and we definitely are not,” she said.

Kendrick Lamar has come a long way since his rap career took of in 2010. Starting with a free mixtape called Overly Dedicated, Lamar, whose real name is Kendrick Lamar Duckworth, has quickly taken his place as one of the most prominent rappers in hip hop today. Less than a year after the rapper released his Grammy award-winning album “To Pimp a Butterfly,” Kendrick Lamar released a new project called “Untitled Unmastered.”
With his newest project, Kendrick seems to be following the newest trend of the surprise digital-first release, allowing his fans to listen to his work through various music subscription services including Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, and many more, before releasing the product for physical purchase. Release strategy aside, the musical content of the album is what matters most.
As with many Kendrick Lamar projects, the production is topnotch. This project is meant to be a collection of leftovers and unmastered material (hence the name) and in many ways it certainly feels that way. The production feels a lot more abstract than the traditional beats that rap fans are used to listening to. Throughout the project, Kendrick rhymes over jazz-influenced beats with horns and other brass instruments underneath his voice.
Sticking with the “untitled unmastered” theme, none of these tracks have traditional names. Instead, each song starts out with the word “untitled” followed by a number and a date. Unmastered most likely refers to the quality of the recording itself. “Mastering” is a term used when recording to make sure that each of the individual parts of the song blend well and evenly together. Not the case with this album. The recoding is a bit “dirty” sounding and intentionally the songs sometimes feel like they are meant to be taken one at a time. Kendrick Lamar still manages to tie together these “leftovers,” most notably by repeating certain phrases at the start or end of each track. For example, Kendrick exclaims “Pimp Pimp… Hooray!” in many tracks.
Uniqueness is something many Kendrick Lamar fans expect, and they will not be let down here. The way Kendrick raps, his flows, his cadence and his lyrics are all unique in their own way. Hip-hop fans expect the best out of Kendrick Lamar, especially since he calls himself “King Kendrick” at almost every opportunity where it may be relevant. While this album may be unique in many ways, it still is the same Kendrick Lamar many know and love – which isn’t a bad thing by any means. The ghetto, Christianity, money; these are all topics that Kendrick Lamar has spoken about before in great detail. This makes sense considering many of these cuts are old, so it is interesting to revisit certain times in the rapper’s life.
These leftover tracks that Kendrick has released are better than many other rappers’ best work, which makes Mr. Duckworth that more appealing. Even with material that Kendrick Lamar deems not worthy of making an album, this project is enjoyable from start to finish. This should absolutely hold Kendrick fans over until his next major release. Until then, these “leftovers” will suffice just fine.

From April 13-17, LIU Post will host the 24th annual Long Island Guitar Festival. The event will include concerts, master classes, workshops, a National High School Classical Guitar Competition and a performance by the Long Island Guitar Festival Guitar Orchestra over the course of five days.
“The festival offers concerts and master classes with some of the world’s greatest guitarists,” said James Erickson, assistant director of the festival and adjunct professor of music at LIU Post. “Music students gain valuable experience by working with these world class guitarist in a small intimate setting,” he added. Andrew York, Alan Hirsh, David Dtarobin and Ronn McFarlane will be performing at the festival, among others.
“The Long Island Guitar Festival is an annual Eclectic and International festival presented in conjunction with the Department of Music of the College of Arts, Communications & Design at LIU Post at Long Island University, said Harris Becker, director and founder of the festival. “The festival represents a commitment to reach out to the artistic community and continue an established tradition of excellence in guitar performance and pedagogy,” Becker said. “The initial intent of the festival was to show the process of becoming a masterful artist through educational workshops and master classes. The idea was to build a community through the interaction between students, amateurs, professionals and the general public.”
The National High School Classical Guitar Competition is open to all high school students in the United States. To enter the competition, students first have to upload a four to seven minute video of them playing on a guitar. If they move on to the semi-finals, students will play a piece of music from the Heitor Villa-Lobos Complete Works for Solo Guitar, Editions Max Eschig, in a private event in front of three judges. In the final round, three students will play in front of a different panel of judges in an April 16 event that is open to the public. The finalists will perform a Villa-Lobo piece as well as another piece that lasts four to seven minutes. Each finalist will have 15 minutes to perform, with the winners announced at the evening concert on April 16. The first place winner will receive $500 as well as a chance to perform at the 2017 Long Island Guitar Festival’s Emerging Artist Showcase. The second place student will receive $200.
Ensemble Shows are also part of the Long Island Guitar Festival. According to the LIU Post website, “As part of a continued commitment to excellence in guitar performance and pedagogy, throughout our history the Long Island Guitar Festival has featured high school guitar ensembles in our “Ensemble Showcases.” The purpose of these showcases has been to give young guitarists the opportunity to perform as well as take advantage of the learning opportunities the festival has to offer.” This year’s Ensembles Showcase Concert will include Bishop McGuinness High School Honors Guitar Ensemble from Kernersville, North Carolina; Brentwood High School Guitar Club from Brentwood, New York; Susan E. Wagner Guitar Ensemble from Staten Island, New York; and the POBJFK Guitar Nation from Planview-Old Bethpage, New York.
This year’s festival will feature performances by Ronn McFarlane, An Evening of New Music For Guitar and Others, Berta Rojas, Hilary Field, Andrew York, the Long Island Guitar Festival Orchestra, and David Starobin.
Tickets for the Long Island Guitar Festival can be purchased by mail, at the door or at the Tilles Center Box Office, which is open Monday through Saturday from 1-6 p.m. An all events pass ranges from $125- $150; concerts range from $10-$25; and master classes are $10.

Each year, senior film majors embark on their final thesis project. It could be a screenplay, a series of work as an editor, cinematographer or other role, but more often a short film. Despite their length, usually no more than twenty minutes, these shorts can require thousands of dollars to produce. The money is needed for casting, set design, sound mixing, scoring, catering, location fees, festival submissions and any other costs not mitigated by school equipment room aid. Many students, such as Errol Nicholson, who completed principal photography on his short “Amelia” in March, turn to crowd sourcing platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo to raise the much needed cash for completion.
“Amelia” is about the tough decisions and emotional trauma a pregnant couple face when they learn of complications that would mean either the mother or baby can survive birth. Nicholson forged the main characters, Jess and Greg, from romantic comedy tropes, making them relatable while also flipping that dynamic on its head.
“It’s about that cliche romantic comedy couple that you see in the movies,” explained Nicholson. “I just wanted to give that couple you see in those types of films a real-life situation. You always see romantic comedies where they never really face a realistic problem, it’s either a fashion montage or running to an airport to stop a loved one from getting on a fight. I wanted to see what it would be like to put them into a different situation.”
Nicholson described the experience of shooting the film, which was an enthusiastic endeavor for the cast and crew. “Everyone was so passionate about the project. You don’t always go on shoots where everyone seems to genuinely care about the story, so it was inspiring.” Much of the investment was spurred by a key part of Nicholson’s directing, when he asked Sara Raimandi, who plays Jess, to write a heartfelt letter to her fictional husband. He did not tell her what to write, instead allowing her to organically do it herself.
“I had [Raimondi] write it and I totally forgot that she had written it when we were about to shoot,” Nicholson said. “The morning of the shoot I called her up and asked if she could bring the note to set. She said sure, no problem. I went to her house and picked it up and she told me how she felt so sad writing it and that she started crying. She put it in a sealed envelope. I wanted to open it, I really did. But I figured it would be better if we had [the character’s husband] open it on camera so his reaction was genuine. We had him come in, he did the scene, opened the letter and he nailed it. All one take.”
Nicholson felt that posing a question to the audience, making them think deep upon seeing the film, would make it a compelling story to tell. “I want to have the audience leave asking themselves what they would do in these types of situations,” he explained. “How would they react? You watch a movie, like a James Bond film and the scenario is to save the girl or stop a nuclear missile. You’ll never experience that ever. So, with “Amelia” we shot for something that could happen, could be relatable. To have the audience question their own morals.”
Later, Nicholson recorded Raimondi reading the letter, another factor which has since inspired him to expand the story into a feature film, which she will be writing with him. Nicholson’s thesis advisor is Professor John Koshel. “We helped a lot with the writing process, and gave me ideas for little details in the script that made it better,” Nicholson said. The director attests to the collaborative and fluid process of shooting the film with his director of photography, Justin Espinal. “I would just have to look at him and he’d know what I was thinking,” Nicholson said.
The film has been almost fully shot, with a few pickup shots left. However, there is still much to be done in regards to post production, which is where the lion-share of funds raised will be allocated. “We’re going to submit it to festivals and [eventually] turn it into a feature. That is something to look forward to as well. If you like romantic comedies, you should donate. If you hate romantic comedies, you should donate.”
As for the director himself, ambitious plans are in store for the future after graduating in May. “The original plan was to start as an editor and work my way up to being a director,” Nicholson concluded. “But the way this short is going, the amount of feedback and excitement I’ve been getting, even people do not go to our school. We went to the city with [Raimondi], to a rehearsal for a play she was in. The other actors were asking about it. So I thought I should just go for directing. So thats the plan after college. I know it’s risky but I figured I’d go for it.”
The target is to raise $5000 dollars for “Amelia” in the next two weeks before the Kickstarter campaign expires. $2500 has already been raised as of this writing. For more information and to view the trailer visit ameliashortflm.com or facebook.som.ameliashortfilm.

Throughout the history of cinema, movies that have been destroyed by critics have often ended up making hundreds of millions of dollars due to the support from fans. With the popularity of websites like Rotten Tomatoes, it’s easy for audiences to find out how well received a movie is. On Rotten Tomatoes, film reviews are collected and the percentage of positive reviews are calculated. The resulting calculation lists the movie as either “Fresh,” having a high percent of positive reviews, or “Rotten,” having a low percent of positive reviews. One of the most popular movie franchises to gain support from fans, despite low review scores, is the “Transformers” franchise. Since coming to the big screen in 2007, the franchise has grossed almost $3.8 billion, even though the highest a movie in the series has placed on Rotten Tomatoes is 57 percent.
The recently released “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” is an example of this phenomenon and was designed to introduce audiences to DC’s cinematic universe, also known as DCEU. The DCEU is DC’s answer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where all DC characters exist in the same universe and interact with each other on screen. After 2013’s “Man of Steel” failed to establish the DCEU, it was up to “Batman v Superman” to create a believable world while satisfying the high expectations of the fans. Unfortunately, a week before its release, negative reviews started appearing online and things did not look good for the highly anticipated film.
Rotten Tomatoes collected some harsh reviews. “In the end, ‘Batman v Superman’ is a tiresome, ill-tempered film, and one too lazy even to earn its dismal outlook,” wrote Christopher Orr in the Atlantic. “The studio has, in the usual way, begged and bullied critics not to reveal plot points, and I wouldn’t dream of denying you the thrill of discovering just how overstuffed and preposterous a movie narrative can be,” wrote A.O. Scott, the film critic for the New York Times. According to Rotten Tomatoes, “Batman v Superman” has 90 fresh reviews and 211 rotten ones for a total score of 29 percent. Yet, despite this less than stellar score, the movie broke numerous records at the box office since it opened on March 25.
“Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” steamrolled past records, debuting at a gargantuan $170.1 million over Easter weekend despite being pilloried by critics, according to Brent Lang on variety.com. That ranks as the top opening weekend for a DC Comics film, the best March launch ever, and the sixth-biggest domestic opening weekend of all-time, he noted. It is clear that fans were not deterred by the negative reviews, as “Batman v Superman” has passed over $700 million at the box office.
Like many fans, I enjoyed “Batman v Superman” even though there were problems with the story and it spent too much time setting up for the future “Justice League” movies instead of focusing on the conflict between Batman and Superman. While most of my favorite movies are critically acclaimed, such as “The Dark Knight” and “The Lord of the Rings,” I do enjoy a lot of movies that were not looked on favorably by movie critics. One of the prime examples of this is “Van Helsing,” starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Even though it made almost $300 million worldwide, it scored a 23 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite this low score, I enjoy “Van Helsing” for what it is and can’t help but watch it whenever it is on TV.
“Batman v Superman” was never going to be the best superhero movie of the year and nor should it have been. It had to compete with several other superhero movies including “Deadpool,” which became the highest grossing R rated movie of all time; “Suicide Squad,” another DC movie that features characters such as the Joker and Harley Quinn; “XMen Apocalypse,” and two highly anticipated Marvel movies in “Doctor Strange” and “Captain America: Civil War.” It was never going to reach the heights of “The Dark Knight” trilogy or debut to critical acclaim. It’s a movie designed to please fans and to satisfy their dreams of finally seeing Batman and Superman fight on the big screen with the formation of the Justice League about to begin.

Rain postponed the softball team’s doubleheader against Dominican College for 24 hours and in those make-up games, the Pioneers suffered a 5-6 loss and a 1-1 tie from Brookville, N.Y.
The Pioneers fell behind the eight-ball early on and trailed Dominican College by three runs after the first inning. Looking to respond, the Pioneers cut the deficit to 3-2 thanks to a misplay in the field by Dominican College which plated sophomore outfielder Samantha Marrone and freshman infielder Leah Mele.
Two innings later, the Pioneers tied the game and took the lead. Senior designated hitter Paige Swantek drove in a run on an RBI double and later came around to score on a passed ball. The Chargers, down by a run in their final turn at-bat, scored two runs to take the lead and put the pressure on the Pioneers.
The Pioneers had a chance though to tie the game. In their half of the seventh inning, the Pioneers extended the match on a game-tying two-base hit from senior third baseman Maria Palmeri. The joy was short lived however, as the Chargers won the game on an RBI single in the thirteenth inning.
Freshman hurler Hannah Olshevski was tagged with the loss, going two innings, giving up five hits and one run. The starter for the game was junior Ashley Martin and she allowed five runs and struck out eight in 11 innings of work.
In the second game, the Pioneers and Chargers battled to a 1-1 tie after the match was called at the commencement of nine innings by umpires because of darkness.
The Pioneers lone run came in the sixth frame when Marrone brought home sophomore outfielder Jaclyn Hahn on a single. In the Chargers do-or-die seventh inning, they came back with a two-out RBI single tying the contest and sending it into extra innings.
Olshevski, who pitched earlier in the day, went all nine innings and allowed seven hits and one run while punching out a pair.
Due to a mix of rain and snow, the Pioneers Saturday, April 9 double-header against Pace University was cancelled and will not be made up. The Pioneers returned to the field on Sunday, April 10, for a double-dip against Southern New Hampshire University. The no. 25 ranked Penmen were handed two loses by the Green and Gold.
Led by the right arm of Martin, the Pioneers inked a ‘W’ in the first game. Martin went the full seven innings, allowing four hits, zero runs and fanning five batters. The Pioneer runs came curtesy of a fielder’s choice in the sixth inning which plated Mele and a single by Swantek that gave the Pioneers an insurance run they wouldn’t need.
The Pioneers continued their stellar play in the second game against the Penmen as well. This time, led by Olshevksi, (who too went the distance), the Pioneers earned a 6-4 victory.
Freshman first baseman Ashley Melendez provided half the offense for the Pioneers with a three-run shot to dead centerfield in the bottom of the second inning. Mele contributed with the stick as well, knocking in two runs on a single in the fourth inning to pad the Pioneer led at the time to 5-2.
The Penmen didn’t go down without a fight though, as they scored two runs in their last frame, but came up two runs shy. Olshevski struck out two in her seven innings and scattered seven hits while surrendering four runs; earning her twelfth victory of the season.
Head Coach Jamie Apicella and his team are back in action on Thursday, April 14, when they host Molloy College for a double-header. First-pitch is set for 3 p.m.

The baseball team suffered an 11-4 loss to Dowling College from Brookhaven, N.Y. on Friday, April 8, thanks to an eight run outburst by the Golden Lions in the eighth inning.
The Pioneers though, got the scoring started in the top half of the first inning. Freshman outfielder Dave Brehm drove in two runs on a two-out single that plated sophomore outfielder Rob Andreoli and senior first baseman David Groeneveld.
In response to the Pioneers two-run first inning, the Golden Lions cut the lead in half on an RBI single. The Pioneers extended their lead to 3-1 on a double from sophomore outfielder James Cohan.
After the Golden Lions trimmed the lead to 3-2, the Pioneers extended it once again. This time, junior catcher Thomas Asbaty came around to score on a single from freshman second baseman Sal Geraci.
For the first seven innings, junior pitcher Jake DeCarli held the Golden Lions in check; allowing just two runs. However, in the eighth inning, the Golden Lions awoke from their hibernation with a vengeance.
An eight run outburst highlighted by a two-run triple by Dowling second baseman Rob Costanzo was enough for the Golden Lions to hold on for the win. DeCarli’s fnal line was seven innings while allowing two earned runs on eight hits. The loss was tagged to the Pioneer bullpen, which was responsible for eight runs in the inning.
The Pioneers and Golden Lions were originally supposed to play a double-header on Saturday, April 9, but the weather did not cooperate. The two sides got reacquainted with one another again on Sunday, April 10, from the same location.
The Pioneers suffered another loss in the same fashion. Seven runs for the Golden Lions after the sixth inning sealed the deal.
For the Pioneers, Groeneveld tallied four hits and three RBIs while Brehm and Cohan each had multi-hit games. For the Golden Lions, five players had multi-hit games and four players had multi-RBI games, signifying a total team effort in the win over the Pioneers.
The 13-7 final dropped the Pioneers to 10-16 on the season and 2-8 in conference play. With the win, Dowling improved to 10-14 overall and 4-2 in conference play.
The Pioneers and head coach Mike Gaffney are back in action on Friday, April 15, when they host the University of Bridgeport. First-pitch from the LIU Post Baseball Field is set for 3:30 p.m.

In a season-high nine point effort, senior attackman Matty Beccaris led the no. 14 men’s lacrosse team (7-3) to a 19-5 victory against Post University (4-5) on Wednesday, April 6, in a non-conference clash at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
Senior attacker Ryan Slane and Beccaris teamed up for eight goals in the first half; clearing the lane for the Pioneers to leap out to a 14-2 lead at the intermission. In addition, graduate midfielder Jeremy Morgan and senior attacker Matt Bellando each found the back of the cage twice.
The Pioneers kicked of the latter stanza with remarkable defense from junior goalie Matthew Liantonio, who stopped the first three shots he faced. Bellando would eventually add to the lead; notching back-to-back markers in a 55-second span and extending the Pioneer lead to 16-2. Later pm, the Green and Gold scored three of the final five tallies of the contest.
Liantonio totaled a game-high seven saves in 45 minutes of action, as senior goaltender Adam Winne racked up six stops in the final 15 minutes.
Beccaris tied for the lead in goals with five and tacked on four assists to his stat-line. Slane finished right behind Beccaris, logging eight points (4 G, 4 A). Following Slane was Bellando, who netted five markers and added two helpers for a seven-point showing while junior midfielder Anthony Galeotafore had a field day, winning 20-of-26 (76.9 percent) faceoffs and scooping up 12 ground balls.
The Green and Gold returned to the field Saturday, April 9, in Old Westbury where they defeated fifth-ranked New York Institute of Technology (8-3) by a score of 15-5 in an East Coast Conference match-up at President’s Stadium.
Knotted up at two apiece in the first period, the Pioneers tallied six straight goals to claim a commanding 8-2 advantage. Sparking the run was senior midfielder Anthony Berardis, who scored two unassisted goals and was followed by Slane, who one-upped Berardis and netted three unassisted markers.
After leading 8-3 at the half, the Pioneers staged an impressive 6-0 spurt to put the game to bed. Morgan and Bellando each recorded two goals apiece during that stretch. Morgan had a field day, recording a seasonhigh four goals. A couple other Pioneers pithed in, including Berardis, who finished with three scores along with sophomore midfielder Dylan Harned, who cashed in with a goal and a helper.
Galeotafore continued his outstanding campaign winning 18-0f-21 draw controls. Between the pipes, Liantonio made seven saves for the Green and Gold while his counterpart, Alex Seltzer, collected five saves for the Bears.
Head Coach John Jez and his Pioneer squad look to improve to 5-1 in conference play as they prepare to commence a three-game home stand starting Saturday, April 16, versus ECC foe Dowling College at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Opening draw is set for noon.
