When the 2020 fall sports season got canceled, athletes and coaches alike did not know what the future held. This all changed on Feb.1, when the Northeast Conference(NEC) announced that fall & spring sports would be competing at the same time during spring season play. 
Every sport will be playing shortened seasons, consisting of only Conference matchups. Men’s Soccer will all look to capitalize on this new format. 
After the long wait, LIU Sharks men’s soccer competition will kick off on Monday, March. 8.
With all the back and forth regarding their fall season Men’s soccer head coach Michael Mordocco is grateful to get back onto the field. 
“We are just thankful that we are able to practice, compete and be around each other,” he said. 
Mordocco believes the schedule changes are a better fit for his players’ health and conditioning. 
“It actually enhances our approach given the month advance before our first match and gives us the opportunity to get our players fit without injury,” he said. “In the Normal fall season we would get three or four days before our first match.”
Mordocco is not concerned about the weather patterns the spring might hold as compared to the fall. 
“Soccer is played in all types of weather. Our young men will be ready to brave the elements of adversity,” he said. 
Coach Mordocco has high expectations for the team this spring. 
“We have one goal in mind, get back to the NEC championship match,” he said. “In order to do that we need to finish top two in the league.”
With a lot of key players from last year graduating, Mordocco is not concerned about the ability for first time starters and freshmen to step up and make a play a big role.
“We were grateful for our senior leadership from last season, they will be sincerely missed, but we feel that our returning squad have the same qualities and experience to take us forward,” he said. “We also feel that our 14 player recruiting class has a lot of talent to make a positive impact immediately. We look forward to integrating them into the group.”
Demetri Skoumbakis is the starting goalkeeper for the Sharks. Similarly to coach Mordocco, Skoumbakis is just excited to be back playing with his team. 
“It feels great to be back on and off the field. My teammates and I are working extra hard to make this season our best since COVID has certainly changed our mindset,” he said. “Now it is our chance to prove that we are capable of not only winning the NEC, but also compete in the NCAA.”
After having a great season last year splitting time with senior goalkeeper Matias Pesallaccia, Skoumabkis looked to improve on himself and maximize his role this season. 
“Although I am very pleased personally about last season, losing a final certainly hurts,” he said. This year I have been working to the best of my ability to improve my weaknesses and my game, so I can be ready to fill in a big role and surpass expectations.”
This is Mordocco’s third season coaching at LIU and second under the Sharks Division I program. Last year they went 6-2-1 in Conference matchups, good for second in the conference. They would defeat Bryant 4-0 in the first round of the NEC tournament, but fell short in penalty kicks to Fairleigh Dickinson University in the Championship game. 
This year, a short seven-game season for each team will determine the top two seeds that face off in the NEC championship on the weekend of April 16. The winner will move on into the NCAA tournament.

When the 2020 fall sports season got canceled, athletes and coaches alike did not know what the future held. This all changed on Feb.1, when the Northeast Conference(NEC) announced that fall & spring sports would be competing at the same time during spring season play. 
Every sport will be playing shortened seasons, consisting of only Conference matchups. Women’s Soccer will all look to capitalize on this new format. 
After the long wait, LIU Sharks women’s soccer competition will kick off on Tuesday March. 2.
Last year was a rough season for the Sharks as they went 4-6 in conference play, and 5-12-1 overall. 
Head Coach Collin Audley was brought in this offseason to take over the position and maximize the potential of this talented roster. Despite all the added circumstances this year has brought, Audley is committed to not letting it take away from his first season at LIU. 
“This year has brought challenges that none of us have been through before. To my knowledge there is not a playbook for leading an athletic program during a global pandemic,” he said. “I don’t think that being a young coach or an old coach will be the deciding factor in the success of the program. I fall back on fundamental performance and moral skills, that’s what I try to convey to the team as well.” 
Audley is certain his players are just as motivated to push through and compete at their best.  
“I must also say that the Student-Athletes I work with have been exceptional throughout,” he said. “They deserve a ton of credit for their relentless commitment to the program.”
Audley admits it has been very challenging to work with all the back and forth regarding their fall season. 
“I do think the uncertainties have been tough on the staff and the players because we are people who like working towards a target,” he said. “It’s been a moving or non-existent target for us for several months. Changing dates, new health protocols, strange training routines, unclear expectations, multiple quarantines, postponements, cancelations and a deadly virus make it so tough for all of us.” 
Audley claims everyone involved has done a great job at keeping aware of the circumstances, even when it felt like there was nothing available. 
“Good coaches know that the little details make a big impact. So, it can be a bit stressful when you don’t have any information at all,” he said. “Our administration and community leaders deserve a ton of credit because they have worked so hard to keep the student-athletes safe, communicate to staff, modifying education practices and finding ways to offer a competitive experience this spring.”
Audley claims the adjusted and shortened schedule will have no impact on game plan and outlook for the team this season. 
“I expect them to express themselves on the field and to enjoy playing the game. I expect them to build relationships and to back each other up. Watching them train the last couple of weeks, it’s clear that we are not going to make it easy for our opponents,” he said. “I expect lots of challenges and some great moments. It should be really fun.”
Audley is not concerned about what the spring weather patterns or anything else might hold as compared to the fall. 
“We will play any time of day, home or away, any day of the week. We are not a team or group of people who expect everything to be perfect,” he said. “We know that we will need to be adaptable in the way we play.”
Coach Audley has high expectations for the Sharks on the field this season. 
If you see their body language, you can tell the team is excited to play. The opportunity to grow individually and collectively, compete for an NEC League Title, Win the NEC Tournament and beat teams in the NCAA tournament are all still on the table,” he said. “The sharks want to eat.”
Kayla DeTreux is the starting goalkeeper for the Sharks. She was extremely excited to find out the season would be official this spring, after all the waiting this past fall. 
“It’s an amazing feeling knowing that we’re getting back into NEC games this year.  Hearing about the postponement of our Fall Season left us all devastated, let alone not knowing if it was definitely going to be rescheduled for the Spring,” she said. “When we were finally told that we would be allowed to play this season, whether it was a full schedule or only conference games, it was the best news we had received since the start of the pandemic.”
DeTreux is not treating this season any differently or lightly due to the outlook of the schedule. 
“Even though the season has been shortened as a result of the pandemic, myself as well as my teammates are not treating it any differently.  If anything, we’re taking this more seriously than ever,” she said. “We want to show both the NEC and the LIU Athletic Department that they made the right decision by allowing us a season this year.”
DeTreux is expecting nothing but greatness from herself and her team this year. 
“Our intentions for this season are to play our absolute best, work the hardest we ever have before, and of course win,” she said. “With regards to my game, I’m looking to protect the net the best that I can and hopefully help lead my team through a successful season.”
Amanda Hjelle is a midfielder and captain of the Sharks. Hjelle is very motivated to make the most of this season after all the situations that held them back.
“I’m so excited to start off this season in just a few weeks. It has been over a year since we played a competitive game so there is nothing that I look forward to more right now, and I know that the rest of the team feel exactly the same way,” she said. 
As one of the top midfielders, Hjelle looks to lead the team the best she can on both sides of the ball. 
“In my position, it’s important that I keep the team together and make sure that we work as a unit. I’ll do my best to back up our goalkeepers and defenders but also to join the attack,” she said. “As captain, I also aspire to lead by example by always working hard in both practice and games as well as encouraging my teammates both on and off the field.”

On Feb. 10, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced all professional sporting events could bring back fans in attendance. Any stadium or arena approved by the NY Department of Health could have an attendance of up to 10 percent capacity. Every individual must have a negative test within 72 hours of the event and follow all proper mask and social distancing guidelines. 
The cross-town rivals Knicks and Nets of the NBA were the first teams to host fans on Tuesday, Feb. 23. This was the first time a live game had fans in attendance since St.John’s basketball played on March.12, 2020, a game that was ultimately canceled at halftime due to the growing coronavirus concerns. 
The Knicks hosted the Golden State Warriors at Madison Square Garden. The Nets would play the Sacramento Kings at Barclays Center. MSG is hosting the max 2000 people for their 20,000 seat capacity, while the Barclays Center limits their attendance to just 300 per game. On Feb.26, three days after the Knicks squared up their first game back with fans, the Rangers played their next home game against the Boston Bruins at MSG with the same crowd size of two thousand. 
Eddie McQuade is a senior sports management major who has been a Knicks and Rangers his whole life and currently works security at Madison Square Garden. McQuade thinks this is a huge milestone for sports fans and New Yorkers overall.
“To have fans back in the stadium means a lot to us sports fans. It’s definitely a step in the right direction in terms of trying to make life what it was prior to the shutdown,” he said. “It also is vital to the players as they feed off of the energy of the crowd, and they would probably tell you it was just as weird not having fans in the stands.”
McQuade is extremely excited to have the ability to see his favorite teams play in person again. 
“Watching games in person are a lot different than being on tv, and if you have never been to a hockey game, I’d recommend seeing a Rangers game, especially at full capacity,” he said. 
McQuade believes despite the limited number of fans, you can still sense the massive energy of the fans.
“While two thousand fans max is obviously not a lot, you still feel the atmosphere of MSG. You can feel the Knicks crowd when they’re chatting ‘DEFENSE’ or when the Rangers score a goal, and they’re singing the goal song,” he said. “It may not be as loud as a full house, but you still notice the fans have been waiting for this.” 
McQuade claims due to the small crowd size, there are some circumstances that happen that never could at full size. 
“In between periods/halftime when fans go get food or whatever they do in between play, you can hear a pin drop bc it gets that quiet, and sometimes you’ll hear the players talking on the court or ice,” he said. 
Mcquade says there have been lots of changes and rules fans must follow. 
“You can’t use cash anywhere nor even use the ATM. You also have to go to your seat to eat your food, and if you are to buy a beer in the building, it isn’t served in cups anymore,” he said. “A lot of stores have closed too, so many people won’t go shopping at once.”
McQuade says there have been many changes to the structure around seating for everyone. 
“All tickets for the games are sold in either groups of two or four, and they must be bought online. No print-out tickets are being accepted at this moment, and there are hand sanitizer stations almost everywhere you turn. The ticket windows are all closed, and we as staff also have to encore social distancing,” he said. “It’s hard on us too because in the cafeteria there used to be tables that seat four per table. Now you have to sit at tables by yourselves.”
McQuade says his job is still the same and has all the same foundations. 
“Our jobs are still the same for the most part. Our number one priority is to make sure everyone is safe. Many rows are closed, so that way no fans are within six feet of each, and most seats are at the end of the aisles,” he said. “The biggest change is making sure people wear their masks at all times unless they’re eating or drinking. Obviously, not everyone listens to that rule, but when they don’t, we politely ask them to put their mask back on.”
McQuade claims the biggest change is around the process of items that would otherwise need to be handled differently. 
“No book bags are allowed in the building anymore, and we don’t hold onto items anymore. Pre lockdown if you had something that you couldn’t be brought to your seat, we had a place to hold onto it for you. However, that’s now a thing of the past because we don’t know where the item is coming from and whose hands have been on it,” he said. “So, for example, if you bring a pocket knife in the building, you either throw it out or return it to your vehicle. No questions asked.”
The Islanders are the only other NY sports team to have held fans in attendance. Since their first home game under the new guidelines on Feb. 25, they have been hosting roughly 1,400 people per game at Nassau Coliseum. 
Once the MLB starts regular-season games, the Yankees will allow up to 5,500 at Yankee Stadium. The Mets will have a capacity of 4,500 at Citi Field.

On Feb. 12, Netflix released the third and final chapter of the hit movie series “To All the Boys” starring Lana Condor and Noah Centineo. 
This series follows the unpredictable life of a young Asian American high schooler, Lara Jean Song Covey. Lara Jean is a hopeless romantic with three sisters, a supportive father, an edgy best friend and a huge secret. She writes love letters to express her feelings and get them off her chest. When Lara Jean’s crafty little sister, Kitty, exposes her most confidential hobby and sends the love letters to the addressed crushes of Laura Jean’s past. 
In this latest installment of “To All the Boys,” viewers see the sequential ending to Lara Jean and her most prized crush of the past, Peter Kavinsky. Here viewers see the outcome from the first two “To All the Boys” and watch Lara Jean and Peter navigate their way through the bittersweet endings of high school, the college selection process and young love. Within the first ten minutes of the movie, we are introduced to LJ’s choice of a lifetime;  go to a west coast college to please her first love or pursue the east coast university she fell in love with at first sight. 
In this final chapter, “To All the Boys: Always and Forever,” many viewers went in with excited but skeptical attitudes. It seemed as though all possible story outcomes were exhausted in the first two movies, but viewers were pleasantly surprised.
“My initial reaction to this movie was that it was just another cheesy romance movie, but in the end, I’d have to say that the third movie definitely brought everything together. It’s even my favorite of the three because of how realistic and relatable it was,” senior elementary and special education major Katie Ginty said.
Many students agreed with Ginty about the realistic and relatable tone this final chapter added to the “To All the Boys” three-part movie franchise. Throughout the series viewers see Lara Jean make her way through confusing and heartbreaking times, but in this final movie it seems the cliched and unrealistic situations originally presented to audiences are put to a halt. 
“I appreciated that they didn’t use love triangles as a crutch in this one,” sophomore broadcasting major Kerry Cullen said. “Though one might counter that they did use NYU as part of a symbolic love triangle with Lara Jean and Peter Kavinsky. I think ‘Always and Forever’ was the most realistic of the three films because it didn’t feature more out of touch love triangles.” Cullen continued. 
In this film franchise, another appreciated factor for viewers is the diversity within the characters and casting; specifically Lara Jean played by Lana Condor. Condor tackles this very similar rom-com situation as a culturally different lead actress in an industry filled with archaic stereotypes. She has brought Lara Jean to life while shedding light on the industry’s typecast. 
In an interview with US Weekly, Condor said 
 “It is so special to me that Lara Jean, a character of Korean descent, finally got a ‘Cinderella moment’.” 
It’s evident that Hollywood has a long way to go, but it’s worth mentioning that “To All The Boys” is one of several films in recent years to give a character of Asian heritage a leading romantic comedy role. 
In its opening week on Netflix, “To All the Boys: Always and Forever” has broken boundaries yet again by remaining on Netflix’s Top 10 list for a consecutive 14 days since its release date on Feb. 12. The film franchise has built a fan base over the years that anticipate a new love story of Lara Jean Song Covey around Valentines Day every year. As the franchise’s final chapter, “Always and Forever” had many engaging conflicts and plot twists for Lara Jean. In the end, viewers were given the comforting end they all hoped for. 
“It was a long movie with a lot going on, but right when you think it’s over, something new happens,” senior physical and health education major Cassie Zangerle said. “I really enjoyed ‘Always and Forever’ because, in my opinion, this is way more than just a love story. ‘To All the Boys’ is about family and friends who are always there for each other through thick and thin. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a feel-good, ‘girls supporting girls.’ You will laugh, you will cry and you will want to watch it again.”
Throughout its three-part saga, “To All the Boys” has brought viewers on the whirlwind adventures of the life of high school student Lara Jean Song Covey; and in this final installment, viewers are taken on one last ride with LJ. Stream ‘To All the Boys: Always and Forever’ on Netflix now, to join Lara Jean and her crazy life of family, friends and love.

On Feb. 11, Taylor Swift announced she was re-recording her 2008 album “Fearless”, only this time it will be retitled “Fearless (Taylor’s Version).” The release began with her re-recorded version of “Love Story,” which dropped that night.
This announcement had Swift fans excited and surprised. However, Swift isn’t doing this project just for her fans but also for herself as an artist. Similar to most artists, Swift signed with a record label at the start of her successful career. Swift signed with Scooter Braun the owner of Big Machine Label Group who worked with her when she recorded her first albums. These recordings, referred to as her masters, were owned by Big Machine Label Group, not Swift herself.
Swift owns the publishing rights to her songs, which includes the lyrics and melodies; however, she does not own the master’s rights. Without the master’s rights, Swift does not completely own her own music. Throughout her career, Swift’s masters have been sold multiple times without her knowledge. 
Scooter Braun, the owner of Big Machine Label Group, and chairman of Ithaca Labels is the current holder of Swift’s masters for her first six albums. For years Swift and Braun have been in a legal battle over the rights to her music. He refuses to sell them to her, only offering for her to come and “earn” the albums back one at a time. Braun offered one of Swift’s old albums back to her for every new record she made with Big Machine Label Group. 
Swift has hinted at re-recording her older music for a while now, but the Feb. 11 announcement was the first official word the Swift fandom had about the matter. 
When she re-records her music, Swift will own the publishing, and master’s rights to the songs. All profits earned from the new songs will go directly to her. This will also decrease the value of the original masters, taking money away from the people holding them. 
“Artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one that really *knows* that body of work,” Swift said in an Instagram statement announcing the release. 
Swift also revealed the release will feature 26 songs, including six unreleased tracks she wrote from ages 16-18. In a series of seemingly random capital letters, Swift hinted at the date the re-recordings will be released in full, spelling out “APRIL NINTH”.
Students on campus are also excited about Swift’s Announcement. 
“I was so excited I immediately texted all of my friends, we screamed about it,” junior musical theatre major Ellie Lauthner said. 
Lauthner is a longtime Swift fan. She reminisced on how Swift’s song “Teardrops On My Guitar” was the first song she actively recognized on the radio. Since Swift’s release, Lauthner has listened to both “Love Story” and “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)”. 
“I prefer the version that pays Taylor and not some random guy who felt the need to exploit a vulnerable young woman,” Lauthner said. She believes all artists should own their own music.
Lauthner is looking forward to the release of “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)”. “I’m really excited for “Fifteen”, for her perspective on the song as a 31-year-old woman,” Lauthner said. 
Other students on campus are listening to “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” for the first time. 
“When I first heard the song, I didn’t realize it was the version from this year. It’s nice to hear her current voice on this iconic song,” junior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said. 
Though Sottung doesn’t keep up with Swift as often as Lauthner she was happy about her new release.“Good for her that she’s finally getting justice,” Sottung Said. 
Much like Sottung, recent college graduate Charlotte Beshers is also a fan of Swift’s music but doesn’t keep up with her too much. “I’m glad there’s a movement starting that is bringing the struggles artist’s go through to light,” Beshers said. 
Beshers supports Swift in her efforts to own all of her music and hopes more people hear about why she is re-recording, so they will exclusively listen to the new versions. 
“The recording of instrumentals definitely pulled the song together and gave me a wonderful nostalgic feeling of being back in middle school and wishing I was in a fairytale,” Beshers said. Swift’s music played throughout Besher’s upbringing. “I’m excited to feel nostalgic on top of being able to support her during this time,” Beshers said.
All three students are excited to support Swift in this new venture, and by listening exclusively to Taylor’s version of her old songs, they are doing just that.
On just the first day of its release, “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” earned 5.8 million streams. Swift’s mission is off to a successful start, and her fans are ready to keep up that attitude all the way until April 9.

Seven theatre students portrayed modern-day versions of Shakespearean characters from Feb. 26 to the 28. The show could be streamed online, and followed the isolation and emotions that many college students have faced during the pandemic
“The show is basically about the pandemic and our lives as students in current times, but told with Shakespeare texts,” sophomore musical theatre major BrayLynn Willis said. “Our director, Steele [Whitney] studied a lot of monologues and sonnets and picked ones that reflected how it feels to be alive right now. He pieced together a seven-actor show about isolation and how it feels to be our age in 2021.”
The rehearsals and performances were allowed to be in-person due to the small cast size. 
“We rehearsed in person because we were learning an entirely new training for this show,” Willis said. “We had to be together in order to have a cohesive energy and connection in the ensemble. We still had some people on Zoom at certain times, who observed the rehearsals and [that] was also interesting and beneficial to the process. But Zoom would not have lent itself well to create the show [for the entire cast]. We were grateful to have a small ensemble that could work together with our masks on and windows open.”
While most of the cast was in-person for all of the rehearsals, sophomore musical theatre major Hannah Winston was exposed to COVID-19, and had to isolate herself until she tested negative twice. This was useful for Winston because her character spent the majority of the show in isolation as well.
“I had a different experience virtually because I had only about two weeks of training for the show before I went into quarantine on campus,” Winston said. “I really felt a real sense of isolation. It gave me a better understanding of how to portray these two pieces. Having everything, and then losing everything. I was taken away from society, and I wanted to get back into it.”
Some of the cast members were weary about performing Shakespeare for the first time.
“I was terrified of Shakespeare because I have never actually performed his work,” Winston said. “I have always read aloud because my teachers loved having the theatre kids read [in high school]. But, I was scared to take on this massive amount of text [by memory]. Now, I feel so much more confident about understanding his text and being able to act it out.”
Willis felt excited to take part in one of her favorite authors’ work.
“I am a fan of Shakespeare to begin with, but what’s so interesting about it is that you’re able to change the meaning of texts based on how you speak it,” she said. “We were able to refresh and recontextualize old stories to mean something about our lives today. I find that fascinating.”
The cast felt overwhelmingly happy to see themselves on their computer or television screens after rehearsing and practicing their parts for a month.

“I was so proud of all of the work our whole cast and all involved,” Willis said. “It was beautiful, thanks to our cinematographer and director. I think it was more than I could imagine it to be.”
Since theater is pre-recorded and shown virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, the actors were able to assess their performances live.
“It’s useful to be able to look back on your performances, because if you’re on stage, you never know what you look like from the audience’s view,” Willis said. “It’s also so different to act from a camera from your own energy then from an audience that is giving you the energy.”

On Friday, Feb. 26 Promise hosted the Black on Broadway Q&A session over zoom. Four high profile theatre actors and LIU almuni, Diamond White, John Eric Parker, Morgan Siobhan Green, and Rhamell Burke-Missouri. discussed their experiences not only with LIU’s theatre program but their general experiences of being a Black theatre actor after graduating from Post. 
One question asked was about what kind of lessons they learned from campus and how they applied those lessons to their theatre work after graduating. A common theme from the answers given was that they all developed a good work ethic. Through her hard work and dedication to the arts, Siobhan Green commented saying that she felt like she could fully advocate for herself as a performer. White agreed, responding that “you may not be the most talented person in the room but there’s no reason to not be hard working.” 
Another common theme was the importance of being able to fully express themselves through their work. Parker told the audience a story about how he felt like he was about to give in but a friend reminded him that there’s only one person in the world like him and that he needs to make the people around him see that. “You have to walk into a room and think ‘you need me and this is why’,’” he said.
Another question asked was about their vision of a diverse and ideal theatre industry. The entire group expressed generally the same idea of having the theatre industry not only be a safe space for people to fully express themselves but also to have a more diverse array of stories be told. It was mentioned by White that one shouldn’t have to worry about being a “diversity hire” and one’s role in a production should be based on their work. Burke-Missouri has expressed the desire of having “characters of all shapes and sizes” and “people being able to be themselves in all aspects.” Siobhan Green expresses similar desires adding on to that by saying that she wants to “debunk the myth that a certain education is required to play a certain role.” And in terms of stories being told, Parker said that we “can we have an industry where a piece can exist without saying ‘oh great another black trauma story.’”

Facebook has been under scrutiny in the media due to allegations that the company is suppressing freedom of speech, invading people’s privacy, and exercising undue influence in national elections. 
In April 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckergerg appeared before Congress to answer questions about his company’s mishandling of data, allowing so-called fake news to be disseminated on his platform, and suppression of unconventional opinions. 
In 2020, Zuckerberg gave a speech in Utah saying, “At some point, Facebook must stand up for free speech.” 
Zuckerberg’s words, however, have not held up in light of recent events. 
According to BBC News, Facebook users in Australia have been blocked from viewing and sharing local and international news, while local publishers have been banned from sharing or posting any link on their pages. 
Facebook’s actions came following a newly proposed Australian law that seeks to curb obscene profits amassed by big tech companies, as over $80 of every $100 spent on digital advertising is spent on Google and Facebook in Australia, posing a threat to smaller publishers. 
Facebook’s Australian managing director William Easton, however, says that the law punishes the company “for content it didn’t take or ask for” because Facebook has little control over which individuals decide to use its platform. 
The tech-giant’s latest move has been criticized by many Australian officials, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who called Facebook’s actions a plot to “unfriend Australia,” and that the company was “as arrogant as they were disappointing.” 
Almost 17 million Australians view Facebook each month, making it the number one social media platform for news in the country. 
Some have expressed concerns that conspiracy theories and half-truths may take the place of objective reporting due to the newly created information vacuum. 
These concerns prove especially valid in light of an increasing need for accurate information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Human Rights Watch’s Australian director Elaine Pearson called Facebook’s latest move a “dangerous turn of events.”
In the face of heavy criticism, however, Facebook has said that it will continue to remove harmful misinformation, provide users with reliable health advice, and work with fact-checkers to prevent inaccurate information from spreading across its platforms. 
Several students have expressed dismay and shock at Facebook’s actions. 
“I just can’t believe what’s going on,” freshman journalism major John Carter said. “One of the biggest news platforms in the world is banning an entire country from seeing the news. Talk about irony.” 
“I’m not surprised they Facebook is doing this,” sophomore journalism major Clara Lopez said. “They’ve censored things they don’t like and tracked your every move like a hawk. These guys really freak me out.” 
“I bet they’re going to ban people from talking soon, too,” junior journalism major Shawn Darcy said. “I love how all these big tech companies like Facebook say they’re ‘for the people’ and ‘encourage free expression’ when everyone knows they don’t. It’s a joke.” 
Though Facebook’s measures may seem tyrannical to many Australians, some remain hopeful that the company’s decision is only temporary. “I use Facebook to keep in touch with many people I do business with,” Leonardo Smith, a partner at the Australian law firm Smith, Ryan, and Harding LLP, said in an interview with BBC. “I hope Facebook allows people to communicate freely again soon.”

 The Texas storm, unofficially referred to as “Winter Storm Uri”,hit the Lone Star State causing power and water outages for millions of Texans on Feb. 13. 
Over the course of the past few weeks, news coverage has shown what life is like for Texans that have been affected by the recent snow/ice storm. During this time, the nation has been exposed to the severe weather conditions that have Texas in a disarray. Over 2 million Texas residents have been affected by the sudden severe winter weather. 
“This has all been very unexpected for Texans,” senior musical theatre major and Texas resident Lee Metaxa said. “One word I’d have to use to describe the current conditions down here are overwhelming- because no one down here is used to or even knows how to deal with this kind of weather. Seeing the content on social media, especially from friends and family, of them struggling through this is tragic. It’s all just a complete disaster.” 
When the news of this aggressive winter storm hit the media, the masses were extremely worried for Texans. 
“Before this awful weather hit, I was here at school. Once I saw the weather report the night before, I knew things were going to get bad quickly so I booked the first flight out that next morning before the snow even started,” sophomore music entrepreneurship, technology and production major Scoggins said. “And even though it’s been snowing a lot in New York recently, I’d have to say that it’s absolutely nothing compared to what’s going on in Texas; because nobody down here really knows how to deal with it, everything is just worse. To put things into perspective, the unplowed areas on campus are way better than the roads in Texas. They don’t drop salt or sand on the roads, they just wait for it to melt and then it’s even worse because it becomes ice and even more dangerous.” 
Along with the dangerous road conditions that Texans have been undergoing, another major issue is the widespread loss of water and power across the state; even in the areas that haven’t been directly hit. Over the course of the past few weeks, Texans have been forced to live through freezing conditions with no water or power. 
“After the storm hit, many of my family and friends were without water and electricity for so long that we had to adjust, accommodate and even learn how to live without it,” Scoggins said. “When I went home this past weekend, I had to go two houses over just to take a shower for a family birthday party.” 
Metaxa also commented on the detrimental loss of water and power in Texas due to Winter Storm Uri.
 “I saw a post from a family friend literally living out of their car, with their two children, just to charge their phones and get some heat,” Metaxa said. “They had no heat, no power, and no water all due to the freezing cold conditions. It’s been extremely hard and scary for me to see people I know and love go through that.” 

Millions of Americans are still living through these conditions, and the Texas government has limited-to-no resources to help them because of Uri’s unexpected element of surprise. 
“My take away from this whole situation would have to be that this is all just more proof that climate change is real,” Metaxa said. “For the sake of people’s lives, we need to acknowledge this as something that’s actually happening. For future reference we need to be more aware so that we can combat these situations before they happen again, even in different ways. Overall, we must take all this seriously, this is not a joke. There is something we can all do within all of our communities so this hopefully won’t happen again; or at least we’ll be more prepared for it.”

 Tessica Brown posted a video on TikTok that explained how she ran out of Got 2 B hairspray, and instead used Gorilla Glue adhesive spray because she believed it would have the same effect. The video was posted on Feb. 3, and went viral.
The Gorilla Glue stuck to Brown’s hair for over a month, and she claims that she had tried to wash her hair over 30 times, even showing her followers that shampoo would not remove the glue in a video.  After weeks of trying different solutions recommended by the internet, a doctor reached out to Brown. Dr. Obeng flew Brown out to California for glue-removal surgery for free. Obeng used medical grade adhesive remover, aloe vera, olive oil and acetone to break down the polyurethane, which is the main ingredient in Gorilla Glue. Brown had set up a Gofundme page, where she asked for $1,500 to help seek the original medical attention she needed, but she quickly received over $20,000 from donors as the video of her showing the glue in her hair reached millions of people.
After the Gofundme surpassed its $1,500 goal, and Brown’sstory began getting lost in translation throughout the month, people began to question if getting media fame and money was the plan from the beginning.
 Junior nursing major Jahaila Harly disagrees with Brown’s mishpa being planned
 “I don’t think she did it on purpose because I don’t think a woman more specifically a Black woman would ruin their hair for short lived internet fame,” Harly said. “She also ended up giving the money away.” 
Harly doesn’t think Tessica knew the implications of gorilla glue or the power of the internet.
 “The people on the internet are really the ones who made the entire situation blow up, but then again, the internet is known for making people famous for their stupidity.” 
Students like senior biology major Rondino Rameau have mixed feelings about Brown’s intentions.
“I honestly think she genuinely didn’t know and was trying to maybe be funny a bit in her video,” he said. “Then again, I can’t really tell what was going on since usually with viral videos. It’s always the same story of ‘I don’t know why this blew up’.”
Rameau doesn’t think that Tessica should’ve gotten donations.
“I don’t really think she should’ve received it, because she did do it to herself, and doesn’t the bottle say not [to] use[it] on the skin or hair?” 
Both Rameau and Harly agree that it was a  relief to see Brown get the glue removed from her hair.
 “I didn’t expect the result to look undamaged, I am happy for her though I’m sure a month with gorilla glue on your scalp is painful,” Harly said.
