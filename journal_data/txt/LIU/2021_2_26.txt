Grab your blue and gold spirit gear, sharks. Promise has made efforts to improve Tradition Tuesdays. 
In past years, students were encouraged to put on their school spirit items and make their way to the campus concierge desk, where they would be given free water bottles, pencils and shirts. This year, free food, and exclusive clothing items are up for grabs.
“Last year they gave away all the same stuff every week, so it wasn’t as fun so [my friends and I] stopped going,” sophomore accounting major Juliana Deleon said. 
Deleon was among the students wearing shark attire last Tuesday, so she was able to grab a cupcake from Promise officials. 
“I didn’t know they were doing it this year,” Deleon said. 
She hasn’t seen any advertising for the event, but was pleasantly surprised when offered a cupcake on the last Tradition Tuesday. 
“I think [Tradition Tuesdays] are better, but I don’t think anybody knows about it,” Deleon said. 
Now that Deleon knows about Tradition Tuesdays, she will gladly be returning in her shark gear next week. Deleon is a student athlete so she has a surplus of spirit gear.
Other students are running into the problem of not having any shark attire. 
“I’ve been trying to get more shark stuff because all of the stuff I have is all Pioneer stuff,” sophomore English major Clare Coursey said. She is glad that Shark Nation has opened back up, but is still working on collecting LIU gear. 
“Maybe if they gave students free gear at least one day a week we could use it afterwards,” junior musical theatre major Sophie Quiñonessaid. She says that she would participate in Tradition Tuesdays if she had more shark gear, but she too has a closet full of Pioneer shirts and sweatshirts. 
Promise is making an effort to get the improvements publicized. 
“We do have stuff on our Instagram story, and flyers in all of the resident halls and buildings on campus,” success coach Tracy Reardonsaid. Reardon was managing the cupcake table for Tradition Tuesday on Feb. 16, spotting students in campus gear and offering them one. 
“Next week we have sweatpants, so we’re hoping that kind of like diversifying the kind of giveaways will make students choose which ones they want to go to,” Reardon said.
Reardon also mentioned that other clothing items that students cannot find in the bookstore or Shark Nation, and items such as reusable straws, will be offered in the upcoming Tuesdays.
The Promise staff says that they are  working hard to make Tradition Tuesday special for students. 
“At the end of the day it’s for you guys, the students, so we want to make sure that students are getting what they want,” Reardon said.
It has been hard for the Promise office to gauge whether or not the improvements have resulted in an increase of student involvement due to COVID-19. 
“Sometimes people don’t want to come in here during common hour because that’s the most trafficked area, but once we get back to a little bit of ‘normal’ we will be able to get our engagement up,” Reardon said.
Reardon hopes more students will come and see what they have to offer in the upcoming weeks. With improvements having been made and more advertising being put out, the Promise office looks forward to seeing more students participate.

Sandra Lindsay, , the director of critical care at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, became the first person in the U.S. to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. on Dec. 14, 2020.
Since then, almost 3 million people have received the vaccine, which requires two rounds of shots with a 28-day interval between injections. 
Some students feel positive about the vaccine because they are excited to see progress during the pandemic. 
“I’m glad the vaccine is finally being distributed,” freshman nursing major Heather Earhardt said. “People have had enough of waiting around for this problem to be fixed.” 
Sophomore nursing major John Doocy agreed with Earhardt.
“It’s about time this vaccine is distributed, but I understand that the elderly are the most vulnerable, so I was fine with waiting to get it,” Doocy said.
Other students, however, have expressed reservations about the vaccine, citing health reasons and side effects as a concern. 
“I’m concerned that if I get the vaccine, I’m going to become sick again,” junior English major at Fordham University Ashley Cox said. “I had COVID-19 about a month ago, and I don’t want to relive that again.”
Earhardt received the vaccine on Feb. 1, and she says her experience since then has been mostly positive. 
“It was a long wait to get the vaccine, but I’m glad I did,” she said. “I felt a little weak for a few days after, but I’ve since recovered. My arm still hurts a little, though.”
Doocy received the vaccine on Jan. 19. He says his body reacted negatively after the shot. 
“I felt horrible, like my whole body had just shut down,” Doocy said. “I know sometimes people feel a little sick after vaccines, but this was on a whole other level. My body felt like it had just been hit by a truck. I know it’s what I had to do, though. If I didn’t get it now, I don’t know how long I would have to wait before I could get it again.”
Other students have also received the vaccine, and claim to have had mixed reactions to the vaccine. 
“It was weird, like I was fluctuating between feeling fine and feeling sick,” junior nursing major Josh Miller said. “I felt fine after receiving the vaccine, but for like a week afterwards, one day I was okay, and the next day I felt as sick as a dog.” 
“I thought this vaccine was supposed to protect you from COVID,” freshman nursing major Sienna Taylor said. “I had COVID before I got the vaccine, and afterwards, it was like one day I felt really good, and the next I felt worse than when I had the virus.” 
Though students have had a variety of experiences after having received the vaccine, it seems like most students agree the vaccine is a step in the right direction towards conquering COVID-19. 
“I may have felt awful after receiving the vaccine, but I know it’s worth it,” freshman nursing major David Williams said. “Most of my friends have gotten the vaccine, and they all agree.”

Many people go to Subway for a healthier alternative when looking for a quick meal to eat, rather than going to a traditional fast food establishment. Two people from Alameda County in the Bay Area of California, Karen Dhanowa and Nilima Amin, made a complaint via a lawsuit about Subway’s tuna, stating that the contents are more than just tuna. 
The lawsuit claims that the tuna from Subway is “a mixture of various concoctions that do not constitute tuna, yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna.”
Samples were brought to an independent lab to see the ingredients of Subway’s tuna. In an email to The Washington Post, attorney Shalini Dogra said “we found that the ingredients were not tuna and not fish.” However, Dogra did not disclose the actual ingredients that were found in the samples from the lab. 
This would contradict what Subway advertises as their “classic tuna sandwich,” which is claimed to be “100 percent wild caught tuna blended with creamy mayo.” 
Subway’s detailed nutritional information can be found on their website. Their tuna salad ingredients are “flaked tuna in brine (tuna, water, salt) and mayonnaise (soybean oil, eggs, water, distilled vinegar, contains less than 2 percent of salt, sugar, spice, lemon juice concentrate, calcium disodium EDTA added to protect flavor).” 
Junior journalism major Jackie Schober,who goes to Subway frequently, is now concerned that they are not being truthful about other ingredients in their food. 
“I’ve never had their tuna, but this makes me question what is actually in the rest of their food. I usually get a veggie sub or a meatball marinara sub,” Schober said.  “If one day, it comes out that their meatballs aren’t completely made of beef, I would be really mad. I would probably stop going to Subway.” 
Many believe that Subway is doing this for the sole purpose of saving money. In an article published in the Washington Post, reporter Tim Carman said “in suburban Washington, for example, the price of a foot-long tuna sandwich at a Subway outlet costs $7.39. The same size cold-cut combo sandwich, by contrast, runs $6.19.”

“I go to Subway once in a while,” freshman business major Mark Tedoro said. “I’ve actually had their tuna. I thought it tasted fine, but after finding this out I’m not going to order it again. I would much rather pay the extra $1.20, and actually get tuna, when I ordered a tuna sandwich. I wonder how much money Subway is saving by doing this.” 
Subway continues to claim that their tuna is actually tuna. In a statement to The Washington Post, senior director for global food safety and quality at Subway, Katia Noll said, “Our restaurants receive pure tuna, mix it with mayonnaise and serve on a freshly made sandwich to our guests.”

Fashion trends come and go rapidly. With every new day, a new one seems to emerge. Some students keep up with what is popular, changing their wardrobe along with the rotating trends, while others stick with their own personal style. 
“Sweater Vests and Corsets are very in right now, and a shift away from mom jeans into a high rise straight leg,” Liv Gonzales, a sophomore acting major said. Gonzales remembers certain trends that emerged during the pandemic, naming sweater vests and corsets as ones that particularly stood out. 
Today, Gonzales describes her fashion sense as alternative girl boss. However when she was younger, her fashion was inspired by Disney Princesses, she said she even wore princess costumes to school. 
“As I got older I used social media to figure out what was on-trend,” Gonzales said. 
Looking forward to the next fashion trend, Gonzales imagines there will be a circling back to styles from the past. “I think we can continue to watch stuff from the 2000s come back into style, we will get that 20-year overlap,” Gonzales said. 
“I also think that party clothes will be in in the next couple of years because people are going to be so excited to show off their outfits, once everyone is vaccinated. I think lounge is the mood of 2020 and we’re ready for some club fits.” Gonzales said. 
Like many others, Gonzales is excited for a world where more than just her acting class can see her outfits. 
Hailey Duchnowski, a junior public relations major has an interest in fashion for a few reasons.
 “It’s always changing. There’s a new trend if not every day, every other day. Every week or month. Something that was popular 10 or 12 years ago can come back anytime, Duchnowski said. 
“I think it’s going to be a color, like brown is in right now, a lot of neutral colors,” Duchnowski said. She is excited about this and points out that she’s already taking part in this soon-to-be trend, by wearing a flannel brown shirt. 
Duchnowski’s personal fashion inspiration is Hailey Bieber. “She can pull off absolutely anything, she can take streetwear and dress it up or down, she can take a plain white t-shirt and match it with anything,” Duchnowski said.
Just like Hailey Bieber inspires many people’s wardrobes, Duchnowski remembers how Kamala Harris’ Inauguration outfit has been making waves. 
“Her jacket was a huge staple piece and everyone loved that, maybe color jackets based on that will be a trend,” Ducknowski said.  
Unlike Duchnowski and Gonzales, senior broadcasting major Samantha Samant does not follow fashion trends and prefers her own personal style.
 “I don’t partake in fashion trends so I cannot say exactly what the next one will be,” Samant said. “My personal style right now is mostly comfort and quick. Not too much, just relaxed.” Samant said. 
Though she doesn’t follow trends, Samant loves fashion. She is a model that gets the chance to wear all different types of clothes. Her appreciation for fashion runs wide. 
“I love all patterns and colors, I also love the movement and personality of each fabric in a garment, some fabrics have a little more sass in their movement while others flow elegantly,” Samant said.
Even though Samant doesn’t jump at what’s trending, she is able to appreciate fashion on her own time, and in her own personal way. 
All three students have an idea of how fashion trends are decided, whether it’s through social media, celebrities, or just deciding what it’s going to be for yourself. No one truly knows what the next great fashion trend will be, but to these three, that’s the most exciting part.

Eddie McQuade, a senior sports management major, got the opportunity of a lifetime when he had the experience to intern at the Super Bowl. Over his time there, McQuade got to witness and work firsthand in what went on to prepare for the big game in Tampa, Florida. 
The Organization that Eddie traveled down with was called Living Sport. McQuade said he found Living Sport on Linkedin. 
“In order to graduate from Post you have to do an internship. So going into the fall I knew I had about 12 credits left to graduate so I was saving it for the spring,” he said. “I was emailed a link with a bunch of LinkedIn internships through my advisor, so I started scrolling through it. Eventually I saw ‘Living Sport Tampa 2021 Super Bowl’ and immediately went all in to get into the program.”
McQuade had many times where he was unsure if it would work out due to the timing and communication.
“At the time I saw the application they had already started doing interviews, this was like mid October,” he said. “Weeks went by and I asked them if I was in the program. I was emailed saying ‘we’re still going over your application’ and I was honestly losing some hope considering it was right around thanksgiving break.”
McQuade said he stayed patient and waited for the perfect time to take advantage of. 
“Right as we came back from Thanksgiving break, The program emailed me saying that three spots just opened and I was gonna be one of ten candidates for the interview the next day,” he said. “I killed it the next day and was brought into the family. Even though the whole process was definitely nerve racking, I wouldn’t change it.” 
McQuade said the best part was when he found out exactly what the program would offer in exchange for the time put in. 
“I liked how they were gonna get us to the Superbowl, tour Tampa Bay & network with professionals in the sports industry,” he said. 
McQuade loved the job he and his team had specifically laid out for them. 
“I worked directly with the populous at the game and showed people how to use the Policy Path App along with working the fan events over the three days before the game,” he said. “They were located at three different locations around Tampa Bay & it was an amazing experience.”
McQuade claimed the best part was when he got to enjoy watching the game after working for the days leading up to kickoff. 
“My best memory without a doubt was being inside Raymond James Stadium during the Super Bowl. I never in my wildest dreams ever would’ve thought I’d be lucky enough to be at one let alone the one right in a pandemic,” he said. “Watching Tom Brady vs Patrick Mahomes will be a Super Bowl that’ll be talked about forever and I’m honored to say I was there to watch Brady get his seventh title”.
McQuade said the people he met and the relationships he created will be something he cherishes forever. 
“I learned about the city of Tampa Bay & the 39 other people I went on this trip with,” he said. “The 40 people on the internship came from all over the country and the world to get to Tampa bay for 10 days and it created a lifelong bond.”
McQuade was ecstatic to get the opportunity to work at the Superbowl, and had a lot to take away from the experience. 
“I learned how to grow as a person, how to get involved in the sports industry, and how people whom you’ve never even knew existed can have the biggest impact on your life,” he said. “Tampa Bay is a beautiful place and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Florida.”
