Overlord” was released in theaters on Nov. 9. The movie is set hours before D-Day (June 6, 1944) and follows the actions of five survivors as they ambush Nazi-occupied France for a crucial mission. With the apocalypse stirring, the surviving paratroopers face some rather unusual enemies. Actor Wyatt Russell plays a key role in the film, and has appeared in several movies, including “22 Jump Street” and “This is 40.” Compared to these, “Overlord” has a darker, gorier theme.

Russell plays Corporal Ford, a “hard-headed individual whose team is caught in a tricky predicament.” He spoke about his character and the challenges he faced in his role. “It was physically demanding,” he said.
“Maintaining high energy was hard for three and a half months,” Russell said. Along with the physical exhaustion, the cast worked with dangerous equipment. “None of the gun fire was CGI (computer-generated imagery),” he said. “That’s what made the movie fun.”
Russell worked with producer J.J.Abrams who is known for producing films including “Star Trek” and “Mission Impossible: Fallout.” “It was great, knowing that as you’re acting you are being graced by the hand of J.J. is very confidence-boosting,” he said. Most of a producer’s work appears after the bulk of filming is completed. “It’s always good news when a producer doesn’t come to set [often],” Russell said.
When the film opened, Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 81 percent positive reaction. Anthony Uly, senior international business major, saw the movie on its opening date. “If you ever wished that ‘Saving Private Ryan’ was a B-movie (low-budget movie) splatterfest, it [Overlord] totally is. I really enjoyed it,” Uly said. “The cinematography was pretty good, overall storyline was unexpectedly great, and I liked the female lead; she gave me a little Wonder Woman tease.”
Russell described the movie as a “popcorn movie,” something that people go to see in the theater. “I want it to be a movie [for the audience] to go with their friends and see something that people put a lot of effort into,” he said.
Many World War, apocalyptic films have appeared over the years, but “Overlord” takes to the imagery of the apocalypse even further through the use of pyrotechnics and lack of green screens. “The best World War II movie has already been made— ‘Saving Private Ryan’— that changed the way a generation saw that war,” Russell said. “You’re not reinventing the wheel; just [looking at] a different take.”

Several students and alumni participated in the New York State Field Band Conference (NYSFBC) for high schools on Oct. 27 and 28. Held at the Carrier Dome at Syracuse University, it was the finale to eight weekends of competition starting at the beginning of September all over N.Y. state.

The competition consisted of 53 high school marching bands; some bands included LIU Post students and alumni performing with their former high schools. They competed in six different classifications: small school class (SS), large school class (LS) and National (Nat). Within these school classes, there are different categories, SS1-3 and LS2-3. The bands were judged and scored in six categories encompassing both musical and visual elements.
Alumni and one current student from the music department put many hours into these performances. Two members of Minneola’s band are from LIU Post. Minneola High school took first place in the SS2 classification, allowing it to choose to move up to SS1 for next year’s competition.
Current graduate student Kenneth Kamping was music arranger, visual designer and visual instructor for the band, and alumnus Zachary St. John was the band’s assistant director. Kamping also assisted Sachem High School to its ninth place finish in the LS2.
Alumni Nicholas Hall and Matthew Nobile helped Division Avenue High School place fifth in the SS2 category. Hall and Nobile played percussion for the performance, with Hall also assisting Brentwood High School place ninth in the national class. Alumnus Frank Mauriello was the band director for Roslyn High School, which placed ninth in the SS2 category.
Director of wind studies and music professor Dr. James McRoy was one of the adjudicators for the event. “I’ve been judging this event for about 14 years,” McRoy said. He was impressed with the dedication of the students and support staff that participated in this event, and the pleasure he still gets after many years of involvement, especially seeing Post alumni and students perform.

“There are more things likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often
in imagination than in reality,”
– Seneca, “Letters From a Stoic: On Groundless Fears”
When we are confronted with a tough situation, some quickly assume the worst is to come. We play out in our heads the most horrible outcomes, which can lead to an extreme amount of unease and distress before the situation has even unfolded. Usually, when we allow ourselves to focus on all the negative outcomes, it tends to take up most of our energy and time.
Rather than dwell on what is to come, we should look for other alternatives. If you must calculate in your head all of the awful possible outcomes, then you should also calculate the better outcomes as well. As long as you acknowledge that there are both kinds of scenarios, you can spend the time you are wasting not only on all the bad, but also the good ones.
In regards to Seneca’s quote, those who fabricate too much in their head end up creating bigger problems than are necessary. Of course, there are times when we cannot prevent our- selves from at least thinking of what bad outcomes could arise. This only becomes an issue when we cannot stop thinking about these bad outcomes in such a way that they frighten and eventually crush us.
When we start drawing an awful conclusion about the future, we lose all the time before anything is concluded. Rather than causing chaos in our heads, we should worry about such things when a problem is actually at hand instead of worrying about it in our imagination.

As Americans, we often hear our elites say, “Diversity is our strength.” Is it, though? Diversity is defined as “a range of different things,” meaning not everything is the same. Is a society stronger when everything is different? Consider the following questions:
Can a marriage survive if spouses have radically different values?
Can two neighbors communicate if each person speaks a different language?
Can a country stay unified if its citizens adhere to different principles, values, and ideals?
Can a business operate at maximum efficiency if skin color or gender is seen as the most important qualification for hire, and not the merits of its employees?
The answer to all of these questions is simple: no. Therefore, how can our leaders say that diversity is our strength? When posed with this question, our leaders often fumble for an answer, denouncing the person who asked it as “racist” or “bigoted” in the process. Of course, the failure of our cultural elites to provide a sufficient answer to this question reveals that diversity is not, in fact, our strength, rather unity is.
Along with mindless screeching about diversity, our leaders also preach about equality. Equality is defined as “being the same in quantity, size, degree, or value.” How, then, can two things be both different and similar at the same time? Consider the following points we often hear from our elites:
“There are no differences between men and women; in fact, they are exactly the same and are capable of doing the exact same things.” How, then, is there any diversity between the two genders?
“An egalitarian society is a happy society. There should be no upper, middle, and lower class; everyone should have the same amount of money, possessions, and opportunities.” How, then, is there any diversity within our society?
Echoing the call of neoconservatives: “The United States must spread democracy all over the world. Perpetual war ensures perpetual peace.” How, then, is there any diversity with regards to the different types of governments and societies that exist around the world?
“All people, cultures, and lifestyles are the same. No one person is better than another. A person should not be judged for his or her actions, since morality is relative.” How, then, is there room to determine differences between individuals and their respective choices? How is there room for differing opinions about people’s lifestyles and life choices?
How can one make a distinction between right and wrong?
It seems pretty clear that diversity and equality cannot coexist. It does not appear that total and complete equality is practical when there is so much diversity; likewise, if everyone and everything is equal, then there is no room for any diversity.
Editor’s Note: “Trick’s Take” is a new political opinion column. While it reflects the thoughts and beliefs of the columnist, it may not reflect views of The Pioneer, which is an objective, unbiased entity.

“Cinder” by Marissa Meyer is the first book in The Lunar Chronicles, a sci-fi series with a plot loosely based on well-known fairy tales. Centered on the fairy tale Cinderella, “Cinder” focuses on Linh Cinder, a cyborg working as a mechanic to provide for her legal guardian Linh Adri in the city of New Beijing. Cinder’s only friend is Adri’s younger daughter Peony, who has just caught letumosis, a deadly disease that has been plaguing the Earth for the past 20 years. There is a draft for cyborgs, who are generally considered as second-class citizens, to become test subjects in hopes of finding an antidote to letumosis. After Peony gets infected, Adri volunteers Cinder for plague testing.

Cinder soon finds out that she is immune to letumosis. Having no memories before the age of eleven, this development rekindles an urge for Cinder to learn more about her past. Along the way, Cinder gets swept up in a political crisis involving Prince Kai of the Eastern Common- wealth. Kai is soon to become the new emperor. However, he went to Cinder to have her fix one of his androids only to become enamored with the her. He has to decide whether to accept the proposal for a political marriage with the cruel Queen Levana of Luna.
Due to “Cinder” taking place in the future, there are some terms in this first book that do not make sense right away. For example, the book takes place in the year 126 T.E. It can take readers a while before they realize that T.E. stands for Third Era. Another issue this book has is that not all of the references to the classic fairy tale are noticeable upon the first read. There are some little details that may go over the readers’ heads until they reread the book.
“Cinder” is a great introduction to The Lunar Chronicles series, as well as a fun book to read on its own. “Cinder” has something for all kinds of readers.

In “Smite,” we are introduced to NuWa, a Chinese goddess known as the guardian of heaven and the protector of man. But according to legend, just how accurately does “Smite” capture this goddess?

Lore: When two warring gods shattered the World Pillar, heaven and earth shifted, and Armageddon was unleashed. Firestorms, floods and bloodthirsty monsters ravaged the land and stole the lives of plenty. In some beliefs, Nu Wa handcrafted all people from clay. They were her creations, her children, her responsibility.
As the earth was crumbling, Nu Wa forged five mystic stones, one for each of the elemental forces of nature: earth, water, fire, wood, and metal. With the power of these stones, she slew a gargantuan tortoise, severed its legs and raced to the broken World Pilar. She used one leg to prop the heavens aloft and with the elemental stones, she sealed it in place. Balance between heaven and earth was restored, but the world was never the same.
In the years that followed, Nu Wa and her brother, Fu Xi, took the throne of China. They ruled with wisdom and ushered in an age of recovery and prosperity, for which she is adored and worshipped for to this day. Yet, the skies grow dark once more and chaos threatens to engulf the land. Gods from all pantheons have chosen earth as a battleground, trading blows with the same thoughtless fervor that destroyed the World Pillar so long ago. Determined to prevent the repetition of such calamity, Nu Wa has summoned the elemental stones once more.
As far as the lore is concerned, “Smite” does a great job as its story is almost one-to-one with the real thing. Another thing they get right are Nu Wa’s abilities. In the game, Nu Wa’s passive ability is called “elemental crystals,” which upon using one of her other abilities activates one of her stones. When activated, they grant her stat boosts.
One of Nu Wa’s normal abilities is called “clay soldiers.” When activated, Nu Wa sum- mons an army of clay minions to aid her in combat, referencing the lore. Nu-Wa has many other abilities, mainly focused around her elemental crystals. Nu Wa’s ultimate move is called “pillars of heaven.” When activated, Nu Wa summons four pillars, creating a damage field that imprisons enemy gods, slowing them down and damaging them.
Overall “Smite” does a good job showing how amazing Nu Wa is. I highly recommend “Smite” players to give her a try.

The Middle Eastern Student Association (MESA) partnered with the Muslim Student Association (MSA) to host their first event of the fall 2018 semester: a vigil service honoring the lives lost in the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Penn.
Nuvaera Mumnoon, sophomore biomedical science major and criminal justice minor, and president of MESA, said the club is not limited to anything. “Our club is intersectional,” she said. “We want to get our culture out there so not just us, but Post as well, has something different in involvement.”
Mumnoon founded the club in the spring 2018 semester along with fellow student and president of MSA, Humdia Barakzai. Originally, the club was created because Mumnoon, who is Pakistani, felt there wasn’t enough of a Middle Eastern presence on campus. She wants to learn about other cultures and share her own.
This year, Mumnoon plans to be more active and work with different groups. “We want to work with different clubs on campus so we are as diverse as we can get,” she said. “We can learn from one another and understand about each other’s backgrounds.”
Mumnoon believes it is important to stand in solidarity with people from all walks of life, which is why they decided to hold the vigil service. “We will continue to support everyone around the world and contribute to any fund- raisers and charitable events,” Momnoon said.
For future events, MESA plans to host potential guest speakers like comedian and political commentator Hassan Minhaj, and Islamic public speaker Noman Ali Khan. They also plan to have an end of semester grande formal as well.

The Veteran Students United (VSU) office hosted a week of events from Nov. 5-9 in celebration of Veterans Day on Nov. 11. These events included a 22 pushup challenge, a flag raising ceremony and a medal of honor obstacle course challenge. Post has more than 50 veteran students. and VSU serves as a center of information and support for them.
Michele O’Brien is the vice president and treasurer of VSU and has worked there since 2014. O’Brien is a coast guard veteran and knows of struggles veterans may face in their return to civilian life. “I loved my military time, I really, really did,” she said. ‘I had wonderful things come out of it, but my transition out was a difficult transition.”
Many veterans struggle to changeover to civilian life, O’Brien said. “You get dressed, you wear the same uniform, you do the same thing you know every day. When we get out of the military, we’re not wearing the uniform any- more, what do we do?” she said.
The 22 pushup challenge raised awareness about mental health struggles veterans face daily. Everyday 22 veterans commit suicide, and members of VSU want to end the stigma associated with mental health in society. “I had some anxiety and depression issues after I got out,” O’Brien said. “I had a hard time transitioning. I went to the Northport VA; I got some mental health [treatment], and I think that needs to be addressed.”
VSU serves as a safe space and a place for veterans to receive support and speak to someone if they’re having issues. Due to a lack of information about veteran educational benefits and resources that they’re entitled to, VSU works to inform veteran students about the various resources they often never told about.
O’Brien compared the transition from military to civilian life with the transition from high school to college. “Even though our scars are on the inside with some of the things we have seen, the transition of you leaving high school and the transition of us leaving the military is still really scary,” she said. “It’s what you’ve known for so many years.”
Maria Salazar is president of the VSU and is a veteran of the Marine Corp. She is an art therapy major and wants the office to serve as a place for veterans to integrate into the student body. “I think it [VSU] gives veterans a place to find like-minded people; a place where you can come hang out and put your backpack down,” she said.
Salazar had her own struggles returning to civilian life. “When I first came here, the age difference is a big factor in how you relate to students,” she said. “This office gives [veterans] the opportunity to hang out with people in their age group.”
This semester, the members of VSU hope to collaborate more with the student body. “I would really like the students to combine with us at our events,” O’Brien said. The events throughout the week of Veteran’s Day served as a way to begin this collaboration, and to inform students about some of the issues that the veteran population faces.
VSU meets every Thursday during common hour in Hillwood Commons room 206. Students can follow their Instagram account at @liupost_vsu.

In today’s digital age, where the art of communication has become a dominant fixture in our daily lives, having a degree specializing in it seems fundamental, if not necessary.
The department of communications and film has recently introduced the addition of its bachelor of science in communications degree to its program.
Functioning as a sampler platter of the diverse field of communications, the new B.S. degree will offer a thorough and complete survey in areas of journalism, film, broadcasting and public relations. It will also allow students the opportunity to concentrate on these particular areas of interest within the degree. The goal is to provide students with a degree that is both comprehensive and dynamic in preparation for their future careers.
The degree is formatted as a “project-based curriculum,” meaning it will involve different design projects that will ultimately contribute to a broad portfolio of work. “There will be a lot of critical thinking involved. It will be a nice mix of skills and analytical thinking and writing.” Dr. Barbara Fowles, professor and former chairperson of the department of communications and film, said.
The goal is to provide students with a degree that is both comprehensive and dynamic in preparation for future careers. “I think this degree would prepare you to fit in almost anywhere,” Dr. Fowles said..
The decision to incorporate the B.S. degree into the curriculum was prompted by the increased demand for communication and media skills across all industries.
“The communication degree is one of the most sought-after degrees in the business world,” Steven Breese, the dean of the college of arts, communications and design, said. “They need someone who has not just the skills of being able to write, but they also need skills to be able to put up a website and other kinds of applied media skills.”
Breese has been at Post since 2016. “I brought in the expertise and knowledge that students are attracted to it and that the industry needs it and wants it and it married very well with the faculty and the department that we already had in place,” he said.
The primary design and details of the B.S. program is credited to Benjamin Gerdes, assistant professor of broadcasting, and Lisa Robinson, associate professor of film, in addition to a committee of department professors who helped in advising its development.

The brothers of Phi Sigma Kappa and Tau Kappa Epsilon held an event to bring awareness to drunk driving and the dangers of alcohol on Tuesday, Nov. 6 to benefit Mothers Against Drunk Driving. This was the first time they held this event.
The event raised $164 for the organization which fights for stricter impaired driving policy. They aim to bring awareness to the dangers of driving while under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
Over 50 students attended the event in the End Zone during common hour. Attendees tried on drunk goggles and played Mario Kart to mimic the effect of drunkenness on driving. Students in attendance discussed the dangers of drinking and driving and pledged not to drive while intoxicated.
Brianna Licausi, a senior physical education major, said she is glad the event used fun games to approach a serious topic. “[Drunk driving] is something that happens every day, and instead of
making it so serious where people don’t want to listen, we’re playing fun games like Mario Kart with drunk goggles. That actually gets people involved,” she said.
Despite the lightheartedness of the activities, the event had a message – drinking is something to be taken seriously, and driving while drunk is never okay.
RJ Ayroso, a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon, said the event meant to show students the true effects of alcohol. “When you’re drunk, you can’t do the things you do every day. It’s much harder to do things when you are drunk, so we are trying to enforce alcohol awareness so people don’t get to that level where they can’t function,” he said.
Theresa Kelley, a senior political science major, said she felt that the educational nature of the event was important. “There are so many people on college campuses who don’t understand the effects of alcohol on your body or your mind,” she said. “As a result of that, people die, and really dangerous situations happen. Education on this is important.”

The Pioneer received a written letter from one of our regular readers last week and we wanted to share their kind words. The Pioneer staff work hard to remain objective in bringing the news to the campus community.
Dear Jada and Ashley,
I have read all the issues of the Pioneer this semester and have thoroughly enjoyed them all – they have been most informative and well-written. You have a great staff. I particularly enjoy Gillian Pietrowski’s column (Capable of Happiness) and the Health Column (by Alecia Sexton).
This year’s Pioneer is the best it has been – so informative. I want to thank you all for your dedication and for your God given talents.
God Bless You,

A vigil was held on Monday, Nov. 12 for the 12 victims of Nov. 8 mass shooting in a music bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
The vigil was hosted by Father Nelson Ngoi, the reverend at the Interfaith Center. “It’s really emotionally heartbreaking when humanity is suffering from a tragedy like this; it touches every soul,” Ngoi said. There has been a rise in mass shootings, and the impact from this one affected families throughout the region.
Students and staff gave their condolences by lighting candles in the Gold Coast Cinema. “The hardest thing for us is to remind ourselves we don’t really under- stand what these people are going through,” Erica Ferrera, senior geology and environmental sustainability major and vice president of SGA, said. “It’s really hard to write thoughts and prayers in a card. There’s so much more that these people deserve.”
Shootings can cause people to be skeptical of their community, however, it is important to come together in times like this, according to Julia Pagano, a promise coach. “You have to keep living and keep enjoying your life,” she said.

The University of New Haven Chargers took on the Pioneers on Nov. 10. Both teams were the two remaining undefeated teams in the Northeast 10 conference, and this game crowned the Northeast 10 conference champion.

In front of a capacity crowd of 4,780 fans in the 45-degree weather, the Pioneers claimed their 13th conference title.
With one minute and 15 seconds left in the first quarter, the Pioneers struck first as senior Joey Tolgyesi hit his career high 12th field goal of the season, from 24 yards away, to give the Pioneers a 3-0 lead.
On the next drive, quarterback Chris Laviano led the offense downfield, capped by a one yard touchdown run by senior captain Malik Pierre, who picked up a total of 161 yards that day, placing him third in career rushing yards as a Pioneer.
Just before halftime, New Haven quarterback Ajee Patterson connected with wide receiver Ju’An Williams on a 46 yard touchdown pass. After Michael Stalenyj’s extra point, New Haven cut Post’s lead to 10-7 at halftime.
The first two scoring plays of the second half were 29 and 22-yard field goals from Stalenyj, which gave the Chargers their first lead of the day, 13- 10, with under nine minutes left in the fourth quarter. The Pioneers answered back as Laviano made his biggest play to date; a 44-yard bomb downfield to Mike Richardson – to retake the lead, 17-13.
With six and a half minutes remaining in regulation, there was still plenty of time for New Haven to strike back. Chargers’ player Patterson converted on a 22 yard pass to Williams before picking up another 17 yards
on the ground. On second and seven from the Pioneers, Patterson looked to Williams again but was picked off by senior linebacker Jake Carlock on the 10-yard line as the Pioneers regained possession.
“I felt like the QB was going to try to attack my side, but I had good coverage on the wideout,” Carlock said. “When I turned around the ball was right there and I just went up and got it.”
Patterson brought the Chargers’ offense all the way to the eight yard line with seconds left on the clock. On the final play of the game, Patterson connected with Brett Huber, but a swarm of Pioneers led by Carlock and Zach Cofrancesco made the tackle at the one yard line as time expired, giving the Pioneers the 17-13 victory and the Northeast 10 conference championship.
“It came down to who wanted the game more, and we refused to lose,” senior middle linebacker Connor Farrell said.
With the victory, the Pioneers earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The Pioneers received the No. 2 seed in super region one, and will play the No. 7 seed Slippery Rock University at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium on Saturday, Nov. 17 at noon.

While college students have somewhere between 18-25 years of life experience under our belt, we are far from reaching our maximum potential. It’s easy to get caught up in daily routines, drama and news. As young adults, it’s our job to be under the impression that we know everything. But there is so much we still have to learn and so many things, people and experiences in life that we can learn from. It’s important to be conscious of this so we can identify these opportunities and seize them.

Self reflection is a way we can look into the past, analyze ourselves and gauge our growth. When I reflect on high school, I can’t help but think, “If only you knew back then what you know now; some things would have been so much easier.”
Just as my current self reflects onto my past self, I know that my future self will reflect on my present self. It’s an odd thing to consider, but a question we can all benefit from asking ourselves is, “What will my future self have to say about my current self?” Will I reflect on the time I wasted, or on the time I spent getting things done?
Now, surprisingly, is an “easy” time in life. While it’s a struggle to maintain a job, commute, study, complete assignments and also maintain some level of sanity, most of us don’t have to juggle the heavy stressors such as spouses, children, mortgages and full time jobs.
It’s important to put things into perspective and know that it may sometimes be better to stay in on a Friday night to finish an assignment, or research things that can lead to future success, especially when you know you have work all weekend.
As young people we often feel like it’s the end of the world when we miss out on something – the “fear of missing out.” We worry about the people we would have met, the conversations we would have had and the food we would have eaten. However, we forget that we have the rest of our lives to meet people and have exciting experiences.
If we plan and prepare for our futures now, then once we get there, provided we end up working in a field that brings us joy, we will have the freedom to go out, express ourselves and live the life we’ve always envisioned.

An artist’s vision jumped off the walls as Xiojian Zheng, a senior photography major, created a three-dimensional experience for guests visiting his exhibition “Illusion,” in the S.A.L. Gallery, located in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library.
Zheng lined the walls of the gallery with black and white imagery that is 3-D in viewing and interpretation. His show featured street photography in New York City, and captured New Yorkers “always moving, and never sleep- ing,” Zheng said. Each picture contained a specific amount of dimension that brought the interaction within the photo to life.
“When the whole photo is 3-D, there is nothing there,” Zheng said. To make his collection unique, he used the element of depth to highlight select movements and conversations so observers would experience the candid moment as if they snapped the photo themselves.
Zheng began working with 3-D photography two years ago in his experimental photography course. He started with color prints, but when he changed them into black and white, he thought the photos were stronger in detail and emotion. He decided to add the dimensional aspect because he prefers his artwork to be powerful in message and different in design.
He experimented with city street lines, buildings and pedestrians to frame his photos to tell a story. Zheng’s favorite photo on display is a picture of his wife standing in a crowd but is the only subject emphasized in 3-D. It relays to the audience the importance of her existence through his lens and in life, according to Zheng.
His collection contained a piece that speaks to the point of commonality among human beings. The photo depicted a couple from behind, holding hands as they walk the city streets. An umbrella with an American flag pattern shields the pair from the rain. Zheng accentuated the fact that deep down we are all the same no matter our race, age, sex, nationality, or class.
Five years ago, Zheng moved to the United States from China to attend LIU. He willl graduate in May. His professor and mentor, Allison Rufrano, believes he has a bright future ahead of him. “He has created this selective, very tedious, very specific form of photography. He has such attention to detail and this work takes an enormous amount of patience to do,” Rufrano said.
“He’s special and caring and thoughtful, and not just in his own work and his commitment to his education, but also to the community and the environment. I mean all of his classmates and friends are here to support him and he deserves every bit of it. We’re going to miss him.”

“Great literature is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree.”
– Ezra Pound, American poet and critic
“Confrontation,” an American literary magazine run by the English department, did not receive funding for this semester. The literary magazine served as a creative backbone for the English department for 50 years, publishing two editions each year. Professional writers from around the world contributed to the publication with fictional short stories, essays and poems.

Although no official announcement has been made about the future of “Confrontation,” money has not been allocated in the budget for its printing and other expenses. Dr. Jonna Semeiks, an English professor, served as the literary magazine’s editor-in-chief for eight years. Before then, she was the associate editor and fiction editor. Having worked on magazine for 18 years, Semeiks is sorry to witness the magazine’s demise.
Semeiks’ role allowed the evolution and advancement of “Confrontation,” on a yearly basis. “After I became editor, we began publishing visual art in every single issue,” Semeiks said. “As fiction would naturally call for both technical and substantial modifications, I would work with each writer to improve their work.”
“Confrontation” was founded in 1968, by Martin Tucker, a retired professor of English and a poet. Although the magazine started at LIU Brooklyn, Tucker brought the magazine with him to the Post campus. The magazine has a rich history of contributors. Notable writers include W.H. Auden, John Steinbeck, Derek Walcott and Isaac Bashevis Singer. The magazine has also helped launch the careers of Walter Abish, Cynthia Ozick and Paul Theroux.
Semeiks believes the magazine will be missed. “It really is a shame, the quality of writing is fantastic and I am proud of every contribution collected over the years,” she said. “I think there is a place for a literary magazine at a university. Whether they are big or small, rich or poor, public or private, they have literary magazines.”
Dr. John Lutz, English professor and director of the English department, said there is an unfortunate lack of support from the administration. “There was an outlay of a stipend and they have decided that the cost was not worth the return,” Lutz said.
While the administration has not offered a reason for the termination of “Confrontation,” Lutz came to the conclusion that money was the ultimate deciding factor. “While a literary magazine would not supply a return in dollars, it provides people with a means of expression and certainly has a place in our university,” he said.
From a humanitarian standpoint, Dr. Lutz believes the magazine offers something more significant than monetary profit. “Not everything in an educational institution is going to provide some kind of financial return,” he said. “There are other kinds of values that we subscribe to with educational expenses that are worthwhile.”
Lutz argued that literature is essential when expanding one’s own perspective. “I defend literature as a practical skill, as a skill that is able to develop our empathy,” he said. “You study poetry and stories to encounter other perspectives and find oneself. Without it, our ability to cultivate that empathy is diminished. It is not something that appears on a financial spreadsheet, but as something that has a value and a place at an educational institution.”
Copies of previous issues of “Confrontation” can be found in the archives at the campus library.

Editor’ Note: Some parts of the pamphlet were not discussed, as we are awaiting an administrative response to publish later this week, per request of Michael Berthel, dean of students.
The authors of the anonymous “Common Sense” pamphlet struck again with a sequel found on campus during the first week of November. It addresses concerns about administration from an angle similar to that of the American Revolution.

The latest “Common Sense” alluded to various news articles from The Pioneer and VIN News Service, specifically an article by Jennifer Fiala. The writers feel that the students are “not the only ones who are questioning our tyrannical Queen (Dr. Cline).” They stated there is a “lack of communication and transparency between faculty and Queen Kimmy’s administration.”
The writers drew a parallel to a situation at Adelphi University in the 1990’s, when then university President Peter Diamandopoulos and the board of trustees were replaced by the NY State Board of Regents. Some of the similarities between these situations are bold, according to Dr. Michael Soupios, professor of political science and president of the faculty union. “It’s not fair to Kim Cline to speculate and draw parallels between her and Diamandopoulos,” he said. “As it stands right now there is no connection at all in terms of their activity.”
The latest “Common Sense” pamphlet alleged that recent decisions of the administration have been motivated by budgetary issues. One of the first things mentioned is “the passing out of 30 death letters to professors,” referring to the dismissal of multiple professors after the spring 2018 semester.
Speculations of the rumored $28 million debt were in the latest pamphlet. In a previous statement, Cline declined the accusations. “In the last five years, our university has gone from $86 million to about $230 million in endowment. We’ve had surpluses every year I’ve been here,” Cline said.
The writers of “Common Sense” question that statement with recent admission figures: “We surmise that there were less than 400 incoming freshmen at Post, but we think it’s closer to mid-300.” The “Common Sense” authors suspect, without proof, that there are actions pertaining to budgetary manipulation. The freshman enrollment in 2018 was 550, according to dashboard figures, but it has been on a steady decline since Cline became president in 2013.
“You really can’t make a budget if you fail to deliver a freshman class here [for] three, four, five years in a row,” Soupios said. “The possibility that there is no budgetary problem is impossible for me to conceive.”
The writers of the pamphlet also wrote about concerns with the number of spring classes that were cut by administration. The article mimicked another event of the American Revolution, calling this latest action the “Friday Night Massacre.” Students have alleged that they needed to enroll in these classes to graduate.
“Not being able to have a choice of when the class is or knowing beforehand when [it] might be is frustrating,” Elizabeth Law, a junior physics and mathematics major, said. Law had the same problems last semester and had to take a graduate class.
The course schedules are created by a software program called Ad Astra that helps predict what students need; however there had been some errors. John Lutz, an English professor and chair of the English, philosophy and foreign languages department, found in his area “17 classes were removed from those schedules.” Lutz said he was not informed in advance of the cuts. “I was not given any opportunity to have a conversation or discussion about which courses were removed,” he said.
When discussing the state of the administration, Lutz said these actions reflect “a lack of transparency and communication.” Lutz attributed professors’ and department heads’ frustrations to the issue that “the administration had not been adequately communicating with                                                               the academic units, at least not with the chairs’ level.”
The administration has restored some of these classes, but Lutz still has his concerns. “I am critical of the administration for not providing that transparency and working as best as they can with academic departments to help us use this [Ad Astra software program] as a rational tool,” he said.
The authors of the pamphlets have been critical about the departmental consolidation of several colleges on campus. In some cases, this has been efficient, but the logic of the decisions was, they said, inconsistent. Lutz supported the consolidation of his department with others, but he doesn’t necessarily think the same coherence exists in other areas. One example is the consolidation of the political science, history, economics, and sociology departments. “It doesn’t make much sense for them,” Lutz said. “I can see why they are upset and [I] even support them. In my own area it worked out.”
The effectiveness of consolidations remains to be seen. Soupios described the combined social science departments as mixing apples and oranges. “You’ve taken this thing and thrown in up in the air and now you have a jigsaw puzzle, a lot of these pieces don’t fit,” Soupios said. “For example, you have one social science unit, does that mean you have one personnel committee? For four different departments, how does that work?” he asked. Soupios questioned the sensibility of having a historian judge the academic work of an economist, or an economist judge the work of a political scientist; and all under one personnel committee.
The new pamphlet alluded to a budgetary motivation for the consolidations. “This was all done very spur of the moment and without a lot of planning,” Soupios said.
Concerning budget cuts, Soupios discussed the consequences. “The reason why I get so emotional about this is because what people don’t realize is I spent the whole summer having young faculty members sitting in that chair crying,” he said. “They come back and say things like ‘I got a mortgage, I got children at home, I gotta feed my kids.’ What the hell am I supposed to say?”
The impact of these administrative decisions led to frustrated faculty who feel as though their roles have been undermined. “They (senior administration) hurt people, they hurt families. It’s not like these people (faculty) are reckless and irresponsible; they did do their work and they still get turned away,” Soupios said.
The “Common Sense” pamphlets contain both true and exaggerated statements. “The first casualty in political discourse is truth,” Soupios said. Despite the exaggeration and hyperboles, it appeared to be an effort by students to voice their concerns to the administration.
