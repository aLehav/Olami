Women’s Ice Hockey secured back-to-back wins in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance(NEWHA) championships with their 5-2 win over Sacred Heart Thursday, March. 4. This was the second game in a best of three series, with the Sharks securing the win in game one of the series 3-2 in overtime on Tuesday, March. 2. 
After winning the conference title in their inaugural season last year, the Sharks were looking to capitalize and prove they could play through all uncertainties of a Covid stricken season. Their season was delayed from the fall of 2020 until the start of 2021.
Head Coach Rob Morgan was excited when he found out the Sharks would have a chance to defend their title after the long wait. 
“Having the opportunity to compete for a championship is the key motivating ingredient for our team,” he said. “When we found out that we could have an abbreviated season that would conclude with a best two of three playoffs, it was exciting news for everyone involved.”
Despite the awkward shortened schedule, Morgan clarified he and his team focused on the things they had to, without worrying about the outside circumstances. 
“We focused on the things that were in our control. Early on, we truly learned what it meant to be adaptable, from doing zoom video sessions to review/learn team systems to being creative with the small group workouts,” he said. 
The Sharks had a rough start to the season, losing their first five over their non-conference opponents. Morgan made clear these were learning battles that helped defeat Sacred Heart when the time came. 
“Our plan has always been about getting better each day. We know that it’s going to take time to beat the Nationally ranked opponents. With that being said, we need to play them to measure our growth as a program,” he said. “Our team understands the importance of learning from the past so that we can be stronger in the present. This mindset and their positive energy is what allows for the team environment that we all enjoy.”
Starting Goalie Kenzie Harmison is extremely proud of winning the conference championship this season. 
“Winning the NEWHA championship back to back is special for so many reasons. Not only is it our second championship in just two years of the program, but we did it all under such unique circumstances. This season our team was lucky enough to be able to train and play fairly regularly with only a few bumps along the way,” she said. “There are teams that did not have the opportunities we had this year to play, so to be able to finish the year raising another cup is second to none.”
Once again, Harmison repeated her stellar performance in the NEWHA championship tournament. By only allowing two goals each game against Sacred Heart, she put her team in a great position. Last year she had three consecutive shutouts in the tournament. 
“Being given the opportunity to start such important games is what really fuels me to perform. My coaches and teammates have the confidence in me to perform my best and give them a chance to win each game,” Harmison said. “Your energy just peaks at that first puck drop, and then you control everything you can from there to help your team until you can raise the cup after the final buzzer.”
Defenseman Julia Hoffman played terrific with two extremely timely goals. She secured the victory in game one with the overtime winner, and followed it up with the go-ahead goal early in the third period. 
“In both situations, I feel like everyone’s anxiety was high because all we wanted to do was win, but after scoring both of those goals, it was like a stress reliever,” Hoffman said. “It felt as if a weight had been lifted off of our shoulders, and it was an overwhelming feeling of emotions for not just me but the whole team.”
Throughout the season, Hoffman focused on playing to her strengths and was confident in her team’s ability to compete through anything. 
“I wasn’t worried about the uncertainties in the beginning because I was confident in my coaches’ choices and plan for our season,” she said. “Winning the NEWHA back to back is just an unbelievable feeling. I already had a feeling that we would win because I know my team and coaching staff’s capabilities, and I believe that we could accomplish anything if we put our minds and skills to it.”
Matilda af Bjur had one of the greatest offensive performances in team history during game two with a hat-trick in the 5-2 win. The first goal in period two tied the game at one and gave the Sharks the momentum they needed to capitalize. Her next two goals in the third secured the victory and the title. 
Matilda was the team’s third-leading goal scorer last year with 10, but with only one goal so far this season, she was due for a huge game. Bjur was proud to be able to contribute the way she did when it mattered most.
“It is an amazing feeling that I could end the season so great personally, but it is even a greater feeling that I could do this for my team,” she said. “Being able to do this in such an important game for my teammates is really great. It was an amazing game but sad that the season is over so soon.” 
Bjur feels it is a big accomplishment to represent LIU every time they take the ice. 
“It is, of course, a huge accomplishment for all of us on the hockey team and the school. It shows that we can do whatever we set our minds to even during this difficult time and that we are ready to take the next step in making this program even greater,” she said. “If we can do this, we can really do anything, and I think our team is ready to do even greater things now.”

Long Island University Men’s Hockey knew they were getting a star player in graduate student Garrett Metcalf, but they had no idea they would be getting an athlete who would be considered for the best goalkeeper in the NCAA. 
Metcalf was named to the 2021 Mike Richter  Award Watch List by the Hockey Commissioner’s Association. The Mike Richter award is given annually to the top goalie in men’s NCAA Division 1 hockey. Metcalf was also named the  2020-2021 State-By-State MVP for his home state of Utah by College Hockey Inc.  
Metcalf posted several solid statistics in his first season as a shark. Metcalf posted a  season-high of 42 saves on Jan 15, 2021, against Army West Point. Metcalf also posted 305  saves and a .900 save pct. Metcalf thought his season  was a success. 
“I thought the season was good. I enjoyed being a part of this historic season and look forward to watching the program grow over the years. Personally, I felt my play gave our team a chance to win,” he said. “I felt I was peaking right as we had to quarantine and couldn’t find that same level once we got out, but overall I was happy with my season.”  
Head Coach Brett Riley had nothing but positive things to say as Metcalf moves on from LIU.
 “In the net, Garrett gave us a chance to win on every single night. He made history standing on his head against Holy Cross in our opening night win and proved the legitimacy of the program in a dominant performance over RIT,” he said. “His nomination for the Richter
Award captures his on-ice success here at LIU in such a short period of time. We now wish Garrett much success as he becomes the first player in program history to sign a professional contract.”  
Garrett Metcalf has had a great experience with a plethora of memories to take away from his time playing NCAA Hockey.
“It was an emotional last two games for me. My college experience was not what I expected, but I would not have changed it for anything,” he said. “The time goes by fast,so you have to learn to enjoy the little things and treat every day like it could be your last. Because one day you’ll blink your eyes, and your four years will be over.”

Saturday, Feb. 13, was a historic day for Long Island University. The date marked the inaugural competition for the Long Island University Women’s Gymnastics Team. Women’s  Gymnastics competed in their inaugural meet against the University of New Hampshire at the  Pratt Recreation Center. The Sharks had a strong showing, but were narrowly defeated 192.050  – 190.575 in the East Atlantic Gymnastics League action. 
LIU had several standout athletes who were able to post solid scores for the team.  Freshman Alisson Lapp was able to post a 9.700 on her uneven bar routine, while freshman  Lauren Miller posted a 9.375 on vault. Lapp led the team on the balance beam by posting a  9.800 routine, while sophomore Amanda Loo led the sharks on the floor by posting a 9.725. In the all-around, sophomore Katy Koopman posted a score of 38.175.  
Women’s Gymnastics Head Coach Randy Lane was pleased with how the first meet went. 
 “The team and staff were very excited to begin the season and to begin the program by having the first gymnast compete in the first event for the Sharks. When Lauren Miller, who was the first gymnast ever to commit to LIU, competed as the first person ever for LIU gymnastics, she created Herstory,” he said. “As the first head coach of this new program, it was important for me to have the first ever gymnast compete in the first ever routine for the Sharks. Lauren was excited, proud and humbled.” Similarly, Miller was also pleased with how the first meet went.
 “I would say the  inaugural gymnastics competition went really well. The team’s energy was super high, and we had a lot of fun. Given the limited time to prepare and practice due to the pandemic, we put up our best gymnastics.” 
Women’s Gymnastics will continue to compete before the EAGL Championship on Saturday, March 20, in Towson, Maryland.

A student organization, The Hidden Opponent (THO), handed out ribbons to students to help bring awareness to mental health. THO has student-led organizations, referred to as chapters, that are run by campus captain ambassadors across the United States. 
THO is an “accredited non-profit and advocacy group that raises awareness for student-athlete mental health and addresses the stigma within sports culture,” according to their website. THO was founded by mental health and body image advocate Victoria Garrick. She is a mental health and body image advocate. Garrick is a former division one volleyball player, TED Talk speaker, as well as the host of the podcast, “Real Pod.” Her podcast discusses mental health, body image, and “real talk.” 
THO’s mission statement is “to address the negative connotation surrounding mental health especially within sports culture. We plan to promote the conversation of mental health with hopes of improving the culture among student-athletes.”
“We’re handing out green ribbons, which is the same color as The Hidden Opponent logo. It’s to raise awareness as an athletic community for mental health,” senior health science major Emily Cavanaugh said. “I think mental health is so overlooked, especially in athletics and sports culture. As a community at LIU, I think we definitely need to touch upon this subject, especially now during COVID.”
“In athletics you can’t have a mental illness, nor can you have an eating disorder, or any psychiatric issues because your coaches always tell you to push harder,” Cavanaugh said. “I think that as a community, wearing the ribbons is showing your support for those who do have a mental illness. It makes it a much easier environment for those who are struggling to maybe talk about it with a fellow teenager or fellow classmate.”
The Hidden Opponent describes their community as a “safe space for all student-athletes to feel heard, supported, and loved.” They believe that people should be able to speak about mental health without being judged, or viewed as weak. 
Students can find out more about The Hidden Opponent by emailing randy.karlson@liu.edu or by following tho_liu on Instagram.

On Wednesday, Feb. 24, the writing center sponsored the second annual African American Read-In on campus via zoom. 
The African American Read-In has been an effort to encourage communities to read together, mainly focusing on African American books and authors. It was founded in 1990 by the Black Caucus of the National Council of Teachers of English. The purpose was to bring awareness to the significance of literature during Black History Month and has reached over six million individuals over the past 30 years. Public Safety Administrator & BSU Advisor Nilda Nelson has been hosting these events over the last two years on campus. 
Nelson is extremely passionate about these types of events offered to herself and others. 
“It was a beacon of hope. I can write as an administrator to fix a problem, however, I couldn’t write my own personal journey or express my own thoughts because there’s no room for that,” she said. “It’s been a year, I have been able to express myself as an African American, as a mother who raised Black youth and as an educator that fills a plight how America doesn’t champion African Americans the way they should”.
While this year’s events are much more subtle due to Covid, Nelson is committed to getting the most value out of it. 
“Last year, we had write-ups with poems, writers, dancers and therapists to talk about anxiety and oppression, curtailing this year to people just giving their stories,” she said. 
Nelson was very motivated to share this experience with as many people as possible. 
“With the Post 101 class this year, we used herstory as the textbook theme, teaching empathy and compassion,” she said. 
Nelson Claims it was much easier to schedule the events this year as compared to last year. 
“Everyone knew about it, everyone was in their homes, they didn’t have to worry about traveling. Last year we used the theatre, had audio and had Uniondale high school perform,” she said. “This year, it was much calmer because people that couldn’t speak could, and we had more people willing to come in and express themselves.”
Nelson loves having these events due to their effect it has on everyone involved. 
“It’s a platform to tell stories. Alumni do work stories not told at work. If you’re not writing where and when do you find the time, being in a group, you find time to do it,” she said. “It’s great to have alumni with current students, so they don’t feel alone as they tell their story or know someone who’s gone through different experiences and learning about it. You remember lines that are important.”

This past Saturday, March 6, the Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA) Club on campus put on a cabaret that celebrated artists of color. With 13 artists from freshman to senior, this student-run cabaret was directed, proposed, edited and produced, completely by students. 
The show opened with freshman theatre arts major Ester Vianna doing a voice over on her experiences as a BIPoC artist. Vianna outlines a specific instance when a white actor was chosen over her for a role that was written for an actor of color.
“The colorblind casting was not a color conscious casting,” Vianna said. 
She detailed many instances where this turned out to be the case. After her voice over, Vianna sang a song from the role she was not chosen for, and this cabaret gave her that platform to do so.
Sophomore musical theatre major Luna Giovenella directed the cabaret, and worked hard to put it together. 
“I’ve had them send me songs that they want to sing, and songs that I’ve chosen for them because you have a limited repertoire to choose from as non-white people,” Giovenella said.
In the end, Giovenella put together a cabaret of songs that meant a lot to the actors singing them, as well as Giovenella herself. 
“Thankfully a lot of them have songs in their native languages they want to sing or songs from Brazillian musicals or things that we don’t typically look at from a western perspective,” Giovenella said.
Songs came from musicals and shows such as “In The Heights,” “Hamilton,” and “Coco.”
“I’m singing ‘Proud Corazon’ from ‘Coco.’ I’m singing in front of a gorgeous Puerto Rican flag in the background. This is one of the first times that I’ve been very open about my own cultural identities in the department,” junior musical theatre major Sophie Quiñones said.
This cabaret is special for Quiñones because she proposed it to the ESTA board, along with Yaya Muñoz. In her freshman year, Quiñones was in this show the first and only year it took place until this weekend. Quiñones hopes to make it an annual event. 
“Now as the diversity and inclusion member of the ESTA board, I brought this back because I think it’s very important to always make sure everyone’s voice is being heard, especially in theatre,” Quiñones said. 
Giovanella, Quiñones and Vianna wanted to put a message out to their theatre department and the rest of the campus with this cabaret.
“I think if there’s any message, it’s just: pay attention. Not necessarily that you have to enjoy this certain thing because this person did it or anything, but just like, here’s my space to speak and your space to listen,” Giovanella said. 
If students missed the cabaret this year, they can catch it in the years to come. 
“It’s going to be something very special you don’t want to miss,” Quiñones said.

On Sunday, Feb. 28, Hollywood gathered at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, to celebrate the 78th Annual Golden Globe Awards. 
Tina Fey and Amy Pohler took to the stage to present the winners with their awards. 
Breaking from the norms of the annual ceremony, Poehler and Fey hosted the event on separate coasts stitched together by the broadcasting company. Instead of performing in front of a room full of celebrities, both comedians performed in front of a room filled with first responders. 
Though many actors and actresses were rewarded for their exemplary performances, some controversy arose regarding the nonprofit Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). According to an article published by the Los Angeles Times, the HFPA has been known to engage in unethical practices such as issuing payments to its members and taking kickbacks from celebrities to whom the organization has issued awards. 
In addition to shady dealings, the Los Angeles Times also revealed that there is not one Black member among the 87 people that make up the HFPA. This caused people to suspect that a number of Black directors and cast members were not nominated for awards even though many believed they deserved to be. 
Tina Fey and Amy Pohler discussed this controversy in their opening remarks. “You gotta change that,” Fey said. 
A spokesperson for the HFPA told the Los Angeles Times that allegations of unethical practices and racial bias are “entirely false.” 
“Nomadland” won the award for Best Motion Picture: Drama. “Nomadland”’s director Chloe Zhao won the award for Best Director: Motion Picture. Zhao also made history by being the first Asian woman to win Best Picture Drama as a producer. 
Andra Day, who starred in “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” won the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture: Drama. 
Sacha Baron Cohen, who starred in “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,” won the award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture: Comedy. “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” also won the award for Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy. 
Chadwick Boseman, who starred in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” won the award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture: Drama. 
“The Queen’s Gambit” won the award for Best Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television. Actress Anya Taylor-Joy won the award for Best Actress in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television.
Gillian Anderson, who starred in “The Crown,” won the award for Best Supporting Actress: Television. Actor Josh O’Connor won the award for Best Actor in a Television Series: Drama. “The Crown” also won the award for Best Television Series: Drama. Actress Emma Corrin won the award for Best Actress in a Television Series: Drama. 
“I thought this show was awesome,” sophomore history major James Bracco said. “I’m really into history, and I thought this show was such an amazing representation of the time period. It makes me wish I was there, in a sense.” 
Jodie Foster, who starred in “The Mauritanian,” won the award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. 
“I’m really happy she won,” freshman film major Jessica Huntsman said. “I really enjoyed some of her movies like ‘Taxi Driver’ and ‘The Silence of the Lambs,’ and I enjoyed this movie, too. She’s a great actor, so the award is well-deserved.” 
“Minari” won the award for Best Motion Picture: Foreign Language. 
Rosamund Pike, who starred in “I Care a Lot,” won the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy.
“Schitt’s Creek” won the award for Best Television Series: Drama. Actress Catherine O’Hara won the award for Best Actress in a Television Series: Musical or Comedy. 
“This show is absolutely hilarious,” senior film major Donna Neil said. “I’ve seen every episode at least twice, and every time I laugh so hard. ‘Schitt’s Creek’ deserves every single award it wins.” 
Jason Sudeikis, who starred in “Ted Lasso,” won the award for Best Actor in a Television Series: Musical or Comedy. 
“Io Si” (Seen), a song featured in “The Life Ahead,”  won the award for Best Original Song: Motion Picture. 
“Soul” won the award for Best Original Score: Motion Picture. “Soul” also won for Best Motion Picture: Animated. 
Aaron Sorkin, who directed “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” won the award for Best Screenplay: Motion Picture. 
Mark Ruffalo, who starred in “I Know This Much Is True,” won the award for Best Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television. 
John Boyega, who starred in “Small Axe,” won the award for Best Supporting Actor: Television. 
Daniel Kaluuya, who starred in “Judas and the Black Messiah,” won the award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. 
“In spite of the many controversies surrounding the event, I was pleased with the winners,” junior communications major Carter Joseph said. “Both men and women were rewarded for the amazing performances, and many different types of films were honored for their uniqueness.” 
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Fey and Pohler commended the winners and hoped to see a happier and healthier America in the coming months.

“Malcolm and Marie” is an American, black-and-white romantic-drama starring Zendaya Coleman and John-David Washington. The film follows the filmmaker Malcolm and his girlfriend Marie after the premiere of Malcolm’s latest movie. The couple examines Marie’s role in the premiere as well as the complexities of their relationship in this almost two-hour film. 
The movie was created after Coleman had to suspend filming for her role in HBO series “Euphoria.” Coleman and “Euphoria” filmmaker Sam Levinson wanted to see if they could create a movie during quarantine and “Malcolm and Marie” was the outcome. The movie was shot in a Northern California house in two weeks. 
 In an article published by the New York Times, co-star Zendaya Coleman explained the creativity on set, 
“You know, it’s funny if you would have told us that there would be a conversation around, you know, awards or whatever, that’s crazy! We were all just figuring it out together,” Coleman said. 
 Coleman also talked about some of the details of the movie, “The film’s script was largely panned and set off several discussions on social media about the age difference between the stars.” This is because Washington is currently 36 while Zendaya is 24. Their age difference is 12 years. 
Post alumna Samantha Uebel shared her thoughts on the movie.
 “The first impression is that the movie seems suspenseful, sad, and bitterly truthful. Love isn’t as simple as people think it is,” she said. 
She goes on to speak on the classic look of the movie.
 “I think putting the movie into black and white added an old Hollywood glamour to it, which is ironic because it’s supposed to be about the realities of love and life.” 
Uebel says that she identifies with Malcolm as a character. 
“I’m similar to him in that way, I’m also a hopeless romantic,” she said. 
She speculated on the time the film took place, stating that, “I think this movie is set around the 80s because of Marie’s dress and makeup.”
Charli Beshers, another alumnus of Post campus who graduated with a mathematics major, loves the film. 
“First of all, I think it’s very important that it’s a love story with people of color in it,” she said. “I feel like those are very much things that are coming to the forefront nowadays but we’re still lagging a lot when it comes to diversity- but not just diversity but diversity being natural.” 
John David Washington is African American, and Zendaya has mixed ethnicities of African American, German and Scottish. 
Beshers goes on to explain the nuances of a relationship through the film’s use of black and white.
 “Love isn’t just about the good moments. It’s about the good, the bad, the ugly, the amazing, all the in-between, no black and white- just grey areas because things aren’t black and white in real life.”

Students entering Hillwood Commons may have noticed a bustling kitchen in the room next to Subway. This kitchen has been closed since the start of the spring semester, but now houses the campus’s newest eatery, Sazon Mexican Grill.
Featuring a menu of quesadillas, Sazon takes the place of Bamboo, a ramen shop that used to operate in Hillwood. Students will have a choice between cheese, chicken, beef, or vegetarian quesadillas. 
Students had disagreements over the quality of the food. 
Sophomore education major Alexandra Smith likes the food and is happy to see it come to campus, while sophomore psychology major Kristina Lavardera thought the food was “okay.”
“They weren’t very consistent. I got it yesterday and today, the first day the chicken was shredded, today it wasn’t [and] it was very greasy,” she said.
Junior criminal justice major Schuyler Valensky loved the food and described it as “bussin.”
Both sophomore education major Brooke Tanner and Valensky agree that while Sazon is better than Bamboo, it doesn’t compare to Twisted Taco, the eatery that had previously been in that location.
Students who are interested in trying Sazon’s food can visit them in Hillwood Commons during common hour.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. This will become the third vaccine to be approved after Pfiezer and Moderna. A panel of experts from the FDA unanimously voted to approve the vaccine for emergency use on Feb. 26. 
The emergency-use authorization will be distributed to people 18 years or older, while also rapidly increasing the availability of the vaccine because it requires one shot. Pfiezer requires two doses to be taken 21 days apart, which has been a difficulty for many people trying to get the vaccine.
“The authorization of this vaccine expands the availability of vaccines, the best medical prevention method for COVID-19, to help us in the fight against this pandemic, which has claimed over half a million lives in the United States,”  FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said in a release statement.
Johnson and Johnson submitted their application to the FDA on Feb. 4, and one dose was shown to be 77 percent effective against a severe COVID-19 case in a massive study which spanned across three continents. The company said that their plan is to deliver 10 million doses to the U.S. and increase that to 100 million by the summer. 
The vaccine effectiveness rate raises concerns for students such as junior nursing major Jahaila Harley.
“Effectiveness of a drug is vital and this vaccine being at a lower rate than the other two that are available does not seem to be in the best interest of the public,” she said. “The main goal of drug development is effectiveness and safety.” 
Harley does believe however people will be more inclined to choose the Johnson and Johnson vaccine over the Moderna and Pfiezer options. 
“I think because Johnson & Johnson is such a trusted household name, many people will feel more willing to get this one,” she said. “For those who are still skeptical I would tell them it’s only normal to feel hesitant since COVID-19 has only been publicized for one year. However, just like every other sickness and disease over the years, doctors and scientists have dedicated their time and knowledge to aid the public and prevent more deaths. Vaccines have been effective for other diseases and infections which even from a child have been administered to us. We have trusted those, let us now trust science and technology once more because things and time change.”
President Joe Biden announced on March 2 that because of the help by manufacturer Merck & Co., there will be enough vaccines available for the entire U.S. adult population by May.

The Roosevelt School offers various academic programs, including a BA in international relations and diplomacy, a 5-Year BA/MBA in international relations & diplomacy/masters of business administration and a PhD in information studies. 
The Roosevelt School will prepare students for policy making at corporations and foundations, leadership positions, service opportunities, careers in international relations, diplomacy work, think-tanks, and work in governmental agencies and non-profit organizations. 
In an email to students, the university describes the BA in international relations and diplomacy as “a comprehensive examination of international relations, diplomat, and service.” The 5-Year BA/MBA is described as “a shared-credit degree program leading to an undergraduate and graduate degree in five years.” The PhD in Information Studies is described to prepare “leaders to assume positions in research, teaching, and practice.” 
University President Dr. Kimberly R. Cline is excited for the new school.
“Long Island University is proud to further build upon the exceptional heritage of the Roosevelts,” she said in a press release. “The Roosevelt School will prepare students to achieve success in a global society by guiding them to become well-informed, critically-minded and engaged citizens.”
The Roosevelt School is named after the Roosevelt family, mainly inspired by Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt.
The centers and institutes at the Roosevelt School will provide research opportunities, public seminars, workshops, educational programs and conferences for students in the programs.
The school will be open for the fall 2021 semester; the university is currently accepting applications. The Roosevelt School is for both Long Island University’s Brookville and Brooklyn campuses. 
The Roosevelt School maintains the Roosevelt legacy at LIU by offering educational opportunities for students interested in global relations, diplomacy, leadership and service. 
The school will be giving scholarships to select students in the Roosevelt School programs.
“This is a great addition to LIU. I know a lot of students that would be interested in attending,” junior music education major Diane Marques said. “I think the new school is going to bring a lot of opportunities to students.”
The great-grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, Tweed Roosevelt, is the chairman of the Roosevelt School. He is a professor at Long Island University, as well as the chairman of the Theodore Roosevelt Institute.
Tweed Roosevelt earned his BA from Harvard University and his MBA from Columbia University’s School of Business. He was also a professor at Harvard and Columbia, and earned his Doctorate of humane letters.
“On behalf of the entire Roosevelt family, we are proud that Long Island University will honor the legacy of our family through the formation of The Roosevelt School,”  Tweed Roosevelt said in a statement about the new school. “This exciting academic venture will prepare graduates to carry forth the highest standards of professionalism, diplomacy and integrity represented by the extraordinary and unparalleled reputations of Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt.”
“I’ve been thinking about getting a doctorate, but I haven’t found a program that I like yet. I’m really happy to hear about this,” senior psychology major Brianna Weizerman said. “I looked at their doctorate program and it seems really interesting. I’m definitely going to consider the Roosevelt School for getting my PhD,” she said. 
The university launched the Theodore Roosevelt Institute in 2018. The Theodore Roosevelt Institute, along with the Global Service Institute, and the Steven S. Hornstein Center for Policy, Polling, and Analysis are all now part of The Roosevelt School. 
The Theodore Roosevelt Institute is used for research, workshops, public seminars, educational programs, and conferences. The Global Service Institute helps prepare students for professional or personal lives dedicated to service, and provides advanced educational initiatives. 
The Steven S. Hornstein Center for Policy, Polling, and Analysis informs people about critical issues, trends, and attitudes in the world. This center will help provide The Roosevelt School with research, analysis, and independent polling. 
“We are proud to offer such a vibrant curriculum, designed for today’s interdependent world, which will equip students with the ability to think and act globally,” LIU Board of Trustees Chairman Eric Krasnoff said in a statement. “The Roosevelt School exemplifies Long Island University’s position as a nationally recognized research and teaching institution.”
