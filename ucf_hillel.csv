Here at KnightNews.com, we decided to take an inside look to see what exactly goes on at a Jewish wedding. It was held on Saturday, Sept. 12 in the Venue (the old UCF Arena). Hundreds of students poured in wearing their semi-formal wedding attire ready to bring the Venue to life.\nOf course, like most weddings, there is a bride and groom, they say their vows and exchange rings and get wedding dress alterations.

Tommy Oreste kicks off our 2009 SGA Senate Race coverage with this exclusive analysis:\n———————————\nWhen the dawn breaks and the polls open for UCF’s student Senate elections this fall, one thing is for certain: there will be at least two major tickets battling for control of arguably the most influential and representative branch of Student Government.\nIf past experience has taught us anything, it is also likely that there may be at least one, if not more, smaller tickets that usually distinguish themselves either by college, or by ideology, as is commonly the case with the Progressive ticket.\nFor those of you who remember the Presidential elections from last Spring, it appears as though many of this Fall’s election participants have chosen similar sides yet again\nAmong the many student senators who supported Peterson and Andrick was the current incumbent Speaker of the Senate Patrick Stauffer.\nStauffer, as well as other members of student government have organized a ticket that appears to include himself, as well as current Senate Pro Tempore Josh Miller and several other incumbent Senators.\nThe Speaker position is highly coveted, not to mention quite well-paid, so it is not a surprise that Stauffer is looking to get his job back. Often times the ticket that wins the majority of the seats, has the ability to elect the Senate leadership, as is the case in all levels of government with a two-party system.\nHowever, it will not be a walk in the park for Stauffer’s ticket to win a majority of the seats this Fall.\nIt appears as though the formation of a predominantly Greek ticket, with members who were supportive of Stein and Peckham in the most recent presidential election, may be a major obstacle for the incumbent speaker to overcome. Stein, now a KnightNews.com entertainment reporter, says he is not running in this race.\nAs for the Greeks, it was not long ago when they had a stronghold on Student Government, and it appears as if they are looking to regain some of that prominence this year.\nThis ticket also appears to have the support and experience of numerous Student Government veterans, including former Sen. Jereme Pozin.\nEvery year there are Greeks spread throughout the different tickets because the support of their respective organizations makes them great running mates. If they all stand together this year, the status quo could be overthrown and an entirely new 42nd student Senate and leadership could emerge.\nRegardless of the outcome of this fall’s election, there is no doubt that it will be hotly contested. Pizza will be bountiful, laptops and tables will be at the entrance to every building and campaigners will nag you to vote every chance they get.\nLook forward to Senate elections 2009 as they should be quite the scene!\nOur exclusive analysis at KnightNews.com will continue over the next few days with more depth and detail about this election.\nStay tuned for updates.']","['\nDuring the weekend a monumental event occured on campus…“My Big Fat Jewish Wedding.”\n\nHillel at UCF has made big strides in bringing elements of the Jewish tradition to the UCF campus.

They’re asking fans to be vigilant, and promptly report any suspicious packages. \nUncertainty is a major element in this mix — especially with New York City’s proposed Islamic Center that’s become known as the Ground Zero Mosque now embroiled in the controversy. The pastor has gone back and forth on whether he’ll move forward with plans to burn the Quran in Gainesville Saturday, based largely on the future of that mosque. \nEarly this week, Jones made it seem there was no stopping the even his church scheduled for 9/11. Then, when Orlando Imam Muhammad Musri, the president of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, went to Gainesville to meet with Jones Thursday, the two religious leaders emerged for a press conference where Jones announced he would cancel the Quran burning because a deal to move the proposed mosque near Ground Zero had been reached.\n\nWhen the New York iman, Feisal Abdul Rauf, said there was no such deal, Jones told media he was lied to because the Orlando imam assured him three times a deal was reached. At that point, Jones changed the Quran burning’s status from cancelled to suspended, while he travels to New York City with the Orlando imam to meet with the New York imam to try and negotiate a peaceful resolution. \nMeanwhile, students from USF, UF and residents of Gainesville are waiting and watching to see what happens next, as violence over the controversy is blamed for at least one death abroad. The Orlando iman told Jones his planned burning would be used as a recruitment tool for terrorists in mosques across Muslim countries as the Holy month of Ramadan concludes over the next few days. \nProtests against Jones have turned violent, and even deadly abroad. A Muslim protester was shot and killed and many others were wounded at a NATO base in Afghanistan when 10,000 protested together on Friday, according to the New York Daily News. \nPresident Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, General David Petraeus and other world leaders have all come out publicly urging Jones to cancel the burning, but the firestorm of controversy may now be too late to stop before the holy books get burned. \nA church leader in Springfield, Tennessee, Rev. Bob Old, told media he planned to burn the Koran Saturday and had no plans to back down. \n“I will be burning a Koran, I’m not going to change my mind no matter who calls me,” Old told the Tennessean paper.\nThe controversial Westboro Baptist Church has reportedly come out and declared its membership would burn the Quran if Jones cancels his. \nThe New York Daily News reported the church issued this news release to Ocala.com: \n“WBC burned the Koran once – and if you sissy brats of Doomed America bully Terry Jones and the Dove World Outreach Center until they change their plans to burn that blasphemous tripe called the Koran, then WBC will burn it (again), to clearly show you some things,” the release read.\nA Wyoming paper is reporting a man plans to burn a Quran on the state capital steps on Saturday, Sept. 11. If there’s a rule against burning, he promised to rip the Holy book up at the capital and then burn it at a private residence later that day. \nIn Afghanistan, American flags and an effigy of Pastor Jones have already been torched in the streets. \n\nKnightNews.com will continue following this developing story.']","['As the third week of the Fall semester comes to a close many UCF students are left longing for the comfort, love and financial support of life at home.

Regardless, having football games during fall semester is just one of the many things students look forward to attending during their time at UCF.\nIn comparison to spring semester, when basketball season is the main sport in season, and summer semester, which can be as short as just six weeks, McKeel finds fall semester to be the hardest to maintain good grades.\n“There has definitely been times I should’ve studied but instead I just went to tailgate,” McKeel said. “I’ve taken a handful of tests after a game weekend and have not done so well, but I guess that is because I rather tailgate then study.”\nAlthough McKeel maintains a B average in his academics, he believes that if he wasn’t such a huge football fan he could likely have a higher GPA average.\n“A lot of my test grades end up being a C after game weekends,” McKeel said. “But I bet if I didn’t go tailgate and focused on studying, I could easily have gotten a B or maybe even an A.”\nUCF student Josh Poffenberger is a huge fan of football, but finds football season non- detrimental to his academics during fall semester.\n“I love football. I live for football. I go to as many UF games as possible,” Poffenberger said. “In fact, I travel to Gainesville almost every time there is a home game for the Gators, and when I don’t go to Gainesville I am at Memory Mall.”\nPoffenberger, being married and having a three-year-old daughter, knows that doing well in school is vital to finding a steady career to provide for his family. He handles his football season and grades as best as he can, but he admits that sometimes he slips up.\n“I try to do all my studying days before any football game weekend,” Poffenberger said. “My family and I will travel to Gainesville for the game and then stay with friends for the rest of the weekend, so there really isn’t much time to study or even cram for my test during the weekend.”\nWith being so proactive when it comes to studying during the fall semester, Poffenberger can’t say he does the same for spring semester.\n“Spring semester is the hardest semester for me to get through,” Poffenberger said. “The way I see it, it’s just a few more months ‘til summer vacation and being able to relax for a few months. Plus there is Spring Break, enough said.”\nPoffenberger is not only a football fanatic; he is also a huge basketball fan. During spring semester, both the NBA and NCAA basketball seasons are on going which makes it tough for him to study.\n“Basketball season kills me more than football season does when it comes to studying. With the NBA and March Madness going on, all I do is watch every game possible on TV,” Poffenberger said. “I also love watching the top collegiate teams battle it out.”\nGrace Madsen, a third year student, believes that handling school and a social life is difficult to handle, and that football season does not make it any easier.\n“Fall semester with football going on makes it really hard for me to focus on school,” Madsen said. “The games are usually on the weekends and that’s the time I normally try to focus on studying, but when it’s football season I like to go tailgating with my friends than try to catch up on my school work.”\nAlthough Madsen usually doesn’t attend the actual football game, she does enjoy dressing up in school spirit attire and walking around to meet new people and socialize.\n“I don’t really ever go watch the games,” Madsen said. “They can get really tiring, especially after a few hours of tailgating. Plus, most times I can just watch it on TV or ask my friends who go what the score is.”\nCaitlyn Rame is not affected at all by football season during fall semester in regards to her study habits and academic standing. However, there are times that football games interfere with her study habits.\n“Football really isn’t my thing. I would rather study or hang at home then go tailgate or go to a game,” Rame said. “I actually don’t like football season only because of how the school reacts to games,”\nRame said. “For example, closing the gym or the SGA printing lab on game day really bothers me. I don’t think they need to be closed down because some students like me, who would rather study, aren’t all into football.”\nIn brief, fall semester at UCF is a busy time for all students. Whether it is with studying, working out, attending football games, or a combination of all, students work hard to maintain a healthy balance.\n“I mean, football is always going to be around,” McKeel said. “But my parents money to pay for my college isn’t, so I really do need to start focusing more on my grades during football\nseason.”', '\nNearing a month ago, KnightNews.com reported that IFC Fraternity, Delta Tau Delta, had their charter revoked by their national headquarters for four years.\nSince they were suspended, a movement to reinstate Delta Tau Delta on Change.org has neared viral status around UCF in the few days that it is been online. On Monday, the petition reached over 1,000 signatures with comments from different sororities and fraternities showing their support to get the fraternity back on campus.\nAccording to the petition, written by Andy Baumbach, “Zeta Omicron chapter of Delta Tau Delta is desirous in coming back as a stronger, better organized, and a more dedicated chapter than ever before. We firmly believe that the men of this chapter can assist the Orlando community in a positive manner and be a strong beneficiary to Greek life at UCF.

You know there will be a lot of other students graduating with you, but it’s only a four hour affair, right?\nFor anybody who’s been to a graduation ceremony before, you know that the fun doesn’t start until someone is reading names off a card while you’re rushed across the stage to pick up an empty certificate folder and stumble down the other side, blinded by the photographer you didn’t even know was taking your picture. And that’s it. You’re done.\nBut I digress. On Dec. 12 and 13 you will be participating in a time honored ceremony that brings pomp and circumstance to the toil and trouble you’ve endured learning how to think, how to create, how to research and how to find truth and meaning in the tiniest details.\nIf it’s been a while since your last commencement ceremony (or if you just want some insight into what’s going on), here’s the breakdown on what can expect to happen at UCF’s Fall 2014 Graduation Ceremony:\nEach ceremony begins an hour-and-a-half before anybody gets up on stage to speak. This means you need to find a parking spot an hour before that. Keep in mind, UCF wants you park in C, D, and F; but you know better than that. The campus roads are going to be filled with stressed out parents and crazy aunts and screaming kids all rushing to find Gemini Boulevard and missing their turns and freaking out because they need to get a good seat. You’ve been at this campus long enough to know that the easiest place to park will be H and I. Plus that gives you a chance to stop at Starbucks before you trek down Memory Mall.\nUCF is not lining up by GPA, nor alphabetically. You, along with a swarm of other students you’ve never seen before, will be rounded up and lined up according to your school. Where you stand in the line determines where you sit for the ceremony. Front of the line equals front seat, etc.\nI’ve heard it said that the best place to sit is in the back. That way once it’s your turn to cross the stage, the whole thing is over and you’re free to go. Compared to crossing the stage early and then you’re stuck for another hour waiting, wondering if your family got a good picture of you stumbling across stage, laughing because the announcer doesn’t know how to pronounce your friend’s name or crying because you your hair was in the way when the photographer took your picture. Once you’re sitting down, the fun begins. You’ll hear from faculty and staff, the Valedictorian, and a special guest speaker.\nOn Friday, Alan Ginsberg will be guest-speaking to graduates of the College of Education and Human Performance, the College of Health and Public Affairs, and the Rosen College of Hospitality Management. Alan Ginsberg is a big-time donor to UCF and many Central Florida establishments. According to his bio-page on the Lowndes Attorney page, he’s donated millions of dollars to the Rollins Hamilton Holt School, is active in UCF’s Jewish studies and its Hillel Foundation, but what he is might be best known for is his $4 million dollar donation to UCF’s College of Medicine.\nSaturday’s commencement ceremony is graduating students from the College of Medicine, the College of Optics and Photonics, The College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Business administration.

Hitt in a release. “He was an astute academic leader with a keen vision. As president, I greatly valued his advice and contributions to our university.”\nKnown as the “Scholar President,” Colbourn held degrees from the University of London, the College of William and Mary, and Johns Hopkins University. \nIn 2001, the Humanities and Fine Arts Building was renamed Colbourn Hall in honor of Trevor Colbourn. ', '\nIn a post-season filled with questionable rulings, narrow victories and underdog comebacks, we now have only the conference championships to look forward to before Super Bowl Sunday is upon us once more. \nThis weekend featured two of the closest games of the season along with a surprise upset, as the Indianapolis Colts prevented the Denver Broncos from another Super Bowl appearance, and a last minute slaughter when the Seattle Seahawks put the Carolina Panthers back in their place.\nThe weekend began with the Baltimore Ravens heading to Foxboro to face the New England Patriots in a game that was decided by an interception thrown by Joe Flacco in the last two minutes of the game, cinching the Patriots’ advancement, with a final score of 31-35.\nThe second game of the night featured a team no one expected to make it past the first round, the Carolina Panthers, who took on last year’s Super Bowl champions, the Seattle Seahawks. Considering the fact that the Panthers were unable to even break the .500 barrier during the regular season, it was a shock to see them attain any success in the post-season. Unfortunately, it was impossible for them to keep that momentum going, as the Seahawks managed to dominate in the final, for a game ending score of 31-17.\nSunday began with a game that made up for last week’s highly questionable calls. \nWhen the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, many cried foul over some of the referees’ rulings. Well after the Cowboys loss to the Green Bay Packers, it seems balance has been restored to the universe. Green Bay’s victory was heavily dependent on a few decisions by the officials, which many saw as debatable.  One skeptical call would have placed the Cowboys on the Packers’ 1-yard line, but instead led to a change of possession and the Packers’ victory.\nThe final game of the week featured one of professional football’s most impressive quarterbacks once again deteriorate under pressure. Hoping to make it back to the Super Bowl once more, the Denver Broncos hosted the Indianapolis Colts, ending the game with a discouraging loss of 24-13. \nAfter last year’s abysmal Super Bowl appearance, some feared that Broncos’ quarterback Peyton Manning might prove unable to lead the team when it really counts. Sadly, those fears came to fruition, as Manning was unable to put up more than one touchdown and 211 yards, making it one of his most disappointing games given the stakes.\nNext Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks will host the Green Bay Packers at 3:05 P.M., while the Indianapolis Colts will head to New England to face the Patriots at 6:40 P.M.', '\nUCF fraternity spring rush is back once again as the

healthy resolutions are gone after a couple of failed gym attempts.\nKnightNews.com wants to remind you that becoming a better you doesn’t always have to be a drag and the UCF Recreation and Wellness Center is here to help with their group exercise classes.\nThe UCF RWC offers many group exercise classes to help fellow Knights get in shape. It’s a fun spin on a typical workout.\nAccording to the official UCF RWC Website, “various formats offered include but are not limited to: resistance training, mind/body, cardiovascular endurance, plyometrics, and spinning.”\nDon’t feel like running on the boring cardio machines? Try taking Hip-Hop Cardio instead.\nRunning tight on time and need a fast workout? an Express Spin class is the perfect solution.\nSome classes offered are Hot Yoga, Kickboxing, and Zumba, but there are many more. With so many to choose from, there is a class for everyone. For a complete list of classes and descriptions, click here.\nOnline registration for the classes begins 24 hours before their start time. Students must log in with their myRWC barcode (PID without the letter) and account pin (birthday in the YYMMDD format).\nStudents must arrive 15 minutes before their class starts to lock in their spot. Walk-ins are welcome, but are not guaranteed admission.\nStudents looking to get a good work out should really take advantage of these classes. They are also great for those who are new to the gym and do not know where to begin. Group exercise makes getting in shape and keeping a New Year’s resolution a little more enjoyable.\nFor a full list of classes make sure to check out the official group exercise schedule.', '\nDill pickle, buffalo, and black bean— these are the disruptive, inventive flavors the “hummus rebel,” also known as UCF student Jesse Wolfe, CEO of O’Dang Hummus, created that could be sitting on the shelves of some major grocery stores soon.\nAfter taking third place in the Joust, the UCF College of Business Administration’s Business Plan Competition, Wolfe was selling his hummus at Lake Eola and other farmer’s markets, making 300 tubs of hummus a week.\nRoughly eight months since he started O’Dang Hummus, Wolfe’s business has dramatically progressed.\nWe first told you about Wolfe and O’Dang Hummus in September of 2014. A little over a month later, Wolfe placed second in Blackstone’s  first LaunchPad Demo Day in New York City, winning $15,000.\n“UCF has done so much for us,” Wolfe said. “From the start, the one thing everyone needs to know that Blackstone Launchpad isn’t out to steal your ideas or take part of your company. In return, the school gets huge recognition. Four teams out of 20 were from UCF.”\nThe Blackstone Launchpad is a student-serving organization that is supported by The Blackstone Charitable Foundation, which seeks to support innovative projects and catalytic ideas that can accelerate start-ups, job growth and economic activity.\n“I would say I received $150,000, if I had to put a price on it, in help with free legal advice, referrals, and countless introductions to important, crucial people,” Wolfe said. “When it came to my accounting needs, they referred me to someone. They don’t take any of your patent. It’s literally an incubator to help you. From the moment you walk in, you time stamp your idea. Everything is confidential.”\nWolfe was also featured twice on Fox35’s Good Morning Orlando. While on the show, Wolfe met the owner of The Meat House in Winter Park. Just a few months later, the product now sits on the shelves at The Meat House with the new labels his team created.\n“You set yourself up three to five years [for your business plan]. Our year one is out the window. We’ve grown much faster than we projected. We are past the introductory phase we planned for Jan. 1,” Wolfe said.\nWhen asked about the future plans for O’Dang Hummus being in other stores, Wolfe said he couldn’t reveal the names of the stores because the contracts still have to be finalized, but he discussed his plan to dominate the hummus industry of Orlando.\n“We have one of our final meetings next Wednesday. We are waiting to finalize, but we have interest in three, large national chains. All we really need is one of those. If all goes through, it would be located in the Dr. Phillips area.  The next chain will put us in all of Orlando,” Wolfe said.\nHe doesn’t want to stop there.\n“Our business plan isn’t to build a giant facility, instead utilize smaller facilities across the country. It would be easier for us to allow Amazon to fulfill it. We want to be the first hummus business through Amazon,” Wolfe said.\nHe still plans to launch his to-go pack and a website, which he says will be ready in a couple of months. He also says that his crazy flavors have no end.\n“We have a bacon hummus and garlic-Parmesan flavor. Brownie batter dip, which is a black bean dip that taste like brownie batter. We beta tested it two weeks ago and it went very well.”\nAs Wolfe’s business plan and flavors are growing, he still plans to be a contestant on ABC’s “Shark Tank” in the near future.', '\nUCF All-American Second Team cornerback Jacoby Glenn will enter the 2015 NFL Draft, Glenn announced on his Instagram Tuesday morning.\n“I want to take the time to thank George O’Leary and tell my UCF Knight’s family that I enjoyed my time at the school and especially enjoyed playing for you guys,” Glenn posted. “I wish everybody the best on success, but it’s time to take my talent to the next level.”\nGlenn, a redshirt sophomore, is coming off of one of the most spectacular seasons ever by a UCF cornerback. This past season he ranked third in the nation with seven interceptions and third with 18 passes defended. He was one of 50 student-athletes to be named to either the AP All-American First or Second teams and was just one of 13 underclassmen named to the list. \nUCF has seen turbulent coaching changes so far this off-season, former DB coach Kirk Callahan left for Florida, former offensive coordinator Charlie Taaffe retired and former defensive coordinator Tyson Summers left for Colorado State.\nJunior wide receiver Breshad Perriman also declared early for the NFL draft. \nGlenn finishes his UCF career sixth in program history with nine interceptions.']","['\nUCF fraternity spring rush is back once

Hitt Library was for more than checking out books and study sessions. The building hung up the secrets of eleven members of the UCF faculty and staff. Their secret? Art. One might have never suspected that a professor or someone working in one of the many offices on campus was a “Hidden Artist,” as the exhibit was rightfully named. It was the third year that this event has taken place to spotlight the talents of UCF’s staff. \nImmediately, one could be drawn in to the crystal-clear photographs by Gina Clifton, an Admissions Specialist. Clifton’s photos included a dazzling golden sunset, few of colorful birds and an obvious love for art.\n“My passion for photography comes from a love of nature, people, places, and life. I enjoy capturing that moment in time and sharing it with other people. The gallery exhibit gave me another outlet for sharing my photographs,” Clifton shared. \nAmong the most heartfelt pieces was the very first on display, titled “We Are…” by IT Business Analyst Senior Dawn Herrod which was a collection of photographs taken in wake of the tragedy at the Pulse Nightclub and displayed how the community came together to show their support for Orlando. \n“I spent several days visiting the memorials, often just sitting on the hot sidewalk reading the signs and notes, watching other visitors, and even taking water to the homeless man who watched over the site at Dr. Phillips. I think I took literally hundreds of photos of the memorials, visitors, and even one of the victims who was wheeled out of the hospital by his nurses to visit his friends’ crosses,” Herrod said.\n“For the first time in my life, I saw a local and national outpouring of support for the LGBTQ community. It is unfortunate that sometimes it takes a tragic loss to soften people’s hearts, but somehow it did just that for many. Even if it was only for a short time, people were reminded that we are all just people trying to find our place in this world, trying to find love, joy, and safety. Taking the photos was therapeutic for me, helping me to process what happened. Putting the piece in the exhibit was my way of holding onto the support of the community just a little while longer.”\nThese artists don’t just sell copies of their artwork, they give back in ways that benefit the community. IT Department Manager Russell Muller, whose artwork features that of a dog sticking its head out of a window on a car ride, does just that. \n“I donate a percentage of all of my art sales to Halifax Humane Society, and they are my charity of choice when I make donations,” Muller said.\nThe focus of most of his images were classic cars. \nOther artists featured in this exhibit were Meredith Malkin, Pamela Williams Gruen, Simona Loh, Fiona Murphy, Judy Bragg Pardo, Brian Pate, and M.C Santana. The exhibit showed UCF’s community that staff members are much more than just staff members. They have incredible talents and are people with passions, just like students.\nLibrary image a rendering of a reading room a few years way from construction.', '\nThree chariots carrying the gods pulled through the campus for the Ratha Yatra celebration on Wednesday.\nThe annual Festival of the Chariots, as it’s called, opened as volunteers carried bright and lavish chariots in a large parade from Pegasus Circle to the Student Union at UCF, before hosting a multicultural celebration in the Pegasus ballroom encouraging tolerance of other faiths.\nThe ceremony represents the humanization of God according to Professor Deepa Nair, a Faculty Advisor for the Indian Student Association.\n“It is an opportunity to see God and for him to see us,” Nair said.\nRatha Yatra honors Lord Krishna’s return to Vrindaban and originated over 5,000 years ago in India, in a city called Jagannatha Puri. The three wooden chariots are present for the three deities, Lord Balarama and Lady Subhadra, and namely the “Lord of the Universe,” Jagannatha.\nHigh energy dances and drums filled the ballroom echoing the same chants that accompanied the Chariot parade which circled the Student Union in the afternoon.\nEnthusiasts joyously dancing and chanting the “Lord’s Holy Names” remind those in attendance just how universal religious traditions are:\nHare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare\nHare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.\nNot unlike Allah or Yahweh, Jehovah or Jesus Christ, the supreme deity at the center of the Hindu occasion is the source of dutiful pride for those in attendance but people involved insist the festival is anything but religious.\nShraddhanjali Devidasi of the Hare Krishna Society described it as “a cultural outreach.” Similarly, Dvaipayana Das of UCF’s Sangam Club said: “this is about spirituality and self-realization, not religion.”\nThe chariot procession and wellness festival is part of a larger effort to tell people about the ancient civilization of India in colleges around the U.S. by groups like the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) who organized the event and performs around the world.\nSeveral hundreds of students and enthusiasts from all backgrounds partook in the diverse celebration ranging from a Bhakti Yoga session, vegetarian Indian foods, sacred dance, and a lengthy musical performance from The Mayapuris and lasted nearly nine hours.\nThe diversity of the crowd even surprised Das who glanced into the ballroom at those enjoying the art of a Hindu sculptor. “We do not consider any boundaries, anybody comes.”\nUndoubtedly, the sight of an open and embracing Hindu tradition greeting new faces with Kirtan world music and what they called prasadam (free food) is more than welcome.\nFor leaders like Nair the spiritual passion of the festival is crucial. “The times that we are living in, we need to be aware of the different cultures and be respectful of different cultural ideas and identities.”\n\xa0', '\nA young woman attends a sexual morality conference at the Student Union, listening intently.\nIn front of her, a panel of religious leaders discusses their views on gender equality, homosexuality, and transgender visibility. It’s an odd topic, to be sure, but one that she said she finds fascinating. She studiously takes notes throughout.\nWhen asked why she was personally invested in the conference, her answer was simple.\n“I’m gay and I want to be a rabbi,” she said. “So I want to promote a better cultural understanding within religion.”\nKayla Symonds, a sophomore religion and cultural studies major at UCF, is the president of BAGELS+, a club for Jewish members of the LGBTQ+ community. BAGELS+ (an acronym for Bisexual, Asexual, Gay, Exploring and Lesbian Students) is a part of Central Florida Hillel, a Jewish cultural center for college students in the Central Florida area. As president of BAGELS+, Symonds plans events such as celebrations of Jewish holidays and scriptural readings.\n“There’s a lot more of us than you’d think,” Symonds said.\nAccording to Central Florida Hillel’s mission page, UCF has the third largest Jewish student population outside of Israel, with an estimated 6,000 Jewish students attending. UCF is also well-known for its LGBTQ+ inclusive\xa0environment – it’s the only Florida school to make Campus Pride’s Top 50 LGBT-Friendly List as of 2014. The combined support from the Jewish and LGBTQ+ community made UCF the perfect environment for BAGELS+ to flourish.\nSymonds began working at Central Florida Hillel as a community engagement intern. She found her niche in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community after recognizing the need for more involvement.\n“I’ve always found the struggles of the Jewish community and the LGBTQ+ community linked,” Symonds said. “Anti-Semitism and homophobia are two issues we still face today. And being a member of both communities means being a minority within a minority.”\nSam Friedman, director of community relations at Central Florida Hillel, also recognized the importance of BAGELS+.\n“One of the things we’re most proud of is forming BAGELS+,” Friedman said. “We pride ourselves on being a center for the community, and the community means everybody.\nFor Symonds, Judaism is the foundation of her identity. She keeps her diet kosher, has a mezuzah (a scroll with Hebrew verses from the Torah) on her door, and observes Shabbat. A common misconception, she said, is believing that her religion conflicts with her sexuality.\n“When people find out that I’m gay and Jewish, they ask, ‘do you really believe in it [Judaism]?’, and the answer is yes. Yes, I am gay. Yes, I am religious. And yes, I am observant.”\nHomosexuality is a divisive issue within the Jewish community. The more conservative Orthodox Judaism generally disapproves of homosexuality, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism are more tolerant. Central Florida Hillel is firmly LGBTQ+ friendly.\n“Some Jewish organizations say that homosexuality is expressly forbidden in the book of Leviticus,” Friedman said. “But Abraham, the first Jew, was known for welcoming every guest that came to his tent. You can’t be like Abraham if you’re not going to welcome everybody.”\n“In Judaism, we have an expression: two Jews, three opinions. So a lot of different people will say a lot of different things,” Symonds said. “I firmly believe that it is up to you to interpret the text, and for me, the text embraces my identity.”\nAfter graduating UCF, Symonds said she plans to spend a year in Jerusalem before attending Hebrew Union College to continue her rabbinical studies. The college has campuses in Cincinnati, Jerusalem, Los Angeles and New York, but Symonds said she’s not sure where she wants to study just yet.\n“It depends on how things go with my girlfriend. We’re looking at schools near her,” Symonds said.\nSymonds said her faith in the Jewish LGBTQ+ community was reaffirmed in February.\nSymonds is active on Tumblr, and read the story of a German transgender woman who wanted to convert to Judaism. Her rabbi warned her that the beit din (a group of rabbis that oversee the conversion process) might require her to compromise her gender identity.\n“I thought that I might be able to help, so I emailed a friend who works with French Jewish LGBTQ+ organizations,” Symonds said. “My friend ended up forwarding the email to Frank Giaoui, the president of the World Congress of GLBT Jews. And he emailed the former president. One thing led to another, and they found a beit din that would help her convert.”\n“Seeing so many people respond was affirming,” Symonds said. “We have another expression: he who saves one life saves the world entire. I truly believe that.”', '\nIf you are looking to tailgate UCF’s first game for cheap, you’re in luck.\nThe free beer on game days is continuing downtown at The Basement until UCF football wins their first game of the season. \nThe free beer deal came about last year in the middle of UCF’s winless season. \nThe Basement posted on its Facebook page, “One last chance for free beer! UCF is going to absolutely dominate this season, so help us bid farewell to 2015 and welcome Frost & Company with one more round (or 10) on us.”\nHead coach Scott Frost was brought in under new athletic director Danny White over the offseason. \nThe Basement is open from 2 p.m. until 2 a.m. on Saturdays, according to their website.

For UCF senior Zack Levine, however, it meant combing through hours of Jimmy Fallon videos and learning guitar chords.\n\nOn Sept. 15, Levine, 20, posted an application video on YouTube for an internship position at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In the video, Levine travels all over the UCF main campus playing a guitar and expressing his qualifications to Fallon through song.\nLevine’s work on the video began as early as February when he wrote the first draft of the lyrics, incorporating plenty of references for Tonight Show fans to enjoy, such as name drops of announcer Steve Higgins an in-house band leader Questlove. The lyrics are sung over the music of Fallon’s 2012 song about the BP oil spill “Balls in Your Mouth,” with Levine only learning to play the guitar over the summer. When the time came to record his vocals, he called in a favor with friends in his hometown of Fort Lauderdale, who let him use their recording studio.\nAs for the video itself, Levine began by editing together clips of Fallon to match the lyrics he had written from him, including self-deprecating comments about Levine’s lack of job prospects as a Radio and Television major. Levine shot his portion of the video over Labor Day weekend with the help of fellow RTV student Josh Staniszewski. Taking advantage of the nearly empty campus, they were able to get plenty of shots of Levine performing at Memory Mall, the reflection pond, the Student Union, and even inside several class buildings.\nBefore deciding on the RTV major, Levine originally intended to study Film through the BFA program. When he was not accepted, he decided to pursue RTV instead, with the Cinema Studies BA program as a minor.

He also worked as a food runner at the Orlando Improv comedy club, which allowed him to meet such comedians as Jay Pharoah of Saturday Night Live and a personal hero of his, stand-up comedian Jo Koy.\nLevine hopes that working with The Tonight Show will be the first step in him working professional in comedy. When asked why he chose Fallon’s show over other late night shows, Levine said, “Fallon is simply the king of late night… He will go down as the GOAT in late night comedy when he retires… He is an influence to me as I’m sure he is to thousands of other students looking to get into comedy or late night.”\nIf Levine is selected, it won’t be his first time seeing Fallon. He got front row seats as an audience member in an April 2017 episode taped in Orlando in which Fallon interviewed Vin Diesel. “Getting to watch the show live was an unforgettable experience,” Levine said. “Fallon is just such a powerful presence.

It’s 0-0. I asked them where we were ranked, and they said, ‘We’re not,” Frost said. “We’re pretending these first three games never happened because we’ve got an eight-game season in front of us.”\nThis weekend is a perfect setup for a letdown.\xa0 Cincinnati is down right now, and UCF is flying high.\xa0 Cincinnati is a conference foe, and at home, so anything can happen. Throw out the record books in a conference matchup.\nCincinnati’s program hasn’t been headed in the right direction since leaving the Big East.\xa0 Their record has declined year by year.\xa0 Last year they finished 4-8.\xa0 This doesn’t mean UCF should take them lightly.\xa0 Cincinnati hired coach Luke Fickell last offseason and is attempting to shift their culture.\xa0 Last year Coach Fickell was the defensive coordinator for Ohio State, where he learned a couple things about a winning culture.\n“Toughness is a skill, it’s developed. Our culture is all about toughness – You win on toughness,” Fickell stated.\nAlthough Cincinnati hasn’t done a ton of winning this year, they have done some good things.\xa0 Junior Quarterback Hayden Moore has a 2:1 touchdown to Interception ratio, with a 108.8 passing efficiency rating.\xa0 Their run game has also been effective.\xa0 They have a balanced running attack, with three backs reaching the 100-yard mark.\nErik\xa0Chinander, UCF’s defensive coordinator, seems concerned with the lack of tape on Cincinnati’s offense.\n“They’ve got a lot of stuff, stuff that we haven’t prepared for because their staff is new. It’s like playing a whole new team, which is not always the best,” Coach Chinander said.\nThe defense is where we expected to see improvements on this Bearcat team.\xa0 They have a linebacking tandem that is supposed to be the most talented in the conference.\xa0 Perry Young and Jaylyin Minor are two super talented guys.\nPerry Young is a sophomore who is really coming into his own this year.\xa0 He originally signed on with Cincinnati as a safety, but is playing great in the middle.\xa0 Last week versus Marshall he had 13 tackles, 1 for loss, and a recovered fumble.\xa0 Playing next to senior linebacker Jaylyin Minor has really helped his development.\xa0 It will be interesting to see if UCF can continue to build on their running success in recent weeks facing this talented crew.\nUCF will no longer catch anyone by surprise.\xa0 Being ranked in the AP poll puts a target on your chest, and the team will need be at their best week in and week out.\xa0 Coach Frost is confident this team will not be affected by any of this.\n“The leadership I’ve seen from Pat Jasinski, Shaquem Griffin, Wyatt Miller and a bunch of other guys, they’re not going to let this group lose focus. Our formula has been working to this point, making us a better football team. I think they understand if we stick to that, that gives us our best chance,” Frost said Monday afternoon.\nThis UCF has grabbed the attention of this city, and the country.\xa0 Frost continues to preach short term goals, and Cincinnati is next on their agenda.']","['\nFor most students, applying for internships means hours of formatting resumes, requesting letters of recommendation, and writing essays about why they deserve the position.

A full room of UCF Jewish students gathered close together in Hillel’s Rabbi Israel Abisror’s living room to hear the story of her parents who survived.\n“I still have nightmares,” Beckman said. “I never heard my father scream. But I knew he screamed every night. His dream was that they were chasing the kids and he had to protect us.”\nBeckman’s father Philip, 94, was born in Krakow Poland in 1924, he was one of six siblings who survived out of 13. Beckman said her father was 14 when the Holocaust started and his parents wanted to send him to the countryside, but he snuck into the ghetto to be with his dad. The Ghettos were so crowded he had to sleep on the floor in the hallway which put him on the front line.\n“He talks about how he had to move bodies, and how scary it was because he would watch them take their last breath,” Debora Beckman said.\nDebora Beckman said her father dodged death countless times. He recalled one day being part of a large group, the two groups were separated one half was to be killed and one was to work. Beckman said her father didn’t know it at the time, he took a guess and snuck to the side that was to work.\nThe group he snuck into had to do grueling jobs while malnourished, including carrying heavy rocks a specific way up 180 steps or intense lashings.

Because if we don’t remember no one will,” said Nirit Gelfer Israel Fellow, and organizer of the event.\n\nDebora Beckman, 62, shared some of the darkest horrors of the Holocaust on behalf of her father who couldn’t make it to the event. A full room of UCF Jewish students gathered close together in Hillel’s Rabbi Israel Abisror’s living room to hear the story of her parents who survived.\n“I still have nightmares,” Beckman said. “I never heard my father scream. But I knew he screamed every night. His dream was that they were chasing the kids and he had to protect us.”\nBeckman’s father Philip, 94, was born in Krakow Poland in 1924, he was one of six siblings who survived out of 13. Beckman said her father was 14 when the Holocaust started and his parents wanted to send him to the countryside, but he snuck into the ghetto to be with his dad. The Ghettos were so crowded he had to sleep on the floor in the hallway which put him on the front line.\n“He talks about how he had to move bodies, and how scary it was because he would watch them take their last breath,” Debora Beckman said.\nDebora Beckman said her father dodged death countless times. He recalled one day being part of a large group, the two groups were separated one half was to be killed and one was to work. Beckman said her father didn’t know it at the time, he took a guess and snuck to the side that was to work.\nThe group he snuck into had to do grueling jobs while malnourished, including carrying heavy rocks a specific way up 180 steps or intense lashings.

The arena sold out in 2017 and posted its highest attendance when the UCF men’s basketball team hosted Illinois in the NIT Invitational.\nCFE Federal Credit Union mailed a voting form to its members announcing a plan to change from a federal credit union to a state credit union, citing an opportunity to tailor the banking system to Florida residents and expand outside of Central Florida.\nAs part of the change in structure, CFE will change its name to Addition Financial.\n“We are pleased to continue our partnership with the University of Central Florida and the CFE Arena as we transition our name to Addition Financial. Under our new name, we will remain dedicated to our heritage in education, and will proudly serve the university in the years to come,” says Kevin Miller, CFE’s president and CEO.\nThe name change for both the bank and arena will take effect on May 1. CFE will pay for the installation of signage which will begin in late March. CFE/Addition Financial will continue to be UCF’s official financial institution.\n“We have a fantastic relationship with our great partners at CFE.\xa0 We are proud to now serve as a landmark as they rebrand the credit union to Addition Financial and continue to host quality events for the Central Florida community.

The event was hosted in the Student Union Wednesday afternoon by Stefanie Campbell of the Multicultural Student Center.\nStudents from different backgrounds elaborated on their experiences with misogyny from cultural traditions. \n“I don’t feel like it’s considered a pressing issue,” Campbell said. “Whenever the news speaks about issues of course there are many bad things happening; but when there’s news that is focusing on issues that are shining gender inequalities, like gender mutilation or women’s marches and they [women] are not getting recognition for it.”\nMany students spoke on how the media depicts gender roles as being a contributor to the mentalities people eventually evolve. A student shared how in coloring books there are specific roles for men and women. The student shared her example of always seeing women as the nurses and men as the doctors.\nMichelle Kahn, 20, sophomore accounting major, shared her experience growing up with Pakistani immigrants.\n“My family moved here for us,” Kahn said. “I’m the second person in my family to go to college for the first time. Though, anytime I go to a family event the question I get the most is when are you getting married?”\nKahn said her parents’ modernizing is owed solely toward their migration from Pakistan.\n“If I was born there [Pakistan], I probably would have been married and popped two kids out by now,” Kahn said.\nKahn said her family has become more modern and have become more accepting of “love” marriages among her kids. Though Kahn shared, her brother had no issue with convincing her parents of who he wanted to marry, unlike her sisters trying to convince her parents.\n“I would have to make sure that this [significant other] is who I want, and this is what I’d fight for.”\nA student who is studying to become a vet technician shared how women dominate her field. When the clinic she works for got a new doctor who was male, she said she witnessed how uncomfortable the female staff had got initially.\nStudents of diverse background shared how culture played a huge role in their perception of their role at home based off their gender.\n“I grew up in a very traditional Latino household,” said Ashley Perez, 22, graduate student in social work. “A lot of the personal experiences resonated with me and validated my experience that as women we might be used by gaslighting [questioning one’s judgement] and there might be more to it. But sometimes it [maltreatment or rejection] is just being pigeon-hold in [assign to a group or class in an exclusive manner] due to your gender.\nA male student shared how he was discouraged from doing household chores because “it won’t be necessary” and was encouraged to focus on outdoor work. \n“Having other Latina friends, and hearing many stories echo each-others we start to question why Hispanic mothers might enable their sons, and enact misogyny onto their daughters?” Perez asked. “It’s a matter of wanting to take personal responsibility of saying this generational cycle. Saying, we’re going to raise our boys different and we’re going to raise our children all the same.”']","['\nThe Muslim Student Association hosted a vigil in honor of the victims of the massacre in New Zealand Friday afternoon in the Student Union. \n“For us the Mosque is a second home,” Abdullah Saqib, vice president of MSA said. “We grew up in the Mosque and to see such a sanctified and homey place be devastated in this manner was horrifying for us.”\nThe student union atrium Friday afternoon was filled with candles and the names of the victims on the UCF Pegasus, as well as about 70 people in attendance.
