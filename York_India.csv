I made contact with the police […] and we’ve asked for a written apology and an explanation.”\nYFS vice-president Darkshika Selvasivam, who did not attend the session, also expressed shock upon hearing the comments.\n“I’m appalled by the comment that the police officer has made saying that women should avoid dressing like sluts, and I think it goes to show the inherent misogyny and lack of education,” said Selvasivam, York Federation of Students (YFS) executive.\n“I think the officer should be very seriously reprimanded for the comment.”\nAfter the session, Bessner spoke with students and student organizations and noted they, too, expressed concerns about the comment. Bessner proceeded to call 31 Division to demand an apology and explanation.\n“Initially it was a call, and the officer said he would get back to me right away. A couple of days had lapsed, so I sent a letter,” she said.\nToronto police spokesperson Constable Wendy Drummond confirmed the incident has been brought to the attention of senior officials and is currently under investigation.\n“[This is] definitely something that we take very seriously. This matter […] has been brought to the attention of our professional standards unit and is something we will be looking into,” she said.\nHowever, she could not confirm whether Toronto police intend to issue an official apology.\n“We are of the position that if these comments were made, it is definitely something that we will [act on],” she added.\nBessner said she has yet to receive an official apology from the officer. She has also spoken to York security and noted that they were also upset by the comments.\n“We have a good relationship with the Toronto Police Service and work collaboratively with them,” said Janice Walls, York spokesperson. “However, we were very surprised and shocked by the comment that was made and we certainly don’t agree with it.”\nBessner argued that such comments make it difficult for victims dealing with sexual assault because they make them feel uncomfortable going to the police for help.\n“I think the problem with the constable’s conduct was that he was blaming the victim,” she said. “He’s also not making victims feel safe to go to the police. It’s quite astounding that in 2011 that you hear comments like that from a professional.”\nBessner stressed the importance of officers having proper knowledge about sexual assault cases.\n“I think it’s really important that the police […] receive appropriate training on sexual assault, so that statements like this are never made and that they understand the dynamics of sexual assault.”\nRelated articles:\nCop’s “slut” comment draws backlash from guerrilla activists\nSlutWalk Toronto: April 3, 2011\n ', 'I happen to agree with him. You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. And why should you blame the officer? It’s your society which turns women into chattel by making a half naked woman sell a pepsi or sprite bottle. That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. Also, girls today dress like sluts so the whole lot of them take offense when someone tells it how it is. Kudos to you Officer.\nOf course the men are responsible who perpetrate this, but seriously, when they chose their victim I’m sure that they searched for someone who was eyecandy to them. They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.\nYou’re just as bad as him. You’re basically insinuating that ‘hindu or sikh or muslim’ women don’t experience sexual assault. You’re saying that men only want eye candy. You’re the one reducing women to their appearance anyway. What about mentally challenged women who are assaulted? Young girls?  You’re blaming women for men’s crimes. You are furthering ideas that men have uncontrollable urges and act on impulse rather than the fact that they have internatilized misogyny and feel the need to exert control over women due to their own insecurities about masculinity.\nI happen to know a lot of decent men who don’t believe that the way a woman is dressed gives you permission to do what you please with her. I also know of a lot of men who think they have that permission, regardless of the situation or your dress.\nEducate yourself. Stop being so ignorant. Your victim-blaming rhetoric is not needed here.\nVery well said.\nIt’s not that the victim is being blamed. You can’t change those around you so you should do everything you can to keep yourself save. I agree that people who are covered up also get raped but you try to optimize your security as much as you can… One way is to dress less provocative and make sure you are always around someone you trust when you are at a party and prevent being in unsafe areas. I think the officer used inappropriate words to say what i think he was trying to say or he could just be a really sick person who believes that it’s ok for men to do it if women dress the way they want to.\nI agree, if you leave your car keys in plain sight in your car it is more likely to be stolen. This logic can be transferred to the topic at hand  The officer simply made a suggestion without sugar-coating it and he got his point across.\ni dont think its about “blaming victims”. it’s about common sense. i think that’s what the officer’s intent was with his comment, though obviously it skirted sensitive territory.\nObviously, as a society we want to ensure all citizens are safe and that we all adhere to the social compact. but that’s not how the world works in reality. While it’d be wonderful to leave precious possessions laying about in plain view unattended, the expectation that we should be able to do this without having them stolen is delusional. That’s why we lock our doors.\nWomen should also realize that the officer’s intent here was to protect them, not to blame them. Like many fathers, brothers, boyfriends and husbands, men worry a great deal about the safety of the women and girls in their lives. And we know that in a society as hyper-sexualized as ours, that avoiding unwanted attentions often times means applying a conservative approach to how we present ourselves.\nSadly the rhetoric and anger surrounding this discussion does a disservice to the police and to the law abiding citizens. I think it’s a shame generally that we can’t seem to appreciate the nuances of coping with the dangers in life.\nOh, the old comparison to the common sense of locking our door because things get stolen. There are so many things wrong with this analogy.\nFirst, while leaving your doors unlocked makes it easier for someone to rob your house, dressing sexily does nothing to make it easier for someone to rape you. A woman in a long skirt is just as easy to force sex on than a woman in a short skirt, as is a woman in baggy jeans vs hot pants, as is a woman in a t-shirt vs a low-cut top. The clothes I wear do not make myself more or less able to defend against an assault, nor do they prevent me from taking other, more realistic safety precautions such as not being alone while out at night.\nSecond, all this rhetoric goes on the baseless assumption that the more attractively a woman dresses, the more likely it is a rapist will target her. This is simply not true. Rape is about power and is most often done when it is convenient, as most victims are raped by people they know or who already have some sort of power over them.\nThird, everyone seems to be forgetting that sometimes women dress provocatively because the DO want to attract attention – of the consentual kind. Blaming the woman for wanting to look attractive is like blaming a store owner for having such nice and expensive things in his store, after the store is subject to an armed robbery. Clearly the owner should cover up and hide all the nice things so no one wants to steal them.\nI completely agree. The part about clothes reminded me of the Italian judge who ruled in favor of the (alleged) rapist on the basis that women wearing jeans are physically impossible to rape.\nPeople seem to like telling women not to dress in sexy clothes, not to get drunk. Wish they’d turn that righteousness to telling men not to rape people.\nAre you suggesting that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women never get raped? Sadly they do. And many of them face ridiculous cultural laws in which the rape must have been witnessed by several MEN who are willing to testify on their behalf or they can’t even report it! Also, a shocking number of seniors are raped every year. So the statement that women dressed “respectably” or women that are not considered “attractive” do not fall victim to sex crimes is seriously seriously flawed.\nA while a woman who dresses up to go to a club may very well be there to pick up (just like the guys are) she still has the absolute right to decide who picks her up.\nI’ve never heard or read of Sikhs or Hindus having a law where male witnesses must have witnessed the rape to testify on behalf of the victim.\nFYI I am a Sikh and have lived for years at a time in Canada, India and the UK.\nActually in most western countries convicting a man of rape is difficult-this is reflected in the conviction rate for rape cases (Google it). So to suggest Sikh, Hindu and Muslim rape laws are so woefully inadequate compared to Canadian ones is unfair.\nAnd a women has the right, but how would she enforce it? This is an issue of ideals versus reality and the reality is men are physically stronger than women.\nRegardless of if you take self defense classes-9 times out of ten an average grown man could rape a women if he was so inclined.\nIts always smarter to avoid attracting unwanted attention anyway.\nI’m not saying women don’t have the right to dress how they wish or to dress attractively because after all most men enjoy seeing a beautiful women. But women should exercise common sense too!\nI think women need to realize that although the sexes are equal, that does not mean we are the same.\nYou’re basically saying that you do agree that women shouldn’t dress provocatively.\nCome on no one respects a women who picks random guys up at clubs or anywhere else.\nI don’t understand why some women don’t respect themselves more. Is it because your trying to emulate some men? Or is that just an excuse-I hear it sometimes ‘men sleep around and they are considered studs so why are women called sluts when they do the same?’ Well thats just a highly reductive and generalized statement that just comes as extremely stupid and not what most sensible people would expect from a university educated women!\nBecause believe me we are not all promiscuous.\nThis reflects a bigger problem with our generation we don’t value ourselves enough. Society is way too hyper sexualized (as someone else commented).\nAnyway students should spend more time studying and less time messing around at clubs and dressing sexy. Where are your priorities?\nFYI-\nPlease don’t make baseless ignorant generalizations. I am a self-identifying slut, and plenty of people respect me completely. Because many people are not sex-negative fuckwads.\nI like to have sex with people I like. It’s enjoyable, fun, good exercise, and generally makes my life more awesome. I am safe, use multiple birth control methods, and get tested regularly. How, exactly am I not respecting myself? I am doing what I choose when I choose with people I choose. I empower myself in my own sexuality rather than letting any societal construct dictate my actions.\nHowever, the most important thing here is that I CONSENT. No matter what the context, no matter what I’m wearing, who I’m with, where I am, I expect everyone to establish consent before having sex with me. I might be dressed sexily because I’m looking for sex, or not, but the way I dress NEVER implies that just anyone can have sex with me without consent. Nor does the way I dress render anyone incapable of making decisions for themselves about whether to rape me.\nYou are right about one thing and that is our society is hyper-sexualized, but only in that it glorifies sex WITHOUT putting the equal necessary effort into promoting consent work and sex-positivity. We make sex tantalizing without making it empowering. But we need to empower ourselves in our sexuality, not by slut-shaming, but by encouraging everyone to make intelligent, informed, consentual decisions about sex.\nAlso, in all my sluttitude, I got all A’s and B’s all four years at university. Explain to me what those exactly have to do with each other?\nHow dare you suggest that a woman leading a sexual life on her terms doesn’t respect herself.\n“a women”\nwhat\n“a university educated women”\nwhat\n“is way too hyper sexualized”\nredundant phrasing\nQuit school; Marry soon; Let party girls party. You give yourself too much credit and respect, and others too little.\nThank you for replying and yes very well said!  It’s sad that there is still such ignorance like that out there…\n…and oh it is Brittaney i agree with if that was unclear.\nSexual assault has nothing to do withthe way the victim is dressed but the sickness of the rapists mind! 80 year old women and little girls get assaulted too! dont make excuses for these sick bastards!\nThe problem is that this is being made into a women’s rights issue when it is broader than that.  For example, I should be able to walk through Regent Park at 3 AM carrying a clear briefcase filled with cash, but I wouldn’t because it would greatly increase the odds of attracting trouble.  This is an exaggerated example, but the point is valid.  Women should be able to dress as they please and go where they please, when they please, but there are people with no respect for the law or other people.  The common sense solution is to avoid drawing their attention.  It doesn’t make it right, but too many people are in here arguing that women should be able to dress as they please and not be sex objects, when no one actually disagrees with that.\nThe cop chose a poor word, and everyone has keyed in on that word, but his point is valid.  You should be able to dress as you please, but in an area where there is a history of sexual predation, you have to adapt and take precautions.  The vast majority of men who respect the law and the rights of women are not your issue here.\nYou are one of the biggest idiot douchebags I have ever read but I guess thats the downfall of the internet, you have to read the opinions of people who think they actually know something about a highly complex topic- that of gender, misogyny and politics. Get educated before you open your mouth. You seem to know nothing about which you are speaking of and you look like a fool. I HATE people like you.\nYou discredit your own argument as lacking intelligence by engaging in ad hominim attack. Your comment adds absolutely nothing to the conversation.\nI agree with and am delighted at your rage and indignation — but I have to interject at “downfall of the internet.” Such a phrase suggests that the internet was ever “up” to begin with; i.e. that it was ever used as an outlet for anything more than toxic opinions amplified by anonymity, moronic acronym-and-emoticon-based “conversation,” and porn. Sorry for interrupting, thanks for listening.\nWow. Way to go buddy. Misogyny and racism at it’s best/worst, right there. Do you really think that rapists care what a woman is wearing? Women who are dressed conservatively get raped, too. The only thing a woman can do to avoid being raped is to not get raped. Seriously, next time, educate yourself before you decide to put your two cents in.\nI was raped while wearing an ankle-length dress with a high neck and long sleeves.  I had NOTHING showing.  The only person responsible for rape is the RAPIST.  PERIOD.  Rape is not about sexual attraction, it’s about power and hatred of women.  Educate yourself before you open your mouth.\nBullying and murder are about power and control, rape is about satiating one’s lust for sex. Power and control over the victim just happens to be the method used to satiate said lust. Have you ever heard of a rapist raping someone he couldn’t overpower? That NEVER happens.\nYou don’t have to dress provocatively to be raped, but rape is one of only three ways to satiate sexual lust. The remaining two methods are consensual sex, and masturbation. If you can think of a fourth method, please, let me know so that I will know too.\nJoe, please tell me you’re being sarcastic.\nHow is it that you profess to know so much about the underlying causes of rape? Should I assume that you’ve being researching rape statistics and studying the psychology of rapists for the last 20 years?\nOr have you raped before? Did you commit such a horrible crime just so you could get off? Because to be honest, I don’t know a single man or woman who would rape someone, who would put another human being through the terrible hell of sexual assault and rape, just so they could get laid.\nAnd to anyone on this post who DARES to suggest that women are raped because of what they’re wearing, how they’re acting, if they’re flirting or not, or if they’re “asking for it,” then how do you explain that 1 in every 3 women in the US army is raped?\nFor more information: http://www.stopmilitaryrape.org/\nhttp://newsjunkiepost.com/2010/01/26/13rd-of-women-in-us-military-raped/\nMy apologies. I tried to find Canadian statistics, but to no avail. Instead, I have an anecdote. A friend of mine just came back from doing a tour in Afghanistan (she’s Canadian Forces). One day, her commanding officers had a meeting with all the females in camp. They gave the women a little whistle, and told the women that if they were ever attacked by a man, to blow the whistle for help. A f&%ing whistle? Really? Canadian Forces can’t do better and maybe find ways to deter potential perpetrators?\nBut you don’t need a Phd to figure the reasoning behind a statement such as ‘dressing a little less provocative’.\nYou are a women and as such you will never understand how men think irrespective of how much education you have-its experience versus sitting in an ivory tower. Some men are nice as pie, where as some may appear nice on the outside and yet be very evil minded on the inside (e.g. Ted Bundy).\nIn war a lot of the rules in civilian peace time society are thrown out-this happens regardless of the Geneva Convention and is a sad reality.\nI think we seriously need to bring women down to earth-you are not the same as men (yes, you are of course equal I’m not disputing that!). Men can be brutal towards one another-how the hell do you think you will stand up to that? (Unless you are some sort of Martial Arts expert).\nThe fact that someone would call this “Fair Game” is sickening.\nA woman has the right to dress however she chooses. Whether she chooses to show skin, or cover herself should not affect the fact that any sexual assault is fully the responsibility of the perpetrator.\nIt seems to be a typical defense response to call a woman a whore or to imply that she was “asking for it”.\nThis post says that “of course the men are responsible”, yet it is said that by choosing unrevealing clothing then a woman is less likely to be assaulted, putting responsibility in the hands of the victim.\nI guess I’d better start wearing a parka at all times so that no men will see my body and be driven into a sexual frenzy… don’t want to get myself attacked or anything…\nIt’s a shame that people still hold these misogynist ideas in Canada in 2011, you’d think we’d be past this.\nWhat a disgusting and misogynistic human being you are. It is people like you and comments like the one you’ve made that have created and sustained a patriarchal rape culture. As a Muslim woman who is a survivor of rape, I can tell you that having your body covered has NOTHING to do with why sexual violence occurs. Sexual violence is about POWER AND CONTROL, not the clothes you wear, and not about being “eye candy”. The comments that you and the police officer have ignorantly made do nothing except re-victimize and re-traumatize victims of sexual violence, and do NOTHING to put blame or punishment upon the individuals who perpetrate such monstrous crimes. Please get yourself a REAL EDUCATION while you are at York, and never make such hateful, disgusting, shameful comments about women who have survived sexual violence again. I am disgusted to go to school with a human being as deplorable as you. May you NEVER have to feel like a survivor of sexual violence and be blamed for the lifelong trauma and horror you experience.\nAnecdote is not an appropriate means to determine if fully covered women experience less sexual assault than sluts.\nIt does prove one instance of its occurrence on a fully covered woman, however, which is more than some are willing to admit is a possible situation. In addition, you have proffered no valid research demonstrating the contrary, instead hoping that your simplistic refutation of an assertion will lead others to believe that its opposite is true.\nFair Game, you are completely right. In the history of the world, a hindu/sikh/muslim woman has NEVER EVER been raped. Women, if you don’t want to get raped, stop being “eyecandy” to men. You should always think of possible rapists while getting dressed and going outside. In fact, why do women even bother going outside? Sure, you could dress conservatively to ward off rapist, but you might accidentally smile seductively or brush your hand against your breast- things that will lure the rapist and force him to rape you.\nI’m actually confused why a woman is Assistant Dean of the JD program. Are they even allowed to vote??\nMarry me…\nA women has a right to wear whatever she wants without fearing sexual assault. Are you actually suggesting that before leaving her house a women is supposed to consider if she looks like an “eye candy” to some sociopath or a pervert with no self restraint? You should be deeply ashamed of yourself, especially for putting the word “freedoms” together with the garbage you wrote.\nSo by your reasoning their are no rape victims in muslim countries that force women to cover themselves from head to toe.  What planet are you from, because you surely aren’t  from this one.\nWhat?! What’s like saying that children who have suffered from sexual assault deserve it.  Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts, and telling girls not to as a step of sexual assault is bound to make victims uncomfortable.  Victim =/= enabler in most cases like this.\nIf your mom was sexually assaulted, do you think you would say “well, were you dressed like a slut, mom?” Or do you think it’d maybe be best just to assign the blame where it belongs (hint: not with the victim) and be supportive.\n“Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts”\nyou suck just as much as the person you are replying to .\nIt is abominable that someone would ever have this opinion, as it is exactly this type of ignorance and misogyny that breeds the sense of entitlement which feeds behaviors such as sexual assault.  Rape is a war crime; not because a whole village, city, or country is filled with women who are ‘asking for it’ by dressing provocatively, but rather, because rape is about POWER.  Even more disgusting is the fact that you seem to think that women who dress in a way that covers their bodies don’t get raped. Rape is one of the many things a man can use to wield his physical power over a woman (and a man or a child, by the way), so in case you missed the last fifty years, women are people now too. Idiot.\nits not just females that can be raped.  I was raped as far as the topic im sorry i have to agree with something 9 times out of 10 it is the women that dress provocative that males rape.  It does make me sick to my stumach that this happens though.  i do have a heart.  I know 3 females that have been raped and one mail that was raped and thats me.\nAnd you didn’t deserve it, even though you’re an asshole. Were you dressed like a slut? That doesn’t make it your fault.\nAmen sister or brother!  Thank you “Winter”!\nI just want to add that thinking the way “Fair Game” does is still universal amongst many societies.  I was teaching English in Japan in 2001.  We threw a party for one of my roommates. That night a foreigner attending the party slipped me the date rape drug.  Even though, I’m pretty sure that I wasn’t actually rapped per se he did have his way with me.  I remember bits and pieces.  He by the way was a fellow English teacher and not a Japanese citizen.  I did end up reporting the crime at the hospital and little did I know, police then become automatically involved.  The reason I bring this up is that amongst all the stuff I was going through at the time, the police while investigated made me find the clothes that I was wearing at the party that night.  At the time, and for a moment the act of photographing my clothes made me feel like I had asked for it.  Now of course I know better.  Making women feel like it is their fault due to their dress really does re-victimize the victim.\nActually, the statistics show that a woman’s appearance and pattern of dress have absolutely NOTHING to do with her risk of being sexually assaulted by a male.  Muslim women DO get sexually assaulted. Older women DO get sexually assaulted.  Little girls DO get sexually assaulted.  Moreover, the majority of male-perpetrated sexual assaults against women take place in the HOME.  I can wear baggy sweat pants on the street AND in the home, and statistically, it will do absolutely nothing to ‘protect’ me.  Perpetrators are responsible for choosing violence.  Believing otherwise is sexist ignorance.\nSo Fair Game:\nLet me get this straight… what you’re saying is that:\na. Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women (which by the way, all of whom apparently dress “traditionally”) do not get raped because they are covered up.\nb. Only hot girls get raped. No one else gets sexually assaulted.\nI would normally suggest that someone as ignorant as you pick up a book or a newspaper, but I’m not sure that even that could save you. I would site some statistics about the sadly high number of women that get raped in all different countries of all different religions and demographics, or even explain to you that a woman has the right to dress how she wants without being sexually assaulted, no matter how provocative it is, or even question what a slippery slope your argument is– next you’ll be saying that if a woman has a drink or two, she’s also “asking” to be raped. But it’s not worth my breath. If you truly believe a woman who shows some skin is apparently “fair game” for sexual assault, as you put so repulsively in your pathetic attempt to be clever, you are ignorant beyond repair. Making excuses for those who would sexually assault innocent women, no matter how they are dressed, is lower than low.\nAs if infants, the elderly, and women in proper hijab aren’t raped every day.\nNice work, Mr. Troll.\nYou’re a pig. Sexual assault should never be the storm cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim, especially a woman, looks like.\nThat’s not true. You can be wearing jeans and t-shirt with nothing revealing and you could still be a victim. If the community start thinking that victims are usually “sluts” as you put… the victim (who is already going through hell for what has happened to her) will start thinking that she is disgusting and blame herself for what happened.\nThere are people out there that think the victim was probably dressed “slutty” and got what they deserve. It’s those kind of thinking that make victims try to hide what happened because THEY will be viewed as “disgusting” by the community and NOT the perpetrator.\nPlease understand that it is NOT the victim’s fault. No matter how they are dressed. Why should the victim get condemned by the society for being a victim? Is it their fault? They dressed to impress not to imply that they want to be sexually harassed.\nTruly an idiotic comment. There is absolutely no excuse for rape and what a woman is wearing is nobody elses business. Muslim and Sikh women are raped regardless of dress. It’s not a question of clothing but of mens attitudes, such as the one you voiced. Is there a set of conditions that makes it justifiable to violate a persons physical autonomy? The comment has a very wide range of implications and all of them are negative towards women and victims of crime. There is always an excuse by the perpetrators to try to justify their actions.\nI think If you were to dress less like a ‘slut’  you might actually decrease your chances at getting raped. How hard is that for you feminazis to understand?\nSee my response to Fair Game.  It applies to you as well.\n@Feminism stinks, Sometimes, people have a hard time understanding things that don’t make sense. Let me educate you:\nUtah State University Sexual Assault and Anti Violence Information:\nMyth: Rape victims provoke the attach by wearing provocative clothing.\nA Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only\n4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior on the part\nof the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple\nas a glance).\nMost convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.\nVictims range in age from days old to those in their nineties,\nhardly provocative dressers.\nUtah State University\nhttp://www.usu.edu/saavi/pdf/myths_facts.pdf\nI fail to see how not wanting to blame victims for the actions of the perpetrator of a crime, when statistics don’t suggest that “not dressing like a slut” helps, makes one a “feminazi.”\nI’m pretty sure my niece could never force someone to assault her, so I guess I must be a feminazi.\nI read in the news about elderly women who got repeatedly sexually assaulted by the same perpetrator who would break into the home in the middle of the night.\nYea, shame on those sexy grannies who are seducing men into committing rape!\n@Feminismstinks: please do the world a favor and REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS PLANET IN THE FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY!  may I recommend walking off a bridge?\nFirstly, women are raped regardless of what they’re wearing.  Secondly, stop placing blame onto women.  No one WANTS to get raped.  Wearing a certain outfit is not an invitation to rape me.  Fuck off.\ni agree that it would help however is not a solution and proper security would go a lot farther then longer hem lines.\nare you ill ? who doesn’t know that rape has nothing to do with sex, it’s about power and humiliation. are you saying that women who don’t dress like “sluts” never get raped ? or women that people may not deem “attractive” ? did you know that 45% of rape victims were assaulted by their partners, compaired to only 8% who were assaulted by strangers ? this makes it hard for me to think that women are raped because of the way they dress.\nyou said yourself that images of half naked women are used to sell products and this is half the problem. society objectifies women into nothing more than sex objects WHEREEVER YOU LOOK. and opinions like this do not make it any better.\no_0\nAnd what exactly does “getting treated like a slut” mean to you? Getting raped? Sorry to point out the obvious, but even sluts aren’t out to get raped, they are out to have consensual sex. A man is not some kind of wild animal species that can’t control its urges when it sees a short skirt. Also, rape is usually not about “eye candy” but about asserting power over the victim. And victims are often not “slutty”-looking girls, they can be anyone from your daughter to your grandmother. Your comment is ridiculously asinine and ignorant. Hope nobody you care about ever gets attacked.\nYou do know that women in traditional clothing get raped all the time, right? The more “traditional” a society, the higher its incident of rape (including marital rape), and IN ADDITION to the higher incidents of rape these women are actively discouraged from seeking justice. You have a serious problem. How about teaching men NOT to RAPE. Dick.\nIn the immortal words of Antoine Dodson, “You are so dumb.  You are really dumb.  For real.”\nOther commenters have eloquently covered all the reasons why you are so dumb.  That is all.\nOh I love that song!!!\nand it certainly applies to all rapists and rapist supporters!\nOh, of course you are right.\nAnd, if you are robbed, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought stuff that someone might want.  If you are carjacked, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought a car.   If any other crime happens to you, it must be your fault for having something the criminal might want.\nThis all makes perfect sense.\nWell Fair Game is completely right. I mean Hindu, Sikh or Muslim women are never raped. Western women only started showing more skin around the 1920’s and that’s right about the time that women started being raped. Coincidence? I think not. Thinking back to when I was raped at 17, I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved sweater. Must of been asking for it right? If only I’d had a burka on to clearly indicate that I wasn’t interested in being held down and raped.  I never told anyone about it because I felt like it was somehow my fault. I felt ashamed. I shouldn’t of let myself be in that situation. The comments made by Fair Game and the officer are the reason so many women never come forward when sexually assaulted.  That officer should be fired. Fair Game, if you have any females close to you, try talking to them, chances are one of them has been sexually assaulted.  Ask your mother, your sister or friend if they were asking for it when it happened to them. Or then again, maybe you don’t have many females in your life that you’re close to. Wouldn’t that be a shock.\nYou’re an idiot. Men walk around showing skin all the time, no shirts, for example. What is a “slut”? Aren’t men the definition of the word? Also, you may want to look up rape victims–they are the elderly, they are the two year olds, they are the nine-year-old male, they are in prison. Get an education.\nYou do realize that Middle Eastern women who wear veils, abayas and burqas are also victims of rape? In fact, victims of rape in Middle Eastern countries are subject to public lashings and honor killings because they “shamed” their family by being the victim of a crime.\nRape isn’t about sex, it’s about controlling and humiliating another person. Men can be raped too, so can children and elderly women. What would you attribute that to? Slutty looking 5 year olds? Please.\nI feel sorry for anyone you know personally that is a survivor, because clearly you have no idea about the true psychological motivations of rape.\n@Fair Game, Rapists will rape people regardless of what they are wearing. No one asks or deserves to be raped. The only people responsible for rape are rapists and rape apologists like you.\nconsidering the fact that the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows (relative, friend, date etc.) I’m certain that when “they” chose their victim, it likely was not at random and probably had nothing to do with how she was dressed.\nin fact, dressing in a manner that exudes (and requires) confidence would probably deter a man from assaulting them.\nnothing a woman says, wears or does warrants being sexually assaulted.  it is a act of power and control that is perpetrated by someone who has neither.  it is a demeaning and shattering experience that no one asks for. and if you think for one moment, Fair Game, that Sikh, Muslim or Hindu women do not experience this kind of torture, you need to put down your excalibur and pick up a G and M.\nwow. check your privilege, asshole.\nhttp://sap.mit.edu/content/pdf/male_privilege.pdf\nthe definition of “slut” is so loose that it can apply to a woman who has had multiple sex partners, and to a 14 year old girl in a short skirt.\nwhat the crappy thing is, women are judged on EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR PERSONALITIES. a woman is not a slut for enjoying sex or wearing revealing clothing that is not always worn to attract others, but to make the woman feel good.\nrape and sexual assault are ALWAYS initiated by the presence of a rapist. the woman (and sometimes men are raped too! think about that!) is NEVER asking for unwanted sexual advances.\nyou sir, can fuck off.\nEven though I didn’t have sex (of any kind) until I was 19, I was labeled a slut in middle school just for having large breasts, which were always covered by baggy t-shirts.\nI totally agree with you on this one, girls who want to dress in a certain “sluttish”  way, they have to pay for the consequences. 5/5!\n“The way a woman dresses or acts does not cause or prevent sexual assault; an attacker rapes someone because they want to exert power and control over him or her. The attacker is solely responsible for the crime. However, this responsibility is lost in translation through the police, the courts and the media.”\nfrom: Don’t Rape (http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/3497)\nCurl up and die please. You’ll do everyone a favour.\nSince when is the onus on women to make men behave like gentlemen? If you can’t keep your pants zipped, YOU have the problem, not the victims!!\nRape is more often than not, an act of dominance.  Sociopathic individuals will commit rape to assert dominance and inflict harm on an individual because that aspect is sexually arousing to them; they do not usually rape someone based on how that person is dressed.  On the contrary, rapists generally look for someone who has low self-esteem (no confident, sexy outfit?) and may not put up much of a fight.\nYeah only the issue is the disgusting and unacceptable crime of the perpetrator, not their sexual preference. Implying that a woman is somehow deserving of sexual assault because of what she wears implies that the crime AGAINST LAW of sexually assaulting someone can be justified. Any grown man that is rational and worth a trial can presumably control his sexual inclinations around a girl in revealing clothing.\nFair Game is a troll.\nTo call yourself “Fair Game” is hypocritical and disgusting.  I am appalled by your comments.  Clearly, what you said is a reflection of what and how much you know about our society.  First of all, sexual violence has NOTHING to do with sex.  It is about POWER, HATRED AND VIOLENCE against another human being.  Second of all, to say “wouldn’t choose a Hindu, Sikh or a Muslim because they are covered in traditional clothing” is an absolute horrible thing to say.  Fair Game, go educate yourself about violence and please keep your comments about our society problems to yourself.  Clearly you have a long way to go in increasing your knowledge about something as serious as this.\nTo call yourself “Fair Game” is hypocritical and disgusting.  I am appalled by your comments.

Clearly you have a long way to go in increasing your knowledge about something as serious as this.\nIt’s sad to know that there are people out there that concludes that women who dresses provocatively are “asking” for this type of crime to happen to them.  One does not have to dress like a “slut” in order to be raped.  The responsibility lies in the fact that our society needs to educate people of all cultures about violence.  It is disappointing that a police officer, someone whom you think that will serve and protect you and your city would lower himself to a comment like that.\nStupid troglodyte!\nSome years ago I was raped by a man I considered to be one of my closest friends, in my own home, while clad in a decidedly unsexy sweatsuit and bunny slippers. The only thing making me attractive to the bastard was my gender, my trust and my availability.\nhey so if I think you’re dressed like a douchebag I should get to beat you up, right? After all, it’s YOUR fault for asking for it! You’ve got the face and clothing of a douche just begging to get beat up!\nfirst of all, you’re disgusting. Secondly if you dress in a way that I decide is “slutty” I suppose you’d be okay with it if I violently destroyed you too. I dress how I want to because it makes me happy, I shouldnt have to hide myself because people like you can’t control yourself. I hope you never have to experience the horrors of rape but if you do maybe you’d finally shut the hell up\nHey, little boys get raped by priests. INFANTS get raped by sick men.  Hell, animals get raped by sickos. I guess they ALL asked for it.\nHow dare that cute baby wear nothing but a diaper?  I guess it’s rape time!\nDON’T APOLOGIZE FOR RAPISTS! the only one at fault is the rapist!!!\nYou’re a troll.  Wise up, people.\nyour comment made me so angry!\nso i guess that its your fault if i (fill in the blanks) you!\nyou have some serious problems…\nYou’re absolutely right. Because no woman wearing a burqa has ever been sexually assaulted.\nFair Game: I know I shouldn’t feed the trolls here (read: you) but I’m going to anyway because I have nothing better to do.\nA) What does it mean to “dress like a slut?”  Is it the showing of skin that makes you think she must have too much sex (which is what I assume you mean by “slut,” a woman who has more sex than you deem appropriate)?  Or is it the too-much-sex issue itself?\nB) Calling a woman a slut is silly, because what constitutes a slut varies depending on the perspective of the person doing the slut-shaming, but worse than silly, it’s a means of silencing the legitimate concerns of women.  Women are called sluts for what they wear (even if they’re virgins,) they’re called sluts if they have monogamous sex with one partner (if they’re the wrong person,) they’re called sluts if they have the audacity to have had multiple partners BY CHOICE.  None of these things make it ok for that person to be raped.  Women aren’t “asking” to be raped if they dress in revealing clothing.\nC)Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women, along with women of every ethnicity and religion around the world are raped daily, regardless of what they wear.  One reason this is allowed to continue is because of the prevailing views that rape is the fault of the victim and not of the rapist.  When a woman gets raped, every sexual experience she’s ever had, her clothing, whether or not she chose to imbibe that evening, and whether or not she chose to go somewhere alone, are all dragged up and used against her.  None of these things have any bearing on her rape- whoever she chose to have sex with in the past has no bearing on this rapist.  As a matter of fact, whether she’s had consensual sex with the rapist in the past has no bearing- anybody has a right at any time, regardless of sexual history, to not give consent to engage in sexual activity, and the only one to blame for the ensuing rape is the rapist.\nYou’re right. about the last part. it’s the perpetrator who is at fault, not the woman. it’s not the woman’s fault the perpetrator is a raging sociopath.\nwhat an incredible double standard. society love women that dress like “sluts.” we see it everywhere, from movies to commercials to ads, all to appeal to the male gaze. but it’s immediately jumped to as an excuse for rape.\nnot to mention, a very small percentage of rape is the “stranger in the bushes on the wrong side of town at night.” Most rapes happen in the victim’s or rapist’s home and they almost always know eachother.\nyou’re an idiot.\nAttitudes like this do nothing to dispel the problem. Women (and men and transgender folk) of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, levels of intelligence, and physicalities experience rape. Research has largely indicted that rapists are not necessarily attacking others due to an insatiable sex drive, but because it’s a way to exert control. Instead of victim-blaming, perhaps we should focus our energies into educating people to not become rapists. I, for one, feel that the officer’s suggestion only perpetuates the attitude that it’s up to the potential victims to avoid getting raped, rather than that it’s a person’s responsibility not to rape.\nIn no way is a woman responsible to dressing to deter rape. This is nothing but victim blaming and as  a social worker who worked with victims of sexual assualt I can assure you that the women who are assaulted are of all shapes/sizes and appearances. It has little to do with sex and more to do with power and control of another person.\nWomen get raped often in more nylon countries where the burkas or niquabs are mandatory so your assumption is inherently wrong.\nWhile I agree with your views about the current objectification of women in our society, I completely disagree that the way in which she dresses means that she is a justified target of sexual assault. I’m sorry, but no.\nA woman has the absolute, undeniable right to walk down the streets of Toronto completely naked without having someone assault them. A woman has the right to walk around dressed head-to-toe in full snow gear without being sexually assaulted.\nPoint is, no matter what a woman is wearing, now matter how much or how little she is wearing, she has a right to not be sexually assaulted.\nPerhaps she invites people to treat her with a certain attitude (ie. treat her like a slut) if she dresses in such a fashion, but in NO WAY is that an excuse for her to be violated. No way, no how.\nI was raped when I was asleep in my bed, where I SHOULD have had every reason to feel safe. Obviously you don’t know shit about this subject, women in every manner of clothing and every situation get raped. It doesn’t matter what you where you where you are, the rapist is the one who did wrong.\nActually there’s nothing to prove that. Most rapists know their victim. What she chooses to wear on any given night has nothing to do with the attack. In fact, some rapists will even target women who dress more conservatively. Women in burkas are raped all the time. As are women in long skirts, fatigues, jumpsuits, ballroom dresses, shorts, pajamas ratty bathrobes and curlers. Furthermore, the term “slutty” can mean different things. To some people it means nothing but boots and to others it means visible wrists. Telling a group of women that they can avoid rape by not dressing slutty even aside from the fact that it’s a huge insult doesn’t add anything constructive. There is nothing a woman can wear that wouldn’t be considered provocative by someone. Responsibility needs to be shouldered by those responsible. A victim of rape is not a slut. They are a victim.\nFair Game, I know rape is scary and not something you want to face, but it’s cowardly to blame the victim. And if a guy really can’t get any without raping or can’t control his impulses, then he probably is not mentally equipped to be having sex in the first place. That’s his problem. It’s not the victim’s fault and I think it’s a little weird that you would side with such a loser.\nSorry, Fair Game, sexual assault is not a crime of passion, but one of violence. Read the research; all types of women, including fully covered women and women in their 80’s are assaulted on a regular basis. Stop trying to blame the victim.\nI agree.  These canadian women are dressing too much vulgar.  In india, women are more traditional and we do not have such things.  but here i seeing many women dressing like sluts (not that i am wanting to complain).  at school, indian girls are dressed conservative and theyr not experience rape but other girls who dressing vulgar and showing body are teasing people.  police man said a good point in my opinion.\nCan you explain why old women in nursing homes have been raped by male nurses?\nOr why children are raped?\nI seriously doubt elderly women or children “dress like sluts”. And saying Hindu,Sikh and Muslim women wouldn’t be raped? Please explain why thousands Hindu and Muslim women who actually *report* being raped to authorities never receive any justice?\nI guess those ladies traditional clothing was just too….ah, traditional? And that is why they were raped?\nI guess I’m just too much of an ignorant woman to understand any of this.\nI am deeply disturbed by this line of thinking. By your point of view, I (a human being, as well as a woman) should be blamed for the choices and actions of others whom I have absolutely no control over, because of how much fabric is covering my body! Does this not seem outrageous to say the least? If you were to leave your house carrying a wallet and there is some indication that that wallet is presently on your body, does that give someone the right to steal it? If someone were to tell you that it’s not the pickpocket’s fault, because you enticed him by taking the wallet out of your pocket to pay for whatever it is you buy, would that be acceptable by your standards?\nThis makes me sick to my stomach. Men are not treated in this fashion, so what in this world that you seem to live in gives you the right to judge women like this?\nFYI: sexual assault is a crime of power, control and violence, not because the assailent is so turned on they have to sexually assault someone and people who observe religious conduct by covering themselves also are victims of sexual assault you are an ignorant person who has no idea what you’re talking about.\nI am always amazed how victim blaming can be so one sided… Would you ever blame a victim of a hold-up? What about of a car-jacking? A break and enter? Of course not, it is patently absurd; however, if police officers have the ignorance to blame rape survivors then they should also hold these other groups partially responsible in motivating their own attacks:\nPerhaps the man who is robbed for his rollex should be held accountable. He dared to ‘show-off the goods’ (ie: his material wealth) and so he should expect to be robbed… right?\nWhat about the old lady driving the $100 00.00+ luxury vehicle? She deserves to be car-jacked. How could she drive around in a car like that and expect not to be car-jacked?\nWhat about the nice couple who worked hard and bought their dream home? Should they be held accountable when they are victims of a home invasion or burglary?\nIf we take the same logic offered by this Toronto officer than it follows that he would recommend that all these other groups should avoid wearning expensive jewellery,driving nice cars, and owning nice homes in order to be less likely to be victims of robbery, car-jacking, and burglary. OF COURSE THIS IS ABSURD!!!! THESE EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE IGNORANCE AND MISOGYNY INHERENT IN BLAMING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. USE YOUR BRAINS PEOPLE…\nYou are completely wrong, most rape victims are introverted, slightly desperate looking, who are alone, rapists dont go for confident people, they are scavengers that look for easy prey like cowards… only really charismatic sexual predetors/cereal killers go for pretty/slutty confident girls but they have a certain something they are looking for….\nthose cereal killers will Trix you, Corn Pop you in the kneecap, rob you of your Life, and all the witnesses will be able to say is “I didn’t get a good look at his face, he just shot the guy and Bran.”\nI apologize to everyone who is nauseated by puns.\nI was going to say “I hope you never have daughters” but I’m almost more scared of what you’d teach your sons!\nRape is not a compliment, you fucking asshole.\nFair Game, show me the statistic that proves Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women “in their traditional clothing” are raped less than other women.\nYou show a lack of understanding of sexual assault and society in general. You express racist and sexist idealogies. The majority of rapists do not even remember what their victim was wearing. Your comments are uneducated and offensive to both men and women. You imply that men cannot control their minds and bodies, you demean women young and old. Women should not have to fear violence and degredation. Think of your mother, sister or daughter – if she walked down the street naked and was raped could you tell her to her face that she ‘deserved’ sexual violence? The only people who can stop rape are rapists.  Nothing a human being wears, says or does justifies sexual assault.\nYou’re an idiot. By your logic if some pervert that’s into feet sees someone wearing open toed shoes he has the right to rape her? I don’t care if a woman is walking down the street naked, that doesn’t give anyone the right to sexually assault her. Just because *you* (or whoever) deems a woman a slut doesn’t make her so.\nHow DARE you, FairGame!\nI was drugged, and gang-raped by 6 men I trusted. I WASN’T drinking alcohol, I WASN’T at a club/party, and I WASN’T “dressed like a slut”.\nI was on a field trip, in front of a motel in the middle of the wilderness, at a bonfire. I was dressed in sweats and a sweatshirt. How does that scream: “Rape me! I’m slutty!” I’m not even that good looking, and I’m certainly not afraid to admit that! I’m not one of your Top Models, nor do I dress sexy.\nI was raped because I’m an independent woman and I don’t conform or allow myself to be peer-pressured or manipulated into doing things. They saw me as a challenge, but knew my character enough to know that I would fight them, tooth and nail, if they tried anything. Which is why they drugged me. Made it easier for them to violate me.\nYou’re a misogynistic pig! I bet you hate women–which must mean you like men. If you like men that much, leave us women the hell alone and go back to that rock you’re living under. Sure, you’ll have to look for a little while, because it’s back in the Dark Ages.\nWhile I agree that many women dress too provocatively, that has NOTHING to do with rape.  I was definitely NOT “eye candy” when I was raped; I am overweight and dress to hide it!  Some people are just sick, whether it is a man or a woman attempting the rape.\nHey fair game it is a womens god given right to dress how ever the fuck she pleases.  What kind of man are you that you don’t like to see women in provacative clothing?\nNot everything the police or the government feed you is right.  Go on thinking that you fucking drone.  OBEY, SLEEP, CONSUME, REPEAT.  Follow those orders and you’l be a model citizen\nDear Fair Game,\nWhat does it mean exactly to be ‘dressed like a slut’? Even if you were somehow able to come up with a clear cut definition, what gives you the right to determine it for the rest of society? Moreover, does getting ‘treated like a slut’ entail sexual assault – are you advocating that those who dress ‘like sluts’ ought to be sexually assaulted? This is absolutely unacceptable, and quite a dangerous comment; what’s next, telling women they shouldn’t wear high-heels because they will get sexually assaulted?\nFurthermore, as Canadians, we all share this society – no matter what religion, gender, and race you are from. Surely, in the 21st century, we have all come to realize the importance of the freedoms and civil liberties we enjoy; to shoot them down, and argue – in your case – for something that is completely a matter of personal taste is not only appalling, but quite barbaric. I certainly agree that our society has problems, and you are correct in pointing out how the media portrays women in advertisements, and how sex appeal is used to sell goods in the market – but that is an entirely separate issue, for which sexual assault victims should NOT be blamed – It simply has nothing to do with them.\nWhat could you possibly mean by ‘the evil terrorists’? Surely you are not implying that those who perpetrate sexual assault are terrorists; as wrong, and as guilty, as both activities are, they are simply not related. Please take care to understand the different terms, the motivations lying behind such activities, and the purposes for which they are conducted.\nIn addition, when an officer of the law – whose job it is to protect citizens, prevent crimes, and arrest criminals – is taking part in a safety information session, he is not representing his own person,  personal values, nor his personal moral outlook on society; he is representing the Toronto Police Department. As such, his flagrantly misogynistic, sexist, and simply revolting opinions should be kept to himself, until such time that he is no longer representing a public security organization, whose aim is to protect individuals, not punish the victim of crimes.\nLastly, if you took care to read, and study about such phenomena, you would understand that they dynamic that underlies sexual assault is not at all similar to what you have described. Please take care to become more informed, because your utter arrogance and ignorance can only assume the role of a burden for a fine society such as our own.\nrape is wrong. even if she dressed like a ‘slut’, a ‘slut’ is  NOT asking for rape, she is asking for consensual sex (and to be paid for it).\nIt seems as if sluts don’t believe in personal responsibility. These poor cops have to deal with sluts who refuse to grow up: http://goo.gl/ODyno\nLet’s address a few of your comments. Let’s pay attention to all victims not just the one’s you may secretly covet. Are you saying elderley woman are eye candy? Little boys are eye candy? In fact there is absolutely no correlation between rape/ molestation and what the victim is wearing! I have stats to back this up. Do you honestly belive Hindu, sikh & muslim women are not sexually abused?!! It’s just not reported because those women would be blamed & punished for it. In many middle eastern countries its legal for a man to rape his wife! Are you excusing a violent act & abuse of power? Is that not like saying his car deserved to be stolen because he drives a BMW? That house deserves to be broken into & robbed because they have a nice tv? Rape/molestation are NEVER the victims fault!! It doesn’t matter what they wear/drink, which family member/uncle/teacher the trust or where they walk/work! The criminal is crossing a line & violating someone else because they are selfish, immature, have no control, have no honor, have a corrupt religion etc. Perhaps what you’re saying is that if you’re to choose a victim you would go for eye candy? You threatened, frightened & are not able to handle sexy women as your equal so that would make perfect sense. (It’s often about control & power issues not about sex.) I may not agree with the use of women in advertising in N.America but I’m glad I am free to dress & express myself as I wish. My final thought: Sex should be enjoyable, sacred, spiritual, sensual, fun and CONSENTUAL for both partners. I hope for your partners sake that you at least come to accept that. Women have just as much right as men to find pleasure in their sexuality without fear or rape.\nrape is a war tactic, all who take part in it are therefore barbarians. people were raping before there was such a thing as “dressing like a slut”-and hindu, sikh, and muslim women get raped every day. is you support rape-and you do, according to what you’ve written (no bs one-line disclaimer at the end can hide that, just as no burqa can hide a woman from a rapist) than you are a moron, and anyone who is not blatantly against rape is FOR the metaphorical rape of his own people (rape historically was inflicted upon women with full knowledge that to destroy an entire group, one must destroy the women which are the core).\nRape is not about being turned on, nor is it about pepsi. It is about inflicting power upon another human being. It has nothing to do with outfits that turn people on-if it did, than cops would be raped all the time.\n“Fair Game”, I am a Hindu and grew up in Mumbai. I wore ‘decent’ Indian clothes – salwar kameezes, fully covered my arms, legs & the rest of my body – except my face. I was molested in public transport on a daily basis. Men would feel me up and stare & say lewd things.\nI am not the only one who faced this on a daily basis. Every girl I know who grew up in India and stepped out of her home was harassed.\nWill your next suggestion be to stay at home & avoid going out, if you’re a woman?\nYou’re an ignorant misogynist and a clueless privileged man who has never had to face the humiliation of being touched or treated inappropriately.\nHow about this phrase: “Men can avoid sexually assaulting women by not sexually assaulting women.”\n@Fair Game, “You can avoid acting like a misogynistic neanderthal by not acting like a misogynistic neanderthal”.\nLOL @ women getting sexually assaulted due to the way they dress. Nothing but ignorance and hate.\nYou’re right – women ask to be raped. WHAT AN IDIOT. It’s people like you who make it hard for victims to ever ask for help .\nSo why is it that men who walk around public parks bare chested, only shorts on aren’t asking to be “raped”?!\nWe are all human, In our country, in this day and age we still have a major double standard!!\nYeah, because women who dress in their traditional clothing never suffer violence from men, except for honour killings, and forced marriages to old men, and being executed in ‘traditional’ societies for being raped (because all they were was their cherry, so when you have garbage you might as well throw it away, right?) while their rapist(s) gets the lash. Of course no one commits incest where ‘traditional’ values rule. No one’s gay either. We’d know if anyone did or was because those societies are so frank and clear eyed about such things. Those societies are not founded on a retrograde and backward superstitious idiocy.\nand this is without getting into all the prepubescent girls who get raped, the old ladies who get assaulted, often in their own homes…\nno, its all about the sluts you miserable stupid arse.\nThere have been thousands of Muslim and Hindu women worldwide who have been raped.. covered or not. The amount of ignorance infused in your comment is the reason people give up on society. Do you really believe that only women showing skin get assaulted?\nIt’s people like you who have taught this officer and other impressionable public figures that it’s okay to generalize people like this. A whole lot of you seem to take offence when someone tells it how it is though, so I expect you to be pretty upset with me at the moment.\nTROLLLLLLLL!\nGet back under yer bridge where you belong!\nWell put… I also want to add that the officer isn’t implying that they deserve to be victims… Or that the perp shouldn’t be punished… He is simply stating that in order to avoid putting yourself in a situation of risk… Tone it down a little…. !  Much as a zookeeper might advise that you don’t strap a steak to your body and enter the lion cage!   Use your heads ladies….!\nSeveral women who were fully clothed have been brutally raped you fuck wit.\nRape is about control not women dressing in “slutty” outifts.\nWhat is your problem? women should be able to dress however they want?  They do not dress like sluts for men to rape them.\nAnd exactly, everyone dresses this way now, does that mean everyone deserves to be raped or assaulted?\nWhen making such ignorant comments think of your mother, sisters, nieces, grandmothers, etc.\nYou sir are a dumbass.  🙂\nAre you serious? I have dressed in very modest clothing all of my life. I thought not dressing provocatively and not going out at dark hours would leave me safe. Was I safe? NO!  I still ended up being sexually assaulted.\nI also completely agree with the cop. Matter of common sense, really.\nYou’re an idiot. My best friend was raped in her Marine Corps Mess uniform; she was covered in head to toe with her damned rank on her shoulder.\nYou owe every man on the planet an apology for being so insulting. Men are completely capable of controlling their sexuality. No real man needs to rape a woman because he thought her skirt was sexy. Sure women dress to attract mates ,as do men, it is not an invitation to take something that without consent. I’m sure you know that .\nHere again we see institutional feminism confronting society in an obnoxious, spoiled brat kind of way. I can hear the truckload of  DONTATE NOW buttons hitting the webistes  — This is such a ridiculous joke — I can’t wait for Harper to cut all funding to this nonsensical educational directive that is womens studies et. al. – a more divisive topic has never been adopted by our school systems and I’m terrified for any young man who has to live under the police state that these feminist architects have implemented. Stop giving court to these nutbags who wake up every morning determined to be offended…\nBut it is that the victim is being blamed. Men who say that are just trying to pass the blame onto the victim- ‘Oh you wore a miniskirt well it’s your own dang fault then’. It’s pathetic. Most girls who are raped don’t dress like sluts. Rape is entirely the fault of the rapist. I mean, do people want girls to walk around all day dressed like nuns and never go out at night? We shouldn’t need to do that. Men should be able to control themselves. Men aren’t accused of ‘dressing like sluts’ when they wear short shorts and walk around with no shirt.\nwomen of all shapes, sizes, colors, ages, and dress get sexually assaulted. men should learn to control their anger and learn to treat people with respect. the real problem is men who believe they have the right to take what ever they want from women when ever they want.\nyour comment is so incredibly misogynistic, unfounded and dangerous. it is so far from depicting the realities of sexual violence and works only to perpetuate the myth that some how survivors of sexual violence (female or male) are responsible for their perpetrator’s actions.\nsexual assault is defined by a lack of consent. period. no consent = sexual assault. no where in that legal definition is there any sort of wiggle room around dress, skirt length, traditional clothing, attitude or relative “sluttiness.”\nand i’m going to go ahead and call bullshit on your claim that women who wear traditional clothing are not targets of sexual violence. talk to the women who walk into my office daily to share their stories of intimate partner violence. or the men who experience violence in their own lives.\nalso – it is unfair for you to make broad sweeping generalizations about “girls today” and the “whole lot of them taking offence.”\nsorry if this comes off as curt, but you seem to be someone who appreciates people “telling it like it is.”\nFair Game, I happen to disagree with you. “You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? That’s beyond ridiculous.\nAnd what’s up with men choosing their “victim” based on how they dress? Do you really believe “hindu or sikh or muslim who was covered in their traditional clothing” don’t get sexually assaulted? It is evident from your illogical statements that you need some intense training on this topic.\n“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? ”\ngreat comment. It really doesn’t mean anything, just a thoughtless comment from somebody who doesn’t even think about what the implications of his words are. I know of women who were sexually harassed who were very conservatively dressed. As well, for some Muslim fanatics if a women shows even her face that is a justification to do whatever they want, because as in the previous comment “dress like a slut you will get treated like one”.\nYou are a disgusting excuse for a human being, and a poorly educated, socially ignorant one at that.\nAnyone who knows the first thing about sexual assault is aware that it is a crime of power and has nothing to do with “eyecandy”.  In fact, most victims of sexual assault know the perpetrator intimately – whether it be a family member, friend or other acquaintance.  Are you going to tell me that children, the elderly and otherly abled women are assaulted because they are dressed like “sluts”?  Did you actually just argue that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women aren’t victims of sexual assault?\nLet me educate you a little bit about what a “fair game” entails.  A “fair game” is one in which a person feels safe walking around regardless of their gender, creed, religion, ability, sexual orientation or the way in which they choose to adorn their body.  A “fair game” is one in which a victim of a heinous crime feels comfortable approaching a police officer – who, after all, is paid to protect citizens’ safety – without feeling judged or reproached.\nKudos to you for being one of the most ignorant and simple-minded people I’ve ever encountered.\nHey Fair Game,\nI was raped . . . by my boyfriend. Your move.\nI’m so sorry. Thank you for being brave enough to use your story to stick up for other women against insensitive jerks.\nMy ex attempted to rape me while retrieving belongings he had left at my house (fortunately, my dog is super protective and started biting him).\nI was also sexually assaulted while wearing a long-sleeved, knee-length dress with a cami that hid my cleavage, my hair in a bun, heavy black stockings and ballet flats. Hardly slutty, didn’t stop five guys from surrounding me and groping/grabbing and trying to violate me until my friends caught them and kicked them out of the restaurant we were in.\nYour dog is a better person than Fair Game will ever be.\nI’m very sorry about the things that bad people have chosen to do and try to do to you. The last thing anyone (even worse a law enforcement officer!) should do is pretend you somehow made it happen, whether you were wearing a miniskirt or a burqa.\nWomen are raped in middle eastern countries where they cover up, too.  Did you think of that?\nRapists attack people who are vulnerable.  That can mean children and elderly people, too.  Women with disabilities are more likely to be raped than those who are able-bodied for that reason.  It’s not about provocative clothing.  Rapists act out of a desire to hurt and humiliate their victims, and to have power over them.  Isn’t this a whole lot more worthy of criticism than women’s clothing?\n“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” definitely implies that the victims are responsible for crimes against them, and is a disgusting statement that I can’t believe anyone would utter these days.  Clothing is not consent for sex, as everyone knows, and “no” is not a hard word to understand.  Arguing that rapists can’t understand it is a huge load of crap.  After all, “no” is one of the first words we learn as children…so there’s no excuse for rapists regardless of what the victim was wearing.\nIt’s sad that people like “Fair Game” feel the need to criticize the victims rather than the violent criminals who abuse them…\nThere are so many things wrong with this statement but here are the things that really bother me:\n1) The onus is NOT on the woman to not get raped, it is on the rapist to NOT RAPE. NO ONE ever deserves to be raped, and it is NEVER a woman’s fault that she was raped. NEVER. Even if she was dressing in a way that you don’t personally approve of.\n2) Rape is not about sexual attraction, it is about POWER. Just because a woman is more covered does not mean that a man who is going to rape, will not rape her. It sounds AWFUL, and it IS AWFUL, but rape is not about “eyecandy”. It is all about power and trying to attain power by forcing someone into doing something they don’t want to.\nWell when the rapists start listening then hurray for you, till then I suggest you take it upon yourself to help prevent rape. If you are raped it is no way your fault but again can’t help to reduce the chances.\nThis is the same way I take measures on not getting murdered. Yes the onus SHOULD be on the murderer to stop killing people I do however in the meantime not pick up hitchhikers.\nI’d also like to point out that I also do not agree with Fair Game but I do agree with the officer in the article UNTIL I find evidence that is not a quote from the woman who took offense to the statement that the officer was implying that the women are to blame for the rape.\nIf the officer was simply saying not dressing like a slut can reduce the risk of rape (from opportunistic rape) then by all means he should be able to say that. Yes there will still be rapes on covered up women and “ugly” women but until the rapists decide to stop raping you’ll have to take the responsibility to help not get raped. Which again DOES NOT MEAN you take responsibility for getting raped if you do. RAPE IS WRONG REGARDLESS OF WHO HOW OR WHY IT IS DONE!\nIf you are trying to make a helpful or constructive point you’d be doing everyone a favor by not. Traditional Muslim women suffer rape. Nuns suffer rape. Grandmothers and little girls suffer rape. Dressing like a “slut” has nothing to do with it.\nOf course no one wants to get raped and tries to avoid it!!  No one wants to have their house robbed either! Just imagine your house is robbed & things that are special to you are destroyed. \xa0Imagine the police show up assess how ‘nice’ your garden looks. Now imagine they make you feel guilty (or even worse blame you) for attracting the thieves. They tell you it’s your fault. (seriously you’d be pissed!) No one would accept that! Are you picking up what I’m saying? Let’s realistically assume what attracts one thief to one house may not be the same as what attracts another thief to another house. Would an arbitrary authority telling us how to decorate our house so they all looked a certain way be effective? We can take all the precautions we can afford (deadbolts, bars on the windows & alarm systems) but if a thief still robs you would you not agree it’s not your fault? \xa0\xa0\nWe have the right to decorate & enjoy your home anyway we want! You may not agree with your neighbors idea of what looks ‘nice’ but you must agree you both deserve the same right to be protected? The thief should receive the same penalty regardless of how we each decorate our homes? The thief is at fault!\n\xa0\n\xa0You’d also get pretty pissed off if a judge sentenced the criminal to 1month jail time because she thought your garden looked shitty but sentenced your neighbors thief to 2 yrs because theirs was nicer looking in the judges eyes!! Thats not how our system works! It shouldn’t work like that in rape cases either!! \xa0\xa0\nHow do sluts dress?  Do I deserve to get raped because I’m wearing a skirt? How about if I tell you it goes past my knee, do I still deserve it now? If I’m wearing a long sleeved sweater, is that okay? Or does it have to be a certain degree of baggy before it passes your “shouldn’t get raped” standards?\nSaying things like “dress like a slut you will get treated like one” is EXACTLY the kind of statement that contributes to the rape culture that makes men think rape is okay, and it’s wildly misogynistic – what, exactly, should MEN avoid wearing so they don’t get raped?  Oh, there’s nothing? Men can wear whatever they want?  But women have to dress with a degree of modesty defined by the individual minds of every man on the planet, or hey, it’s her fault.\nAnd by the way, douchebag, women in hindu, sikh, and muslim cultures get raped ALL THE TIME.  There’s a well-documented history of family members MURDERING women from those cultures who are raped, despite their “traditional clothing.” So, as it turns out, forcing women to cover up not only FAILS to protect them from rapists, but also dehumanizes them even further, by implying that after being raped, they’re not even worthy of life.\nThe way to stop rape is for RAPISTS TO STOP RAPING, not for women to swaddle themselves away from male gaze.\nWell put sister. Agree on all fronts, glad someone is able to articulate exactly what is so offensive about this comment without relying on name-calling.\nI don’t agree.  I’ll have less hotties to look at >=(\nYour comment reeks of ignorance.  Women who dress provocatively are not the only women who get sexually assaulted.  And there is no law against dressing in a way you think will attract the opposite sex.  The idea that the way you dress is what gets you raped is beyond ridiculous.  You and the police officer in question need a bit of education\nExcept that the thing about rapists is that *they rape people*\nThey rape women who are fat and they rape women that are thin.\nThey rape women who are tall and they rape women that are short.\nThey rape women of colour and caucasian women.\nThey rape women wearing snow pants and a parka on a winter day, or they rape a woman wearing a short skirt.\nThey use rape as a tool of war in war-torn countries.\nThey rape children, and they rape men.\nThey are family members, coworkers, police officers, doctors, bosses, students, teachers, friends.\nSo instead of trying to punish some women for being sexually active, or blaming them for the terrible thing that happened to them.  You can encourage people to respect consent and bodily autonomy and *not* rape people.\nExcuse me “Fair Game” you have no idea what you are talking about. How about you get educated and then talk. It doesn’t matter what women wear. Assault happens because people like you choose to focus on the victim rather than the perpetrator. “I’m sure” doesn’t carry much weight. Women should be able to wear what they want either way. That is not a reason. Assault is about power, it doesn’t matter whether she’s “eyecandy”. I suggest you take a course from Women’s Studies before you continue with your sexism.\nI imagine you must dress like an ignorant misogynist because you certainly sound like one! Perhaps instead of choosing a “slut” to rape, the men responsible could just not rape anyone! What a crazy idea.\nFair Game, you sound like a real class act.  Are you seriously under the impression that the only women who get raped are “eye candy”? I can’t think of a more ignorant comment you could have made.\nClearly you are a man who hates seeing women in control of themselves, and would prefer if we were all veiled to keep men from getting excited.  I pity the women in your life. I’m sure you’d be really sympathetic if any of them were ever raped, but, hey, it would be their own fault if the rapist found them attractive, right?\nActually, no. It has been well established, time and time again, that rape has nothing to do with how someone is or isn’t dressed. That is a myth used to excuse rapists and blame victims, like what’s happening here. And even if there WAS a correlation, it would STILL be disgusting to blame victims for being raped, because it STILL wouldn’t be their fault.\nThe Toronto police officer’s comment is truly disturbing because he blames the victim for unwanted, forced sexual violence. Blaming the victim means that you hold the person who was attacked responsible for that violence that they suffered. It implies that the victim coulda, shoulda, woulda avoided the attack and therefore was partially responsible for what would inevitably happen.  Sadly, that couldn’t be farther from the truth.  Rape is regularly and consistently used every day by men all over the world as a way of asserting power and dominance over women.  It is a system of control moreso than a sexual act, and therefore it really doesn’t matter what the woman is wearing.\nIt’s really sad that the police officer who made this comment is in a position of any kind of authroity. With flagrantly sexist and mysogenistic attitudes like that, women in Toronto are certainly less safe. He should be fired or resign from his duties.\nYou ARE aware that rape is rampant Hindi, Sikh and Muslim women, yes?\nI cannot believe the last post. It is people like you that are the problem with society today! I am a male, and regardless of my gender I think that the victims of sexual harrasment should NEVER be to blame.\nDo you think the way a woman dresses, really changes the perspective of a predator. How small minded are you? Have you not been reading about the recent events in egypt, where even women in traditional muslim clothing are being sexual harrassed?\nJust an FYI, you and your opinion disgust  me.\nHey, Fair Game.\nNews flash. Sexual assault is a crime of violence, not sex. It’s a power issue, not one of sexual attraction. When I was raped, I was wearing a winter coat, an oversized sweater and baggy jeans – what’s so slutty about that?\nI’m sorry but what you wear has NOTHING to do with it, a lot of sexual assaults happen to women who are in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nOr to women that have been watched for weeks or even months, and ‘Fair Game’ I bet you any money they don’t always look like sluts.\n& just so you know, Muslims and Sikh women who do wear traditional clothing are just as much at risk if they’re in the wrong place, walking in dark areas and alone.\nYou and this officer disgust me.\nThe safety tips should have been general:\nAvoid being alone late at night.\nStay in well lit areas.\nActually, there’s zero correlation between rape and how someone is dressed, even if you discount the fact that most assaults are committed by relatives and partners. Outside of the societal myths that support rape culture, there’s nothing linking costume, conventional attractiveness, health, fitness, weight, or any other physical trait with rape, completed or attempted.\nNone.\nI also admit to being curious whether you actually believe that cultures which shame women into covering their bodies more fully are magical rape-free zones, which is what you seem to be suggesting.\nYou can’t have it both ways – either you’re blaming the attacker, or you’re suggesting there’s something the woman could have done to avoid being assaulted. There’s no middle ground there, at all. To say that women should expect to be assaulted and should modify their lives accordingly is to support the belief that women should be contained, covered, and chaperoned. It also infantilises men, suggesting there’s no chance that they could learn not to rape.\nRather than wasting time victim-blaming – and that’s what you’re doing, even with your mealy-mouthed proviso to the contrary – spend your time asking yourself exactly how we’re going to pound it into assailants’ heads that rape is bad, it is not excusable, it is not acceptable, and it is not ever anyone’s fault but theirs.\nSuperbly put, Judith. I could not agree with you more.\nAre you fucking kidding me?!?! Cause everyone who gets sexually assaulted MUST be wearing something slutty\nFucking ignorant idiots 😐\nYou know nothing about the anatomy of rape, do you?\nThe elderly and babies are targeted, along with people anywhere on & off the gender spectrum, of all shapes, sizes, colours, creeds, wardrobes.  It’s not about them looking pretty, hot, sexy, nor slutty.  It’s about power.\nThe main purpose of rape is power for the rapist, not sexual gratification.\nFalse false faaaalse. Are we fucking done with the sexism and rape apologism? Women do not get raped because of what they wear, but because a disgusting human being RAPED them. 80% of victims know their rapist, so quit it with the ”stranger in a dark alley raping a young woman with a short skirt” trope.\nMuslim women are raped all the time. Ugly women are raped. Fat women are raped. Actually, 1 out of 6 women will be raped in her lifetime. You are an ignorant misogynist.\nperhaps we should tell men who are victims of crime that it’s their fault too. maybe they should be advised that if they travel or go out at night, they’re just asking to be mugged or robbed. because they are after all just making themselves eye candy to the thieves.\nYou’re honestly calling women who are dressed like sluts “Fair Game” for being attacked? That gives someone fair reason to sexually assault a woman? Using your flawed theory, that gives me the right to attack you because you’re going around flaunting an opinion I don’t like. Same concept, there is no real logic behind it.\nYou sir, have your morals backwards. I also don’t understand why you are referring to it as ‘your’ Society like you are not a part of it too. You are a part of the so-called problem of half-naked women selling pepsi and coke and people purchasing it.\nUse your head, innocent people have no right to be attacked.\nShort version of Mr. ‘Fair Game”s comment: “women who don’t adhere to my religion should be raped.”\nI’d say you just need to get laid, but, really, men like you need to be castrated. You’re encouraging violent criminals – if you’re not one yourself – and you’re giving the rest of us a bad name.\nWork on your self-loathing, kid. Here’s a hint on where to start; women aren’t to blame for it. Stop punishing them because you’re afraid of their bodies and your own.\nI hope you do some growing up before you really damage someone.\nWell said George!!  Great assessment of fair game’s personality! I’d say you got it exactly right!  Hopefully he gets some help with his issues around sexuality and insecurity.\nTo the person who commented that if a woman dresses slutty, she is therefore to blame for any unwanted sexual advances/assaults should probably get their head examined. Completely backward and illogical thinking when it comes to womens’ issues like sexual assault is asinine and it’s that out of touch thought process that scare women off from reporting these crimes.\nAnd the motivation to sexually assault a woman has been rarely reported as a result of what the victim is wearing compared to a crime of convenience (victim was easy to access and isolate), a result of the perpetrator’s upbringing (bad childhood/was assaulted as a child) ,societal pressures, etc.. A lot of these men also have social/behavioral issues, as well.\nLastly, women are assaulted everyday, whether they’re wearing a parka in the dead of winter, or short -shorts in the middle of summer. Neither are acceptable and neither is your comment. It’s actually quite disgusting and ignorant. It almost feels as if you think they DESERVE to be raped because of what they’re wearing. Personally, I think YOU deserve a smack upside the head for even writing any of that.\nMuch as I hate to admit it, the first comment does have a point. We live in a time when if you go to our ‘universities’ (our esteemed institutions of learning), all that the people are doing in the hallways, benches, under trees, in every place one looks is doing everything but having the actual act of sex. In such a pornified society as this where its all about flaunting what you got on a beach or at a university…people may not realize the attitudes that are fostered towards them when they act as ‘sluts’.\nAnd yes its true that rape is not the exclusive domain of western foreigners, it still is a sizeable occurance as compared to other countries in the eastern part of the world (saudi arabia)-not saying that it doesn’t happen- but that its much much much less on a ratio basis even taking into account people who won’t report it because the same thing happens here in canada and the USA.\n@Thinking about #1, too bad rape is not about sex then, and actually about power. Rapists rape people who are vulnerable, which has nothing to do with anyone’s perceived “sluttiness.”\nYea, the difference between what’s going on at the universities and what’s covered here is that one happens between two consenting adults and the other one is a CRIME.\nSo if you get married, have kids, so everyone knows decisively that you’re most definitely NOT a virgin, does that mean we can now declare a rape open season? OBVIOUSLY *NOT*.\nIt is immoral and illegal to force something upon another person, ESPECIALLY something as violent and degrading as rape!!!!!\npersonally, I feel people who wear a certain brand of clothing are all idiots but that doesn’t mean I now have a license to assault anyone wearing that brand of clothing!\nYou are full of it, “Fair Game” — and frankly seem to be getting a little too much enjoyment out of the idea that people “deserve” to be raped. Rape is a crime of power, to suggest it’s primarily sexual attraction that motivates it goes everything we know about the subject. You’re also full of it re: “traditional clothing” as we know damn well the rape culture that exists in some of the societies with very traditional dress. Seriously, look in the mirror, you are expressing some very backward and honestly borderline evil attitudes. This Officer was WAY out of line.\nIf you knew a single thing about sexual assault and rape you’d know it’s about power and dominance, not about ‘eye candy’.\nYou are completely correct.\nMuslim women are obviously never the victims of sexual violence.\nSound logic.\nA woman should not have to cover herself from head to foot to feel safe.\nI blame the officer for being so crass, but it’s not like this is an isolated issue. This society fosters a rape culture, where it’s on the potential victim to hope they’re not picked out by some rapist tonight. It’s a society which makes women afraid to go to the police because they’re “asking for it” by dressing or acting a certain way.\nFair Game,\nyou’re a disgusting misogynist. Educate yourself.\nMost women aren’t sexually assaulted because of how they dress. They’re usually assaulted by men that they know personally.\n‘You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. ‘\nSo you’re justifying rape now, you pathetic scumbag?\n‘That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. ‘\nThat doesn’t even make any sense. Are you justifying Muslim terrorism because women wear tank tops and dresses that don’t cover their knees? How stupid are you?\n‘They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.’\nSo women need to be fully covered up to avoid being raped? What kind of sexist double standard is that? As a man I find you’re comment an insult to me personally. You’re treating men as if they’re animals who can’t control themselves. What a ignoramus you are.\nAnd here’s a newsflash: Women don’t need to justify their worth to you by dressing the way you prefer them to dress. If you’re so small-minded that you’d judge a woman negatively not by her character and actions but by how much skin she shows, than you’re the one who needs to change.\nHey Fair Game…\nMy soulsister was sexually assaulted by a man at her synagogue when he drove her home. She wears long sleeved shirts, jeans, and never wears makeup. She’s one of the least “slutty” girls I know. Also, most cases of rape/sexual assault are done by men that are close to them such as boyfriends, husbands, relatives…\nAnd of course, we haven’t touched upon same sex or female-on-male sexual assault.\nThat cop is a pig.  Sexual assault should never be a frightening cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim “looks” like.\nHe’s also an idiot. Everyone knows that pigs who rape women or who expose themselves or whatever else, have serious mental problems that go way beyond their “weapon of choice.” Just because they can’t keep it in their pants, doesn’t mean it has ANYTHING to do with actual sex.  Anger, rage, hatred, revenge and jealousy are the main reasons men rape.\nToronto Police are NOT educating their members!  (Pardon the pun).\nThe policeman does not have to issue the apology. He has not done anything wrong. It is just a suggestion people. Dont make such a big deal over this! If you do not dress like sluts, then ignore the suggestion. Why bother to get so offended?\nDressing slutty at night is like wearing a redsuit when a stupid bull is around. Smart people will avoid dressing in red. Do not give rapers an incentive by not dressing slutty, trust me, it will help you alot. (Althought it has been proven that colour red does not anger a bull)\nAfter all the policeman just voiced his thoughts – freedom of speech – and if you do not like it, then ignore it.\nLastly always look around when you are alone 🙂\nIt’s not just a suggestion, and women covering up won’t suddenly make rape go away or stop assaults.  Not only is it an ignorant comment that the police officer made but the fact that he is a cop makes it worse because he is supposed to one of the “good guys” who will help the victims. As well, the definition of “slutty” can be almost anything. Maybe the pants were not baggy enough, shirt not baggy enough, should of wore a jacket, should of wore a veil….how far do you want to go? There is never a justification.\nP.S. freedom of speech also involves the right to voice dissent against ignorance.\n@Fair suggestion, It is absolutely wrong to spread misinformation like that because it leads to the perpetuation of a culture in which women are held responsible for a crime committed against them. It is absolutely NOT TRUE that promiscuous dress “attracts” rapists. Please educate yourself:\nA Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only 4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior (“sluttiness”) on the part of the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple as a glance). Additionally most convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.\nThe policeman should issue an apology, though the explanation should be prepared by the police service and be to the effect of, “We did not properly educate this officer on the subjects he discussed.”\nThe logic you use is astounding. First you suggest there’s a relationship between rape and time of day, and then in one breath assert that one should not wear red around a bull while in the next seem to suggest awareness of the fact bulls are colour blind…\nLastly, awareness isn’t the best way to protect yourself. The average rapist is known to the victim, and spends time grooming said victim. If there’s not a previous relationship, the perpetrator takes steps to circumvent his victim’s awareness and preparedness. There is, frankly, no way to completely avoid being a victim. Rather it is better to make oneself a harder target.\nNo, what the policeman is doing is blaming the victim and in so doing he is creating an atmosphere in which rape is seen as being more acceptable because it really “not the rapist’s fault”. Unless this kind of crap is stamped on every time we hear it we will continue to have a society where women can’t even answer their own front door without the fear of rape.\nNo one asks to be raped, unless it’s a fantasy of yours. Period.\nFreedom of speech isn’t quite the same thing when you’re in a position of formal public trust and wearing the uniform of a sworn service. Stop making stuff up.\nPeople are making a big deal of this because you fundamentally DO NOT GET IT and are advancing a very dangerous line of reasoning. You are ENABLING the problem. You and your attitudes are PART of the problem. Listen and learn, stop being so pig-headed. This stuff counts.\nPeople could cover every inch of skin, lock themself in a house, master self-defense, carry a knife, carry a gun, wear a locked metal “chastity belt”, and still get raped. We can take measures to protect ourselves, and still get assaulted. Sometimes sexual assault happens long after a person has been made a victim.\nSometimes the people who commit the crime are the ones we turn to for protection, the ones we think will never hurt us. Sometimes it can happen where we feel the safest. Sometimes it happens when we least expect it.\nSubjectivity aside, what the police officer said is worse than unhelpful. If a person were to believe him, were to believe that by dressing conservatively s/he could avoid or discourage rape, they might believe they were safe.\nThat police officer is terrible. This whole “dressing like a slut” business actually has nothing to do with a woman’s preference of clothing. “Dressing like a slut” is an EXCUSE used by perpetrators to justify hurting another person.\nTo say that a woman who dresses how she wants to dress deserves to be raped is like saying that you deserve to be hit by a car if you’re around a road. It doesn’t matter if you’re at a crosswalk or have the pedestrian right-of-way or even on the sidewalk – you’re near the road, so I’m going to run you over with my car. Sure, I could CHOOSE not to and keep going on my merry way, but because you’re close to a street, it means you’re “asking for it,” right? I mean, if you didn’t want to become a victim of vehicular homicide, surely you would NEVER go near a road.\nEveryone needs to chill out and take a look at this UN crime survey before we keep bashing the guy who made the first comment and the police officer in question:\nhttp://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap_percap-crime-rapes-per-capita\nIt is shown that the majority of the top 20 nations with the highest prevalence of rape in the world are those with the greatest female civil liberties, which includes the freedom to dress as they please. (South Africa, Australia, Canada, USA, France, UK, etc.) The others are mostly impoverished nations with weaker law enforcement established. (Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Dominica, Venezuela, etc.)\nIt is shown that many of the the bottom 20 countries surveyed are predominantly governed under Islamic Law or with a legal code modeled after Islamic Law, with far fewer female civil liberties. (Azerbaijan, Yemen, Indonesia, Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, etc.) Rape is actually found to be the least prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where many foreign observers find women to have the fewest civil liberties.\nThis information was found in about 2 minutes, which suggests that the people most in need of education are those blindly criticizing our friend who made the first post. His point is valid and so is that of the police officer, statistics show. However, the officer probably should have exercised more tact in his choice of words, which by the looks of them suggest that they have been taken somewhat out of context, in my non-expert opinion.\nPlease, before anyone tells me that I am placing the blame on victims, read the following: Rape is against the law and I do not condone it. The tragic fact is this: people are going to rape people no matter what. There is nothing anyone can do to eliminate it without revoking our civil liberties to extreme degrees.\nThe biggest problem with numbers and estimates on rape has to do with a severe under-reporting of these incidents, due in large part to cultural issues such as this one. If a woman feels embarrassed or worries that she won’t be taken seriously when reporting a rape (e.g. being told she looks slutty and was probably asking for it), why would she bother making it worse on herself? Embarrass the victim, protect the rapist. Not to mention how many women in other nations will get stoned to death for being an “adulteress” or having sex outside of marriage when someone (yes, even a family member) rapes them. There’s a lot of incentive to keep your mouth shut when someone violates you.\nThere are a lot of nuances here, and it’s hard to trust the numbers. Not that they should have anything to do with this–rape is rape, regardless of religion, dress, geographic location, sex/gender, age, or any other demographic someone should happen to pull out in defence of ignorance.\nThat site clearly says:\n“DEFINITION: Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”\nThe actual prevalence of rape IS NOT reflected in this chart, the website itself says so. This is a collection of reported rapes, not real prevalence.\nIn many Middle Eastern countries women who are rape victims can be publicly punished with lashings, killed by the family members or shunned by their community. Therefore, reporting is low. Try reading all the information before trying to use these statistics to your advantage.\nI just want to point out that statistics like that are based upon REPORTED crime, or government estimates. In some countries being raped can lead to you being condemned to death, I’d say that’s a reason to keep it quiet. In countries with more equal rights for women, women are more likely to report crimes against them. In countries where rape is understood as a crime of power, and victim blaming is slightly less of a problem, more people will come forward. Even in the US, where I’m from, most assaults go unreported.\nLook at the caveat on the survey you just posted: “Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”\nIn countries governed by Islamic law, rapes are vastly under reported precisely because the victim is often blamed for somehow soliciting the assault. In many cases, when the victim is a woman, the victim is then charged with adultery. A man’s word counts more than a woman’s so the rapist can simply claim the woman seduced him to avoid a rape charge. Naturally, this reduces the number of recorded rapes because 1) it’s not recorded as a rape if it’s recorded as adultery and 2) who the hell risks reporting rape in a country where they’re more likely to punish the victims? This is precisely the reason why all of us are mad at rape apologists like Fair Game and the policeman in the article. They enable rapists by blaming the victim for the crime.\nAlso @Edgar Graham, shame on you for pretending to state the facts while at the same time confounding correlation and causation.* They are not the same. If you don’t condone rape, please don’t inadvertently contribute to rape culture by supporting rape apologists and not reading your own sources correctly.\n*An example: While red hair and freckles often occur together (correlation), it does not necessarily follow that red hair CAUSES freckles (it doesn’t).\n@mynameisbutters\nExcellent comment but unfortunately too many people are so uneducated in science and basic statistics that they can’t separate correlation from causation.\nThere is research showing correlation between teenagers who have breakfast with family and sexual activity at a later age.  An idiot would claim breakfast cereals have the magical ability to make kids more “moral” but in reality, it’s because typically, children who have breakfast with their family come from more close-knit families with more attentive parents.\nThese statistics don’t show anything about whether “dressing slutty” makes you more likely to be raped.  I’d go so far as to say that countries where women’s freedoms are greatly restricted don’t create an environment where it’s easy for women to report rape in the first place.  Rape is very prevalent in many African countries, for example, but do you think that society there provides recourse for victims, or even acknowledges that a crime has taken place in most cases?\nYou’ll notice the DRC isn’t recorded, where rape is used as a weapon of war. Also, many of those countries at the bottom of the list don’t consider marital rape a crime.\nAs the majority of responses to your post have pointed out, this is a report on sexual assault that is reported or otherwise recorded. The relationship between reports of sexual assault and the civil liberties women have in that country cannot be over-emphasized; it is far easier to report a sexual assault in a country which will take your report seriously. The report in question does not define “rape” or take into account the differences in definition by region. I prefer the term sexual assault, as it encompasses many different aspects of the term than just forced intercourse.\nIn many of the countries you reference as being in the bottom 20, reporting a sexual assault is a fast track to ostracism on the nice end of things. Can you imagine how difficult it must be for a woman to disclose sexual violence to the men who think her ankles are to be hidden? I know from travelling to some of these countries that women are blamed for many types of sexual assault, including being groped or frotteurised on public transit; these women should not be in public surrounded by men is the logic used. It does stand to reason that in a country where women are “allowed” to say no, they will report a man who doesn’t respect their use of the word or their attempts to protect their civil liberties and personal safety.\nI don’t think you are necessarily placing blame on the victim, however, I do think it’s a good idea for you to look into the subject a little more thoroughly.\nA few things the officer in question, as well as most of the comments, seem to disregard include male on male sexual assault, or even what dressing “like a slut” entails. The word is, after all, a misogynist insult in itself. If a young boy is assaulted, is it possible he also dressed like a slut? Or perhaps it’s more to the point that in justification of his actions a rapist will say he was overcome by feelings of lust based on his victim’s attire rather than say the truth: he is a violent offender who will take whatever excuse he can create to be violent toward his preferred victim.\nNaturally countries where the legal penalty for having been raped is stoning have fewer rapes, not less reporting.\nSo if you have sharia law in these societies, then you have a situation wherein a woman’s testimony in a court of law is worth only half a mans. So if two men hold a woman down while a third rapes her, and then she goes to the police, her testimony counts for nothing against that of her three rPISTS, NO?\nSo how many fucking rapes do you think are likely to get reported in these shitholes?\nOkay, here’s a serious question.\nIs it okay or not okay for advertisers of products and makers of pop music video clips to use semi-naked models in slutty clothes and make-up?\nThere have undoubtedly been hundreds (if not thousands) of graduate theses on this very subject–I think the resounding answer to your question is, “The jury’s still out.” Or, at the very least, it will remain a contentious issue for a very long time (if not forever).\nWhat is the bigger consideration to me is the definition of the word “slut” and its implied meaning. It’s a tired observation, but it’s still true–guys who sleep around are seen as manly and deserving of respect for their sexual prowess, whereas girls who have the confidence to enjoy their own sexuality while behaving the same way are completely disrespected and dismissed as tramps. Where’s the equality in that? Even when men get called sluts and whores in popular culture, the connotation is a positive or non-serious one.\nRather than do an overhaul on advertising practices, I’d like to see a complete rewrite of cultural understanding and acceptance when it comes to female sexuality. You can’t shame sluts if the concept of being a slut doesn’t exist.\nLast I checked, dressing provocatively is part of their job description so I don’t really see your point!  Part of their job description is also to be more attractive than the vast lot of us (except me because I’m gorgeous LOL LOL)\nCome to think of it, you’ve posted more than one random non-issues that no one but you think is a thought provoker here.\nIf I were you I wouldn’t go around calling myself “clear thinking” because it’s an embarrassment.\nLet us remember, people, that rapists are sick people; they enjoy violent and brutally having sex. How a woman dresses play very little in a rapist committing the act or not. Seriously, do you think that because you are wearing long jeans and a sweater you risk no chance of getting rape?? I have big news for you!\nPretending that the way women dress is a direct consequence of what men will do to do is actually both offensive for men and women: it seems to suggest that women who are covering more their body will not be victim of rape and it also suggests that men cannot control their actions (1) and that they enjoy brutally and violently forcing a women into having sex (2); i’m not sure how many men would enjoy this characterization of themselves.\n@fairsuggestion\nWomen get raped every day by people that they know wearing almost anything.  The last thing a victim needs to hear is that they gave the rapist an incentive to rape them.  You have obviously never been raped, or else you wouldn’t utter something so ignorant and one sided.\nWhen you tweet this; make sure to cc @torontopolice\nWho here suspects that Fair Game is indeed the police officer, further running his mouth??\nFirst to comment…? Sounds fishy.\nI’m not making accusations, just wondering.\nThe biggest problem with this situation is that the officer will likely not have to suffer the consequences of his actions (the parallels to victim-blaming are astounding). My guess is a brief suspension with pay at worst, though a light slap on the hand in the form of a forced public apology is the most likely outcome.\nWhile people recognize these kinds of comments as wrong, society doesn’t care about women enough (yet) to follow through on making examples of people who are in positions of authority, but who clearly shouldn’t be. By not taking this issue as seriously as it should, the police department is merely acknowledging public frustration with the officer in question rather than taking responsibility for the situation. True, you can’t control everything coming out of an employee’s mouth, but public servants have a responsibility to ensure that the people walking the streets are educated and sensitive to such damaging events.\nAs far as I’m concerned, the police representative’s PR spinning is just as bad as the cop’s comment. What are you investigating? He said it. People heard it. Time for justice. It’s almost as if they’re saying, “If women didn’t get raped so much, we wouldn’t have to be bothered with providing tips on how to stay safe. And then this issue would have never happened.”\nAre you kidding me?\nTo all of you on here who are blaming the victim for dressing too ‘slutty’ or ‘sexy’.  Has it occurred to all of you that this argument cheapens men as much as women by asserting that guys have absolutely no control over their instinct and that instinct will always trump our higher thought processes?  By the same logic, those who wear expensive clothes were just asking to get robbed because nobody can control themselves, right?\nDressing provocatively may not be an invitation to rape but it IS an invitation to be treated as an object. Please note that I haven’t specified a gender.\nIt makes me sad that one moronic police officer can say something like this and makes the whole force look like misogynistic assholes. As a victim of sexual assault who DID go to the police, they aren’t all like this and I would actually say most of them aren’t.\nI would like to know why this particular officer was chosen to speak on this issue when he has no understanding of it and is therefore clearly not qualified to do so. It isn’t as if there are no police officers in the city who have two brain cells to rub together, so what gives?\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nNicole Hanson\nContributor\nBlack enclaves – urban settlements with an inherent sense of both cultural and ethnic pride – are known for being separate from the societal social and economic mainstream. Little emphasis, however, has been set on their origins: a series of beginnings mainly built on race.\nEglinton West is also known as “Little Jamaica”. John Tavares\nBoth historically and presently, black enclaves have been a contested urban space. When we look at North American black enclaves – settlements such as Africville, Jane and Finch and Eglinton West – we are visibly engaging in spatial histories which may be unnoticed.\nThe births of these “ethnic enclaves” are imbued with strong, racial undertones that connect racial identities.\nLooking back, black enclaves, such as Nova Scotia’s Africville, Vancouver’s Hogan’s Alley and Ontario’s Wilberforce Colony, have been nationally understood as an embodiment of black pride and community. Yet their formation was involuntary, because slavery and racism enforced lines of demarcation, drawing out an urban space for blacks to live and hindering them from settling in desirable spaces.\nThe forced nature of these black enclaves embodied oppression, because whites owned most of the land, exerted power and domination, and dictated where blacks would fit within the urban landscape – but these communities were nevertheless successful in building black solidarity.\nRetrospectively, these spaces have fostered a sense of spatial emancipation and liberation from their white counterparts.\nNow black enclaves are becoming voluntary spaces; the dynamics within them are liberating, empowering and uplifting, and build a sense of residential solidarity through community building.\nJane and Finch, just south of York University, is a black enclave with a bad reputation. (John Tavares)\nEglinton West and Jane and Finch stand as examples of community-building urban space in Toronto, Ontario. Eglinton West is called “Little Jamaica,” and is characterized by retail Jamaican shops, authentic Jamaican cuisine, barbershops and salons.\nThe black identities that make up this space have allied together to strengthen themselves as an economic, communal whole; however, the arrangement of these urban settlements, especially that of Jane and Finch, have become associated with stereotypes, clearly polarizing the city’s social, economic, political and cultural makeup.\nThat’s why Jane and Finch area has been labelled the home of the impoverished, disadvantaged or, more clearly, the urban poor, over-generalizing every identity within that space because they reside within that enclave. The politics of representation co-exist with the urban politics of the space when it comes to black enclaves, thus perpetuating not only an urban identity crisis, but re-instilling structures of hyper-segregation, racial discrimination and urban apartheid.\nBlack enclaves, whether thought of as voluntary or involuntary, are still oppressive, because as more blacks concentrate in these enclaves, they further remove themselves from the mainstream. What this mechanism does is reinforce a lack of economic opportunity, which continues to pave the way for both residential, community and entrepreneurial poverty.\nThe people in a neighbourhood reinvest their income back into their community. In situations of blatant poverty, neighbourhoods do not have that reinvestment coming back to them, stopping them from building the fundamental institutions that cater to community building. For the most part, the little sense of economic development these neighbourhoods once had quickly ceased; poverty creates crime, leaving the economic value of these businesses threatened.\n(Illustrated by (Cola)nothy Humphrey.)\nBusinesses thus move out of these areas. High insurance means businesses are forced to increase the price of their products, but the high crime rates do not allow for longevity and economic profitability, thus reinforcing discrimination and segregation, leaving the black enclave socially and economically stigmatized to development and growth.\nEven though black enclaves are also seen as voluntary spaces, they continue to be the epitome of racial segregation and economic divide. They are notoriously characterized as unattractive spaces with a high rate of poverty. They are affiliated with joblessness, insurmountable teenage pregnancies, out-of-wedlock births (emphasizing discontinuity between black male and female relationships) and female-led families people assumed are welfare-dependent –\xa0 and all of this against the backdrop of high crime rates.\nWhether black enclaves are understood as involuntary or voluntary, these places have been sensationalized within the city. Black enclaves have become ghettoized, to the point where it’s almost taboo for blacks to live out in the suburbs. The ghettoization of these black enclaves perpetuates a sense of stagnation, affecting the identity of urban youth, both within the enclaves and outside of them.\nIntangible structures such as racism, racial segregation and discrimination lead to urban segregation, and create a politic of identity that intentionally captures and emphasizes difference and limits social and economic integration for those identities within black enclaves.\nThis robs people in these spaces of the ability to create identities for themselves; instead, they become neglected, subordinate and dependent on dominant groups. If we can utilize this historic transfer – black enclaves premised on a racialized connectedness – then we can create a holistic approach to community building, not only visibly to the mainstream, but also internally, within ourselves, the foundation for a nationalistic sense of independence.\nThere needs to be a holistic approach to reclaiming the identity of our communities and to embody that nationalistic spirit of residential solidarity, community building and economic independency.\nWhen we understand black enclaves were formed via a racialized connectedness, we can examine that shared history – a history of communities formed both involuntarily and voluntarily, premised not only in racism, discrimination and segregation but focused on community formation and restructuring.\nThis understanding will allow us to take better steps to form a nationalistic approach in rebuilding black solidarity within and outside black enclaves.\nNicole Hanson is the president of Apostolic Pentecostals of York University (APYU)\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nDespite a student-organized protest, the controversial documentary Iranium was successfully screened on campus Feb. 11.\nThe screening of Iranium, a film that explores the history of Iran as well as the idea of Iran as a nuclear state, was sponsored by a number of student groups on campus, and was monitored by 11 Toronto police officers.\nDavid Elmaleh – an executive member of Hasbara Fellowships at York, one of the groups sponsoring the event – said the screening was intended to draw attention to Iran’s reported ambitions to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons, which would threaten the entire globe.\n“A university […] is exactly the place that you should be discussing these issues,” said Maleh.\nThe screening, however, caused an uproar among many York students. A crowd of just under 100 protestors showed up with homemade signs and chanted “No more lies” and “No war, no Iranium.”\nArmed with slogans and homemade signs, students protested York’s screening of ‘Iranium.’ (Brendan Rowe)\nNoah Kadish, co-president of the Jewish Law Students Association at Osgood Hall, said the protest would not do much good.\n“It’s a little odd that one of the groups protesting is the Iranian Human Rights Society (IHRS) when the Iranian government is perpetrating human rights abuses against the Iranian people,” he said. “They should be hoping to also put the spotlight on these abuses.”\nBut Hanieh Bahmanpour, an executive member of IHRS at York who was at the event protesting the film, expressed her concerns over the screening.\n“We felt that [Iranium] portrays a lot of false information,” said Bahmanpour. She said all the film would do is spread propaganda.\nShe also pointed out the commentators in the film deliberately mistranslate the Farsi language to make the dialogue appear more violent and threatening.\n“It was not an issue about supporting the regime, but it was an issue about spreading false information and promoting war and propaganda on campus,” said Bahmanpour.\nDishy pointed out many Iranian students on campus were supportive of the screening.\n“There were a lot of random Iranians that came up [to the tabling for the event] and were very supportive of it,” he said, specifically referencing the “Iran Human Rights Activists Association of York University” listed as a sponsor on the group’s Facebook page.\nThe association is not an officially registered student club, and according to Bahmanpour is composed mainly of Iranian students. It was founded by Sara Akrami, a former IHRS member who left for undisclosed reasons.\n(Brandon Rowe)\nIHRS member Niloofar Golkar said his group was particularly offended Hasbra@York had hired 11 police officers for the event in response to the student protest.\nAdir Dishy, president of Hasbara@York, said his group never requested any police officers, and that the number of officers at the event was determined by York Security and Toronto police.\n“Regardless of what we want, that’s how many [officers] that have to be there,” he said, adding Hasbara@York is unable to afford 11 police officers. The group was charged for the cost of two officers, he clarified, since clubs that sponsor an event requiring security must bear partial security costs.\nRob Kilfoyle, director of security services, confirmed the police were paid duty officers and that Hasbara@York would be covering some of the costs.\nWhen it comes to protests, Kilfoyle said York Security Services dialogues with student groups.\n“We meet with student groups [to] let them know they’re free to express their ideas as long as it’s done safely and respectfully,” he said. “We encourage open dialogue.”\nUnfortunatly, the demonstrations distracted more than a few nearby students, some of whom were writing exams for a second-year software tools course.\nThough the professor stated he didn’t think the demonstrations overly disrupted the exam, some students claimed otherwise.\n“It affected us so badly,” said second-year computer science student Ahmad Aseeri. Wizda Nisar, a third-year in the same major, complained “we couldn’t focus.” Third-year fine arts student Prina Wong was particularly irked.\n“It was really annoying because I was trying to focus on the test,” she said. “I probably failed.”\nWith files from Devin P.

Viva has shuttled over 38,000 commuters down the route since then.\nThe $38-million, six-kilometre bus lane – paid for by the city of Toronto, the province and by Ottawa – was designed to shuttle TTC passengers more quickly to and from Keele campus and Downsview station until the 2015 subway extension launches.\nThe express route cut the usual 20-minute TTC bus ride by approximately four minutes. Though the Viva Orange bus shuttles between the same two destinations, it usually travels in regular traffic, so it takes longer.\n\nCompiled by News Department\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJacqueline Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\nPassing by the recently installed information desk in the middle of Vari Hall, York University students looking for the transitional RED Zone program may have noticed a sign redirecting them to an alternate location in the Ross building.\nThe university has confirmed that the info desk closes if the temperature drops below 18 degrees Celsius.\n“We have had extreme temperatures this winter, so we have had days where it’s gone below 18 degrees,” said York spokesperson Susan Webb.\nShe added that while the temperature issue was considered while Vari Hall was being renovated, the university believed the heat barriers in place could maintain the temperature necessary to keep the desk open.\nWebb, however, said the concern is not necessarily over safety, but rather over the possibility of the temperature going below the university threshold.\nNevertheless, she indicated the university is aware the current barriers in Vari Hall do not adequately retain heat.\n“Now that [the administration] has discovered that we could have extreme temperatures below the 18-degree threshold set by the university, [the administration] will be taking additional steps to remediate that,” said Webb, noting installing door sweeps is one of the measures being considered to better insulate Vari Hall.\nKrisna Saravanamuttu, York student union president, said the information desk should be opened up to student organizations on campus that may want to use that space during the winter period.\n“It seems to me that the information desk is becoming a huge waste of resources, especially during the winter months, especially if the university has no intention of using it,” said Saravanamuttu, noting members of the Student Community & Leadership Development (SCLD) are primarily using the desk.\nSaravanamuttu also maintained the renovations to Vari Hall were intended first and foremost to quell protests.\n“I’m of the opinion that the university’s utmost desire to clamp down on protests in Vari Hall may have trumped any other logistical, financial or administrative concerns that they should have thought about,” said Saravanamuttu.\nWhile Webb insisted the renovations to Vari Hall were simply to promote student space and not to stop protesting, Saravanamuttu referenced vice-president students Robert Tiffin’s comment in an issue of Excalibur which stated the renovations were to ensure protests did not take place in the area.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2011/02/16/from-africville-to-eglinton-west/'],"['I happen to agree with him. You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. And why should you blame the officer? It’s your society which turns women into chattel by making a half naked woman sell a pepsi or sprite bottle. That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. Also, girls today dress like sluts so the whole lot of them take offense when someone tells it how it is. Kudos to you Officer.\nOf course the men are responsible who perpetrate this, but seriously, when they chose their victim I’m sure that they searched for someone who was eyecandy to them. They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.\nYou’re just as bad as him. You’re basically insinuating that ‘hindu or sikh or muslim’ women don’t experience sexual assault. You’re saying that men only want eye candy. You’re the one reducing women to their appearance anyway. What about mentally challenged women who are assaulted? Young girls?  You’re blaming women for men’s crimes. You are furthering ideas that men have uncontrollable urges and act on impulse rather than the fact that they have internatilized misogyny and feel the need to exert control over women due to their own insecurities about masculinity.\nI happen to know a lot of decent men who don’t believe that the way a woman is dressed gives you permission to do what you please with her. I also know of a lot of men who think they have that permission, regardless of the situation or your dress.\nEducate yourself. Stop being so ignorant. Your victim-blaming rhetoric is not needed here.\nVery well said.\nIt’s not that the victim is being blamed. You can’t change those around you so you should do everything you can to keep yourself save. I agree that people who are covered up also get raped but you try to optimize your security as much as you can… One way is to dress less provocative and make sure you are always around someone you trust when you are at a party and prevent being in unsafe areas. I think the officer used inappropriate words to say what i think he was trying to say or he could just be a really sick person who believes that it’s ok for men to do it if women dress the way they want to.\nI agree, if you leave your car keys in plain sight in your car it is more likely to be stolen. This logic can be transferred to the topic at hand  The officer simply made a suggestion without sugar-coating it and he got his point across.\ni dont think its about “blaming victims”. it’s about common sense. i think that’s what the officer’s intent was with his comment, though obviously it skirted sensitive territory.\nObviously, as a society we want to ensure all citizens are safe and that we all adhere to the social compact. but that’s not how the world works in reality. While it’d be wonderful to leave precious possessions laying about in plain view unattended, the expectation that we should be able to do this without having them stolen is delusional. That’s why we lock our doors.\nWomen should also realize that the officer’s intent here was to protect them, not to blame them. Like many fathers, brothers, boyfriends and husbands, men worry a great deal about the safety of the women and girls in their lives. And we know that in a society as hyper-sexualized as ours, that avoiding unwanted attentions often times means applying a conservative approach to how we present ourselves.\nSadly the rhetoric and anger surrounding this discussion does a disservice to the police and to the law abiding citizens. I think it’s a shame generally that we can’t seem to appreciate the nuances of coping with the dangers in life.\nOh, the old comparison to the common sense of locking our door because things get stolen. There are so many things wrong with this analogy.\nFirst, while leaving your doors unlocked makes it easier for someone to rob your house, dressing sexily does nothing to make it easier for someone to rape you. A woman in a long skirt is just as easy to force sex on than a woman in a short skirt, as is a woman in baggy jeans vs hot pants, as is a woman in a t-shirt vs a low-cut top. The clothes I wear do not make myself more or less able to defend against an assault, nor do they prevent me from taking other, more realistic safety precautions such as not being alone while out at night.\nSecond, all this rhetoric goes on the baseless assumption that the more attractively a woman dresses, the more likely it is a rapist will target her. This is simply not true. Rape is about power and is most often done when it is convenient, as most victims are raped by people they know or who already have some sort of power over them.\nThird, everyone seems to be forgetting that sometimes women dress provocatively because the DO want to attract attention – of the consentual kind. Blaming the woman for wanting to look attractive is like blaming a store owner for having such nice and expensive things in his store, after the store is subject to an armed robbery. Clearly the owner should cover up and hide all the nice things so no one wants to steal them.\nI completely agree. The part about clothes reminded me of the Italian judge who ruled in favor of the (alleged) rapist on the basis that women wearing jeans are physically impossible to rape.\nPeople seem to like telling women not to dress in sexy clothes, not to get drunk. Wish they’d turn that righteousness to telling men not to rape people.\nAre you suggesting that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women never get raped? Sadly they do. And many of them face ridiculous cultural laws in which the rape must have been witnessed by several MEN who are willing to testify on their behalf or they can’t even report it! Also, a shocking number of seniors are raped every year. So the statement that women dressed “respectably” or women that are not considered “attractive” do not fall victim to sex crimes is seriously seriously flawed.\nA while a woman who dresses up to go to a club may very well be there to pick up (just like the guys are) she still has the absolute right to decide who picks her up.\nI’ve never heard or read of Sikhs or Hindus having a law where male witnesses must have witnessed the rape to testify on behalf of the victim.\nFYI I am a Sikh and have lived for years at a time in Canada, India and the UK.\nActually in most western countries convicting a man of rape is difficult-this is reflected in the conviction rate for rape cases (Google it). So to suggest Sikh, Hindu and Muslim rape laws are so woefully inadequate compared to Canadian ones is unfair.\nAnd a women has the right, but how would she enforce it? This is an issue of ideals versus reality and the reality is men are physically stronger than women.\nRegardless of if you take self defense classes-9 times out of ten an average grown man could rape a women if he was so inclined.\nIts always smarter to avoid attracting unwanted attention anyway.\nI’m not saying women don’t have the right to dress how they wish or to dress attractively because after all most men enjoy seeing a beautiful women. But women should exercise common sense too!\nI think women need to realize that although the sexes are equal, that does not mean we are the same.\nYou’re basically saying that you do agree that women shouldn’t dress provocatively.\nCome on no one respects a women who picks random guys up at clubs or anywhere else.\nI don’t understand why some women don’t respect themselves more. Is it because your trying to emulate some men? Or is that just an excuse-I hear it sometimes ‘men sleep around and they are considered studs so why are women called sluts when they do the same?’ Well thats just a highly reductive and generalized statement that just comes as extremely stupid and not what most sensible people would expect from a university educated women!\nBecause believe me we are not all promiscuous.\nThis reflects a bigger problem with our generation we don’t value ourselves enough. Society is way too hyper sexualized (as someone else commented).\nAnyway students should spend more time studying and less time messing around at clubs and dressing sexy. Where are your priorities?\nFYI-\nPlease don’t make baseless ignorant generalizations. I am a self-identifying slut, and plenty of people respect me completely. Because many people are not sex-negative fuckwads.\nI like to have sex with people I like. It’s enjoyable, fun, good exercise, and generally makes my life more awesome. I am safe, use multiple birth control methods, and get tested regularly. How, exactly am I not respecting myself? I am doing what I choose when I choose with people I choose. I empower myself in my own sexuality rather than letting any societal construct dictate my actions.\nHowever, the most important thing here is that I CONSENT. No matter what the context, no matter what I’m wearing, who I’m with, where I am, I expect everyone to establish consent before having sex with me. I might be dressed sexily because I’m looking for sex, or not, but the way I dress NEVER implies that just anyone can have sex with me without consent. Nor does the way I dress render anyone incapable of making decisions for themselves about whether to rape me.\nYou are right about one thing and that is our society is hyper-sexualized, but only in that it glorifies sex WITHOUT putting the equal necessary effort into promoting consent work and sex-positivity. We make sex tantalizing without making it empowering. But we need to empower ourselves in our sexuality, not by slut-shaming, but by encouraging everyone to make intelligent, informed, consentual decisions about sex.\nAlso, in all my sluttitude, I got all A’s and B’s all four years at university. Explain to me what those exactly have to do with each other?\nHow dare you suggest that a woman leading a sexual life on her terms doesn’t respect herself.\n“a women”\nwhat\n“a university educated women”\nwhat\n“is way too hyper sexualized”\nredundant phrasing\nQuit school; Marry soon; Let party girls party. You give yourself too much credit and respect, and others too little.\nThank you for replying and yes very well said!  It’s sad that there is still such ignorance like that out there…\n…and oh it is Brittaney i agree with if that was unclear.\nSexual assault has nothing to do withthe way the victim is dressed but the sickness of the rapists mind! 80 year old women and little girls get assaulted too! dont make excuses for these sick bastards!\nThe problem is that this is being made into a women’s rights issue when it is broader than that.  For example, I should be able to walk through Regent Park at 3 AM carrying a clear briefcase filled with cash, but I wouldn’t because it would greatly increase the odds of attracting trouble.  This is an exaggerated example, but the point is valid.  Women should be able to dress as they please and go where they please, when they please, but there are people with no respect for the law or other people.  The common sense solution is to avoid drawing their attention.  It doesn’t make it right, but too many people are in here arguing that women should be able to dress as they please and not be sex objects, when no one actually disagrees with that.\nThe cop chose a poor word, and everyone has keyed in on that word, but his point is valid.  You should be able to dress as you please, but in an area where there is a history of sexual predation, you have to adapt and take precautions.  The vast majority of men who respect the law and the rights of women are not your issue here.\nYou are one of the biggest idiot douchebags I have ever read but I guess thats the downfall of the internet, you have to read the opinions of people who think they actually know something about a highly complex topic- that of gender, misogyny and politics. Get educated before you open your mouth. You seem to know nothing about which you are speaking of and you look like a fool. I HATE people like you.\nYou discredit your own argument as lacking intelligence by engaging in ad hominim attack. Your comment adds absolutely nothing to the conversation.\nI agree with and am delighted at your rage and indignation — but I have to interject at “downfall of the internet.” Such a phrase suggests that the internet was ever “up” to begin with; i.e. that it was ever used as an outlet for anything more than toxic opinions amplified by anonymity, moronic acronym-and-emoticon-based “conversation,” and porn. Sorry for interrupting, thanks for listening.\nWow. Way to go buddy. Misogyny and racism at it’s best/worst, right there. Do you really think that rapists care what a woman is wearing? Women who are dressed conservatively get raped, too. The only thing a woman can do to avoid being raped is to not get raped. Seriously, next time, educate yourself before you decide to put your two cents in.\nI was raped while wearing an ankle-length dress with a high neck and long sleeves.  I had NOTHING showing.  The only person responsible for rape is the RAPIST.  PERIOD.  Rape is not about sexual attraction, it’s about power and hatred of women.  Educate yourself before you open your mouth.\nBullying and murder are about power and control, rape is about satiating one’s lust for sex. Power and control over the victim just happens to be the method used to satiate said lust. Have you ever heard of a rapist raping someone he couldn’t overpower? That NEVER happens.\nYou don’t have to dress provocatively to be raped, but rape is one of only three ways to satiate sexual lust. The remaining two methods are consensual sex, and masturbation. If you can think of a fourth method, please, let me know so that I will know too.\nJoe, please tell me you’re being sarcastic.\nHow is it that you profess to know so much about the underlying causes of rape? Should I assume that you’ve being researching rape statistics and studying the psychology of rapists for the last 20 years?\nOr have you raped before? Did you commit such a horrible crime just so you could get off? Because to be honest, I don’t know a single man or woman who would rape someone, who would put another human being through the terrible hell of sexual assault and rape, just so they could get laid.\nAnd to anyone on this post who DARES to suggest that women are raped because of what they’re wearing, how they’re acting, if they’re flirting or not, or if they’re “asking for it,” then how do you explain that 1 in every 3 women in the US army is raped?\nFor more information: http://www.stopmilitaryrape.org/\nhttp://newsjunkiepost.com/2010/01/26/13rd-of-women-in-us-military-raped/\nMy apologies. I tried to find Canadian statistics, but to no avail. Instead, I have an anecdote. A friend of mine just came back from doing a tour in Afghanistan (she’s Canadian Forces). One day, her commanding officers had a meeting with all the females in camp. They gave the women a little whistle, and told the women that if they were ever attacked by a man, to blow the whistle for help. A f&%ing whistle? Really? Canadian Forces can’t do better and maybe find ways to deter potential perpetrators?\nBut you don’t need a Phd to figure the reasoning behind a statement such as ‘dressing a little less provocative’.\nYou are a women and as such you will never understand how men think irrespective of how much education you have-its experience versus sitting in an ivory tower. Some men are nice as pie, where as some may appear nice on the outside and yet be very evil minded on the inside (e.g. Ted Bundy).\nIn war a lot of the rules in civilian peace time society are thrown out-this happens regardless of the Geneva Convention and is a sad reality.\nI think we seriously need to bring women down to earth-you are not the same as men (yes, you are of course equal I’m not disputing that!). Men can be brutal towards one another-how the hell do you think you will stand up to that? (Unless you are some sort of Martial Arts expert).\nThe fact that someone would call this “Fair Game” is sickening.\nA woman has the right to dress however she chooses. Whether she chooses to show skin, or cover herself should not affect the fact that any sexual assault is fully the responsibility of the perpetrator.\nIt seems to be a typical defense response to call a woman a whore or to imply that she was “asking for it”.\nThis post says that “of course the men are responsible”, yet it is said that by choosing unrevealing clothing then a woman is less likely to be assaulted, putting responsibility in the hands of the victim.\nI guess I’d better start wearing a parka at all times so that no men will see my body and be driven into a sexual frenzy… don’t want to get myself attacked or anything…\nIt’s a shame that people still hold these misogynist ideas in Canada in 2011, you’d think we’d be past this.\nWhat a disgusting and misogynistic human being you are. It is people like you and comments like the one you’ve made that have created and sustained a patriarchal rape culture. As a Muslim woman who is a survivor of rape, I can tell you that having your body covered has NOTHING to do with why sexual violence occurs. Sexual violence is about POWER AND CONTROL, not the clothes you wear, and not about being “eye candy”. The comments that you and the police officer have ignorantly made do nothing except re-victimize and re-traumatize victims of sexual violence, and do NOTHING to put blame or punishment upon the individuals who perpetrate such monstrous crimes. Please get yourself a REAL EDUCATION while you are at York, and never make such hateful, disgusting, shameful comments about women who have survived sexual violence again. I am disgusted to go to school with a human being as deplorable as you. May you NEVER have to feel like a survivor of sexual violence and be blamed for the lifelong trauma and horror you experience.\nAnecdote is not an appropriate means to determine if fully covered women experience less sexual assault than sluts.\nIt does prove one instance of its occurrence on a fully covered woman, however, which is more than some are willing to admit is a possible situation. In addition, you have proffered no valid research demonstrating the contrary, instead hoping that your simplistic refutation of an assertion will lead others to believe that its opposite is true.\nFair Game, you are completely right. In the history of the world, a hindu/sikh/muslim woman has NEVER EVER been raped. Women, if you don’t want to get raped, stop being “eyecandy” to men. You should always think of possible rapists while getting dressed and going outside. In fact, why do women even bother going outside? Sure, you could dress conservatively to ward off rapist, but you might accidentally smile seductively or brush your hand against your breast- things that will lure the rapist and force him to rape you.\nI’m actually confused why a woman is Assistant Dean of the JD program. Are they even allowed to vote??\nMarry me…\nA women has a right to wear whatever she wants without fearing sexual assault. Are you actually suggesting that before leaving her house a women is supposed to consider if she looks like an “eye candy” to some sociopath or a pervert with no self restraint? You should be deeply ashamed of yourself, especially for putting the word “freedoms” together with the garbage you wrote.\nSo by your reasoning their are no rape victims in muslim countries that force women to cover themselves from head to toe.  What planet are you from, because you surely aren’t  from this one.\nWhat?! What’s like saying that children who have suffered from sexual assault deserve it.  Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts, and telling girls not to as a step of sexual assault is bound to make victims uncomfortable.  Victim =/= enabler in most cases like this.\nIf your mom was sexually assaulted, do you think you would say “well, were you dressed like a slut, mom?” Or do you think it’d maybe be best just to assign the blame where it belongs (hint: not with the victim) and be supportive.\n“Not all victims of sexual assault dress like sluts”\nyou suck just as much as the person you are replying to .\nIt is abominable that someone would ever have this opinion, as it is exactly this type of ignorance and misogyny that breeds the sense of entitlement which feeds behaviors such as sexual assault.  Rape is a war crime; not because a whole village, city, or country is filled with women who are ‘asking for it’ by dressing provocatively, but rather, because rape is about POWER.  Even more disgusting is the fact that you seem to think that women who dress in a way that covers their bodies don’t get raped. Rape is one of the many things a man can use to wield his physical power over a woman (and a man or a child, by the way), so in case you missed the last fifty years, women are people now too. Idiot.\nits not just females that can be raped.  I was raped as far as the topic im sorry i have to agree with something 9 times out of 10 it is the women that dress provocative that males rape.  It does make me sick to my stumach that this happens though.  i do have a heart.  I know 3 females that have been raped and one mail that was raped and thats me.\nAnd you didn’t deserve it, even though you’re an asshole. Were you dressed like a slut? That doesn’t make it your fault.\nAmen sister or brother!  Thank you “Winter”!\nI just want to add that thinking the way “Fair Game” does is still universal amongst many societies.  I was teaching English in Japan in 2001.  We threw a party for one of my roommates. That night a foreigner attending the party slipped me the date rape drug.  Even though, I’m pretty sure that I wasn’t actually rapped per se he did have his way with me.  I remember bits and pieces.  He by the way was a fellow English teacher and not a Japanese citizen.  I did end up reporting the crime at the hospital and little did I know, police then become automatically involved.  The reason I bring this up is that amongst all the stuff I was going through at the time, the police while investigated made me find the clothes that I was wearing at the party that night.  At the time, and for a moment the act of photographing my clothes made me feel like I had asked for it.  Now of course I know better.  Making women feel like it is their fault due to their dress really does re-victimize the victim.\nActually, the statistics show that a woman’s appearance and pattern of dress have absolutely NOTHING to do with her risk of being sexually assaulted by a male.  Muslim women DO get sexually assaulted. Older women DO get sexually assaulted.  Little girls DO get sexually assaulted.  Moreover, the majority of male-perpetrated sexual assaults against women take place in the HOME.  I can wear baggy sweat pants on the street AND in the home, and statistically, it will do absolutely nothing to ‘protect’ me.  Perpetrators are responsible for choosing violence.  Believing otherwise is sexist ignorance.\nSo Fair Game:\nLet me get this straight… what you’re saying is that:\na. Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women (which by the way, all of whom apparently dress “traditionally”) do not get raped because they are covered up.\nb. Only hot girls get raped. No one else gets sexually assaulted.\nI would normally suggest that someone as ignorant as you pick up a book or a newspaper, but I’m not sure that even that could save you. I would site some statistics about the sadly high number of women that get raped in all different countries of all different religions and demographics, or even explain to you that a woman has the right to dress how she wants without being sexually assaulted, no matter how provocative it is, or even question what a slippery slope your argument is– next you’ll be saying that if a woman has a drink or two, she’s also “asking” to be raped. But it’s not worth my breath. If you truly believe a woman who shows some skin is apparently “fair game” for sexual assault, as you put so repulsively in your pathetic attempt to be clever, you are ignorant beyond repair. Making excuses for those who would sexually assault innocent women, no matter how they are dressed, is lower than low.\nAs if infants, the elderly, and women in proper hijab aren’t raped every day.\nNice work, Mr. Troll.\nYou’re a pig. Sexual assault should never be the storm cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim, especially a woman, looks like.\nThat’s not true. You can be wearing jeans and t-shirt with nothing revealing and you could still be a victim. If the community start thinking that victims are usually “sluts” as you put… the victim (who is already going through hell for what has happened to her) will start thinking that she is disgusting and blame herself for what happened.\nThere are people out there that think the victim was probably dressed “slutty” and got what they deserve. It’s those kind of thinking that make victims try to hide what happened because THEY will be viewed as “disgusting” by the community and NOT the perpetrator.\nPlease understand that it is NOT the victim’s fault. No matter how they are dressed. Why should the victim get condemned by the society for being a victim? Is it their fault? They dressed to impress not to imply that they want to be sexually harassed.\nTruly an idiotic comment. There is absolutely no excuse for rape and what a woman is wearing is nobody elses business. Muslim and Sikh women are raped regardless of dress. It’s not a question of clothing but of mens attitudes, such as the one you voiced. Is there a set of conditions that makes it justifiable to violate a persons physical autonomy? The comment has a very wide range of implications and all of them are negative towards women and victims of crime. There is always an excuse by the perpetrators to try to justify their actions.\nI think If you were to dress less like a ‘slut’  you might actually decrease your chances at getting raped. How hard is that for you feminazis to understand?\nSee my response to Fair Game.  It applies to you as well.\n@Feminism stinks, Sometimes, people have a hard time understanding things that don’t make sense. Let me educate you:\nUtah State University Sexual Assault and Anti Violence Information:\nMyth: Rape victims provoke the attach by wearing provocative clothing.\nA Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only\n4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior on the part\nof the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple\nas a glance).\nMost convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.\nVictims range in age from days old to those in their nineties,\nhardly provocative dressers.\nUtah State University\nhttp://www.usu.edu/saavi/pdf/myths_facts.pdf\nI fail to see how not wanting to blame victims for the actions of the perpetrator of a crime, when statistics don’t suggest that “not dressing like a slut” helps, makes one a “feminazi.”\nI’m pretty sure my niece could never force someone to assault her, so I guess I must be a feminazi.\nI read in the news about elderly women who got repeatedly sexually assaulted by the same perpetrator who would break into the home in the middle of the night.\nYea, shame on those sexy grannies who are seducing men into committing rape!\n@Feminismstinks: please do the world a favor and REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS PLANET IN THE FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY!  may I recommend walking off a bridge?\nFirstly, women are raped regardless of what they’re wearing.  Secondly, stop placing blame onto women.  No one WANTS to get raped.  Wearing a certain outfit is not an invitation to rape me.  Fuck off.\ni agree that it would help however is not a solution and proper security would go a lot farther then longer hem lines.\nare you ill ? who doesn’t know that rape has nothing to do with sex, it’s about power and humiliation. are you saying that women who don’t dress like “sluts” never get raped ? or women that people may not deem “attractive” ? did you know that 45% of rape victims were assaulted by their partners, compaired to only 8% who were assaulted by strangers ? this makes it hard for me to think that women are raped because of the way they dress.\nyou said yourself that images of half naked women are used to sell products and this is half the problem. society objectifies women into nothing more than sex objects WHEREEVER YOU LOOK. and opinions like this do not make it any better.\no_0\nAnd what exactly does “getting treated like a slut” mean to you? Getting raped? Sorry to point out the obvious, but even sluts aren’t out to get raped, they are out to have consensual sex. A man is not some kind of wild animal species that can’t control its urges when it sees a short skirt. Also, rape is usually not about “eye candy” but about asserting power over the victim. And victims are often not “slutty”-looking girls, they can be anyone from your daughter to your grandmother. Your comment is ridiculously asinine and ignorant. Hope nobody you care about ever gets attacked.\nYou do know that women in traditional clothing get raped all the time, right? The more “traditional” a society, the higher its incident of rape (including marital rape), and IN ADDITION to the higher incidents of rape these women are actively discouraged from seeking justice. You have a serious problem. How about teaching men NOT to RAPE. Dick.\nIn the immortal words of Antoine Dodson, “You are so dumb.  You are really dumb.  For real.”\nOther commenters have eloquently covered all the reasons why you are so dumb.  That is all.\nOh I love that song!!!\nand it certainly applies to all rapists and rapist supporters!\nOh, of course you are right.\nAnd, if you are robbed, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought stuff that someone might want.  If you are carjacked, it is your fault because you shouldn’t have bought a car.   If any other crime happens to you, it must be your fault for having something the criminal might want.\nThis all makes perfect sense.\nWell Fair Game is completely right. I mean Hindu, Sikh or Muslim women are never raped. Western women only started showing more skin around the 1920’s and that’s right about the time that women started being raped. Coincidence? I think not. Thinking back to when I was raped at 17, I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved sweater. Must of been asking for it right? If only I’d had a burka on to clearly indicate that I wasn’t interested in being held down and raped.  I never told anyone about it because I felt like it was somehow my fault. I felt ashamed. I shouldn’t of let myself be in that situation. The comments made by Fair Game and the officer are the reason so many women never come forward when sexually assaulted.  That officer should be fired. Fair Game, if you have any females close to you, try talking to them, chances are one of them has been sexually assaulted.  Ask your mother, your sister or friend if they were asking for it when it happened to them. Or then again, maybe you don’t have many females in your life that you’re close to. Wouldn’t that be a shock.\nYou’re an idiot. Men walk around showing skin all the time, no shirts, for example. What is a “slut”? Aren’t men the definition of the word? Also, you may want to look up rape victims–they are the elderly, they are the two year olds, they are the nine-year-old male, they are in prison. Get an education.\nYou do realize that Middle Eastern women who wear veils, abayas and burqas are also victims of rape? In fact, victims of rape in Middle Eastern countries are subject to public lashings and honor killings because they “shamed” their family by being the victim of a crime.\nRape isn’t about sex, it’s about controlling and humiliating another person. Men can be raped too, so can children and elderly women. What would you attribute that to? Slutty looking 5 year olds? Please.\nI feel sorry for anyone you know personally that is a survivor, because clearly you have no idea about the true psychological motivations of rape.\n@Fair Game, Rapists will rape people regardless of what they are wearing. No one asks or deserves to be raped. The only people responsible for rape are rapists and rape apologists like you.\nconsidering the fact that the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows (relative, friend, date etc.) I’m certain that when “they” chose their victim, it likely was not at random and probably had nothing to do with how she was dressed.\nin fact, dressing in a manner that exudes (and requires) confidence would probably deter a man from assaulting them.\nnothing a woman says, wears or does warrants being sexually assaulted.  it is a act of power and control that is perpetrated by someone who has neither.  it is a demeaning and shattering experience that no one asks for. and if you think for one moment, Fair Game, that Sikh, Muslim or Hindu women do not experience this kind of torture, you need to put down your excalibur and pick up a G and M.\nwow. check your privilege, asshole.\nhttp://sap.mit.edu/content/pdf/male_privilege.pdf\nthe definition of “slut” is so loose that it can apply to a woman who has had multiple sex partners, and to a 14 year old girl in a short skirt.\nwhat the crappy thing is, women are judged on EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR PERSONALITIES. a woman is not a slut for enjoying sex or wearing revealing clothing that is not always worn to attract others, but to make the woman feel good.\nrape and sexual assault are ALWAYS initiated by the presence of a rapist. the woman (and sometimes men are raped too! think about that!) is NEVER asking for unwanted sexual advances.\nyou sir, can fuck off.\nEven though I didn’t have sex (of any kind) until I was 19, I was labeled a slut in middle school just for having large breasts, which were always covered by baggy t-shirts.\nI totally agree with you on this one, girls who want to dress in a certain “sluttish”  way, they have to pay for the consequences. 5/5!\n“The way a woman dresses or acts does not cause or prevent sexual assault; an attacker rapes someone because they want to exert power and control over him or her. The attacker is solely responsible for the crime. However, this responsibility is lost in translation through the police, the courts and the media.”\nfrom: Don’t Rape (http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/3497)\nCurl up and die please. You’ll do everyone a favour.\nSince when is the onus on women to make men behave like gentlemen? If you can’t keep your pants zipped, YOU have the problem, not the victims!!\nRape is more often than not, an act of dominance.  Sociopathic individuals will commit rape to assert dominance and inflict harm on an individual because that aspect is sexually arousing to them; they do not usually rape someone based on how that person is dressed.  On the contrary, rapists generally look for someone who has low self-esteem (no confident, sexy outfit?) and may not put up much of a fight.\nYeah only the issue is the disgusting and unacceptable crime of the perpetrator, not their sexual preference. Implying that a woman is somehow deserving of sexual assault because of what she wears implies that the crime AGAINST LAW of sexually assaulting someone can be justified. Any grown man that is rational and worth a trial can presumably control his sexual inclinations around a girl in revealing clothing.\nFair Game is a troll.\nTo call yourself “Fair Game” is hypocritical and disgusting.  I am appalled by your comments.  Clearly, what you said is a reflection of what and how much you know about our society.  First of all, sexual violence has NOTHING to do with sex.  It is about POWER, HATRED AND VIOLENCE against another human being.  Second of all, to say “wouldn’t choose a Hindu, Sikh or a Muslim because they are covered in traditional clothing” is an absolute horrible thing to say.  Fair Game, go educate yourself about violence and please keep your comments about our society problems to yourself.  Clearly you have a long way to go in increasing your knowledge about something as serious as this.\nTo call yourself “Fair Game” is hypocritical and disgusting.  I am appalled by your comments.

Clearly you have a long way to go in increasing your knowledge about something as serious as this.\nIt’s sad to know that there are people out there that concludes that women who dresses provocatively are “asking” for this type of crime to happen to them.  One does not have to dress like a “slut” in order to be raped.  The responsibility lies in the fact that our society needs to educate people of all cultures about violence.  It is disappointing that a police officer, someone whom you think that will serve and protect you and your city would lower himself to a comment like that.\nStupid troglodyte!\nSome years ago I was raped by a man I considered to be one of my closest friends, in my own home, while clad in a decidedly unsexy sweatsuit and bunny slippers. The only thing making me attractive to the bastard was my gender, my trust and my availability.\nhey so if I think you’re dressed like a douchebag I should get to beat you up, right? After all, it’s YOUR fault for asking for it! You’ve got the face and clothing of a douche just begging to get beat up!\nfirst of all, you’re disgusting. Secondly if you dress in a way that I decide is “slutty” I suppose you’d be okay with it if I violently destroyed you too. I dress how I want to because it makes me happy, I shouldnt have to hide myself because people like you can’t control yourself. I hope you never have to experience the horrors of rape but if you do maybe you’d finally shut the hell up\nHey, little boys get raped by priests. INFANTS get raped by sick men.  Hell, animals get raped by sickos. I guess they ALL asked for it.\nHow dare that cute baby wear nothing but a diaper?  I guess it’s rape time!\nDON’T APOLOGIZE FOR RAPISTS! the only one at fault is the rapist!!!\nYou’re a troll.  Wise up, people.\nyour comment made me so angry!\nso i guess that its your fault if i (fill in the blanks) you!\nyou have some serious problems…\nYou’re absolutely right. Because no woman wearing a burqa has ever been sexually assaulted.\nFair Game: I know I shouldn’t feed the trolls here (read: you) but I’m going to anyway because I have nothing better to do.\nA) What does it mean to “dress like a slut?”  Is it the showing of skin that makes you think she must have too much sex (which is what I assume you mean by “slut,” a woman who has more sex than you deem appropriate)?  Or is it the too-much-sex issue itself?\nB) Calling a woman a slut is silly, because what constitutes a slut varies depending on the perspective of the person doing the slut-shaming, but worse than silly, it’s a means of silencing the legitimate concerns of women.  Women are called sluts for what they wear (even if they’re virgins,) they’re called sluts if they have monogamous sex with one partner (if they’re the wrong person,) they’re called sluts if they have the audacity to have had multiple partners BY CHOICE.  None of these things make it ok for that person to be raped.  Women aren’t “asking” to be raped if they dress in revealing clothing.\nC)Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women, along with women of every ethnicity and religion around the world are raped daily, regardless of what they wear.  One reason this is allowed to continue is because of the prevailing views that rape is the fault of the victim and not of the rapist.  When a woman gets raped, every sexual experience she’s ever had, her clothing, whether or not she chose to imbibe that evening, and whether or not she chose to go somewhere alone, are all dragged up and used against her.  None of these things have any bearing on her rape- whoever she chose to have sex with in the past has no bearing on this rapist.  As a matter of fact, whether she’s had consensual sex with the rapist in the past has no bearing- anybody has a right at any time, regardless of sexual history, to not give consent to engage in sexual activity, and the only one to blame for the ensuing rape is the rapist.\nYou’re right. about the last part. it’s the perpetrator who is at fault, not the woman. it’s not the woman’s fault the perpetrator is a raging sociopath.\nwhat an incredible double standard. society love women that dress like “sluts.” we see it everywhere, from movies to commercials to ads, all to appeal to the male gaze. but it’s immediately jumped to as an excuse for rape.\nnot to mention, a very small percentage of rape is the “stranger in the bushes on the wrong side of town at night.” Most rapes happen in the victim’s or rapist’s home and they almost always know eachother.\nyou’re an idiot.\nAttitudes like this do nothing to dispel the problem. Women (and men and transgender folk) of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, levels of intelligence, and physicalities experience rape. Research has largely indicted that rapists are not necessarily attacking others due to an insatiable sex drive, but because it’s a way to exert control. Instead of victim-blaming, perhaps we should focus our energies into educating people to not become rapists. I, for one, feel that the officer’s suggestion only perpetuates the attitude that it’s up to the potential victims to avoid getting raped, rather than that it’s a person’s responsibility not to rape.\nIn no way is a woman responsible to dressing to deter rape. This is nothing but victim blaming and as  a social worker who worked with victims of sexual assualt I can assure you that the women who are assaulted are of all shapes/sizes and appearances. It has little to do with sex and more to do with power and control of another person.\nWomen get raped often in more nylon countries where the burkas or niquabs are mandatory so your assumption is inherently wrong.\nWhile I agree with your views about the current objectification of women in our society, I completely disagree that the way in which she dresses means that she is a justified target of sexual assault. I’m sorry, but no.\nA woman has the absolute, undeniable right to walk down the streets of Toronto completely naked without having someone assault them. A woman has the right to walk around dressed head-to-toe in full snow gear without being sexually assaulted.\nPoint is, no matter what a woman is wearing, now matter how much or how little she is wearing, she has a right to not be sexually assaulted.\nPerhaps she invites people to treat her with a certain attitude (ie. treat her like a slut) if she dresses in such a fashion, but in NO WAY is that an excuse for her to be violated. No way, no how.\nI was raped when I was asleep in my bed, where I SHOULD have had every reason to feel safe. Obviously you don’t know shit about this subject, women in every manner of clothing and every situation get raped. It doesn’t matter what you where you where you are, the rapist is the one who did wrong.\nActually there’s nothing to prove that. Most rapists know their victim. What she chooses to wear on any given night has nothing to do with the attack. In fact, some rapists will even target women who dress more conservatively. Women in burkas are raped all the time. As are women in long skirts, fatigues, jumpsuits, ballroom dresses, shorts, pajamas ratty bathrobes and curlers. Furthermore, the term “slutty” can mean different things. To some people it means nothing but boots and to others it means visible wrists. Telling a group of women that they can avoid rape by not dressing slutty even aside from the fact that it’s a huge insult doesn’t add anything constructive. There is nothing a woman can wear that wouldn’t be considered provocative by someone. Responsibility needs to be shouldered by those responsible. A victim of rape is not a slut. They are a victim.\nFair Game, I know rape is scary and not something you want to face, but it’s cowardly to blame the victim. And if a guy really can’t get any without raping or can’t control his impulses, then he probably is not mentally equipped to be having sex in the first place. That’s his problem. It’s not the victim’s fault and I think it’s a little weird that you would side with such a loser.\nSorry, Fair Game, sexual assault is not a crime of passion, but one of violence. Read the research; all types of women, including fully covered women and women in their 80’s are assaulted on a regular basis. Stop trying to blame the victim.\nI agree.  These canadian women are dressing too much vulgar.  In india, women are more traditional and we do not have such things.  but here i seeing many women dressing like sluts (not that i am wanting to complain).  at school, indian girls are dressed conservative and theyr not experience rape but other girls who dressing vulgar and showing body are teasing people.  police man said a good point in my opinion.\nCan you explain why old women in nursing homes have been raped by male nurses?\nOr why children are raped?\nI seriously doubt elderly women or children “dress like sluts”. And saying Hindu,Sikh and Muslim women wouldn’t be raped? Please explain why thousands Hindu and Muslim women who actually *report* being raped to authorities never receive any justice?\nI guess those ladies traditional clothing was just too….ah, traditional? And that is why they were raped?\nI guess I’m just too much of an ignorant woman to understand any of this.\nI am deeply disturbed by this line of thinking. By your point of view, I (a human being, as well as a woman) should be blamed for the choices and actions of others whom I have absolutely no control over, because of how much fabric is covering my body! Does this not seem outrageous to say the least? If you were to leave your house carrying a wallet and there is some indication that that wallet is presently on your body, does that give someone the right to steal it? If someone were to tell you that it’s not the pickpocket’s fault, because you enticed him by taking the wallet out of your pocket to pay for whatever it is you buy, would that be acceptable by your standards?\nThis makes me sick to my stomach. Men are not treated in this fashion, so what in this world that you seem to live in gives you the right to judge women like this?\nFYI: sexual assault is a crime of power, control and violence, not because the assailent is so turned on they have to sexually assault someone and people who observe religious conduct by covering themselves also are victims of sexual assault you are an ignorant person who has no idea what you’re talking about.\nI am always amazed how victim blaming can be so one sided… Would you ever blame a victim of a hold-up? What about of a car-jacking? A break and enter? Of course not, it is patently absurd; however, if police officers have the ignorance to blame rape survivors then they should also hold these other groups partially responsible in motivating their own attacks:\nPerhaps the man who is robbed for his rollex should be held accountable. He dared to ‘show-off the goods’ (ie: his material wealth) and so he should expect to be robbed… right?\nWhat about the old lady driving the $100 00.00+ luxury vehicle? She deserves to be car-jacked. How could she drive around in a car like that and expect not to be car-jacked?\nWhat about the nice couple who worked hard and bought their dream home? Should they be held accountable when they are victims of a home invasion or burglary?\nIf we take the same logic offered by this Toronto officer than it follows that he would recommend that all these other groups should avoid wearning expensive jewellery,driving nice cars, and owning nice homes in order to be less likely to be victims of robbery, car-jacking, and burglary. OF COURSE THIS IS ABSURD!!!! THESE EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE IGNORANCE AND MISOGYNY INHERENT IN BLAMING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. USE YOUR BRAINS PEOPLE…\nYou are completely wrong, most rape victims are introverted, slightly desperate looking, who are alone, rapists dont go for confident people, they are scavengers that look for easy prey like cowards… only really charismatic sexual predetors/cereal killers go for pretty/slutty confident girls but they have a certain something they are looking for….\nthose cereal killers will Trix you, Corn Pop you in the kneecap, rob you of your Life, and all the witnesses will be able to say is “I didn’t get a good look at his face, he just shot the guy and Bran.”\nI apologize to everyone who is nauseated by puns.\nI was going to say “I hope you never have daughters” but I’m almost more scared of what you’d teach your sons!\nRape is not a compliment, you fucking asshole.\nFair Game, show me the statistic that proves Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim women “in their traditional clothing” are raped less than other women.\nYou show a lack of understanding of sexual assault and society in general. You express racist and sexist idealogies. The majority of rapists do not even remember what their victim was wearing. Your comments are uneducated and offensive to both men and women. You imply that men cannot control their minds and bodies, you demean women young and old. Women should not have to fear violence and degredation. Think of your mother, sister or daughter – if she walked down the street naked and was raped could you tell her to her face that she ‘deserved’ sexual violence? The only people who can stop rape are rapists.  Nothing a human being wears, says or does justifies sexual assault.\nYou’re an idiot. By your logic if some pervert that’s into feet sees someone wearing open toed shoes he has the right to rape her? I don’t care if a woman is walking down the street naked, that doesn’t give anyone the right to sexually assault her. Just because *you* (or whoever) deems a woman a slut doesn’t make her so.\nHow DARE you, FairGame!\nI was drugged, and gang-raped by 6 men I trusted. I WASN’T drinking alcohol, I WASN’T at a club/party, and I WASN’T “dressed like a slut”.\nI was on a field trip, in front of a motel in the middle of the wilderness, at a bonfire. I was dressed in sweats and a sweatshirt. How does that scream: “Rape me! I’m slutty!” I’m not even that good looking, and I’m certainly not afraid to admit that! I’m not one of your Top Models, nor do I dress sexy.\nI was raped because I’m an independent woman and I don’t conform or allow myself to be peer-pressured or manipulated into doing things. They saw me as a challenge, but knew my character enough to know that I would fight them, tooth and nail, if they tried anything. Which is why they drugged me. Made it easier for them to violate me.\nYou’re a misogynistic pig! I bet you hate women–which must mean you like men. If you like men that much, leave us women the hell alone and go back to that rock you’re living under. Sure, you’ll have to look for a little while, because it’s back in the Dark Ages.\nWhile I agree that many women dress too provocatively, that has NOTHING to do with rape.  I was definitely NOT “eye candy” when I was raped; I am overweight and dress to hide it!  Some people are just sick, whether it is a man or a woman attempting the rape.\nHey fair game it is a womens god given right to dress how ever the fuck she pleases.  What kind of man are you that you don’t like to see women in provacative clothing?\nNot everything the police or the government feed you is right.  Go on thinking that you fucking drone.  OBEY, SLEEP, CONSUME, REPEAT.  Follow those orders and you’l be a model citizen\nDear Fair Game,\nWhat does it mean exactly to be ‘dressed like a slut’? Even if you were somehow able to come up with a clear cut definition, what gives you the right to determine it for the rest of society? Moreover, does getting ‘treated like a slut’ entail sexual assault – are you advocating that those who dress ‘like sluts’ ought to be sexually assaulted? This is absolutely unacceptable, and quite a dangerous comment; what’s next, telling women they shouldn’t wear high-heels because they will get sexually assaulted?\nFurthermore, as Canadians, we all share this society – no matter what religion, gender, and race you are from. Surely, in the 21st century, we have all come to realize the importance of the freedoms and civil liberties we enjoy; to shoot them down, and argue – in your case – for something that is completely a matter of personal taste is not only appalling, but quite barbaric. I certainly agree that our society has problems, and you are correct in pointing out how the media portrays women in advertisements, and how sex appeal is used to sell goods in the market – but that is an entirely separate issue, for which sexual assault victims should NOT be blamed – It simply has nothing to do with them.\nWhat could you possibly mean by ‘the evil terrorists’? Surely you are not implying that those who perpetrate sexual assault are terrorists; as wrong, and as guilty, as both activities are, they are simply not related. Please take care to understand the different terms, the motivations lying behind such activities, and the purposes for which they are conducted.\nIn addition, when an officer of the law – whose job it is to protect citizens, prevent crimes, and arrest criminals – is taking part in a safety information session, he is not representing his own person,  personal values, nor his personal moral outlook on society; he is representing the Toronto Police Department. As such, his flagrantly misogynistic, sexist, and simply revolting opinions should be kept to himself, until such time that he is no longer representing a public security organization, whose aim is to protect individuals, not punish the victim of crimes.\nLastly, if you took care to read, and study about such phenomena, you would understand that they dynamic that underlies sexual assault is not at all similar to what you have described. Please take care to become more informed, because your utter arrogance and ignorance can only assume the role of a burden for a fine society such as our own.\nrape is wrong. even if she dressed like a ‘slut’, a ‘slut’ is  NOT asking for rape, she is asking for consensual sex (and to be paid for it).\nIt seems as if sluts don’t believe in personal responsibility. These poor cops have to deal with sluts who refuse to grow up: http://goo.gl/ODyno\nLet’s address a few of your comments. Let’s pay attention to all victims not just the one’s you may secretly covet. Are you saying elderley woman are eye candy? Little boys are eye candy? In fact there is absolutely no correlation between rape/ molestation and what the victim is wearing! I have stats to back this up. Do you honestly belive Hindu, sikh & muslim women are not sexually abused?!! It’s just not reported because those women would be blamed & punished for it. In many middle eastern countries its legal for a man to rape his wife! Are you excusing a violent act & abuse of power? Is that not like saying his car deserved to be stolen because he drives a BMW? That house deserves to be broken into & robbed because they have a nice tv? Rape/molestation are NEVER the victims fault!! It doesn’t matter what they wear/drink, which family member/uncle/teacher the trust or where they walk/work! The criminal is crossing a line & violating someone else because they are selfish, immature, have no control, have no honor, have a corrupt religion etc. Perhaps what you’re saying is that if you’re to choose a victim you would go for eye candy? You threatened, frightened & are not able to handle sexy women as your equal so that would make perfect sense. (It’s often about control & power issues not about sex.) I may not agree with the use of women in advertising in N.America but I’m glad I am free to dress & express myself as I wish. My final thought: Sex should be enjoyable, sacred, spiritual, sensual, fun and CONSENTUAL for both partners. I hope for your partners sake that you at least come to accept that. Women have just as much right as men to find pleasure in their sexuality without fear or rape.\nrape is a war tactic, all who take part in it are therefore barbarians. people were raping before there was such a thing as “dressing like a slut”-and hindu, sikh, and muslim women get raped every day. is you support rape-and you do, according to what you’ve written (no bs one-line disclaimer at the end can hide that, just as no burqa can hide a woman from a rapist) than you are a moron, and anyone who is not blatantly against rape is FOR the metaphorical rape of his own people (rape historically was inflicted upon women with full knowledge that to destroy an entire group, one must destroy the women which are the core).\nRape is not about being turned on, nor is it about pepsi. It is about inflicting power upon another human being. It has nothing to do with outfits that turn people on-if it did, than cops would be raped all the time.\n“Fair Game”, I am a Hindu and grew up in Mumbai. I wore ‘decent’ Indian clothes – salwar kameezes, fully covered my arms, legs & the rest of my body – except my face. I was molested in public transport on a daily basis. Men would feel me up and stare & say lewd things.\nI am not the only one who faced this on a daily basis. Every girl I know who grew up in India and stepped out of her home was harassed.\nWill your next suggestion be to stay at home & avoid going out, if you’re a woman?\nYou’re an ignorant misogynist and a clueless privileged man who has never had to face the humiliation of being touched or treated inappropriately.\nHow about this phrase: “Men can avoid sexually assaulting women by not sexually assaulting women.”\n@Fair Game, “You can avoid acting like a misogynistic neanderthal by not acting like a misogynistic neanderthal”.\nLOL @ women getting sexually assaulted due to the way they dress. Nothing but ignorance and hate.\nYou’re right – women ask to be raped. WHAT AN IDIOT. It’s people like you who make it hard for victims to ever ask for help .\nSo why is it that men who walk around public parks bare chested, only shorts on aren’t asking to be “raped”?!\nWe are all human, In our country, in this day and age we still have a major double standard!!\nYeah, because women who dress in their traditional clothing never suffer violence from men, except for honour killings, and forced marriages to old men, and being executed in ‘traditional’ societies for being raped (because all they were was their cherry, so when you have garbage you might as well throw it away, right?) while their rapist(s) gets the lash. Of course no one commits incest where ‘traditional’ values rule. No one’s gay either. We’d know if anyone did or was because those societies are so frank and clear eyed about such things. Those societies are not founded on a retrograde and backward superstitious idiocy.\nand this is without getting into all the prepubescent girls who get raped, the old ladies who get assaulted, often in their own homes…\nno, its all about the sluts you miserable stupid arse.\nThere have been thousands of Muslim and Hindu women worldwide who have been raped.. covered or not. The amount of ignorance infused in your comment is the reason people give up on society. Do you really believe that only women showing skin get assaulted?\nIt’s people like you who have taught this officer and other impressionable public figures that it’s okay to generalize people like this. A whole lot of you seem to take offence when someone tells it how it is though, so I expect you to be pretty upset with me at the moment.\nTROLLLLLLLL!\nGet back under yer bridge where you belong!\nWell put… I also want to add that the officer isn’t implying that they deserve to be victims… Or that the perp shouldn’t be punished… He is simply stating that in order to avoid putting yourself in a situation of risk… Tone it down a little…. !  Much as a zookeeper might advise that you don’t strap a steak to your body and enter the lion cage!   Use your heads ladies….!\nSeveral women who were fully clothed have been brutally raped you fuck wit.\nRape is about control not women dressing in “slutty” outifts.\nWhat is your problem? women should be able to dress however they want?  They do not dress like sluts for men to rape them.\nAnd exactly, everyone dresses this way now, does that mean everyone deserves to be raped or assaulted?\nWhen making such ignorant comments think of your mother, sisters, nieces, grandmothers, etc.\nYou sir are a dumbass.  🙂\nAre you serious? I have dressed in very modest clothing all of my life. I thought not dressing provocatively and not going out at dark hours would leave me safe. Was I safe? NO!  I still ended up being sexually assaulted.\nI also completely agree with the cop. Matter of common sense, really.\nYou’re an idiot. My best friend was raped in her Marine Corps Mess uniform; she was covered in head to toe with her damned rank on her shoulder.\nYou owe every man on the planet an apology for being so insulting. Men are completely capable of controlling their sexuality. No real man needs to rape a woman because he thought her skirt was sexy. Sure women dress to attract mates ,as do men, it is not an invitation to take something that without consent. I’m sure you know that .\nHere again we see institutional feminism confronting society in an obnoxious, spoiled brat kind of way. I can hear the truckload of  DONTATE NOW buttons hitting the webistes  — This is such a ridiculous joke — I can’t wait for Harper to cut all funding to this nonsensical educational directive that is womens studies et. al. – a more divisive topic has never been adopted by our school systems and I’m terrified for any young man who has to live under the police state that these feminist architects have implemented. Stop giving court to these nutbags who wake up every morning determined to be offended…\nBut it is that the victim is being blamed. Men who say that are just trying to pass the blame onto the victim- ‘Oh you wore a miniskirt well it’s your own dang fault then’. It’s pathetic. Most girls who are raped don’t dress like sluts. Rape is entirely the fault of the rapist. I mean, do people want girls to walk around all day dressed like nuns and never go out at night? We shouldn’t need to do that. Men should be able to control themselves. Men aren’t accused of ‘dressing like sluts’ when they wear short shorts and walk around with no shirt.\nwomen of all shapes, sizes, colors, ages, and dress get sexually assaulted. men should learn to control their anger and learn to treat people with respect. the real problem is men who believe they have the right to take what ever they want from women when ever they want.\nyour comment is so incredibly misogynistic, unfounded and dangerous. it is so far from depicting the realities of sexual violence and works only to perpetuate the myth that some how survivors of sexual violence (female or male) are responsible for their perpetrator’s actions.\nsexual assault is defined by a lack of consent. period. no consent = sexual assault. no where in that legal definition is there any sort of wiggle room around dress, skirt length, traditional clothing, attitude or relative “sluttiness.”\nand i’m going to go ahead and call bullshit on your claim that women who wear traditional clothing are not targets of sexual violence. talk to the women who walk into my office daily to share their stories of intimate partner violence. or the men who experience violence in their own lives.\nalso – it is unfair for you to make broad sweeping generalizations about “girls today” and the “whole lot of them taking offence.”\nsorry if this comes off as curt, but you seem to be someone who appreciates people “telling it like it is.”\nFair Game, I happen to disagree with you. “You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? That’s beyond ridiculous.\nAnd what’s up with men choosing their “victim” based on how they dress? Do you really believe “hindu or sikh or muslim who was covered in their traditional clothing” don’t get sexually assaulted? It is evident from your illogical statements that you need some intense training on this topic.\n“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” – what does that even mean? are “sluts” supposed to be treated differently than other women? ”\ngreat comment. It really doesn’t mean anything, just a thoughtless comment from somebody who doesn’t even think about what the implications of his words are. I know of women who were sexually harassed who were very conservatively dressed. As well, for some Muslim fanatics if a women shows even her face that is a justification to do whatever they want, because as in the previous comment “dress like a slut you will get treated like one”.\nYou are a disgusting excuse for a human being, and a poorly educated, socially ignorant one at that.\nAnyone who knows the first thing about sexual assault is aware that it is a crime of power and has nothing to do with “eyecandy”.  In fact, most victims of sexual assault know the perpetrator intimately – whether it be a family member, friend or other acquaintance.  Are you going to tell me that children, the elderly and otherly abled women are assaulted because they are dressed like “sluts”?  Did you actually just argue that Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women aren’t victims of sexual assault?\nLet me educate you a little bit about what a “fair game” entails.  A “fair game” is one in which a person feels safe walking around regardless of their gender, creed, religion, ability, sexual orientation or the way in which they choose to adorn their body.  A “fair game” is one in which a victim of a heinous crime feels comfortable approaching a police officer – who, after all, is paid to protect citizens’ safety – without feeling judged or reproached.\nKudos to you for being one of the most ignorant and simple-minded people I’ve ever encountered.\nHey Fair Game,\nI was raped . . . by my boyfriend. Your move.\nI’m so sorry. Thank you for being brave enough to use your story to stick up for other women against insensitive jerks.\nMy ex attempted to rape me while retrieving belongings he had left at my house (fortunately, my dog is super protective and started biting him).\nI was also sexually assaulted while wearing a long-sleeved, knee-length dress with a cami that hid my cleavage, my hair in a bun, heavy black stockings and ballet flats. Hardly slutty, didn’t stop five guys from surrounding me and groping/grabbing and trying to violate me until my friends caught them and kicked them out of the restaurant we were in.\nYour dog is a better person than Fair Game will ever be.\nI’m very sorry about the things that bad people have chosen to do and try to do to you. The last thing anyone (even worse a law enforcement officer!) should do is pretend you somehow made it happen, whether you were wearing a miniskirt or a burqa.\nWomen are raped in middle eastern countries where they cover up, too.  Did you think of that?\nRapists attack people who are vulnerable.  That can mean children and elderly people, too.  Women with disabilities are more likely to be raped than those who are able-bodied for that reason.  It’s not about provocative clothing.  Rapists act out of a desire to hurt and humiliate their victims, and to have power over them.  Isn’t this a whole lot more worthy of criticism than women’s clothing?\n“You dress like a slut you will get treated like one” definitely implies that the victims are responsible for crimes against them, and is a disgusting statement that I can’t believe anyone would utter these days.  Clothing is not consent for sex, as everyone knows, and “no” is not a hard word to understand.  Arguing that rapists can’t understand it is a huge load of crap.  After all, “no” is one of the first words we learn as children…so there’s no excuse for rapists regardless of what the victim was wearing.\nIt’s sad that people like “Fair Game” feel the need to criticize the victims rather than the violent criminals who abuse them…\nThere are so many things wrong with this statement but here are the things that really bother me:\n1) The onus is NOT on the woman to not get raped, it is on the rapist to NOT RAPE. NO ONE ever deserves to be raped, and it is NEVER a woman’s fault that she was raped. NEVER. Even if she was dressing in a way that you don’t personally approve of.\n2) Rape is not about sexual attraction, it is about POWER. Just because a woman is more covered does not mean that a man who is going to rape, will not rape her. It sounds AWFUL, and it IS AWFUL, but rape is not about “eyecandy”. It is all about power and trying to attain power by forcing someone into doing something they don’t want to.\nWell when the rapists start listening then hurray for you, till then I suggest you take it upon yourself to help prevent rape. If you are raped it is no way your fault but again can’t help to reduce the chances.\nThis is the same way I take measures on not getting murdered. Yes the onus SHOULD be on the murderer to stop killing people I do however in the meantime not pick up hitchhikers.\nI’d also like to point out that I also do not agree with Fair Game but I do agree with the officer in the article UNTIL I find evidence that is not a quote from the woman who took offense to the statement that the officer was implying that the women are to blame for the rape.\nIf the officer was simply saying not dressing like a slut can reduce the risk of rape (from opportunistic rape) then by all means he should be able to say that. Yes there will still be rapes on covered up women and “ugly” women but until the rapists decide to stop raping you’ll have to take the responsibility to help not get raped. Which again DOES NOT MEAN you take responsibility for getting raped if you do. RAPE IS WRONG REGARDLESS OF WHO HOW OR WHY IT IS DONE!\nIf you are trying to make a helpful or constructive point you’d be doing everyone a favor by not. Traditional Muslim women suffer rape. Nuns suffer rape. Grandmothers and little girls suffer rape. Dressing like a “slut” has nothing to do with it.\nOf course no one wants to get raped and tries to avoid it!!  No one wants to have their house robbed either! Just imagine your house is robbed & things that are special to you are destroyed. \xa0Imagine the police show up assess how ‘nice’ your garden looks. Now imagine they make you feel guilty (or even worse blame you) for attracting the thieves. They tell you it’s your fault. (seriously you’d be pissed!) No one would accept that! Are you picking up what I’m saying? Let’s realistically assume what attracts one thief to one house may not be the same as what attracts another thief to another house. Would an arbitrary authority telling us how to decorate our house so they all looked a certain way be effective? We can take all the precautions we can afford (deadbolts, bars on the windows & alarm systems) but if a thief still robs you would you not agree it’s not your fault? \xa0\xa0\nWe have the right to decorate & enjoy your home anyway we want! You may not agree with your neighbors idea of what looks ‘nice’ but you must agree you both deserve the same right to be protected? The thief should receive the same penalty regardless of how we each decorate our homes? The thief is at fault!\n\xa0\n\xa0You’d also get pretty pissed off if a judge sentenced the criminal to 1month jail time because she thought your garden looked shitty but sentenced your neighbors thief to 2 yrs because theirs was nicer looking in the judges eyes!! Thats not how our system works! It shouldn’t work like that in rape cases either!! \xa0\xa0\nHow do sluts dress?  Do I deserve to get raped because I’m wearing a skirt? How about if I tell you it goes past my knee, do I still deserve it now? If I’m wearing a long sleeved sweater, is that okay? Or does it have to be a certain degree of baggy before it passes your “shouldn’t get raped” standards?\nSaying things like “dress like a slut you will get treated like one” is EXACTLY the kind of statement that contributes to the rape culture that makes men think rape is okay, and it’s wildly misogynistic – what, exactly, should MEN avoid wearing so they don’t get raped?  Oh, there’s nothing? Men can wear whatever they want?  But women have to dress with a degree of modesty defined by the individual minds of every man on the planet, or hey, it’s her fault.\nAnd by the way, douchebag, women in hindu, sikh, and muslim cultures get raped ALL THE TIME.  There’s a well-documented history of family members MURDERING women from those cultures who are raped, despite their “traditional clothing.” So, as it turns out, forcing women to cover up not only FAILS to protect them from rapists, but also dehumanizes them even further, by implying that after being raped, they’re not even worthy of life.\nThe way to stop rape is for RAPISTS TO STOP RAPING, not for women to swaddle themselves away from male gaze.\nWell put sister. Agree on all fronts, glad someone is able to articulate exactly what is so offensive about this comment without relying on name-calling.\nI don’t agree.  I’ll have less hotties to look at >=(\nYour comment reeks of ignorance.  Women who dress provocatively are not the only women who get sexually assaulted.  And there is no law against dressing in a way you think will attract the opposite sex.  The idea that the way you dress is what gets you raped is beyond ridiculous.  You and the police officer in question need a bit of education\nExcept that the thing about rapists is that *they rape people*\nThey rape women who are fat and they rape women that are thin.\nThey rape women who are tall and they rape women that are short.\nThey rape women of colour and caucasian women.\nThey rape women wearing snow pants and a parka on a winter day, or they rape a woman wearing a short skirt.\nThey use rape as a tool of war in war-torn countries.\nThey rape children, and they rape men.\nThey are family members, coworkers, police officers, doctors, bosses, students, teachers, friends.\nSo instead of trying to punish some women for being sexually active, or blaming them for the terrible thing that happened to them.  You can encourage people to respect consent and bodily autonomy and *not* rape people.\nExcuse me “Fair Game” you have no idea what you are talking about. How about you get educated and then talk. It doesn’t matter what women wear. Assault happens because people like you choose to focus on the victim rather than the perpetrator. “I’m sure” doesn’t carry much weight. Women should be able to wear what they want either way. That is not a reason. Assault is about power, it doesn’t matter whether she’s “eyecandy”. I suggest you take a course from Women’s Studies before you continue with your sexism.\nI imagine you must dress like an ignorant misogynist because you certainly sound like one! Perhaps instead of choosing a “slut” to rape, the men responsible could just not rape anyone! What a crazy idea.\nFair Game, you sound like a real class act.  Are you seriously under the impression that the only women who get raped are “eye candy”? I can’t think of a more ignorant comment you could have made.\nClearly you are a man who hates seeing women in control of themselves, and would prefer if we were all veiled to keep men from getting excited.  I pity the women in your life. I’m sure you’d be really sympathetic if any of them were ever raped, but, hey, it would be their own fault if the rapist found them attractive, right?\nActually, no. It has been well established, time and time again, that rape has nothing to do with how someone is or isn’t dressed. That is a myth used to excuse rapists and blame victims, like what’s happening here. And even if there WAS a correlation, it would STILL be disgusting to blame victims for being raped, because it STILL wouldn’t be their fault.\nThe Toronto police officer’s comment is truly disturbing because he blames the victim for unwanted, forced sexual violence. Blaming the victim means that you hold the person who was attacked responsible for that violence that they suffered. It implies that the victim coulda, shoulda, woulda avoided the attack and therefore was partially responsible for what would inevitably happen.  Sadly, that couldn’t be farther from the truth.  Rape is regularly and consistently used every day by men all over the world as a way of asserting power and dominance over women.  It is a system of control moreso than a sexual act, and therefore it really doesn’t matter what the woman is wearing.\nIt’s really sad that the police officer who made this comment is in a position of any kind of authroity. With flagrantly sexist and mysogenistic attitudes like that, women in Toronto are certainly less safe. He should be fired or resign from his duties.\nYou ARE aware that rape is rampant Hindi, Sikh and Muslim women, yes?\nI cannot believe the last post. It is people like you that are the problem with society today! I am a male, and regardless of my gender I think that the victims of sexual harrasment should NEVER be to blame.\nDo you think the way a woman dresses, really changes the perspective of a predator. How small minded are you? Have you not been reading about the recent events in egypt, where even women in traditional muslim clothing are being sexual harrassed?\nJust an FYI, you and your opinion disgust  me.\nHey, Fair Game.\nNews flash. Sexual assault is a crime of violence, not sex. It’s a power issue, not one of sexual attraction. When I was raped, I was wearing a winter coat, an oversized sweater and baggy jeans – what’s so slutty about that?\nI’m sorry but what you wear has NOTHING to do with it, a lot of sexual assaults happen to women who are in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nOr to women that have been watched for weeks or even months, and ‘Fair Game’ I bet you any money they don’t always look like sluts.\n& just so you know, Muslims and Sikh women who do wear traditional clothing are just as much at risk if they’re in the wrong place, walking in dark areas and alone.\nYou and this officer disgust me.\nThe safety tips should have been general:\nAvoid being alone late at night.\nStay in well lit areas.\nActually, there’s zero correlation between rape and how someone is dressed, even if you discount the fact that most assaults are committed by relatives and partners. Outside of the societal myths that support rape culture, there’s nothing linking costume, conventional attractiveness, health, fitness, weight, or any other physical trait with rape, completed or attempted.\nNone.\nI also admit to being curious whether you actually believe that cultures which shame women into covering their bodies more fully are magical rape-free zones, which is what you seem to be suggesting.\nYou can’t have it both ways – either you’re blaming the attacker, or you’re suggesting there’s something the woman could have done to avoid being assaulted. There’s no middle ground there, at all. To say that women should expect to be assaulted and should modify their lives accordingly is to support the belief that women should be contained, covered, and chaperoned. It also infantilises men, suggesting there’s no chance that they could learn not to rape.\nRather than wasting time victim-blaming – and that’s what you’re doing, even with your mealy-mouthed proviso to the contrary – spend your time asking yourself exactly how we’re going to pound it into assailants’ heads that rape is bad, it is not excusable, it is not acceptable, and it is not ever anyone’s fault but theirs.\nSuperbly put, Judith. I could not agree with you more.\nAre you fucking kidding me?!?! Cause everyone who gets sexually assaulted MUST be wearing something slutty\nFucking ignorant idiots 😐\nYou know nothing about the anatomy of rape, do you?\nThe elderly and babies are targeted, along with people anywhere on & off the gender spectrum, of all shapes, sizes, colours, creeds, wardrobes.  It’s not about them looking pretty, hot, sexy, nor slutty.  It’s about power.\nThe main purpose of rape is power for the rapist, not sexual gratification.\nFalse false faaaalse. Are we fucking done with the sexism and rape apologism? Women do not get raped because of what they wear, but because a disgusting human being RAPED them. 80% of victims know their rapist, so quit it with the ”stranger in a dark alley raping a young woman with a short skirt” trope.\nMuslim women are raped all the time. Ugly women are raped. Fat women are raped. Actually, 1 out of 6 women will be raped in her lifetime. You are an ignorant misogynist.\nperhaps we should tell men who are victims of crime that it’s their fault too. maybe they should be advised that if they travel or go out at night, they’re just asking to be mugged or robbed. because they are after all just making themselves eye candy to the thieves.\nYou’re honestly calling women who are dressed like sluts “Fair Game” for being attacked? That gives someone fair reason to sexually assault a woman? Using your flawed theory, that gives me the right to attack you because you’re going around flaunting an opinion I don’t like. Same concept, there is no real logic behind it.\nYou sir, have your morals backwards. I also don’t understand why you are referring to it as ‘your’ Society like you are not a part of it too. You are a part of the so-called problem of half-naked women selling pepsi and coke and people purchasing it.\nUse your head, innocent people have no right to be attacked.\nShort version of Mr. ‘Fair Game”s comment: “women who don’t adhere to my religion should be raped.”\nI’d say you just need to get laid, but, really, men like you need to be castrated. You’re encouraging violent criminals – if you’re not one yourself – and you’re giving the rest of us a bad name.\nWork on your self-loathing, kid. Here’s a hint on where to start; women aren’t to blame for it. Stop punishing them because you’re afraid of their bodies and your own.\nI hope you do some growing up before you really damage someone.\nWell said George!!  Great assessment of fair game’s personality! I’d say you got it exactly right!  Hopefully he gets some help with his issues around sexuality and insecurity.\nTo the person who commented that if a woman dresses slutty, she is therefore to blame for any unwanted sexual advances/assaults should probably get their head examined. Completely backward and illogical thinking when it comes to womens’ issues like sexual assault is asinine and it’s that out of touch thought process that scare women off from reporting these crimes.\nAnd the motivation to sexually assault a woman has been rarely reported as a result of what the victim is wearing compared to a crime of convenience (victim was easy to access and isolate), a result of the perpetrator’s upbringing (bad childhood/was assaulted as a child) ,societal pressures, etc.. A lot of these men also have social/behavioral issues, as well.\nLastly, women are assaulted everyday, whether they’re wearing a parka in the dead of winter, or short -shorts in the middle of summer. Neither are acceptable and neither is your comment. It’s actually quite disgusting and ignorant. It almost feels as if you think they DESERVE to be raped because of what they’re wearing. Personally, I think YOU deserve a smack upside the head for even writing any of that.\nMuch as I hate to admit it, the first comment does have a point. We live in a time when if you go to our ‘universities’ (our esteemed institutions of learning), all that the people are doing in the hallways, benches, under trees, in every place one looks is doing everything but having the actual act of sex. In such a pornified society as this where its all about flaunting what you got on a beach or at a university…people may not realize the attitudes that are fostered towards them when they act as ‘sluts’.\nAnd yes its true that rape is not the exclusive domain of western foreigners, it still is a sizeable occurance as compared to other countries in the eastern part of the world (saudi arabia)-not saying that it doesn’t happen- but that its much much much less on a ratio basis even taking into account people who won’t report it because the same thing happens here in canada and the USA.\n@Thinking about #1, too bad rape is not about sex then, and actually about power. Rapists rape people who are vulnerable, which has nothing to do with anyone’s perceived “sluttiness.”\nYea, the difference between what’s going on at the universities and what’s covered here is that one happens between two consenting adults and the other one is a CRIME.\nSo if you get married, have kids, so everyone knows decisively that you’re most definitely NOT a virgin, does that mean we can now declare a rape open season? OBVIOUSLY *NOT*.\nIt is immoral and illegal to force something upon another person, ESPECIALLY something as violent and degrading as rape!!!!!\npersonally, I feel people who wear a certain brand of clothing are all idiots but that doesn’t mean I now have a license to assault anyone wearing that brand of clothing!\nYou are full of it, “Fair Game” — and frankly seem to be getting a little too much enjoyment out of the idea that people “deserve” to be raped. Rape is a crime of power, to suggest it’s primarily sexual attraction that motivates it goes everything we know about the subject. You’re also full of it re: “traditional clothing” as we know damn well the rape culture that exists in some of the societies with very traditional dress. Seriously, look in the mirror, you are expressing some very backward and honestly borderline evil attitudes. This Officer was WAY out of line.\nIf you knew a single thing about sexual assault and rape you’d know it’s about power and dominance, not about ‘eye candy’.\nYou are completely correct.\nMuslim women are obviously never the victims of sexual violence.\nSound logic.\nA woman should not have to cover herself from head to foot to feel safe.\nI blame the officer for being so crass, but it’s not like this is an isolated issue. This society fosters a rape culture, where it’s on the potential victim to hope they’re not picked out by some rapist tonight. It’s a society which makes women afraid to go to the police because they’re “asking for it” by dressing or acting a certain way.\nFair Game,\nyou’re a disgusting misogynist. Educate yourself.\nMost women aren’t sexually assaulted because of how they dress. They’re usually assaulted by men that they know personally.\n‘You dress like a slut you will get treated like one. ‘\nSo you’re justifying rape now, you pathetic scumbag?\n‘That’s your progress, your business, your freedoms that the evil terrorists hate. ‘\nThat doesn’t even make any sense. Are you justifying Muslim terrorism because women wear tank tops and dresses that don’t cover their knees? How stupid are you?\n‘They wouldn’t say—choose a hindu or sikh or muslim woman who was covered in their traditional clothing.’\nSo women need to be fully covered up to avoid being raped? What kind of sexist double standard is that? As a man I find you’re comment an insult to me personally. You’re treating men as if they’re animals who can’t control themselves. What a ignoramus you are.\nAnd here’s a newsflash: Women don’t need to justify their worth to you by dressing the way you prefer them to dress. If you’re so small-minded that you’d judge a woman negatively not by her character and actions but by how much skin she shows, than you’re the one who needs to change.\nHey Fair Game…\nMy soulsister was sexually assaulted by a man at her synagogue when he drove her home. She wears long sleeved shirts, jeans, and never wears makeup. She’s one of the least “slutty” girls I know. Also, most cases of rape/sexual assault are done by men that are close to them such as boyfriends, husbands, relatives…\nAnd of course, we haven’t touched upon same sex or female-on-male sexual assault.\nThat cop is a pig.  Sexual assault should never be a frightening cloud that hangs over the heads of pretty or beautiful women. Some women can’t “ugly” themselves up to avoid being jumped by a pig. JUST DON’T DO IT! No matter what a victim “looks” like.\nHe’s also an idiot. Everyone knows that pigs who rape women or who expose themselves or whatever else, have serious mental problems that go way beyond their “weapon of choice.” Just because they can’t keep it in their pants, doesn’t mean it has ANYTHING to do with actual sex.  Anger, rage, hatred, revenge and jealousy are the main reasons men rape.\nToronto Police are NOT educating their members!  (Pardon the pun).\nThe policeman does not have to issue the apology. He has not done anything wrong. It is just a suggestion people. Dont make such a big deal over this! If you do not dress like sluts, then ignore the suggestion. Why bother to get so offended?\nDressing slutty at night is like wearing a redsuit when a stupid bull is around. Smart people will avoid dressing in red. Do not give rapers an incentive by not dressing slutty, trust me, it will help you alot. (Althought it has been proven that colour red does not anger a bull)\nAfter all the policeman just voiced his thoughts – freedom of speech – and if you do not like it, then ignore it.\nLastly always look around when you are alone 🙂\nIt’s not just a suggestion, and women covering up won’t suddenly make rape go away or stop assaults.  Not only is it an ignorant comment that the police officer made but the fact that he is a cop makes it worse because he is supposed to one of the “good guys” who will help the victims. As well, the definition of “slutty” can be almost anything. Maybe the pants were not baggy enough, shirt not baggy enough, should of wore a jacket, should of wore a veil….how far do you want to go? There is never a justification.\nP.S. freedom of speech also involves the right to voice dissent against ignorance.\n@Fair suggestion, It is absolutely wrong to spread misinformation like that because it leads to the perpetuation of a culture in which women are held responsible for a crime committed against them. It is absolutely NOT TRUE that promiscuous dress “attracts” rapists. Please educate yourself:\nA Federal Commission on Crime of Violence Study found that only 4.4% of all reported rapes involved provocative behavior (“sluttiness”) on the part of the victim. In murder cases 22% involved such behavior (as simple as a glance). Additionally most convicted rapists do not remember what their victims were wearing.\nThe policeman should issue an apology, though the explanation should be prepared by the police service and be to the effect of, “We did not properly educate this officer on the subjects he discussed.”\nThe logic you use is astounding. First you suggest there’s a relationship between rape and time of day, and then in one breath assert that one should not wear red around a bull while in the next seem to suggest awareness of the fact bulls are colour blind…\nLastly, awareness isn’t the best way to protect yourself. The average rapist is known to the victim, and spends time grooming said victim. If there’s not a previous relationship, the perpetrator takes steps to circumvent his victim’s awareness and preparedness. There is, frankly, no way to completely avoid being a victim. Rather it is better to make oneself a harder target.\nNo, what the policeman is doing is blaming the victim and in so doing he is creating an atmosphere in which rape is seen as being more acceptable because it really “not the rapist’s fault”. Unless this kind of crap is stamped on every time we hear it we will continue to have a society where women can’t even answer their own front door without the fear of rape.\nNo one asks to be raped, unless it’s a fantasy of yours. Period.\nFreedom of speech isn’t quite the same thing when you’re in a position of formal public trust and wearing the uniform of a sworn service. Stop making stuff up.\nPeople are making a big deal of this because you fundamentally DO NOT GET IT and are advancing a very dangerous line of reasoning. You are ENABLING the problem. You and your attitudes are PART of the problem. Listen and learn, stop being so pig-headed. This stuff counts.\nPeople could cover every inch of skin, lock themself in a house, master self-defense, carry a knife, carry a gun, wear a locked metal “chastity belt”, and still get raped. We can take measures to protect ourselves, and still get assaulted. Sometimes sexual assault happens long after a person has been made a victim.\nSometimes the people who commit the crime are the ones we turn to for protection, the ones we think will never hurt us. Sometimes it can happen where we feel the safest. Sometimes it happens when we least expect it.\nSubjectivity aside, what the police officer said is worse than unhelpful. If a person were to believe him, were to believe that by dressing conservatively s/he could avoid or discourage rape, they might believe they were safe.\nThat police officer is terrible. This whole “dressing like a slut” business actually has nothing to do with a woman’s preference of clothing. “Dressing like a slut” is an EXCUSE used by perpetrators to justify hurting another person.\nTo say that a woman who dresses how she wants to dress deserves to be raped is like saying that you deserve to be hit by a car if you’re around a road. It doesn’t matter if you’re at a crosswalk or have the pedestrian right-of-way or even on the sidewalk – you’re near the road, so I’m going to run you over with my car. Sure, I could CHOOSE not to and keep going on my merry way, but because you’re close to a street, it means you’re “asking for it,” right? I mean, if you didn’t want to become a victim of vehicular homicide, surely you would NEVER go near a road.\nEveryone needs to chill out and take a look at this UN crime survey before we keep bashing the guy who made the first comment and the police officer in question:\nhttp://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap_percap-crime-rapes-per-capita\nIt is shown that the majority of the top 20 nations with the highest prevalence of rape in the world are those with the greatest female civil liberties, which includes the freedom to dress as they please. (South Africa, Australia, Canada, USA, France, UK, etc.) The others are mostly impoverished nations with weaker law enforcement established. (Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Dominica, Venezuela, etc.)\nIt is shown that many of the the bottom 20 countries surveyed are predominantly governed under Islamic Law or with a legal code modeled after Islamic Law, with far fewer female civil liberties. (Azerbaijan, Yemen, Indonesia, Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, etc.) Rape is actually found to be the least prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where many foreign observers find women to have the fewest civil liberties.\nThis information was found in about 2 minutes, which suggests that the people most in need of education are those blindly criticizing our friend who made the first post. His point is valid and so is that of the police officer, statistics show. However, the officer probably should have exercised more tact in his choice of words, which by the looks of them suggest that they have been taken somewhat out of context, in my non-expert opinion.\nPlease, before anyone tells me that I am placing the blame on victims, read the following: Rape is against the law and I do not condone it. The tragic fact is this: people are going to rape people no matter what. There is nothing anyone can do to eliminate it without revoking our civil liberties to extreme degrees.\nThe biggest problem with numbers and estimates on rape has to do with a severe under-reporting of these incidents, due in large part to cultural issues such as this one. If a woman feels embarrassed or worries that she won’t be taken seriously when reporting a rape (e.g. being told she looks slutty and was probably asking for it), why would she bother making it worse on herself? Embarrass the victim, protect the rapist. Not to mention how many women in other nations will get stoned to death for being an “adulteress” or having sex outside of marriage when someone (yes, even a family member) rapes them. There’s a lot of incentive to keep your mouth shut when someone violates you.\nThere are a lot of nuances here, and it’s hard to trust the numbers. Not that they should have anything to do with this–rape is rape, regardless of religion, dress, geographic location, sex/gender, age, or any other demographic someone should happen to pull out in defence of ignorance.\nThat site clearly says:\n“DEFINITION: Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”\nThe actual prevalence of rape IS NOT reflected in this chart, the website itself says so. This is a collection of reported rapes, not real prevalence.\nIn many Middle Eastern countries women who are rape victims can be publicly punished with lashings, killed by the family members or shunned by their community. Therefore, reporting is low. Try reading all the information before trying to use these statistics to your advantage.\nI just want to point out that statistics like that are based upon REPORTED crime, or government estimates. In some countries being raped can lead to you being condemned to death, I’d say that’s a reason to keep it quiet. In countries with more equal rights for women, women are more likely to report crimes against them. In countries where rape is understood as a crime of power, and victim blaming is slightly less of a problem, more people will come forward. Even in the US, where I’m from, most assaults go unreported.\nLook at the caveat on the survey you just posted: “Total recorded rapes. Crime statistics are often better indicators of prevalence of law enforcement and willingness to report crime, than actual prevalence.”\nIn countries governed by Islamic law, rapes are vastly under reported precisely because the victim is often blamed for somehow soliciting the assault. In many cases, when the victim is a woman, the victim is then charged with adultery. A man’s word counts more than a woman’s so the rapist can simply claim the woman seduced him to avoid a rape charge. Naturally, this reduces the number of recorded rapes because 1) it’s not recorded as a rape if it’s recorded as adultery and 2) who the hell risks reporting rape in a country where they’re more likely to punish the victims? This is precisely the reason why all of us are mad at rape apologists like Fair Game and the policeman in the article. They enable rapists by blaming the victim for the crime.\nAlso @Edgar Graham, shame on you for pretending to state the facts while at the same time confounding correlation and causation.* They are not the same. If you don’t condone rape, please don’t inadvertently contribute to rape culture by supporting rape apologists and not reading your own sources correctly.\n*An example: While red hair and freckles often occur together (correlation), it does not necessarily follow that red hair CAUSES freckles (it doesn’t).\n@mynameisbutters\nExcellent comment but unfortunately too many people are so uneducated in science and basic statistics that they can’t separate correlation from causation.\nThere is research showing correlation between teenagers who have breakfast with family and sexual activity at a later age.  An idiot would claim breakfast cereals have the magical ability to make kids more “moral” but in reality, it’s because typically, children who have breakfast with their family come from more close-knit families with more attentive parents.\nThese statistics don’t show anything about whether “dressing slutty” makes you more likely to be raped.  I’d go so far as to say that countries where women’s freedoms are greatly restricted don’t create an environment where it’s easy for women to report rape in the first place.  Rape is very prevalent in many African countries, for example, but do you think that society there provides recourse for victims, or even acknowledges that a crime has taken place in most cases?\nYou’ll notice the DRC isn’t recorded, where rape is used as a weapon of war. Also, many of those countries at the bottom of the list don’t consider marital rape a crime.\nAs the majority of responses to your post have pointed out, this is a report on sexual assault that is reported or otherwise recorded. The relationship between reports of sexual assault and the civil liberties women have in that country cannot be over-emphasized; it is far easier to report a sexual assault in a country which will take your report seriously. The report in question does not define “rape” or take into account the differences in definition by region. I prefer the term sexual assault, as it encompasses many different aspects of the term than just forced intercourse.\nIn many of the countries you reference as being in the bottom 20, reporting a sexual assault is a fast track to ostracism on the nice end of things. Can you imagine how difficult it must be for a woman to disclose sexual violence to the men who think her ankles are to be hidden? I know from travelling to some of these countries that women are blamed for many types of sexual assault, including being groped or frotteurised on public transit; these women should not be in public surrounded by men is the logic used. It does stand to reason that in a country where women are “allowed” to say no, they will report a man who doesn’t respect their use of the word or their attempts to protect their civil liberties and personal safety.\nI don’t think you are necessarily placing blame on the victim, however, I do think it’s a good idea for you to look into the subject a little more thoroughly.\nA few things the officer in question, as well as most of the comments, seem to disregard include male on male sexual assault, or even what dressing “like a slut” entails. The word is, after all, a misogynist insult in itself. If a young boy is assaulted, is it possible he also dressed like a slut? Or perhaps it’s more to the point that in justification of his actions a rapist will say he was overcome by feelings of lust based on his victim’s attire rather than say the truth: he is a violent offender who will take whatever excuse he can create to be violent toward his preferred victim.\nNaturally countries where the legal penalty for having been raped is stoning have fewer rapes, not less reporting.\nSo if you have sharia law in these societies, then you have a situation wherein a woman’s testimony in a court of law is worth only half a mans. So if two men hold a woman down while a third rapes her, and then she goes to the police, her testimony counts for nothing against that of her three rPISTS, NO?\nSo how many fucking rapes do you think are likely to get reported in these shitholes?\nOkay, here’s a serious question.\nIs it okay or not okay for advertisers of products and makers of pop music video clips to use semi-naked models in slutty clothes and make-up?\nThere have undoubtedly been hundreds (if not thousands) of graduate theses on this very subject–I think the resounding answer to your question is, “The jury’s still out.” Or, at the very least, it will remain a contentious issue for a very long time (if not forever).\nWhat is the bigger consideration to me is the definition of the word “slut” and its implied meaning. It’s a tired observation, but it’s still true–guys who sleep around are seen as manly and deserving of respect for their sexual prowess, whereas girls who have the confidence to enjoy their own sexuality while behaving the same way are completely disrespected and dismissed as tramps. Where’s the equality in that? Even when men get called sluts and whores in popular culture, the connotation is a positive or non-serious one.\nRather than do an overhaul on advertising practices, I’d like to see a complete rewrite of cultural understanding and acceptance when it comes to female sexuality. You can’t shame sluts if the concept of being a slut doesn’t exist.\nLast I checked, dressing provocatively is part of their job description so I don’t really see your point!  Part of their job description is also to be more attractive than the vast lot of us (except me because I’m gorgeous LOL LOL)\nCome to think of it, you’ve posted more than one random non-issues that no one but you think is a thought provoker here.\nIf I were you I wouldn’t go around calling myself “clear thinking” because it’s an embarrassment.\nLet us remember, people, that rapists are sick people; they enjoy violent and brutally having sex. How a woman dresses play very little in a rapist committing the act or not. Seriously, do you think that because you are wearing long jeans and a sweater you risk no chance of getting rape?? I have big news for you!\nPretending that the way women dress is a direct consequence of what men will do to do is actually both offensive for men and women: it seems to suggest that women who are covering more their body will not be victim of rape and it also suggests that men cannot control their actions (1) and that they enjoy brutally and violently forcing a women into having sex (2); i’m not sure how many men would enjoy this characterization of themselves.\n@fairsuggestion\nWomen get raped every day by people that they know wearing almost anything.  The last thing a victim needs to hear is that they gave the rapist an incentive to rape them.  You have obviously never been raped, or else you wouldn’t utter something so ignorant and one sided.\nWhen you tweet this; make sure to cc @torontopolice\nWho here suspects that Fair Game is indeed the police officer, further running his mouth??\nFirst to comment…? Sounds fishy.\nI’m not making accusations, just wondering.\nThe biggest problem with this situation is that the officer will likely not have to suffer the consequences of his actions (the parallels to victim-blaming are astounding). My guess is a brief suspension with pay at worst, though a light slap on the hand in the form of a forced public apology is the most likely outcome.\nWhile people recognize these kinds of comments as wrong, society doesn’t care about women enough (yet) to follow through on making examples of people who are in positions of authority, but who clearly shouldn’t be. By not taking this issue as seriously as it should, the police department is merely acknowledging public frustration with the officer in question rather than taking responsibility for the situation. True, you can’t control everything coming out of an employee’s mouth, but public servants have a responsibility to ensure that the people walking the streets are educated and sensitive to such damaging events.\nAs far as I’m concerned, the police representative’s PR spinning is just as bad as the cop’s comment. What are you investigating? He said it. People heard it. Time for justice. It’s almost as if they’re saying, “If women didn’t get raped so much, we wouldn’t have to be bothered with providing tips on how to stay safe. And then this issue would have never happened.”\nAre you kidding me?\nTo all of you on here who are blaming the victim for dressing too ‘slutty’ or ‘sexy’.  Has it occurred to all of you that this argument cheapens men as much as women by asserting that guys have absolutely no control over their instinct and that instinct will always trump our higher thought processes?  By the same logic, those who wear expensive clothes were just asking to get robbed because nobody can control themselves, right?\nDressing provocatively may not be an invitation to rape but it IS an invitation to be treated as an object. Please note that I haven’t specified a gender.\nIt makes me sad that one moronic police officer can say something like this and makes the whole force look like misogynistic assholes. As a victim of sexual assault who DID go to the police, they aren’t all like this and I would actually say most of them aren’t.\nI would like to know why this particular officer was chosen to speak on this issue when he has no understanding of it and is therefore clearly not qualified to do so. It isn’t as if there are no police officers in the city who have two brain cells to rub together, so what gives?\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nNicole Hanson\nContributor\nBlack enclaves – urban settlements with an inherent sense of both cultural and ethnic pride – are known for being separate from the societal social and economic mainstream. Little emphasis, however, has been set on their origins: a series of beginnings mainly built on race.\nEglinton West is also known as “Little Jamaica”. John Tavares\nBoth historically and presently, black enclaves have been a contested urban space. When we look at North American black enclaves – settlements such as Africville, Jane and Finch and Eglinton West – we are visibly engaging in spatial histories which may be unnoticed.\nThe births of these “ethnic enclaves” are imbued with strong, racial undertones that connect racial identities.\nLooking back, black enclaves, such as Nova Scotia’s Africville, Vancouver’s Hogan’s Alley and Ontario’s Wilberforce Colony, have been nationally understood as an embodiment of black pride and community. Yet their formation was involuntary, because slavery and racism enforced lines of demarcation, drawing out an urban space for blacks to live and hindering them from settling in desirable spaces.\nThe forced nature of these black enclaves embodied oppression, because whites owned most of the land, exerted power and domination, and dictated where blacks would fit within the urban landscape – but these communities were nevertheless successful in building black solidarity.\nRetrospectively, these spaces have fostered a sense of spatial emancipation and liberation from their white counterparts.\nNow black enclaves are becoming voluntary spaces; the dynamics within them are liberating, empowering and uplifting, and build a sense of residential solidarity through community building.\nJane and Finch, just south of York University, is a black enclave with a bad reputation. (John Tavares)\nEglinton West and Jane and Finch stand as examples of community-building urban space in Toronto, Ontario. Eglinton West is called “Little Jamaica,” and is characterized by retail Jamaican shops, authentic Jamaican cuisine, barbershops and salons.\nThe black identities that make up this space have allied together to strengthen themselves as an economic, communal whole; however, the arrangement of these urban settlements, especially that of Jane and Finch, have become associated with stereotypes, clearly polarizing the city’s social, economic, political and cultural makeup.\nThat’s why Jane and Finch area has been labelled the home of the impoverished, disadvantaged or, more clearly, the urban poor, over-generalizing every identity within that space because they reside within that enclave. The politics of representation co-exist with the urban politics of the space when it comes to black enclaves, thus perpetuating not only an urban identity crisis, but re-instilling structures of hyper-segregation, racial discrimination and urban apartheid.\nBlack enclaves, whether thought of as voluntary or involuntary, are still oppressive, because as more blacks concentrate in these enclaves, they further remove themselves from the mainstream. What this mechanism does is reinforce a lack of economic opportunity, which continues to pave the way for both residential, community and entrepreneurial poverty.\nThe people in a neighbourhood reinvest their income back into their community. In situations of blatant poverty, neighbourhoods do not have that reinvestment coming back to them, stopping them from building the fundamental institutions that cater to community building. For the most part, the little sense of economic development these neighbourhoods once had quickly ceased; poverty creates crime, leaving the economic value of these businesses threatened.\n(Illustrated by (Cola)nothy Humphrey.)\nBusinesses thus move out of these areas. High insurance means businesses are forced to increase the price of their products, but the high crime rates do not allow for longevity and economic profitability, thus reinforcing discrimination and segregation, leaving the black enclave socially and economically stigmatized to development and growth.\nEven though black enclaves are also seen as voluntary spaces, they continue to be the epitome of racial segregation and economic divide. They are notoriously characterized as unattractive spaces with a high rate of poverty. They are affiliated with joblessness, insurmountable teenage pregnancies, out-of-wedlock births (emphasizing discontinuity between black male and female relationships) and female-led families people assumed are welfare-dependent –\xa0 and all of this against the backdrop of high crime rates.\nWhether black enclaves are understood as involuntary or voluntary, these places have been sensationalized within the city. Black enclaves have become ghettoized, to the point where it’s almost taboo for blacks to live out in the suburbs. The ghettoization of these black enclaves perpetuates a sense of stagnation, affecting the identity of urban youth, both within the enclaves and outside of them.\nIntangible structures such as racism, racial segregation and discrimination lead to urban segregation, and create a politic of identity that intentionally captures and emphasizes difference and limits social and economic integration for those identities within black enclaves.\nThis robs people in these spaces of the ability to create identities for themselves; instead, they become neglected, subordinate and dependent on dominant groups. If we can utilize this historic transfer – black enclaves premised on a racialized connectedness – then we can create a holistic approach to community building, not only visibly to the mainstream, but also internally, within ourselves, the foundation for a nationalistic sense of independence.\nThere needs to be a holistic approach to reclaiming the identity of our communities and to embody that nationalistic spirit of residential solidarity, community building and economic independency.\nWhen we understand black enclaves were formed via a racialized connectedness, we can examine that shared history – a history of communities formed both involuntarily and voluntarily, premised not only in racism, discrimination and segregation but focused on community formation and restructuring.\nThis understanding will allow us to take better steps to form a nationalistic approach in rebuilding black solidarity within and outside black enclaves.\nNicole Hanson is the president of Apostolic Pentecostals of York University (APYU)\n ']"

York graduate Vanessa Grillone did.\n“This is what I did. This is all mine,” says Grillone as she flips through her recently published book, My Pen, My Voice. Grillone is a 22-year-old writer who graduated fromYork University’s English program in 2010. Faced with the “real world,”  Grillone wanted to follow her dream and publish a book. She had been  keeping a diary since before she was twelve and knew that she had a story that should be told. Upon  graduation, she decided there was no better time to pursue her dream of  being a writer than now, while she was still young.\nShe sent out manuscripts, but received no replies. Most publishers  rarely look at unsolicited manuscripts and Grillone did not have a  literary agent. After a few months, though, she found some hope when a publisher vacationing in India promised to look  at her work after she returned to Toronto. Grillone waited eagerly, but her hopes were crushed when she found out the publisher fell  ill on her trip and passed away. Grillone lost not only a friend, but also her only connection to the publishing industry.\nVanessa Grillone. (Courtesy of Vanessa Grillone\nGrillone was convinced publishing the book was simply not meant to be. Her parents were determined to see their daughter succeed and suggested self-publishing. She researched her options and decided to go with a self-publishing package from iUniverse, a company linked to Chapters.\nThe self-publishing package suggested writers hire a copy editor and line editor–but Grillone didn’t. Instead, she used the skills she learned in school to edit her own work. It worked out great, she said.\xa0 The finished book is her real diary, filled with\xa0 her “raw emotions.” While some editors suggested she tweak it in some parts — changing\xa0 some prose to poetry, for example — Grillone kept it the way it was because she didn’t want to alter the reality of the diary.\nThe result is a book that’s all hers — from the words on the page to the choice of cover.

York graduate Vanessa Grillone did.\n“This is what I did. This is all mine,” says Grillone as she flips through her recently published book, My Pen, My Voice. Grillone is a 22-year-old writer who graduated fromYork University’s English program in 2010. Faced with the “real world,”  Grillone wanted to follow her dream and publish a book. She had been  keeping a diary since before she was twelve and knew that she had a story that should be told. Upon  graduation, she decided there was no better time to pursue her dream of  being a writer than now, while she was still young.\nShe sent out manuscripts, but received no replies. Most publishers  rarely look at unsolicited manuscripts and Grillone did not have a  literary agent. After a few months, though, she found some hope when a publisher vacationing in India promised to look  at her work after she returned to Toronto. Grillone waited eagerly, but her hopes were crushed when she found out the publisher fell  ill on her trip and passed away. Grillone lost not only a friend, but also her only connection to the publishing industry.\nVanessa Grillone. (Courtesy of Vanessa Grillone\nGrillone was convinced publishing the book was simply not meant to be. Her parents were determined to see their daughter succeed and suggested self-publishing. She researched her options and decided to go with a self-publishing package from iUniverse, a company linked to Chapters.\nThe self-publishing package suggested writers hire a copy editor and line editor–but Grillone didn’t. Instead, she used the skills she learned in school to edit her own work. It worked out great, she said.\xa0 The finished book is her real diary, filled with\xa0 her “raw emotions.” While some editors suggested she tweak it in some parts — changing\xa0 some prose to poetry, for example — Grillone kept it the way it was because she didn’t want to alter the reality of the diary.\nThe result is a book that’s all hers — from the words on the page to the choice of cover.

Contrary to cyberbullying fears, the blogosphere provides teens “with a safe area for self-exposure.” Blogging can “improve self-image, increase self-confidence, and gather friends.”\nThe study says blogging is considered ideal for anyone who is stressed, depressed, and anxious.\nPsychologists have recommended writing in the past as a method of emotional venting and problem solving. Writing, the authors of the study say, “influences the emotional state, as well as the social behavior of the writer.”\nBut blogging is different from writing in a journal. “Online writing enables free expression, easy rereading and editing, and convenient communication with others,” the study goes on to say.\nBloggers are in control of the interpersonal conversation online. Teenagers can modify their thoughts and decide if they would like their blog to be open to other peoples’ posts. The interpersonal sharing with others helps teens reduce their social stress.\n“The virtual environment gives [teens] a feeling of privacy and a sense of protection from exposure[…]or physical contact,” the study says, “which might be threatening in face-to-face encounters.” Bloggers can hide personal information from family and friends, but can engage in conversations with strangers who can give them advice.\nGenerally, teens are confident sharing their feelings online due to the anonymity and invisibility of the internet. Instead of seeing others’ reactions by sharing their problems publicly, they can focus on the content.\xa0 Because of this, blogging is a bigger release for teenagers.\nIn the study, a total of 161 teens participated, with 124 girls and 37 boys. They were asked to rate themselves by their level of self-esteem, peer relationship, and interpersonal activities. During the study, experts evaluated “the participants’ social–emotional condition” by reading their blog posts.\nIn total, participants were\xa0rated on 30 posts. The first and second group posted messages in their blogs on “their thoughts and feelings concerning their social\xa0circumstances and interpersonal relationships.” The first group opened their blog to others, the second did not. The third and fourth groups wrote “about any subject they wished.” The third group opened their blog to the public where the fourth group\xa0did not. To balance the study, a fifth group served as a control by writing entries in their personal diaries.\nUnlike diarists, the study shows that, “online writers describe their writing process as a dynamic dialogue.”\nBlogs and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter combine public and private worlds. Writers can construct identities online. By constructing their own identity, teens can manage the intimate details they choose to share or withhold from others.\nBloggers, the researchers imply, are in control even if their situation is spiralling out of control-—a comforting thought whenever a blog is updated.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \ningredients\n3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes\n1/3 cup diced celery\n1/3 cup finely chopped onion\n3/4 cup diced cooked ham\n3 1/4 cups water\n2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules\n1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste\n1 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or\nto taste\n5 tablespoons butter\n5 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n2 cups milk\npreparation\nMix the onions, celery, potatoes, water, and ham in a stockpot.

Eke.\nNo one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.\nWhat parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.\nRoom 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.\nFrom the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.\nThe campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.\nHer pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off. \xa0Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.\nShe heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”\n“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”\n“No, she never goes anywhere.”\n“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”\n“Did you notice in English lecture…?”\nEke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.\n“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.\nShe blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.\nDuring her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.\n“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.\n“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”\nAt six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.\nHis arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.\nEke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.\nJoining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.\nBut this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.\n“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.\nWith her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.\n“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.\nHer hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.\nKnock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.\nThe door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.\n“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”\n“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.\n“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.\n“Do I know you, girl?” he said.\nShe grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nKezia-Danielle Weerasooriya\nContributor\n\nCozy contentment seeps through\xa0the night as cars slosh along the slick streets. Mom sits at the dining room table with a phone pressed to one of her large ears. She runs through a list of birthday guests, talking loudly in her overexcited Filipino way. The warm wind flutters the blinds and the smell of cassava cake drifts under my nose. The TV blares from the living room. My eight-year-old sister Naomi—Ate, meaning big sister in Tagalog—makes arts and crafts upstairs. I play with my sister Jillian, who will turn three tomorrow, May 20. I will turn seven in October.\nTogether, we created a game we call “Rocketship.” I lie on my back with my arms and legs in the air, bent at strange angles, like a dead beetle. Jill clambers onto my shins, pressing her feet against mine and holding my hands for balance. Her long, thick hair tickles my arms. Her small hands are squishy and her brown eyes are bright.\n“One, two, three!” I say, and catapult her off of me onto the green and white linoleum. She lands clumsily on her bum.\n“Again!” Jill beams, her teeny teeth gleaming. She climbs onto the launch pad and prepares for blast off. I count.\n“It should be backwards,” she says matter-of-factly.\n“Yeah, okay. But that means you should be backwards, too,” I say. This time I hold her feet and she holds mine. “Ready? Three, two, one!”\nThis repeats for a while, but then Mom’s patience runs out. She slams her hand over the receiver and turns to us, her sleek black hair flying.\n“Kezia! Es-stop making noise! I am on da pone! Go up stair!”\n“Okay Mommy. Cuddle time for-a-miiiiNUTE!” Jill sings, throwing her arms around Mom.\n“Sandwich!” I screech, falling on top of Jill. I poke the mole in Mom’s eyebrow. Mom pats us both.\n“Now go get ready por bed!” she says.\nJill and I pivot and bolt out of the kitchen, streaking through the dim living room between the huge TV and a dozing Dad. His moustache quivers. We galumph up the grey-carpeted stairs on all fours like dogs. The china cabinet rattles. We enter my room and flop onto my small bed, which creaks and groans under the weight of two bodies. Posters of puppies cover my walls. I shift aside a heap of blankies and stuffed animals and lie down in the dead beetle position. Then I fling Jill off my legs and she soars through the air before she lands on her knees at the foot of my bed. She throws her hands out in front of her, her face dangerously close to the rails. My purple Doodle Bear fixes her with its button-eyed stare.\n“Wait!” I say.

This time, I hurl her off of me as hard as I can.\nTime slows down.\nThe pillow shifts.\nAnd then red spurts everywhere.\nI lock eyes with Jill, her sweet face pale and contorted and covered in blood.

Blood gushes from a gap in Jill’s mouth where three of her top front teeth had been. Tears form in Mom’s eyes as she grips fistfuls of her hair and screams. She steers Jill out of the room. As if I’m sleepwalking, I shuffle down the hall after them. Dad strides into the bathroom to help clean Jill up.\nMy vision blackens and blurs as I watch the sink water turn pink. Mom lets out high-pitched, hysterical sobs. Her hands tremble as she moves around the cramped bathroom. Jill fidgets. Dad keeps his calloused brown hands steady as he slumps over Jill.\nHe wipes the smears of red from Jill’s face and puts rolls of gauze in her mouth.

It’s nine o’clock at night and we’re going to da hospital,” Mom rages to Dad.\nI hobble back to my room and sit on the edge of my bed, dizzy and clammy and shaking. Mom follows me. She screams and scolds with unintelligible words, and I cower. Tears slip silently down my cheeks. Flecks of red splotch my Doodle Bear, complementing the blue scribbles.\nFor a long time afterwards, the three black X’s in Jill’s gums haunt me every time she smiles.

A shot was fired inside an apartment residence on Assiniboine Road, and fortunately, the grad student inside was unharmed.\nWhat bothers me is the lack of security we have in our community. For a campus of almost 65,000—a population big enough to rival small towns—we don’t have a police department on site.\nYorkton, a tiny city located in east-central Saskatchewan with a population of roughly 17,200, has a better source of protection than students here; they have the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) nearby. It’s honestly surprising that York doesn’t have a detachment of Toronto police, given our notoriously problematic location near Jane and Finch.\nWith an active police force on campus, we would surely see a dip in crime. I acknowledge that we have the York security patrolling the entire community alone, but they cannot do this alone. With the added extension site of Toronto police, they would offer far more presence to our community.\nLet’s face it, we’re basically a city with a shopping mall, but even in my hometown of Mississauga, we have a police station—it’s located within the shopping centre of Meadowvale. Then there’s another two in the area to boot. So why can’t our community benefit from another form of protection?\nWe have the emergency towers dotting the campus and York security, and if we don’t have Batman or any similar vigilante, we should most definitely have a Toronto police branch on site.\nI don’t fear many things, but as an individual incapable of stopping bullets with my face, I have to come to terms with the fact that I’m going to fear a person with a 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Unless York offers bulletproof vests to students with our tuition, I regretfully fear that without vigilantes or armed security, our rather large community will continue to suffer through its ongoing trend of crime.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJack Hostrawser\nLouis realized he was staring. His\xa0gaze drifted through the bent spider web in the windshield, down the hood, and off into the twinkling embers on the plains below. Over the lake, another anvil flickered silently and the sun seemed to shear off the air itself. Calvin was down there, watching the coverage of his dad on TV. Louis had done a bad thing and now his son and the rest of the city were learning of it in high definition, with surround sound. Far away, his story was\ninterrupting sitcoms.\n“Now what?” he said, for the sound of it. Aluminum and iron, injectors and water pumps, all ticked and cooled beneath deep, dented green. Nothing. Nothing to say, nothing worth saying. He sat and wondered in his car on that tarmac ledge between the caves of damp coniferous and the vast potential below. He couldn’t stay here; he was prey. He’d ditched a chopper, for Christ’s sake. No one ditched the chopper.\nThe road hugged the edge of the escarpment, damming up the heavy moss of the forest. The moaning trees twisted in the grip of the cold front, pushing the storms east. A dandelion seed barrelled in through the window and settled on the dashboard. It probably wanted an autograph.\nSoon he realized that he needed to piss. He might have held it all day—he hadn’t been paying attention. He slithered from the car, his cartilage creaking as the rear strut did. The sheet metal there deflected inwards to conjure police-issue ram bars. He tried to cross the wire fence that girdled the ditch but it was loose with age and wavered as he stood\non it. He imagined falling and shooting himself and the image brought hints of irony to his mouth.\nHe’d never owned a pistol, and he was wary of it. He also noted that wedging it in the front of his pants was probably not helping, but it stayed.\nLeaping, he pushed his foot into the post and it crumbled under his soles. He started to swear then hit the ground hard. Finishing the curse and tossing in several others, he brushed the mud and needles from his hands, revealing the fine wisps of scarlet meteors across the butt of his palm. The throbbing pain along his side persisted but he repressed it, breathing deep to pull in the howl of the wind and chill the blood that wept from his hand, stigmata of an unconvincing Christ.\nHe moved into the forest until the rush of it surrounded him. If the car were spotted, he at least wouldn’t be caught with his fly down. By now, the warmth of his body had begun to flow back into the grip of the pistol and the metal seemed to fuse with skin until he pulled it out to avoid shooting his dick off.\nAs the sodden evening shivered, he loitered. The smells of exhaust, gunsmoke, and blood were gone from his nose but they were dusted across his brain. And suddenly he was strolling in the woods.\nSitting on a dry log, he thought about smiling and stared some more. The storm had saved him\nearlier. Lucky break. Now the humid air chilled him and drew his thoughts to warmer places. He thought about shooting himself, for prudence’s sake. There wasn’t really a choice but he held up the gun anyway, taking it in his hand and cycling the action. The unused bullet flew silently into the moss. As he levelled the sights, the setting sun risked a glance through the ragged clouds and dripping leaves, igniting the crooked birch and forging little diamonds on its paper dress. Fate, babe. Bang.\nThere were holes in the back of the Mustang. Little ones where the patrolman had aimed. He doubted that it was protocol to open fire during high-speed pursuits, but the holes had no comment.

In fact, half of those students were taking extra years to finish their studies.\nSome York students, like sixth-year theatre and English student Garett Oliver, disagreed with the idea of a three-year undergraduate degree program, saying that the quality of education would only suffer as a result.\n“That hasn’t really worked in the past,” he says. “They did it with high school by removing grade 13. It’s looking at it more as getting a piece of paper with your name on it saying whatever program you’re in rather than actually learning something, which should be the function of post-secondary education.”\nOn the other hand, several students commented in favour of\xa0a condensed three-year undergraduate program, saying they would rather jump-start their careers and save some cash on the way.\n“It would be done faster. I can get out of here and start my career. I’m a musician,” says Cecile Eugene, a third-year music major. “As soon as I’m done, I can get on the road and tour. But because it’s a four-year program, I have to stay here for four years instead of three. Plus, all these extra courses\xa0I have to take—like humanities and social science—won’t help me be a musician.”\nSome students have actually seen how the three-year programs work overseas, and are quite taken to the idea. Venessa Lao, a second-year accounting student, sees the move as a good thing for students. She says that in countries like Australia, a lot of her friends finish\xa0their studies abroad in three years.\n\xa0“It would be a benefit for students financially,” she says. “I have friends who are basically taking loans that they have to pay off the minute they graduate.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nBut who ended up with the harder job?\nHufsa\xa0Tahir\nStaff Writer\n @excalweb\nPresident Mamdouh Shoukri swapped his suit and tie for a letterman jacket and backpack, joining the throngs of students on the Square One GO bus to York. This day marked York’s—and Canada’s—first-ever President for a Day event.\nThe lucky York student who won a day in Shoukri’s presidential seat is Rabia Sajun, a third-year biochemistry and education student whose winning contest entry included three ideas for improving student life: expanding Steacie Library, reducing class sizes, and enhancing campus safety.\n“It’s been super busy,” Sajun describes her day. “I’ve been in a lot of meetings. I met vp Rob Tiffin about disability. I’m interested in accessibility services for all students. I met vp Brewer about campus safety.”\nShe also talked to vp academic and provost Patrick Monahan about class sizes, and about improving student engagement in classrooms.\nWhile Sajun sat through several meetings, Shoukri spent his day in a lecture on molecular biology and in a physics lab. Sajun serves as the co-president of the Chemistry Society, and Shoukri sat in for her office hours, selling students old lecture notes and professor-approved sample copies of old tests for $15 a packet.\n“I’ve had a chance to talk to students there, learn more about the university and about their concerns,” he says.\nThe one negative of the day for Shoukri, however, was when he visited a very crowded Student Centre for lunch. The lineup for the microwaves especially dismayed him.\n“I wouldn’t do that if I was a student. I’d give up on warm food,” he remarks. “To be honest, maybe building a new Student Centre will take time, but doing something about the microwaves should not.”\nFor Shoukri, the event was a way of engaging with the student population, something that he didn’t expect would happen on such a high level.\n“Fact is, I walk through campus all the time and talk to lot of students,” says Shoukri. “But they want to talk to me more now, probably because I’m not wearing a suit, I’m wearing this—” he gestured to his letterman jacket—“They’re probably more comfortable seeing me trying to reach out to them.”\nSajun highly approves of the President for a Day campaign and believes it should be a recurring event.\n“I think this idea was a really interesting experience to get a behind-the-scenes look into what is involved in implementing something,” she says. “The admin is doing its best to better student life, and this gives students a better behind-the-scenes look.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n“There’s been a terrific increase in interest this year” -McMillan\nJacqueline\xa0Perlin\nAssistant News Editor\n@jackieperlin\nThe world-famous TEDx talks are about to begin their second round at York.\nThe Technology, Entertainment, and Design (TED) Conference is set to take place March 10 at York’s Glendon campus.\nThe talks are part of a number of globally-occurring conferences that are owned by the private not-for-profit Sapling Foundation, which began in 1984 and aims at addressing a number of issues within science and culture.\n“There’s been a terrific increase in interest this year,” says Ross McMillan, one of the co-curators of the event.\nMcMillan adds that the event has already received many more applications from students eager to participate in the talks than the 100 spots available.\nSome of the speakers set to present at York include a student talking about her research on domestic violence and aboriginal women, and a York vice-president presenting his take on how universities are changing to meet the demands of the future. Past presenters in the talks include figures such as Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, though they were not at York campus.\nAll speeches fall within the overall theme of this year’s conference, “Impact Matters.” Speakers are encouraged to highlight their stories about making differences in their communities.\nRoss calls the event a “one day symposium,” where participants will spend the entire day listening to the twelve speakers and watching two performances.\n“It’s really a cross-section of the York community,” says McMillan, who notes that organizers are looking to cultivate an audience from all walks of life that can not only attend, but also engage in talks with other participants who they would not normally interact with.\nThe last day to send in an application is February 29.

For her, the actions of the university are impeding upon the negotiation process causing no agreements on key proposals.\n“Without this leverage, we are concerned that the Employer will continue to stall through conciliation, talking in circles while our contracts continue to be eroded by inflation,” states the update. “Rather, the Employer’s stance remains unchanged: reduce your\xa0demands to fi t within our financial mandate and maybe then we can talk on some of these issues,” it continues.\nRobert Castle, senior advisor\xa0to vp fi nance and administration,\xa0is adamant that the university is\xa0doing everything in its power to\xa0reach an agreement with the union\xa0and says that negotiations thus far\xa0have been positive.\n“We’ve had good work done\xa0with the union,” he says.\nCastle notes that the university\xa0received over 170 proposals from\xa0the union in November of last\xa0year, so it is only reasonable that\xa0the process is taking time.\n“There’s been a lot of work done\xa0through our negotiations […] it’s\xa0hard to see how we’re not taking\xa0this situation seriously,” he says.\nCastle also says the university is\xa0pleased to go into the conciliation\xa0process.\n“We’re perfectly happy going\xa0into conciliation and we don’t\xa0see the conciliator as leveraging\xa0for either party. It’s a third party\xa0independent voice to help us to\xa0get to an agreement,” he says,\xa0adding that the university does in\xa0fact expect a detailed review and\xa0discussion of all the proposals.\nOnce a conciliator is appointed\xa0by the Ministry, the individual will\xa0reach out to both parties to continue\xa0with the negotiation process.\xa0Nevertheless, CUPE says that\xa0having a strike mandate does not\xa0mean that the union will strike.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/arts/2012/02/29/the-professor/'],"['Damian Mangat\nStaff writer\nShe could blame her name, her first name. Eke.\nNo one in residence pronounced it properly, neither did the modern professors who bothered with attendance. Her surname was not worth claiming, another Singh. There were Singhs from all over the continent, from the Tamils in Singapore, to the Hindus in Sri Lanka, to the Buddhists in Bengal. The northern Punjabis affixed it to every boy child. Though her ancestry blended all three, Eke disliked her Northern mother’s long ropey plaits and her Southern father’s oily complexion. Thankfully, her only Indian features were the olive skin, bluish lips, and downy sideburns. She could be anybody. Italian? Persian? Native American? Despite the parrot nose, pronounced lower jaw, and pouchy eyes, she felt as multi-textured as her thoughts. But it was her name, her first name, that shunned her.\nWhat parents would name a girl Eke, meaning “matchless” and “alone?” Did it also mean insignificant? The philomancers, necromancers, and astrologers in her parents’ village, who mapped out her destiny on the Vedic birth chart, must have misread the stars and constellations when they picked her name. And because of that rash cosmic fortunetelling, her parents had grimly determined to marry her off as young as possible like the generations preceding her, in some laughable ceremony of fire, water, wind, and earth. But there was no time to sneer at cultural norms when her parents booked Air India tickets and scrutinized snapshots of pimply boys readying immigration documents. That was why she had run away to university and locked herself up in any residence that would accept her.\nRoom 204B, a cramped boxy space on the second floor of the co-ed dormitory, was meant to manifest freedom—away from the Masourri silk curtains, the elephant brocaded bedspread, and the brass statues of winged monkeys. Yes, she had disowned the baby pink walls along with the matchmaker’s photographs.\nFrom the small window bitten into the wall above her desk, she could see the grey campus, cold and dark with the metaphysical confusion of February. Students in twos and threes shuffled under the weight of their backpacks. Grad students paced the steps to the Student Centre, shivering, puffing Belmont Lights, reddening and slashed by the cyclone of dust tailing the wind. Through the smudged windows of the coffee shop across the walkway, she could make out steam rising from porcelain cups cradled between brightly-coloured finger nails, upended laptops, a couple reaching across a grimy table to peck at the crumbs on their lover’s hands. She had never felt so alone.\nThe campus was only a 45-minute drive from her parents’ residence, but for her, it was an exodus. She would find friends (she had not been allowed before), she would meet a boy (she had been too frightened to dial their cell numbers before), she would become a woman (she had not been permitted to shave her legs before). Someone, anyone, would single her out, recognize the truth behind her name, break through her solitary confinement, and hold her hand for the first time.\nHer pen slipped between her stubby fingers, bounced off her thigh, and bled ink into her stockinged feet. The control top pantyhose bit into her stomach as she bent to retrieve it. The university logo was already half worn off. \xa0Light drifted in beneath the doorjamb stuccoed by sneakered feet. The usual Thursday night stampede of first-year students sent tremors along the floorboards. They howled, they hollered, they roared with jokes she could not understand. Boys chased screeching girls up and down the hall. Beer bottles clinked together.\nShe heard a rustling outside her. She felt her eyelids quiver and thought of her namesake Aunty Eenakshi, meaning “with eyes of a deer.”\n“Should we invite Elka or whatever her name is?”\n“No, she never goes anywhere.”\n“Besides, she smells kinda funny.”\n“Did you notice in English lecture…?”\nEke chewed her biro. More letters of the university logo came away between her teeth. The nib bore into her wide, gaped gums. The bearish, podgy hands, which she always hid in her pockets, slammed the books shut.\n“English,” she thought wistfully. She felt a movement in her chest, as though a trapped animal had been disturbed. She glanced at the clock that hummed and buzzed and jerked the hours apart.\nShe blinked, and darkness fell like a second. She felt her pulse quicken as she plumped her thighs onto the chair and shifted forward until she was nose to nose with the glass. She breathed hot onto her fist and wiped the window in circular motions. Her loneliness vibrated within the walls and door frame and loped ceiling that refracted the jumpy music invading the halls with beats of hip hop. Her pupils dilated as she focused in on the third storey, fourth window from the left of the English literature department—his office. Her breathing eased. She waited for the light to flicker on and for Professor Simpson’s silhouette to frame the iridescent back splash. He would, she knew, tug at his collar, roll up his checkered shirt sleeves, remove his spectacles, polish them on his alpaca vest, and place them anew on the bridge of his nose.\nDuring her vigils over the semester, she had memorized his patterns like a diligent Indian wife (which she would never be)—his regal procession to the podium, his measured inventory of the first three rows, his eloquent voice that boomed into her tape recorder. Discreetly, she began to chew at her stubby nails, emotion welling, rolling upon his intonation and the stimulation of his poetic discourse.\n“He won the Nobel Prize for literature in ‘71,” lectured Professor Simpson. “And Neruda, in his Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, captures the significance of Dante’s Tuscan poetry. Despair and passionate love are motifs in my writing. As a Chilean half-breed myself, perhaps I share the ebullience of this illustrious poet.” He cleared his throat.\n“I do not love you as if you were sal-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,” he recited. “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.”\nAt six o’clock, Professor Simpson—Jack Simpson—took possession of his office on the third story of the English Literature Department. Upon unlocking, locking, and double-checking the door, he fumbled for the gooseneck desk lamp. He took off his spectacles and wiped them on his faded Harvard tie. He checked his vintage Waltham pocket watch, a decent copy from Chinatown. In 25 minutes he would swallow a glass of Aberlour Scotch from the bottle secured in the torn lining of his briefcase.\nHis arthritic joints cracked as he eased into his chair. He slid a Saint Luis Rey Rothchilde cigar ($2.12 at the on-campus Korean convenience store) out of its cellophane glove and fit it into the corner of his wrinkled mouth, smoothed a wisp of white hair across his balding scalp, and whistled through his nostrils. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach—all the music a doctor of English literature should know. Wind burst from his body. His stomach rumbled. He began to contemplate roast beef and then Neruda.\nEke gazed at him night after night. Last week, when Professor Simpson scrawled “GOOD” across her essay, she was determined to approach him.\nJoining the line-up around the podium, she searched frantically for something clever to say. The line jerked forward. She inhaled, and inhaled, and inhaled, hoping for a whiff of his scent. Musk, oak, sandalwood, leather, milky darjeeling, and maybe scotch emanated from his tie. As her turn approached, she wobbled on her ballerina slippers, as dizzy as though she were standing at the top of the forty steps leading down into the lecture hall. Turning on her heels, she stumbled towards the exit sign and rushed through the double doors into the smack of wind.\nBut this night, a week later, something inside her felt different. The clock read 8:24. In another 36 minutes, Professor Simpson would adjust his tie, smooth down his tweed blazer, and stroll out to the taxi stand. Tonight she needed him to stay longer. The thought of the small room with its small desk and its small bed and her big thoughts propelled her from her chair. She dropped onto her knees, tearing a gap in her stockings, and reached under the bed for her poetry journal.\n“Jack” had inspired them all. Sure, some students made fun of him, “the old bag,” “he looks like a bobble head,” “if his belly gets any bigger he’s going to topple off the podium.” And every time, with private vengeance, she narrowed her eyes and “accidentally” bumped shoulders with the offender while exiting the lecture.\nWith her notebook of love poems tucked under her arm, she dashed through the double doors—different ones this time leading in, not out—and raced up the steps, double quick, her fingers barely making contact with the rail. Within five minutes, she stood outside his door. The lamplight wafted outwards into the empty corridor. She ground her teeth with determination.\n“Jack,” she practiced, and this time, the word tasted solid.\nHer hand on the door knob, she paused for a break in the rhythm of his hum, and prayed to the deities that she might recognize the tune. Surely he would be impressed if she started with: “Jack, I heard you humming Beethoven’s fifth concerto.” She imagined his surprise. His pink eyelids would quiver, he would lift his chin, and he would gesture to the chair closest to him. She would seat herself demurely, lean foreword, and pass him the notebook. Their hands would come in contact, and finally she would experience the sensation of his skin, dry and flaky certainly, but also soft and pliable. And while he was reading “My love is the dark” and “Loneliness unbound” and “Cupid’s neglect,” she would inconspicuously hitch up her skirt to reveal the heavy but luxuriously strong and youthful thighs that were the only self-respecting part of her body.\nKnock, knock. She aimed her fist at the centre of the wooden frame, knowing he was slightly deaf in one ear. The humming stopped. He cleared his throat. Silence. She knocked again. She could hear the chair shifting under his weight, then a groan, then a sort of internal rumbling.\nThe door opened and the light shattered the dim silence of the hallway. His eyes crinkled as he tried to adjust from light to dark, looking over the brown girl’s head as was his habit with his students.\n“Jack…” her voice had lost its power again, reduced to a whisper, deafened by the creaking floorboards and the rattling of water pipes from the adjacent men’s room. “Mr. Simpson…”\n“Oh…” he growled under his breath. He could not recognize the chubby brown girl that stood in his doorway. He cleared his throat, a deep rumbling sound, and the girl seemed to shrink and lose twenty pounds right before his very eyes. She spoke.\n“I was wondering if you’d, umm, well, I thought you might, after today, with Neruda and everything, how inspiring your lecture was, well maybe, you could look at some I wrote, I mean poems…” She trailed off mid-sentence because of the way his eyes, even disoriented behind his spectacles, began to narrow. He thumbed at his tie. She had never noticed how threadbare it was, how the crimson had faded. She had never noticed how spidery red veins broke out on the ridge of his nose. His nostrils flared open, little white hairs trembling with each inhalation. The smell of mothballs, his pockmarked skin, his bushy eyebrows—she noticed them all. She hesitated, the notebook hovering there between them.\n“Do I know you, girl?” he said.\nShe grinned foolishly for the first time all semester. A sudden lightness overcame her. She spun around smoothly on her ballerina slippers, caked with mud and snow, and strutted back down the hall from where she had come. She reached for the banister but then drew back. She no longer needed its support. As she burst upon it, the cold night air seemed less formidable. Her thighs prickled under her stockinged hose, but for once she did not care. She did not think to hide her podgy hands in her pocket but swung them military style. She began to whistle a sharp, high tune that was not Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.\n ']"

It was going to ask, considering it’s the year 2013, is feminism still even necessary?\nBut I noticed a pattern when the first drafts of the articles started coming in.\nI realized they were all about questioning what a woman was, and what a woman was supposed to be. The stories examined the expectations society sets for women, and the expectations we set for ourselves—the ones that tell us we should be thin but curvy, ladylike but sexy, career-oriented but dedicated mothers, smart but not too smart; certainly not smarter than men.\nThe stories in this supplement challenge these assumptions. Some of them feature women testing the boundaries of what is considered appropriate “feminine” behaviour, and others are about women pushing back at these boundaries when they get in their way.\nSo that is where the theme, “De/constructing Feminism,” comes from. It means both taking apart what a woman is supposed to be, while simultaneously constructing new, diverse images and ideas about women.\nI’ve thought a lot about what I want to achieve with this supplement. And the truth is, I don’t want to make some grand statement on feminism or offer a sweeping solution to any of the questions mentioned above.\nWhat I want is for people, women and men, to ask questions. I want to inspire a dialogue that questions what it means to be a woman in today’s society, and if one singular meaning is even possible.\nAnd I want people to question the boundaries and rules set for us—that govern the way we should dress, the way we should speak, the way we should act, what things we should like, and even in what fields we should work, and for how long.\nBecause that’s the thing about boundaries. Once you know where they are, they become easier to cross. So, happy crossing.\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nVanessa Del Carpio, Women’s Supplement Coordinator\nIn the supplement, look for:\nToys without boys\nIn defense of fashionistas\nEverything means yes: consent in the media\nPublic action continues for gang rape victim in India\nSpelling out the sex trade\nA lesson on inequality\nGirly-girl power\nYou are what you write\nThis is what a filmmaker looks like\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\nWhile most stag shops are designed to service the needs of men, Good For Her finds its niche with female customers\n“[As a young girl], even though I was thin and white, I didn’t see anyone in the media that looked like me,” says Carlyle Jansen, owner and founder of Toronto’s leading female-friendly sex shop, Good For Her, located at Bathurst and Harbord Streets.\nJansen felt she never looked good in long hair or girly clothes, so she compensated by wearing loose clothing, to hide her body, and cut her hair short.\nLike many girls in their teens, the now exuberant Jansen not only felt uncomfortable with her body, but her sexuality as well. When she went through puberty, she found the thought of sex so repugnant she postponed engaging in sexual intercourse until her early 20s.\xa0 Even then, she says her discomfort never dissipated, and throughout the course of her sexual exploration, she found she could not reach orgasm with any of her partners.\nDestitute and beleaguered, there seemed to be no solution for her sexual ineptitude. At age 28, she reached rock bottom when her then-boyfriend left her because she could not have an orgasm. But Jansen saw this moment as a calling that sex no longer be merely a complex assortment of gestural rhetoric.\nSoon after, Jansen began to educate herself in the art of sex. Through workshops, literature, sex toys, and self-exploration, she became the guru of self-love, and found that she could reach climax with the aid of sex toys.\nDuring her sister’s bridal shower, she taught her sister’s friends the mechanics of sex toys. Jansen says at that moment, she realized there were a multitude of women like her, who felt so uncomfortable with expressing their sexuality that they suppressed their desires, and became completely ignorant of all the possibilities of their sexuality.\nIn 1997, Jansen recognized this untapped market and decided to promote sexual education for women through the creation of her very own sex shop.\nDesigned to promote comfort and openness for its female customers, the shop resembles a humble home. Besides having a selection of sex toys that cater to every need, from 15-inch dildos to nipple stimulators that resemble mini-serrated pizza cutters, the shop also holds workshops for a variety of subjects, from learning how to talk dirty to how to give erotic massages.\nJansen also mentions that they have women and trans-only hours, from 12 to 5 p.m. on Sundays because female customers often feel uncomfortable buying products in the presence of men.\n“As a women and trans-friendly shop, it is a key resource for people exploring their sexuality. It’s a non-judgmental space,” says Michael Jackman, a sixth-year media and sexuality student and PhD candidate.\n“Most sex-shops are geared towards men and are not inviting for women. But Good for Her provides that space where women feel safe.”\nWhen asked what the source of this discomfort is, Jansen says from a young age women are socialized into thinking sex is immoral and their genitals are ugly. When it comes to intercourse, she says women often feel guilty about asking for what they want in bed and that they are boring their partners.\nJansen believes all the pressures placed on women to be successful, look perfect, and be good mothers, partners, and daughters can cause women to shut down sexually, and consciously stop thinking about things like being good lovers because they’re so busy trying to be everything else.\nJansen says many of these unrealistic pressures experienced by women are visible in mainstream pornography because the actresses all fit into a single mold—thin, hairless, white, large-breasted—and are capable of reaching orgasm within minutes. Also, much of the sex in these movies is tailored to the service of men, while the focus on authentic female pleasure is very minimal.\nAs a proprietor solely interested in the sexual education of women, the inclusion of mainstream porn in her shop would be extremely detrimental because it homogenizes female desires, promotes violence against women, and centralizes the penis. Jansen argues that ultimately, mainstream porn fails on every level as an educational tool.\nSixteen years ago, she says there was not a lot to choose from in the market of female-friendly porn. As the industry grew, however, Jensen says the production of porn was no longer an elitist practice, and more and more marginalized groups like women and transsexuals began making their own porn.\nThe feminist porn offered in the shop depicts genuine female pleasure, agency, and desire. It celebrates the plurality (ethnicity, sexual orientation, body type, and age) of all women, and operates mainly through an anti-oppressive framework. But most importantly, it promotes the equal treatment of women, as well as safe sex practices.\nA few years ago, Jansen even decided to create an event to award these female-friendly porn stars, directors, and producers.\nDubbed the Feminist Porn Awards, the event garnered so much attention from a variety of workers in the industry that it spawned a recurring annual celebration for female, race, gay, lesbian, transsexual, and inter-sexual-friendly porn.\nHeading into its eighth year, the event has grown substantially, spanning two days: the first day, a showcase of directors’ work at Bloor Cinema, and the second, the gala award ceremony.\nApart from the Feminist Porn Awards, Jansen also intends on participating in Vajanuary, the female equivalent for Movember, which requires that one’s pubic hair not be shaven until the end of the month, with the proceeds going to towards charity.\nThough the war for recognizing sexual equality and education for women is not one that can be won overnight, Jansen believes that her utopia is attainable.\nThe key to this empowerment, says Jansen, is “celebrating your body and desires as they are, not comparing yourself with other women, educating yourself, accepting who you are, and not trying to make yourself like everyone else.”\nRajin Patel, Staff Writer\n\nWhile most stag shops are designed to service the needs of men, Good For Her finds its niche with female customers\n“[As a young girl], even though I was thin and white, I didn’t see anyone in the media that looked like me,” says Carlyle Jansen, owner and founder of Toronto’s leading female-friendly sex shop, Good For Her, located at Bathurst and Harbord Streets.\nJansen felt she never looked good in long hair or girly clothes, so she compensated by wearing loose clothing, to hide her body, and cut her hair short.\nLike many girls in their teens, the now exuberant Jansen not only felt uncomfortable with her body, but her sexuality as well.

You go to your closet and you select… I don’t know… that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. That blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs, and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff.”\nHer words are certainly true in today’s world. But while fashion has the ability to destroy a woman’s self-esteem, it can also empower her.\nThe relationship between feminism and fashion has been, and still is, a tumultuous one. During the second wave of feminism, the New York Radical Women’s group protested at the 1968 Miss America Pageant and tossed items associated with femininity—high heels, false eyelashes, makeup, tweezers, curlers, girdles, fashion and beauty magazines, corsets and bras—into the “Freedom Trash Can.”\nIt is difficult to argue against critics who say the fashion industry objectifies women and upholds beauty standards unattainable for the average woman. The industry sends messages that influence us, telling us how we should value ourselves and determine our self-worth. Instead of valuing ourselves based on our accomplishments, intelligence, and personal strengths, we are instead told that our self-worth is measured by our material possessions.\nIn the case of fashion, it’s what or who you are wearing. Women are continually pressured to contribute to this vicious cycle and wear the latest trends. We are told we need to own that glamorous $2,000 Chanel handbag most can’t afford.\nBut fashion touches the lives of women every single day. The argument of being “anti-fashion” for anyone, feminist or not, would be hard to support.\nConsider this: fashion is integral to society; we make decisions about what clothes to wear every single day. A person generally wears six to 10 articles of clothing a day, not including accessories. This forces women to make a choice every day. We can either choose not to care what we look like, which some don’t, or we can choose to conform to what the industry standards are, which most of us do.\nWomen have the ability to use fashion to their advantage and reclaim it as a form of empowerment, and not destruction. We can use it as a form of resistance against the socially constructed norms that dictate the “proper” way to dress.\nFashion should be used creatively and as a form of self-expression. If there was no fashion industry, we would not have any diversity. We most likely would have to conform to wear the same things, and who likes conformity? How boring.\nFashion is also another form of communication; we use it to communicate our personality, mood, beliefs, social or political views, and cultures.\nUltimately, fashion is a personal choice. Feminist or not, it is a powerful tool that has yet to be used to its full potential.\nBut in order for women to use fashion for social change, we must first change among ourselves. We have become too critical of one another, especially when it comes to what we wear. Instead, we should rise up to encourage and support women who go against fashion norms.\nWhether you love fashion or don’t, whether you love to wear sneakers or eight-inch heels, whether you like to show a little more skin or enjoy covering up, fashion should not be used as means by which women judge each other. No woman should feel as if she is setting back feminism if she loves fashion,\nAs Minh Ha T. Pham wrote in the January issue of Ms., a feminist magazine, “If feminists ignore fashion, we are ceding our power to influence it.”\nOlivia Chandler, Contributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nFilm and television create ambiguous sexual expectations by not explicitly showing consent being given\n\nIn the second-season premiere of Girls, there’s a moment where one of the characters, Shoshanna, is having a dispute with her lover, Ray. It escalates. She’s walking away. He grabs her and pulls her back, forcibly kissing her. She relents. They have sex.\nThis is a question that was posited to me a few weeks ago, and has since been turning over in my head: how often is sexual consent given in film and television? And extending from whatever the probable answer is (hint: almost never), what does it mean?\nWhat’s shocking is the lack of statistical documentation about this. There hasn’t been a single study done on approach and consent in film. It’s simply there, and taken for granted, which is intensely troubling.\nI’ve been trying to think of films and shows in which a kiss is approached with consent, and I have trouble listing more than five. There are more than a few scenes I can think of that can easily be counted as rape, the aforementioned one in Girls being one of them.\nIt’s a sign of a society in which sexism has, because of the reductive processes of equality, become more subtle, an ingrained behaviour rather than an active decision, and this is one of the ways it manifests itself.\nWe’re often primed to reject violence, while love and intimacy are expected. The cues for sexual behaviour are taken from our own social learning and what we absorb from the media. This is only strengthened as we age and are fed the same concepts. From watching the Prince kiss Snow White,all the way to watching Booth Jonathan aggressively accosting Marnie in Girls, expectations develop around the way things occur, especially in the power-tipped patriarchal side.\nIt’s from these expectations that we get things like nice-guy syndrome and rape culture. For all its sophistication, mass media operates in almost storybook terms when it comes down to simple intimacy. Even worse, it normalizes the idea that not asking for consent yields positive results. It’s these small, significant ideas that are omnipresent, constantly holding back gender equality.\nAll of this comes down to the idea of responsibility in entertainment. Director Mike Figgis once said, “All films are science fiction films,” which is true, to an extent. They posit situations, scenarios, and people out of nothing, leading us to lives that, no matter how unremarkable they are, always operate on heightened levels of reality.\nBut to say that a film isn’t informed by the culture at large would be ignorant. Girls demonstrates a close-to-life aesthetic and has become something of a cultural trend-setter, both in how it speaks to the emotions of people in its target audience, and how it informs the programming that has come afterwards. It’s a show that prides itself on having realistic depictions of sex scenes. So then, why can’t it have realistic depictions of physical communication and approach?\nOf course, Girls is one piece of entertainment out of countless others that do this.

It was going to ask, considering it’s the year 2013, is feminism still even necessary?\nBut I noticed a pattern when the first drafts of the articles started coming in.\nI realized they were all about questioning what a woman was, and what a woman was supposed to be. The stories examined the expectations society sets for women, and the expectations we set for ourselves—the ones that tell us we should be thin but curvy, ladylike but sexy, career-oriented but dedicated mothers, smart but not too smart; certainly not smarter than men.\nThe stories in this supplement challenge these assumptions. Some of them feature women testing the boundaries of what is considered appropriate “feminine” behaviour, and others are about women pushing back at these boundaries when they get in their way.\nSo that is where the theme, “De/constructing Feminism,” comes from. It means both taking apart what a woman is supposed to be, while simultaneously constructing new, diverse images and ideas about women.\nI’ve thought a lot about what I want to achieve with this supplement. And the truth is, I don’t want to make some grand statement on feminism or offer a sweeping solution to any of the questions mentioned above.\nWhat I want is for people, women and men, to ask questions. I want to inspire a dialogue that questions what it means to be a woman in today’s society, and if one singular meaning is even possible.\nAnd I want people to question the boundaries and rules set for us—that govern the way we should dress, the way we should speak, the way we should act, what things we should like, and even in what fields we should work, and for how long.\nBecause that’s the thing about boundaries. Once you know where they are, they become easier to cross.

With something this season for everyone’s personal style, I’m here to give you the insider’s scoop in summer fashion so that you what to expect, stay ahead of the game and look good while doing it, too.\nFor boys who enjoy dressing a little more conservatively, the trend this summer was something functional to keep you cool, while looking fashionable with a touch of nostalgia. This look is very easy to achieve with light cotton and linen shirts.\nMany spring collections include short-sleeved button-down shirts with bright, fun, cheesy, and lovably nostalgic patterns and prints. Pair one of these breathable cotton shirts with a light t-shirt underneath and you have a versatile look for endless outdoor occasions. Linen is also the go-to look this summer for men as it is famous for being extremely light and breathable. A long-sleeve linen shirt is a great addition to any wardrobe as linen is generally sold in neutral colours that are effortless to pair with other items.\nIn terms of bottoms, the signature look of summer 2014 is denim shorts above the knee, cuffed or rolled up at the bottom. If you aren’t afraid to step a little bit out of your comfort zone, patterns and specifically floral patterns are this year’s hit for men.\nFlorals go great on pants, shirts, jackets, and everything in between. They give your outfit a non-traditional look that will surely separate you from the rest. With such a bold pattern, try to focus it more on one item at a time. If you wear a floral shirt, avoid wearing other patterns: you want the focus to be on that pattern without over-doing it. There are so many ways to wear a shirt, and they all have a different effect on your appearance.\nCrew necks and V-necks are fun and classic looks, but it’s definitely time to try something new, boys. Rolled up sleeves are a great way to emphasize your arms. The sleeve ends a tad higher than regular t-shirts, giving you an opportunity to show off some definition. A longer length t-shirt that ends a few inches lower is a unique way to emphasize your height if you are on the taller side.\nFinally, if you’re in the gym often enough to have achieved a chiseled chest, a grunge scoop t-shirt is an awesome way to show off your hard work. It’s essentially a regular crew neck t-shirt, but the neck is wider and deeper, showing off your trapezius and pectoral muscles.\nSome new trends that are (believe it or not) making a comeback are crop tops and short shorts. Sometimes boys want to show off a bit more skin and if you’re confident in yourself, you could definitely try this look out for a summer outing to a beach or pool party, barbeque, or a day in the great outdoors.\xa0Crop tops were popular in men’s fashion in the 90s, as you can see in many high school shows. The classic snapshot is the high school quarterback having a serious conversation on his pastel yellow landline phone with his big haired crush. All the while sporting a jersey cropped to the navel, showing off his core and especially giving the audience a peek at his V-lines.\nLadies, summer is a great time to experiment with new fashions. Don’t be afraid to try something different! Many companies are focusing on bringing tropical culture to chilly, old Canada this summer, and that includes brining back maxi dresses. They are a perfect addition to every closet. They are flattering to every body type, and are impeccably easy to dress up or down for any occasion.\nMost maxi dresses come in simple cotton-blend materials such as jersey, and this makes them fantastically comfortable and very easy to care for. For an effortless yet elegant look, pair a neutrally coloured maxi dress with a thin belt at the waist and matching wedges to achieve the perfect look for that beach or garden party you’ve been planning. Take that same dress and throw on a denim jacket and flashy accessories and you’re ready for those summer nights that top off the perfect summer days we are all longing for.\nIf you’re not into one-pieces, take a maxi skirt pulled up past the navel paired with a crop top for a sexier look that shows off just enough skin while keeping you cool. A lot of focus is brought to tropical prints and draping fabrics this year, and these prints are a great way to try something new. Try a light cardigan with a tropical print over a basic t-shirt and denim shorts for that Miami Beach look. Keep an eye out for fringes. Simply put, a fringe is a line of fabric with dangly strings all lined up, like the fringe of your hair.\nSheer shawls, purses, cardigans, necklaces, and even hoop earrings all seem to present opportunities for designers to add a fringe, and this is nothing but perfect. A fringe is a genius way for a designer to add movement to a piece. Any shift in position, every step will make this fringe naturally move on the garment and this looks simply amazing.\nThat being said, it seems like one of this summer’s trends for ladies is movement. Focus on wearing items that move on you, such as the famous fringe, light and sheer draping fabrics that will be picked up by the find and flutter in the breeze, patterns with lines and shapes that mesmerize an onlooker with every step you take like an optical illusion.\nAllen Simans, Contributor\nPhotos courtesy of Stylecaster, La Belle Femme, Hijabulous, Asos, Wholesale7, and AskMamaz.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe Ontario government failed to allocate any additional graduate student spaces to York over the next three years in its recent strategic mandate signing spree with colleges and universities.\nThe government had been signing agreements with Ontario’s 45 post-secondary institutions, requesting that they provide lists of 10 programs they consider their strongest and five programs they wish to expand.\nThe decision to sign the agreements, otherwise known as “strategic mandate agreements” was allegedly made to end the duplication of programs and to move towards a more specialized system.\nRegarding additional graduate student spaces, the University of Toronto will receive 580 new spots, Ryerson will receive 256, and York will receive none for the periods of 2014-2015 to 2016-2017.\nIn an article in the Toronto Star, York president and vice-chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri said he believed York was penalized in regard to graduate funding allocation because most of its current graduate students are not Canadian or permanent Canadian residents.\n“On the one hand, the government tells us to take in more international students, then they don’t count them because they don’t fund them,” said Shoukri.\nRhonda Lenton, vice-president academic and provost says it is important to note York has one of the largest graduate student\npopulations in Ontario. “We continue to advocate for recognition and funding for international students, along with our colleagues in the sector.”\nMay Nazar of the communications branch at the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities says York was not given additional graduate spaces over the three-year period because eligible graduate enrolment has been under York’s targets in recent years.\nAccording to the SMA between York and the MTCU, York was 341.18 under its target for the 2013-2014 period.\n“York University still has room for eligible graduate enrolment growth, as its current enrolment remains below the target confirmed as part of the process,” says Nazar.\nIn its SMA, York identified engineering and science, bilingual programs, arts, digital media, performance and design, business/management/administration, and healthy individuals and communities as its proposed programs for future growth.\nThe SMA also notes a medical school on the horizon for York by 2020 in its vision statement.\nNazar, however, says at this time the ministries of Health and Long-Term Care and Training, Colleges, and Universities are not predicting medical education expansion over the short and medium term.\n“We remain open to the future possibility of establishing a medical school,” says Lenton.\nLenton says in addition to\xa0focussing on York’s five designated programs, York will continue to set the foundation for a\xa0medical school.\nAshley Glovasky, News Editor\nPhoto courtesy of the government of Ontario.', ' ', 'Well, what do you expect?

Official notification was sent to Immigrant Watch Canada instructing the organization to cease and desist using York’s logo and photographs.\n“Diversity and inclusiveness are core values of York University,” says Rider.\nAccording to Jenniferjit Sidhu, a media relations officer for Toronto Police Service, they received a radio call regarding the posters on Friday, August 1. York Security also provided a copy of the poster to the police.\nAccording to Sidhu, the TPS Hate Crime Unit is reviewing the posters to confirm whether they constitute as potential hate propaganda. She also notes similarities to the posters which appeared in Brampton on April 22. However, it was determined after consultation that while the posters may be considered to be racist and offensive, they do not meet the threshold of the hate crime criteria in the Criminal Code of Canada.\n“Why would we not distribute them at York?” says Dan Murray of Immigration Watch Canada. Does York deserve some immunity from exposure to free speech? Does the material in the flyers conflict with York ideology?”\nVarious campus groups and students have spoken out regarding the offensive posters.\n“No one should be subjected to such hateful and offensive messaging on their campus or in their community,” said Mithilen Mathipalan, vice-president equity of the York Federation of Students in a press release.\n\xa0“Students deserve to live, work and study without fear of discrimination or harassment.”\n“There is absolutely no place for this at York University,” said Mathipalan.\n“We commend the administration for acting so quickly in removing these posters,” said Tamara Caplan, director of Hillel @ York.\n“Hillel embraces multiculturalism and diversity on campus, and we encourage all students to speak out with us vigorously against acts of bigotry.”\nSidhu of TPS says each appearance of the flyers is investigated separately.\n“We encourage anyone receiving these or any similar flyers to continue to report them to the police,” says Sidhu.\nNo criminal charges have been laid at this time.\nAshley Glovasky, News Editor\nPhoto courtesy of YorkU Memes.', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe launch of the Toronto-York Spadina subway extension could be further delayed due to a lawsuit filed by the TTC against the contractor of Vaughan’s subway station.\nThe $10-million lawsuit argues that the contractor, Arup Canada failed to meet scheduled dead-lines, use “skilled, competent staff,” and to meet building and electrical codes.\nIt’s currently unknown if this alleged breach-of-contract will affect the current date of completion, and which subway sites will be impacted.\nAlthough Andy Byford, TTC CEO, would not comment on the lawsuit to various media outlets, he said the plan to open the line remains set for late fall 2016.\n“We do know that is going to be a challenge at a number of the sites. My project team is working with the contractors to see what’s possible,” said Byford in a CBC article.\nAccording to Brad Ross, executive director of corporate communications for the TTC, lawsuits like this one against Arup Canada are common.\n\xa0“We have many contracts that we take action against to protect our interests, so this is not an unusual thing,” he says.\nIn an article to The National Post, Byford also revealed that the timeframe of the expansion has been difficult since the beginning.\nThe line extension has already been delayed once, as the completion was originally set for December 2015.\nThe TTC blamed this delay on contractor performance and the amount of time spent on obtaining funding approvals. The blame has also been placed on the time it took for the contractor to reach an agreement on station designs, extensive work needed to relocate utilities, and the death of a construction worker at the York construction site in October 2011.\nFor the time being, it is unknown if the project will be delayed further due to the lawsuit. The TTC maintains it is working to avoid this.\n“I have no information to suggest that the project will be delayed because of this,” says Ross.\nAndrew McAlpine, principal of Arup Canada, says the lawsuit is general in nature and was filed over six months ago.\n“While we are responding in due course, we remain confident of an amicable resolution and continue to keep our focus on delivering a successful project.”\nAshley Glovasky, News Editor\nPhoto by Kinga Szymczyk', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nYork student Annie Truong-Le’s passing at this summer’s Veld Music Festival shocked Toronto and surrounding communities.\nTruong-Le, 20, was studying to complete her BA in political science.\nShe died suddenly after allegedly ingesting unknown party drugs at the two-day music event held on August 2 at Downsview Park.\nThe student’s family has been understandably heartbroken by the event, with Truong-Le’s\nfriends and family lashing out at media outlets via Twitter as a result of the news coverage.\nTruong-Le interned for City Councillor Anthony Perruzza, helping constituents with their municipal issues. She also helped organize special events,community meetings and assisted with and organized community advocacy.\n“Annie was a smart, charismatic young woman full of life, full of purpose with a great future,”\xa0says Perruzza.\n“Her sudden passing is a terrible loss for all of us. I will miss her.”\nAccording to Perruzza, she spent a great deal of volunteer time assisting others and asking for nothing in return. She had a bubbly, infectious personality and was the kind of person many could not help but like.\nTruong-Le was also very active with a local community agency called MATA (Mentoring Arts Tutoring Athletics), which helps youth by providing guidance and mentorship. The program aims to promote post-secondary education and betterment of youth in marginalized communities.\nRegarding the consumption of drugs and alcohol, the university has a number of initiatives to prevent irresponsible consumption at this year’s frosh, regardless of the incident.\nThe National College Health Assessment statistics regarding campus alcohol consumption breaks through the illusion of York students heavily consume alcohol.\nBased on the study sample, people thought only 4.7 per cent of York students abstain from alcohol. But according to the study, 28 per cent of York students refrain from the use of alcohol completely.\nHealth Education at York also supports the delivery of Alcohol EDU, an alcohol teaching program to all first year students living in residence, as well as varsity athletes, orientation leaders, and other peer leaders from across the university.\nAccording to Leah State, coordinator at Health Education, York is currently in the process of rolling out a bystander intervention program.\nNew students are urged to use the multitude of York safety initiatives, including the safety app which, to date, has been downloaded almost 13,000 times.\nRyan Moore, Assistant News Editor\nPhoto courtesy of Facebook.', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAfter much deliberation, York in cooperation with Seneca College, has chosen Markham as the preferred location for the potential new York campus.\nMarkham, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, East Gwillimbury, and Aurora in collaboration with Newmarket originally delivered proposals to York and Seneca.\nThe new campus was shortlisted for Vaughan, Markham, and Richmond Hill in April.\nYork announced on June 23 it would be working in collaboration with Seneca College to submit a proposal to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities to build a new campus in Markham Centre.\n“The Markham Centre site is located in the heart of a vibrant new urban centre, close to Ontario’s ‘Big Move’ transit investments and other amenities for students,” says Rhonda Lenton, vice-president academic and provost.\nAccording to Lenton, the size and design of the proposed campus have yet to be determined.\nWithin five years of opening, the university aims for the campus to hold 5,000 students.\nOver the next 20 years, the campus is expected to hold between 10,000 to 20,000 students.\nA report to the Board of Governors meeting on June 23 states the new campus is estimated to need 2.4 million square feet at capacity and is predicted to be a $300 to $400-million project.\nLenton says York’s collaboration with Seneca for the project will take York’s strength in student mobility and flexibility to a new level that will benefit new and current students.\n“We are thrilled with the opportunity in Markham Centre and it is just the beginning of our plan to be in more locations across the region over time,” said York president and vice-chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri in a YFile article.\nLenton notes the new campus will allow the university to better serve the York Region, which she says is one of Ontario’s fastest growing major urban areas.\nDave Barrow, mayor of Richmond Hill, said in a press release that although he is disappointed the campus will not be in Richmond Hill, he is excited about the possibility of having a campus so close to the town.\n“We look forward to working with our neighbours to the east and with the entire York Region community in supporting York University’s bid for a campus in our region.”\nTim Simmonds, executive director for the city of Vaughan says the new campus will create jobs and become a catalyst to future development across the region.\n“From an education, economic, and social perspective, this campus is a positive for the entire community,” says Simmonds.\nThe city of Markham was unavailable to comment on the proposal.\nLenton says the university is working closely with Seneca, the city of Markham, and York Region to submit an “outstanding” proposal that addresses the criteria outlined by the MTCU by the deadline date, September 26.\nA decision is expected to be announced in early 2015.\nAshley Glovasky, News Editor\nIllustration by Erika Madsen.', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nA\xa0proposal has been put forward to add a new wing to the Schulich School\xa0of Business, according to a memo included in the Board of Governor’s agenda package this past summer.\nThe proposal was for BOG to approve-in-principle, a new project on condition of the successful fundraising of 75 per cent of the anticipated $40-million project.\nThe expansion will be designed to accommodate the growing number of MBA and PhD students, many of whom arrive from international destinations and have different social, cultural, and intellectual needs.\nAccording to the BOG memo, “Internal growth pressures are severely taxing the current building and external pressures are derived from several sources, including increased competition from top international business schools at the graduate level.”\nSince the Seymour Schulich Building opened in 2003, the undergraduate population has grown by 25 per cent beyond what was originally planned.\nUpwards of 60 per cent of MBA students now come from outside of Canada. As stated by the memo, The Schulich School of Business, India, when opened will further accelerate this trend.\n“I’ve never felt that’s been an issue,” says Jessica Gill, a third year international bachelor of business administration student.\n“I think Schulich has done a pretty good job of accommodating all students. I do believe there has been an increase in incoming students, so perhaps it’s getting difficult for them to manage it.”\nYork administration provided a signal that they will endorse the proposed expansion with the approval-in-principle, and according to the memo, they will fully collaborate with the project.\nIt’s expected that enabling the site plan approval in parallel with the fundraising exercise will shorten the project’s path by an estimated eight months.\nThe Schulich student body remains largely unaware of the proposed building expansion.\n“I’m not sure exactly what resources the expansion will bring, but I’m sure it will definitely enhance the MBA program,” says Gill\nAccording to York advisor and deputy spokesperson Janice Walls, “It’s very preliminary at this point so there’s no more information available beyond what is in the Board of Governors’ package.”\nRyan Moore, Assistant News Editor\nPhoto by Kinga Szymczyk.', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nHead Start at York helped new students understand how to communicate their academic needs and accommodations to professors during the annual event hosted by Mental Health Disabi-lity Services.\nThe summer transition program aimed to help students learn from peers, faculty, and industry experts on how to navigate York’s resources, and how to interact with professors when requesting academic accommodations.\nDr. Jennifer Lund of Trent University spoke at Head Start earlier in the week.\n“Accommodation for students with mental health disabilities looks a bit different at each university and college,” says Dr. Lund. “However, there is consistency in that the mandate of our offices is to provide access so students can be successful in their studies.”\nDr. Lund openly talks about living with bipolar disorder and specifies that, most importantly, for those who live with mental health disabilities, is the option, with supporting medical documentation, to be registered as equivalent to full-time when they choose to take a reduced course load to prioritize health and maximize academic strengths.\nStudents registered with disability services are required to hand in their accommodation forms to professors early in the semester. Although, students may often find the process difficult if professors are not understanding.\nThis event helped students utilize specific resources related to mental health, and how they can interact with professors to communicate their needs.\n“If you are nice to people, you are more likely to get what you want, and this is true to any aspect of life,” says Associate Professor Jennifer Kuk from the School of Kinesiology and Health Science.\nKuk presented students with information on how to become more familiar with the accommodation process and how they can discuss their needs with their future professors.\n“Teaching is only one-third of your professor’s responsibility,”\xa0she adds.\n“Professors do care, but sometimes they may not know how to accommodate or have the time to accommodate in the way you want. Let us know what you need early so we can better accommodate in a fair way to you, the other students, and the professor.”\nKuk’s opening comments at Head Start specified how she was hired for her research background and had not been traditionally trained as a teacher. At this point, she was not familiar with York’s accommodation process.\nLike many professors, Dr. Kuk learned about disability services and accommodations for students as she taught. She often required students to explain what their specific needs were.\nMHDS offers the three-day program ‘Head Start’ every August to students who identify with having a mental health challenge.\n“Accommodation is always confidential – this is also key,” says \xa0Dr. Lund.\n“Meeting with a disability/accessibility counsellor is\xa0key to feeling heard, understood and validated.”\n“I can’t tell you how important my counsellor at MHDS at York was to me during my doctoral degree. I can state unequivocally that her confidence and faith in me was instrumental in my completing my degree.”\n“My challenges as a student was feeling confident that I would be seen as competent while registered with a disability,” says Dr. Lund.\n“I learned to address the shame that I felt and learned to ask for what would make me successful academically. I learned skills in self advocacy through MHDS which have served me in all areas of my life, particularly in requesting accommodation as a university employee.”\nStudents often struggle to navigate the accommodation system, including the alternative exam centre, which has specific criteria for registration. The alternative exam centre has allegedly changed their registration requirements since the winter academic season.\n“The Head Start program was a good way to get a jump on the upcoming school year and feel better prepared,” says one student who chose to remain anonymous.\n“It was really helpful to learn more about all of the services CDS, MHDS and LSS provides and how to easily access them. The guest speakers and peer mentors were very relatable and informative. Also, it was a great opportunity to make connections with\xa0other students.”\nRyan Moore, Assistant News Editor\nPhoto by Ryan Moore.', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nYou’ve arrived at York and so we tip our metaphorical hats to you.

It sucks, we know.\nBut for now welcome to our frosh issue where we’ve done our very best to supply you with tips and tricks that will help make your transition into York life as easy as possible.\nIt’s not easy being a student; you are probably in some sort of debt and will most likely walk into the wrong lecture hall several times. As you step into the wrong crowded lecture hall, I will chuckle to myself and smile as your gaze of confusion glistens, and close to 300 students stop taking notes just to look at you.\nI will be honest with you, university isn’t easy. Unless you’re a genius, you will need to put legitimate effort into your studies. That means going to class, taking notes, and actually speaking up in your tutorials. Those participation marks can really kill your GPA. Take a look at your syllabus, you might lose close to 10 per cent of your mark if you pull off the silent treatment gig.\xa0Tutorials can be legitimately scary, and it might make you pee a little, but every other new student is in the same position as you.\nYou can do it, we have confidence in you. If you are actually lost and confused, there are many places\nto turn to for advice. I’d suggest getting involved with one of the many student associations and clubs across campus. There you will meet students who have a\nbit more experience than you, and can often answer those stupid questions you are dreading to ask. There are endless intramural programs to join, and your respective college has it’s own student government who would love for you to get involved.\nExcalibur is the same, we want you to stroll in and get involved with the paper. As an institution, we are constantly in need of volunteers. No experience required, just a good attitude and a smile here\nor there helps quite a bit.\nNot to mention the school itself has many programs and counselling services to help you enjoy some\nof the best years of your life.\nWhatever your interests are, from Nintendo to self-defense, Pokemon to Harry Potter, there really is something for everyone here at York. It’s a great way to make some new friends and feel all the more comfortable during your time here. No, you won’t need to study everyday, and yes, you will have free time. So make the most of it, deal? Deal.\nHave\xa0some fun this frosh and be yourself. Your parents aren’t watching and it’s time to not only get your degree, but also go through some personal growth and become the person you want to be.\nPlease, don’t be afraid.\nMichael Burton, Editor-In-Chief\nIllustration by Erika Madsen.', ' ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAs the forthcoming school year looms, Excalibur recommends a break from reality and an escape into the realm of cinematic ingenuity with this year’s Toronto International Film Festival.\nCanadian films are better than ever, with Quebec native Xavier Dolan leading the charge at the tender age of 25.\n\xa0Al Pacino will be featured in a one-on-one conversation at the Festival Kickoff Party.

forward to add a new wing to the Schulich School\xa0of Business, according to a memo included in the Board of Governor’s agenda package this past summer.\nThe proposal was for BOG to approve-in-principle, a new project on condition of the successful fundraising of 75 per cent of the anticipated $40-million project.\nThe expansion will be designed to accommodate the growing number of MBA and PhD students, many of whom arrive from international destinations and have different social, cultural, and intellectual needs.\nAccording to the BOG memo, “Internal growth pressures are severely taxing the current building and external pressures are derived from several sources, including increased competition from top international business schools at the graduate level.”\nSince the Seymour Schulich Building opened in 2003, the undergraduate population has grown by 25 per cent beyond what was originally planned.\nUpwards of 60 per cent of MBA students now come from outside of Canada. As stated by the memo, The Schulich School of Business, India, when opened will further accelerate this trend.\n“I’ve never felt that’s been an issue,” says Jessica Gill, a third year international bachelor of business administration student.\n“I think Schulich has done a pretty good job of accommodating all students. I do believe there has been an increase in incoming students, so perhaps it’s getting difficult for them to manage it.”\nYork administration provided a signal that they will endorse the proposed expansion with the approval-in-principle, and according to the memo, they will fully collaborate with the project.\nIt’s expected that enabling the site plan approval in parallel with the fundraising exercise will shorten the project’s path by an estimated eight months.\nThe Schulich student body remains largely unaware of the proposed building expansion.\n“I’m not sure exactly what resources the expansion will bring, but I’m sure it will definitely enhance the MBA program,” says Gill\nAccording to York advisor and deputy spokesperson Janice Walls, “It’s very preliminary at this point so there’s no more information available beyond what is in the Board of Governors’ package.”\nRyan Moore, Assistant News Editor\nPhoto by Kinga Szymczyk.']"

September 24 marks the premier of this year’s I Am series, featuring solo autobiographical dance performances that shed some light on four students’ journeys.\xa0The solo performances mark a transition for second year master’s students, who after a year of choreographic study are able to present their works on a public stage.\xa0This particular performance, held at the McLean Performance Studio, is titled Available Light. Carol Anderson, creative director of the I Am series, says the show was named due to the performances being presented in whatever available lighting they have. “It seems an apt metaphor for the way in which artists work with the resources that they have at hand, and in mind and heart, at the moment of creative expression,” said Anderson. Available Light spotlights students of diverse backgrounds, including Nikolaos Markakis, Allison McCaughey, Suma Nair, and Michelle Silagy. Having survived their first year in their master’s program together, the quartet of dancers regularly collaborate and together comprise a diverse show. Markakis, who is dancing to live music, drew inspiration from folklorish and contemporary dance for his performance titled Ithaka. The title comes from a Greek poem that transcribes the 10-year-long journey from Troy to the island of Ithaka. “I am using Ithaka as a metaphor for my journey from my past to my present and hopes of my future,” added Markakis. McCaughey, a former chorus dancer, named her solo Third from the Left, a play on her position in a chorus line. A more commercial performance, the solo is meant to represent how the business of entertainment is an all-consuming aspect of dance, particularly McCaughey’s experience. Nair incorporates traditional Bharatanatyam Indian dance into her contemporary piece Belong.Influenced by personal narratives and cultural memories, this dance performance is a re-imagining of traditional dance to a contemporary audience. Silagy’s solo, titled …at the end of a stem, is a piece inspired by nature and a garden, environments which often influenced her MFA research. “It becomes a portal through which to pursue a fine attunement of my relationship to air, exhalation, respiration, impulse, nuance, gravity, and the natural world,” said Silagy. The I Am solos are one of three research components that the students go through, which culminate to a self-produced thesis concert in collaboration with York’s theatre production program. The public performances are open to all, and allow for students to embody their critical research into physical practices in front of an audience.\nVictoria Goldberg, Arts Editor.\n\xa0\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2015/09/25/shed-some-light-on-these-unique-dance-solos/'],"['The spotlight turns on Available Light and four MFA students in York’s dance program.

It’s time to broaden your musical horizons with some of the most interesting LGBTQ+ acts out there today, from L to Q! Sex, drugs, music-a-go-go!\nL.\nThe Con by Tegan and Sara \nAn emotional rollercoaster of an album. Songs ranging from bubbly and poppy, to poignant and melancholy, the Canadian twin sister duo have been making music for almost two decades. This album, while managing to be sonically beautiful, expresses love songs devoid of pronouns, making it universal for anyone to listen and associate with. After all, everybody has felt love, and everybody’s felt it when it’s gone.\nFavourite song: “Dark Comes Soon.”\nG.\nThe Plague by Big Momma:\n         It doesn’t matter as much that Big Momma identifies as gay as much as it matters that this gay gangsta-rapper is criminally underrated. Bringing hardcore rappity-rap flows to your ears, Big Momma touches on dark and often morbid issues. The Plague packs such a punch that it manages to flip all of the tropes typically associated with oversaturated phallocentric themes found in gangster rap and flips it on its head. The weather is growing grimmer and darker by the day, so maybe adding this horror-core artist to your music-playing device may not be a bad idea.\nFavourite Song: “Denata.”\nB.\nFabulous Muscles by Xiu Xiu:\nXiu Xiu is definitely bringing some of the finest avant-garde music to the table, and weirdest at that. Fabulous Muscles is bold in its experimentation and fragmentation of typical lyrical structure, as it documents on lead singer Jamie Stewart’s personal experiences, masquerading behind beautiful, sentient, and original poetry. Xiu Xiu is definitely an acquired taste, but the title track on the album is one of the most simultaneously sad and beautiful songs ever written, revolving around an abusive same-sex relationship.\nFavourite Song: “I Luv the Valley, OH!”\nT.\nTransgender Dysphoria Blues by Against Me!:\nAgainst Me!’s latest effort Transgender Dysphoria Blues is both catchy and the band’s first release since lead singer transitioned from Tom James Gabel to Laura Jane Grace. A lot has changed in the band’s thematic content, however what came off as muffled gender displacement in their old songs transformed into full-blown transgender anthems, both celebrating and facing gender dysphoria. This album catapulted a mainstream act that celebrated the transgender way of life and made some tough-as-nails art out of the confusion.\nFavourite Song: “Osama bin Laden as the Crucified Christ.”\nQ.\n Thee Official Limp Wrist Discography by Limp Wrist\n         Queer straight-edge hardcore bands sure are strange. It’s not because they identify as queer, or because they abstain from drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes. It’s because they managed to form a band where all members identify with these things and managed to play all the instruments required for a band. Often honoured as one of the best hardcore bands of all time, Limp Wrist’s brand of punk is abrasive, played with intense breakneck speed and humor. Thee Official Limp Wrist Discography has over 40 songs but only runs for about 35 minutes. Listen to it on your lunch break, although you won’t be satisfied when its done.\nFavourite song: “Does Your Daddy Know?”\nZach Fenech, Staff Writer\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nArthur Inkheart was very excited.\n“Tonight’s our first dance!” he told Keegan excitedly, springing alcohol from beneath his bed. The boys jittered in their dorm.\n“We’ll be each other’s wingmen!” Keegan said sappily as they sipped the alcohol.\nAbsalom Catholic Academy, although a prestigious boarding school for grades 6 to 12, preserves its social functions for grades 9 to 12. It’s a big deal for first-timers.\nWhen they had enough liquid courage, the boys departed. The dance quickly devolved into a slimy crotch massage, as was the custom of the times.\nYou’d think Arthur would be more interested in his potential virginity thief. Oh no! There was a drunken train wreck called Keegan to watch.\nLike a chivalrous knight, Arthur peeled off his partner and ran to the rescue.\n“How are ya bud?” Arthur hollered over the pulsating, mechanical music.\n“Good – I’m – I might – be sick.”\nArthur guessed what he said and peeled off Keegan’s dance partner.\nThe duo passed the teachers who were entranced by the horny horde of teenagers. They were, as the Germans say ‘angepisst’ – oh, they were very angepisst!\nArthur brought Keegan back to the dorm.\n“Did ya see her?” Arthur asked.\n“Who?”\n“That one chick.”\n“No.”\n“I didn’t either. She kept turning her butt to me. You were on booty duty Keeg.”\n“What! Oh, I bet she was real skunky. Arthur, you saved me from a hot mess!”\n“Maybe,” Arthur said, lowering him to his bed.\nSuddenly, Keegan bear-hugged Arthur, dragging him onto the bed.\n“You’re my best friend,” said Keegan, within intimate space of Arthur’s face, lying beneath him in a drunken embrace.\n“You’re mine too – now would ya mind –”\n“I’m so happy! ‘Cause you are – you are my best friend.” Keegan’s soft hands cherished Arthur’s sides.\n“That’s great, but…” Closer and tighter together Keegan towed them.\n“You’re my best friend,” Keegan whispered in his ear. They were a kiss’ distance away. Keegan motioned for Arthur’s cheek.\n“This is bad,” Arthur swerved his head away.\nSoft, warm, honey sweet lips caressed Arthur’s neck as a soft, sensual breeze titillated his face.\n“This is worse.”\nKeegan’s lips were touching, just touching, Arthur’s neck as Keegan giggled. “Oops.”\n“That’s enough!” Arthur jerked away, “Go – good night, Keegan.”\n“I’m not even that drunk, Arthur,” Keegan said before he passed out.\nArthur twitched. He tossed and he turned; he turned and he tossed. He could not relax.\nSo he carved out his heart with a pen and let it bleed unto the page. He wrote:\nI can’t relax because of Keegan. Sometimes he gets me so worked up I can’t sleep. You know how some people get you going so much you shake? And your memories of them are so intense they’re all you think about?\nJesus.

It eats at me!\n\nNot that I’m against it.\nTyler Kingston, contributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nFor the longest time, shopping in the plus-size section of any store left you with minimal options. Skinny jeans became mom jeans, and little black dresses became black ankle-length dresses. Forget finding a just a plain black shirt, because let’s face it, it is not plus-size unless it has a floral design.\n“I can remember trying to find an outfit for a semi-formal in high school and only able to shop at one store. This store tailored to women over 40 years old and was terrible,” says Victoria McGroarty, owner of Gussied Up, a plus-size clothing boutique in Toronto.\nAt one point, you had to sit and wonder, did fashion designers know that there are people whose thighs just don’t fit in a size six dress? Who made this universal rule that plus-size women were not allowed to wear skinny jeans?\n“Plus-size clothing has always been a taboo subject among fashion designers. Although the average woman wears a size 14, designers and even regular stores refuse to carry anything above a size 12,” says McGroarty.\nWhen the average woman wears a size 14, it doesn’t make financial sense to ignore this segment of the market, she says.\nBased on the terrible conventions that were associated with plus-size women, shopping has become somewhat of a taboo for McGroarty and many others.\n“Finding clothes that were fashionable, affordable, and yet still managed to flatter my body seemed impossible,” says McGroarty. “It is assumed that anyone who is above size 12 has given up on all things fashion and prefers to wear matronly cover-ups.”\nStores who only cater to a size chart that stops at a size large greatly limits the amount of consumers that walk through their store on a daily basis. These stores send out a negative message to anyone who cannot fit into their size-eight dresses: you are just not skinny enough to shop here.\nThis distinction of body types alienates body types that are not the “ideal.” \xa0If men’s stores can make sizes that go up to XXL and women’s store that have sizes starting at XXS, why can’t they make sizes that go up to XXL for women as well?\nThere is a clear market out there for the larger sizes, yet a lot of the stores won’t carry them, says McGroarty.\nThe reasoning behind this logic becomes unfair. It creates a binary in the shopping world while simultaneously dictating what certain body types can and cannot wear. If a woman of a larger body-type wishes to wear her little black dress, she should be allowed. She should not be stopped or discouraged by retail stores who say this is just not possible.\nThis is why it becomes important to pay attention and credit stores that carry clothes that cater to all body types. Stores such as Gussied Up, Forever 21, H&M, and Old Navy all offer clothing sizes that exceed your traditional size large.\n“We have spending power but feel completely neglected by the industry. We are curvy, we are beautiful, we want fashion to catch up,” says McGroarty.\nGussied Up offers clothes that go beyond floral prints, mom jeans, and flowy shirts. \xa0They welcome the little black dresses, skinny jeans, crop tops, and pencil skirts. These clothes are affordable, comfortable, and most importantly, fashionable.\nThe ability to feel comfortable in your body is not always an easy adaptation. While fighting off societal expectations, your confidence may plummet and your own personal critique can make becoming comfortable with your body a tiresome and evergoing process.\nHowever, when you walk into a store and see that bigger sizes are offered, you feel elated. At last, someone has recognized that voluptuous girls deserve to feel beautiful in the clothes they wear and in the way the feel.\nThe fashion world is developing. It is going from being super inclusive, to exclusive, recognizing that there is not just one body type, but many, and every body type deserves clothes that fit their unique figure.\nThe world of plus-size shopping does not have to be as intimidating and stressful as it once was. Slowly but surely, the fashion world is opening up the realm to women of all sizes. The nightmares of walking into the shopping mall and leaving empty-handed have turned into magical real-life dreams.\nSo, go ahead ladies, rock that little black dress or your big comfy sweater. Always know it is you who dictates your fashion worth, no one else.\n\xa0\nCristina Maria Lupoi\nContributor\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nFor those of you counting down the days to long lectures to come to a halt for the break, the good news is that the end of the first semester is just around the corner.\nOn another note, you’ve probably been quick to realize that this offers very little relief. The sad and agonizing reality for the majority of us is that the worst is yet to come.\nYork’s exam period begins Wednesday, December 9th and goes through to the 23rd. You can literally see the panic and stress on all the sleep-deprived faces of students on campus.\nPerhaps you’re part of the small percentage of students who aren’t burdened with any exams, but rather a slew of assignments. After all, misery loves the company of end-of-the-term projects, essays, presentations, and assignments.\n“I don’t have any final exams this semester but I do have a lot of projects that I think are even more time consuming,” \xa0says Sara Qarizada a second-year graphic design student. “Projects take so much of your time and it’s a whole drawn-out process.”\nWhatever your situation may be, there are some things you can do in the upcoming weeks that will make your life a little easier. So listen up.\xa0As university students we are no strangers to all nighters. In fact, they happen far more often than anyone would like to admit.\nThe best thing you could probably do for yourself and for your grade is to set up a schedule.\n“It’s important to make a study schedule you feel you can stick to and make sure not to break it,” says Abrahim.\nAs the old saying goes, motivation is what gets you started but habit is what keeps you going. This applies very well to developing good study habits, he adds.\nReward yourself and take breaks. Not hour-long breaks, but 15 minutes usually does the trick. That way you are able to process what you just learned instead of trying to stuff your brain full of things you won’t retain by the next day.\nIt’s important to ensure that you have enough study time, enough leeway time, and enough self-care time, says Abrahim.\nWhen it comes to taking the actual exam, too many people make the mistake of underestimating multiple choice exams or tests. The problem is that most of us will learn to recognize instead of actually understanding the information.\nThis tends to lead us into the mindset of thinking that everything is a trick question and any of these options could be possible. This also means that we take the shortcut and try to recognize the answer by keywords we think will stand out during the exam.\nHowever, when it comes to an application type of question where you’re required to apply whatever concept or idea you learned, you’ll have no idea where to go next. Rather than memorizing, it’s important to actually try to understand the material.\n“For the content that you feel you care about, you should try to understand it. Your grades will reflect that and you’ll feel better earning those grades as well,” says Abrahim.\nWhether that means looking up an explanation or a YouTube animation to break down the topic for you, make sure you have a good grasp and understanding of the topic at hand.\nWhen someone asks you what you’ve been learning, don’t brush it off like it’s a stupid question. Explaining a concept or theory to someone who doesn’t know will help you understand the material better and help you focus on the key points you need to hit.\nFigure out the way you study best: cue cards, notes, reading, mnemonic devices, repetition, speaking out loud, or have sticky notes everywhere.\nAs for studying in groups, it does not always guarantee that studying will be accomplished, however groups are good for bouncing ideas off each other and testing one another.\n“Group versus self-studying can be class dependant. If the material is dry, group studying is probably better but you need someone there to keep the group on track,” says Abrahim.\nHowever, if the material is interesting it might be better to self-study regularly and then only group study for the major tests, he says.\nThere you have it, what you need to know to survive the next few weeks and come out on top. Good luck, scholars.\n\xa0\nJodie Vanderslot\nStaff Writer\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nIt has been an up-and-down start to the season for the Lions men’s basketball team, who lost back to back games in their season home opener at Tait McKenzie Centre this past weekend, first to the Brock Badgers on Frida,y and then to the McMaster Marauders the following evening.\nBefore hosting the teams from Hamilton and St. Catharines here in Toronto, the Lions were on the road, losing to the Queen’s Gaels before taking hard-fought wins over Nipissing and Laurentian University. In these games they showcased their offensive ability, quickly rising to fourth place in Ontario University Athletics scoring rankings. The same kind of offense kept them in their games against the Badgers and Marauders, despite both opponents being two of the top teams in the country.\nIn Friday’s game, both teams were hot from the start, exchanging successful plays and ending off the first quarter with a 18-17 lead for the Lions. In the second quarter the Badgers came fighting back and took a 43-38 lead, despite the Lions’ three-pointers raining down at their end of the court. The second half was similar, with the Badgers taking a dominant lead and the Lions fighting to keep up. In the end, the Badgers took away a 86-71 victory.\nOn Saturday, the Lions once again had a strong first quarter, narrowly leading before the Marauders pulled ahead in the second quarter to lead by 49-39 at the half. The Lions’ hopes of recovering the deficit were dashed in the third quarter, in which the Lions outscored the Marauders 22 points to 14 but were unable to catch up with their opponents. The final score of the game, largely due to the Marauders’ efficient three-point shooting, was 88-74.\n“I feel like those were both games in which we had multiple chances to take control down the stretch and we let them get away,” says new Lions’ point guard Shane Reader, adding that it was good learning experience for the team. “I think our biggest challenge is our complacency. We know we’re as good as any team in the country but we don’t always play our game for a full 40 minutes.”\nReader led the Lions’ effort in both games, recording 16 points, four rebounds, four assists, and three steals on Friday, and adding another nine points and four assists on Saturday. He is currently ranked second in the OUA in assists per game.\nDespite tough losses at home, Reader remains optimistic about the rest of the season. “I’m very excited for the rest of the season, as are the rest of my teammates,” he says. “The season has had its share of ups and downs so far but I’m confident that we’ll be able to get things rolling and hit our stride when it matters most in February and March.”\nHassam Munir\nSports and Health Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe Lions women’s basketball team fell in their season home opener to some of Canada’s top teams this past weekend. The Brock Badgers defeated their host team by a score of 68-52 on Friday, and the McMaster Marauders proved too much for the Lions the following night, taking them down by a score of 86-45.\n“It’s been a challenging season for us thus far as we are still trying to claim our first win,” says guard Ishanaa Seupersadsingh, who is one of the Lions’ top performers. “In saying that, I’m very proud of my team’s effort as we do compete with top teams, and we’ve been in a few very close nail-biter games where we just couldn’t come out on top.”\nIn Friday’s game, the Badgers dominated at the Lions’ end of the court right off the bat, ending the first quarter with a 22-9 lead. The Lions fought back in the second quarter, outscoring their opponents 16-11 in a team effort that narrowed the Badgers’ lead to 33-25 at halftime. The Badgers, who are ranked the seventh best team in Canada, came out even stronger in the second half of the game, outscoring the Lions in both the third and fourth quarters to take away a 68-52 victory.\nThe Lions’ Seupersadsingh and Nina Guzina put up a strong effort to lead their team in the tough contest, together scoring 31 of 52 points. Seupersadsingh also contributed two rebounds and two assists to the game, and Guzina scored an efficient 5-of-9 off the floor.\nSaturday’s game against the Marauders, who are fourth in the national rankings, turned out to be even more lopsided. The Marauders took a dominant 32-2 lead in the first quarter, and though the Lions fought hard to cut it down during the rest of the game, they failed to do so. Seupersadsingh once again led the effort, putting up a team high 11 points, four rebounds, and four steals. However, the Marauders took the victory with a score of 86-45, leaving the Lions with a 0-4 record so far in the regular season.\nNevertheless, the Lions are looking forward to improving their games and competing, if not always winning, in the rest of the season. However, to do that they will have to overcome the challenges of being a young and inexperienced team guided by a new head coach, as well as developing their offensive ability.\n“The biggest challenge we face right now is staying consistent throughout the whole game,” says Seupersadsingh. “Defensively we’re pretty solid, it’s just offence that we need to work on in terms of making it flow more and converting shots.” Guzina feels the same way, adding that improvement in offensive play will be “all about the little things, and taking it one step at a time.”\nCome what may, the team appreciates the undying support of the York community. “Every home game the stands are filled with fans cheering us on,” says Seupersadsingh, “it really helps motivate me and pump me up.”\n“One of the best things about being a Lion is knowing you have that moral support from your Lion family and we couldn’t be more thankful when they come out,” emphasizes Guzina.\nMoving forward, the players are looking to their next two games as an opportunity to end off the first part of their season on strong footing. “I’m very excited to get a win, as these are two teams that we are very capable of beating,” says Seupersadsingh, referring to the upcoming games against the Waterloo Warriors and Laurier Golden Hawks.\nCome 2016, the Lions are eyeing the Ontario University Athletics post-season. “There are one or two pieces that have to come together and once that happens I’m very hopeful that we’ll be competing in the playoffs,” says Seupersadsingh.\n“I am very optimistic for the rest of the season,” adds Guzina. “There’s still a lot of basketball to be played and I think that people will be surprised to see what we’re capable of!”\n\xa0\nHassam Munir\nSports and Health Editor\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe Lions hockey teams were on fire on the ice this past weekend as they won three of their four games, including two shut-out victories and two upsets for their competitors. The men’s team fell to the Waterloo Warriors on Friday by a score of 4-1 but came back the following evening to upset the McGill Redmen, the top-ranked team in Canada, by a score of 3-2.\nMeanwhile, the women’s team earned a 4-0 shutout against the Ryerson Rams on Saturday and followed it up with a 1-0 shutout victory over the UofT Varsity Blues, who are ranked the second best team in the country.\nThe men’s team stepped out onto the ice with determination in Friday’s game, launching the puck towards the Warriors’ net twice in the first two minutes of the frame only to have it hit the crossbar each time. The Warriors dominated the first two periods of the game, with their goalkeeper Mike Morrison turning away all 23 of the Lions’ shots coming towards the net.\nGoing into the third, the Warriors had a 3-0 lead, but the Lions finally got on the scoreboard when Trevor Peterson took advantage of his team’s 5-on-3 advantage due to penalties and got the puck past Morrison. The Warriors returned the favour, and the game ended at a score of 4-1 in their favour.\nSaturday’s game was even more challenging, as the Lions had to face off with Canada’s top team at home. The Lions themselves are ranked 10th, but smarting from the previous day’s loss, scored two goals in the first period in a span of less than two minutes, giving their team a 2-0 lead. The Redmen fought back, pressuring the Lions’ defense, but in the second period they were only able to get the puck into the net once before the Lions followed it up with their third goal, bringing the score up to 3-1. The Redmen then rallied to score once again, leaving the Lions to defend a one-point lead.\nNeither team scored in the third period, though the Redmen pushed relentlessly to even up the score and the Lions valiantly defended their end of the rink to keep them from doing so. In the end, the Redmen ran out of time and the Lions achieved a hard-fought 3-2 victory, ending the Redmen’s nine-game winning streak. This was the Lions’ fifth win at home this season and it updated their record to 8-2-3, making them the top team in the Ontario University Athletics West standings.\nThe women’s team, meanwhile, was even more dominant over the weekend, defeating both of their local competitors in Toronto and not allowing them any goals at all. On Saturday, the Lions brought down the Rams with two goals in the first period and one each in the second and third. It was a spectacular team effort, as nine players worked together to secure a 4-0 victory. Goalkeeper Megan Lee blocked all 25 shots taken at her to keep the Rams scoreless, and perhaps give a preview of her amazing performance the following day.\nSunday’s game was a tight one, as the women’s team battled with the Varsity Blues through all three periods as well as in double overtime, but the score remained deadlocked at 0-0. The game was finally decided by a shootout, during which Lee successfully made the last of her 41 saves in the game, and the Lions’ Dana Somerville and Kristen Barbara both found the back of the Varsity Blues’ net to give their team a 1-0 victory.\nHassam Munir\nSports and Health Editor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nInspired by true events, Nirbhaya, a play written and directed by Yael Farber, is playing at the Nightwood Theatre in the Distillery District.

A group of six men brutally raped a woman and assaulted her male companion when the two boarded a bus on their way home from the movies. Jyoti Singh, whose name was prohibited from being released by the press at the time of the rape, became known as “Nirbhaya,” the Hindi word for fearless one.

Yes, Nirbhaya has many formal qualities of a play, a theatre setting, stage, lighting, props, and costumes, yet it rejects the notion of actors performing. These women have performed silence and submissiveness their whole lives, unable to speak of the violence done to and around them. However, when on stage, these women speak without apology or restraint for what they have gone through. As theatre-goers sit in rows, compelled by these horrific and moving stories, they empathize simultaneously with the real experiences.\nNirbhaya documents the specific horrors of violence that many Indian women have gone, and continue to go, through, yet also speaks to the condition of all victims and survivors. These people who have suffered violence, injustice, or indecency have been wounded, but that wound is what lets the light in. The bandage of silence is insufficient and the bondage to social taboos is suffocating. The women have chosen not to be scared by the darkness around them. They are not scabbed in silence, choosing to shine the spotlight on social injustices, allowing for change to occur.\nNirbhaya welcomes other people affected by violence to not mark themselves by the actions of others. Though it may hurt, survivors must peel back their scabs and deal with what lies beneath. Wounds come in all shapes, sizes, colours, and degrees of pain. They’re not discriminatory in that sense. No one can choose how they are wounded, but everyone can choose to allow wounds to fester in hatred, silence, and darkness, or heal in knowledge, sharing, and lightness.\n\xa0\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nI want to tell you,\nI want to tell you\nBut I don’t know how.\nPlease if I tell you,\nPromise me\nYou won’t leave me now.\nIt’s a simple phrase to say\nDon’t let me lead you astray.\nBut it won’t make you\nSee as I see\nHear as I hear\nMy words will fall like the lame\nDon’t tell me something different\nWe cannot feel the same.\nIt’s not your fault,\nThere’s nothing broken.\nI don’t know what to say\nBecause I’m searching for a way\nTo make you see as I see\nHear as I hear\nFix you so you’ll walk\nThis lonely path with me.\nBut there’s nothing to fix,\nThere’s nothing broken.\nSo I sit with shut lips,\nAnd I grasp for words far above me.\nI want to tell you.\nI would tell you,\nIf I only knew how.\nThis poem takes its first line from the Beatles’ song “I Want to Tell You” which is about an inability to communicate.

It is purposefully written in a vague manner to ease empathy with the narrator’s solitude, but also provide space for open interpretation. The narrator is lonely because of his/her inability to connect with a person of another sexual orientation, superficially on a romantic level, but also on a deeper, empathetic level. This is not stated however, to avoid advocating the stereotype that LGBTQ+ people’s problems solely arise from their sexual identity.\nTyler Kingston, Contributor\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nIn Canada, only one in five people struggling with mental health receive the help they require. Of these five people, it is statistically less likely that a man will report abuse or seek help during a period of distress.\nOn November 18th, Jack.org at York, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization that aims to eradicate the stigma surrounding mental health, invited performer Elliot Maxwell and director Ray Jacildo to perform their multi-perspective show about male sexual abuse. The play, Water Choke, was followed by a discussion among Maxwell, Jacildo, and the audience.\nAs mental health week took over York on November 16, it seemed like a logical time for second-year sociology student Maya Ameyaw to organize the interactive event for her club.\n“Stigma is one of the main things we try to tackle. We hope that people leave questioning the traditional views surrounding male identity, and the very real struggle of men who have endured abuse,” says Jacildo.\nOscillating between four different stories of men struggling with sexual abuse, the performance allowed viewers to identify with a multitude of personalities and struggles. The one-man show emphasizes the stigmas surrounding male abuse that prevent the victims from seeking help, particularly the stigma that men are sexual beings and should enjoy sexual interactions, consensual or not.\nIn conjunction with stigmas surrounding abuse, the show features themes of suicide, trauma, struggling with identifying as a traditional male, and feeling alone as an abuse victim. With some viewers crying and others holding someone next to them, it was clear that Water Choke was not only an artistic piece, but an influential work of growth and finding help.\n“When you see someone who has successfully battled their problems, you realize that things can be different and that there most certainly is hope in overcoming your obstacles,” says first-year undeclared science student Nancy Truong shortly following the performance.\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health concerns, York provides resources, including Personal Counselling Services.

Tensions between Pakistan and India in particular have been rising in recent months, but Tariq believes that events such as the Games are a way to dissipate those tensions to some extent.\n“Such events improve relations,” he says. “Going into the Games, I thought the Indian public would be hostile toward us Pakistanis, but I was stumped by their welcoming nature. Such events are really important to erase misconceptions about other countries.”\nTariq believes that the Lions competitive club for swimming should be turned into a full-scale varsity program, but he encourages members of the York community to try swimming. The pool is “a great place to make some good friends,” he says.\n“Swimming definitely makes me focus more on school and of course, physically, it’s the best sport to play in my opinion as it engages all of your muscles, keeping you fit and active.”\nTariq quickly returned from South Asia, bronze medal in hand, to represent his university in the Ontario University Athletics championships in London. There, he made it to the final round of the men’s backstroke, in which he came in at 13th place, and in the 50-metre he broke his own York record to set a new record of 26.63 seconds.\nIn the future, he hopes to compete in the upcoming 2016 FINA World Swimming Championships in Windsor, and in the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nTariq has made Pakistani students at York proud. “We are extremely happy to see our member Haseeb Tariq accomplish such a milestone and set a record for others,” says Muhammad Nisar, president of York’s Pakistani Students Association. “We encourage him to work harder and accomplish all the goals that he wishes to succeed while representing himself as a proud Pakistani.”\nFollow us on instagram,  @excalphotos \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nThe 2016 YFS elections are upon us and Excalibur is here to bring you news and notes from the campaign trail.

In the finals, he improved on his timing and finished at 1:01.04, but that was not enough to beat P.S. Madhu and Sethu Manickavel, both representing India, who won the gold and silver medals respectively.

The team hustled through a very successful tournament, with Maddy Delle-Donne picking up a bronze medal and Gurnek Tak and Alexandria Town both bringing home gold.\nTown headed to the tournament fresh from her bronze-medal victories in the 55-kilogram division at both the Ontario University Athletics and Canadian Interuniversity Sport championships. Carrying over the momentum, she easily won all of her matches in the first round.\n“I had three matches that day,” says Town. “The first I won by pinfall with a score of 12-0, the second was 13-2, and the last was 10-0.”\nShe had her gold medal match against Laurence Beauregard of Montreal, which turned out to be an almost instant win for Town. “She wasn’t able to score a single point on me,” Town says. “I finished all of my attacks and countered every one of hers.”\nLions’ rookie Tak also had a successful weekend participating in the Junior Men’s Greco Roman Canadian Championships where he won a gold medal.\n“It was my first national competition for wrestling,” says Tak. “The biggest challenge was that I had to go up a weight class and I got completely destroyed in freestyle wrestling. But I came back and won the Greco Roman wrestling championship.”\nHis final match in the men’s 60-kilogram category was against the Western Mustangs’ Eric Renaud, whom he dominated with a score of 2-0. But Tak is not gloating. “I learned that no matter how good you are, you can only get better,” he says. “There’s no limit to what you can achieve.”\nMeanwhile, Delle-Donne worked her way up to a bronze medal in the women’s 82-kilogram category, which adds to her achievements after her gold medal at the Ontario Junior Championships earlier this year.\nThis marks the end of the season for the Lions wrestling team, which finished off with multiple victories. However, the hustle is far from over for most of the team members.\n“I have a new sense of confidence in my abilities and an even stronger sense of confidence in our program,” says Town. “We sent three wrestlers out to New Brunswick and returned with three medals. And to top it all off, most of us are within our first few years of eligibility. It’s all very exciting for the team.”\n\nTweet us,  @excaliburYU \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nBaljinder Kaur, Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of \nTo share and promote the values of Sikhi on campus, the Sikh Students Association organized Sikh Awareness Week, which took place from March 14 to 17. Students and professors from different ethnicities and religious backgrounds participated in the events throughout the week.\nThe week began with Bedtime Sakhis hosted by Tejnoor Kaur. The magical evening consisted of Kaur taking the students back to 1469 by recounting the sakhi (story) of the first guru of the sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev ji, while cookies and hot chocolate kept participants warm.\nNext was the prayer night. Approximately 20 students gathered in the Student Centre to collectively recite Sri Rehraas Sahib, the evening Sikh prayer, followed by kirtan where everyone sang hymns accompanied by a harmonium and tabla.\nThe annual Dastaar Day, one of SSA’s most popular events, took place on March 16 in the East Bear Pit in Central Square. Over 200 students and staff had turbans tied and learned its significance in Sikhi. Sikhs wear turbans as a symbol of royalty, to take care of their unshorn hair, promote equality, and preserve the Sikh identity.\n“We received a really nice response from students here at York University,” says Sukhman Singh, co-president of SSA. “It was very humbling and inspiring to see people wanting to learn about something new.” Various members of SSA helped make the event a success and ensured all participants had the opportunity to take part.\n“I look forward to this event all year,” says Balpreet Gill, a first-year kinesiology student.\n“Although I don’t wear a turban regularly, I make sure to get one tied as it makes me feel connected to my roots.”\nThe week concluded with The Amazing Race: York Edition, an event executed for the first time by SSA. A race with several checkpoints and short Sikhi-related challenges took place at different locations on campus such as the Student Centre, Bethune College, and the Health, Nursing and Environmental Studies building.\nTeams of two people were in a race against the clock in search of the locations on the York map, which was turned into the map of Punjab. Each challenge was unique as the location that was associated with it represented a historical event, which had taken place in Sikhi.\nActivities at stations included chapatti-making competitions to understand the concept of selfless service and langar in Sikhi. Langar is a community kitchen in every Gurdwara (Sikh place of worship) where visitors are served free food regardless of their background, religion, colour, or caste.\nEveryone sits on the floor together to enjoy a free meal, which represents equality. There were eight stations in total and the pair with the fastest time was rewarded a tablet each.\n“We were really happy with the turnout of the event especially that so many non-Sikhs participated,” says Simreet Kaur, executive member of SSA and key organizer.\nIf this sounds like a good time, look out for the celebration of Holla Mohalla, a Sikh festival held at the Scott Religious Centre on March 31 at 5:30 p.m.\n\nTweet us,  @excaliburYU \n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nTasha Ramdehall, Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Aaron Fisher\nWhat’s in a story?

This panel centers its solutions on this.”\nThe Bonn panel brought together several researchers and regional government representatives from Canada, the U.S., India, and Germany, where they all discussed the role of multi-stakeholder dialogues under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Action.\nKenneth Shockley, an associate professor of philosophy at Colorado State University, shares his own approach to his portion of the panel. “I am interested in the different ways that we understand ‘working together,’ and I wanted to impress upon the audience the importance [doing so] in a way that fosters trust among all parties,” he states.\n“This collaborative approach gives a productive way of listening to other parties, working in a manner that is focused on the problem at hand, and not any individual parties’ preconceived— and therefore biased—notion of how we might solve that problem.”\nSander Chan, adjunct assistant professor at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development at Utrecht University and researcher with the German Development Institute, focused on similar themes.\n“I was invited to speak on a conference I organized called ‘Interconnections,’ which discussed how the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement are connected,” he says.\n“Discussions focused on the role of state, non-state, and subnational actors, who could help deliver on both agendas.”\nAlthough the sustainable development and climate change processes are politically separate, they contribute to the same reality.\n“There is much interest in connecting climate action to sustainable developmental goals,” said Boran.\nThe panel participants were pleased with the headway of the Bonn panel, but all agree that more action and research is still necessary.\n“Idil and I, and our colleagues involved in this work, plan to move onward with a collective, broad, and interdisciplinary research that will take us into uncomfortable places, as the solutions to climate change require difficult decisions to be made,” says Bazely.\nShockley insists further research should be pursued to look for points of synergy between the different non-state actors (states and provinces, financial actors, and NGOs) to make sense of the new international policy landscape.\nChan, meanwhile, offers a starker truth.\n“We have only 45 years before our carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius warming will be used up,” he comments. “Before [we] have a research project funded, conducted, and that can present final results, it’s probable that we [will have] already passed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.”\n“Building interfaces between decision makers and researchers is, in my view, more urgent, to bring\xa0knowledge and solutions into the decision-making space,” he adds.\nStarting her sabbatical research in July, Boran will spend three months at the German Development Institute, then two more as a researcher in residence at the Centre for Excellence at Goethe University in Frankfurt/ Main to continue work on her study manuscript.\nShe aims to develop a political theory of climate action on a global public sphere.\n ', 'the biggest contributor to human caused climate change is animal agriculture. The biggest change you can make in your life to help this issue is to become a vegan or at least avoid animal products in your life. which is very easy. \nwhy this issue s not brought up by these experts is surprising. we can see in some countries already 5% or more of the population are vegan. hopefully they will continue to help others make the change and other forms of human caused climate change will be reduced or eliminated soon. \nThe rise of materialism and consumerism is not helping either.

UV radiation causes about 90 per cent of melanoma cases.” Additionally, cases of melanoma have increased significantly over the past 25 years, according to CCS.\nThe reasoning for this is because the sun transmits three types of deadly rays, which are, in large part, reflected back into space due to the ozone layer. The three types of UV rays are: Ultraviolet A (UVA), which “make up most of the sun’s natural light. They can penetrate deep into the skin, causing wrinkles and premature aging of the skin;” Ultraviolet B (UVB), which “are the main cause of sunburn. They are nearly 1,000 times stronger than UVA rays;” and Ultraviolet C rays, which are “short-wave radiation that never reaches the earth’s surface, because the atmosphere filters them out.”\nThe ozone layer is deteriorating due to pollution and accumulation of CO2 emissions—thus, causing more harmful UV rays to penetrate the earth’s atmosphere and increase its harm to all living organisms.\nIn the case of skin protection from the sun, water-resistant sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or above are recommended, as they have a broad spectrum of protection against both UVA and UVB rays. However, it’s important to thoroughly read the warning label on all products, as some medicines and skin care products may also increase the skin’s vulnerability to UV damage.\nThe potential for sun damage is at its worst from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., so it’s best to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun’s rays during these times, or cover up exposed skin.\nIt’s also important to check for skin abnormalities, which will help when it comes to detecting early signs of skin cancer, which increases your chances for survival. After all, it is better to be safe than sorry.\n ', 'Best way to take care your skin in summer Drink Lot water\n\n York University Community Newspaper \nAbdeali Saherwala | Contributor\nFeatured image: The York exhibition allows visitors to experience movement through dance, theatre, and the visual arts, all in one visit. | Courtesy of the Art Gallery of York University\nSome artists make art solely based on the stillness of an object or a view, while others are inspired by their fascination with movement. Artist Derek Liddington seems to be the latter. He created a solo exhibition around the performance of two photographic stills from the Ballet Russes’ productions of Ode and Apollon Musagète in 1928.\nIt is being staged back-to-back at the Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) in the Accolade East Building and the Southern Alberta Art Gallery. The exhibition at the AGYU is called the body will always bend before it breaks, the tower will always break before it bends.\nLiddington’s new exhibition is a powerful and humanistic statement that utilizes 3-D clay caricatures and works imprinted or painted in fabrics and on walls. He also produced a video in which dancers perform in each other’s company, which is the product of a co-commission video shot by Toronto filmmaker Chris Boni. The short video was done during a time spent with students from York’s dance department in the summer of 2016. The dancing style used in the short is presented in a slow, graceful, and even an athletic manner, seeming to show the audience that the movement in dance is the embodiment of the intricacy of human movements, and the tensions of the human anatomy.\nNot only that, it also presents the fluidity of our operativeness, despite our anatomy being constituted with rigid bones and firm muscles. Overall, Liddington shows the strength of the human form in an abstract manner.\nThe artist also makes sure that each exhibition uses the “performance still” (or production shot) as a dramaturgical framework for the development of its score and mise-en-scène. He attempts to capture the essence and authenticity of the Ode and Apollon Musagète, and not just to make art that looks aesthetically pleasing.\nHe makes sure that each gallery is a sample of Gesamtkunstwerk, wherein each component is operating at the intersection of dance, theatre and the visual arts. Liddington wants his audience to feel as though they have been to the theatre, an art gallery or dance performance, all in one visit.\nAccording to Emelie Chhangur, the curator of the exhibition at the AGYU: “Liddington animates the space in-between performance and image as a point of departure for his ongoing investigation into the relations between narrative (meaning) and abstraction (aesthetics).”\nHe intends to cultivate a story out of his artwork. Audiences can interpret the drawings on walls and on free flowing curtains as symbols of the unlimited flow of the human body. We are free to move in any way we want, and yet, the marble sculptures represent load bearing joints of the human figure, and the clay sculptures portray our limitations in terms of movement.\nWith the exhibition, the audience doesn’t always get clearcut representations. It instead shows two sides of a story, which goes back to Liddington’s mission to intersect both meaning and aesthetics. He wants to create a world that displays both the significance of the body’s movement and our environment— in both positive and negative ways.\nThe main theme of this exhibition remains intact, being that the body will always bend before it breaks, the tower will always break before it bends.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJodie Vanderslot | Health Editor\nFeatured image: Christopher Lai\nI remember when I moved into residence my first year. I was bombarded with introductions and overwhelmed by my multiple roommates and dozens of people flooding the halls.\nI remember feeling lost and what it felt like to know no one. I remember how I timidly wandered around during orientation week, constantly encouraged to participate, and I remember repeatedly saying my major and shyly chiming in on conversations.\nNow, three years later, those roommates are my best friends. I have been one of those overenthusiastic orientation leaders, and I am constantly talking about my major and how attending York has been one of the best decisions I have ever made.\nYork’s reputation borders on controversial and maligned. York is often portrayed in a negative light by the media, fueled by confirmation biases and powered by many perpetuating misconceptions.\nThe media is often biased against York, streaming headlines of assaults and crimes, constantly inferring that if it happens around York, it must reflect the university. York is persecuted and ridiculed for their location, however, for a university, York University Heights is ranked 19th out of 140 Toronto neighbourhoods for sexual assaults, a much lower rating than both U of T area (second) and Ryerson (11th). Yet it is “York University” that is often linked with “violence” and “assault.”\nSecurity bulletins are sent out when incidents happen in and around York from things such as suspicious activity to actual incidents. These updates are sent out briefly after the incidents are reported and are intended to keep faculty and students informed and safe.\nYork is Canada’s third-largest university, with an incredibly diverse population and program selection. York has one of the leading internationally recognized educational institutions for the faculty of business studies, as well as a unique space engineering program.\nThere are constant improvements being made around York to accommodate and enhance our experiences, yet we still have retorts, declaring that this progress is taking too long and there is too much construction.\nThe people are part of what makes York so great. They come from all over the city, not to mention the world, with different perspectives that really do open your mind. I met my support system here. Those people I warily talked to during my first few weeks here, the ones I awkwardly met by chance, and the people I continue to meet, are part of the reasons why I care so much about York.\nYork’s reputation depends entirely on who you ask and the experiences they’ve had. Everyone always says some reiterated version of, “it’s what you make of it,” however, somewhere along the way I feel like we’ve forgotten that.\nThere is this romanticized idea that someone else’s school is better than yours (the grass is always greener on the other side, to use a cliché). We’ve started blaming everything on our school, discrediting it and putting it down.\nBut it’s your experiences; it’s the people you meet, how you approach situations and the opportunities you allow yourself to have, York is just the place that it happens. It’s your time—to take responsibility.\nGet involved. It’s not just something to say, it’s actual advice because there are more opportunities and resources than you may realize. Utilize your time here and respect the education you are receiving and the institution you are attending.\nYour degree is a piece of paper; your education is what you make of it.

Furthermore, in six of these 15 years, Torontonians have not had the opportunity to cheer for either team come playoff time.\nThis April finally brought an end to this trend, as both the Maple Leafs and the Raptors successfully made it to the playoffs in their respective leagues. The city saw a playoff fever that thousands of youth and young adults had not experienced in their lifetime.\nThis fever was especially present on York campus, where hundreds of students showed their support by watching the games, posting on social media, and wearing Leafs- and Raptors-related gear.\n“The playoff fever in Toronto has a huge impact on York’s campus since people are more willing to go to campus bars to watch the games,” says third-year theatre student Maddy Fisher. “I’ve gone to Shopsy’s more in the past month or so just to watch sports with friends than I have all year!”\nYork students jumped on a ‘hype train’ by sharing pictures at sports bars on Instagram, sending videos of the mayhem at Jurassic Park/ Maple Leafs Square on Snapchat, tweeting their brief thoughts about games, and giving their detailed opinions about games via Reddit.\nBut among everything else, the feeling that was most prevalent through the April playoff run was national pride.\n“When Toronto makes it to the playoffs, people become extremely patriotic to not only the sports team, but also Canada,” adds Fisher. “I see an increase in various swag items that reflect both the sport and Canada as a whole. It’s definitely a sense of pride for most people.”\nLooking at York Lions teams, one cannot help but wonder about the effect that a similar sense of support would have on the performance of our teams. The inspiration that a passionate York crowd can give has been known to work wonders in the past.\n“There is a huge difference between a normal regular season game and a playoff game,” says Fisher. “The crowd is always more vocal and is willing to go as far as they can to ensure a win for York. Some fight the other team, some fight the referees, and others pray.”\nUnfortunately, not every team benefits from a rowdy York crowd voicing support for their team, especially the Lions’ teams that fall outside the popular soccer and football sphere. When asked about his experience supporting the York men’s basketball team, second-year environmental studies major Abdeali Saherwala remarked on a vastly different experience when compared to Fisher’s hockey experience. Saherwala was disappointed with the atmosphere at the game, and felt the cause was directly related to a lack of attendance.\n“I believe that hype and crowd support can really boost morale for players, who are trying their absolute best to win. But without the support from the York community, it is difficult to draw emotional strength and resilience,” he adds.\nSo this year, why not take the time to support your Lions? Whether it is a men’s soccer championship game or a regular season basketball game, any support will be needed in the upcoming 2017-2018 York Lions season. Your cheers will yield noticeable results on the field, pitch, court, or rink, so I hope to see you there this year!\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/uncategorized/2017/05/26/york-philosophy-prof-climate-change-un-event/'],"['Dennis Bayazitov | Assistant News Editor\nFeatured image: Climate change experts agree that progress was made at the conference, but there is much more work to be done.\nYork philosophy professor Idil Boran led an official panel at the Bonn Climate Change Conference earlier this month as a call to action for building trust and inclusiveness in non-party stakeholder engagement in global climate action.\nThe panel, “Marrakech Partnership: Building Trust and Inclusiveness in Non-Party Stakeholder Engagement,” was held on Saturday, May 13th in Bonn, Germany as an official side event of the UN climate change conference.\nBoran organized the event in partnership with Colorado State University, collaborating with York science professor Dawn Bazely.\n“[Boran] frames climate change in an ethical context, wherein human values, governance, and political processes provide the larger picture beyond scientific research,” says Bazely.\nShe stresses that the warnings of 1990’s climate change research are indeed already coming to pass, with ice sheets melting in Antarctica and the Arctic.\n“The world’s most vulnerable are already being affected, and they will be impacted far worse than the wealthy,” she says.\n“Climate change is, in truth, an ethical issue. This panel centers its solutions on this.”\nThe Bonn panel brought together several researchers and regional government representatives from Canada, the U.S., India, and Germany, where they all discussed the role of multi-stakeholder dialogues under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Action.\nKenneth Shockley, an associate professor of philosophy at Colorado State University, shares his own approach to his portion of the panel. “I am interested in the different ways that we understand ‘working together,’ and I wanted to impress upon the audience the importance [doing so] in a way that fosters trust among all parties,” he states.\n“This collaborative approach gives a productive way of listening to other parties, working in a manner that is focused on the problem at hand, and not any individual parties’ preconceived— and therefore biased—notion of how we might solve that problem.”\nSander Chan, adjunct assistant professor at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development at Utrecht University and researcher with the German Development Institute, focused on similar themes.\n“I was invited to speak on a conference I organized called ‘Interconnections,’ which discussed how the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement are connected,” he says.\n“Discussions focused on the role of state, non-state, and subnational actors, who could help deliver on both agendas.”\nAlthough the sustainable development and climate change processes are politically separate, they contribute to the same reality.\n“There is much interest in connecting climate action to sustainable developmental goals,” said Boran.\nThe panel participants were pleased with the headway of the Bonn panel, but all agree that more action and research is still necessary.\n“Idil and I, and our colleagues involved in this work, plan to move onward with a collective, broad, and interdisciplinary research that will take us into uncomfortable places, as the solutions to climate change require difficult decisions to be made,” says Bazely.\nShockley insists further research should be pursued to look for points of synergy between the different non-state actors (states and provinces, financial actors, and NGOs) to make sense of the new international policy landscape.\nChan, meanwhile, offers a starker truth.\n“We have only 45 years before our carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius warming will be used up,” he comments. “Before [we] have a research project funded, conducted, and that can present final results, it’s probable that we [will have] already passed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.”\n“Building interfaces between decision makers and researchers is, in my view, more urgent, to bring\xa0knowledge and solutions into the decision-making space,” he adds.\nStarting her sabbatical research in July, Boran will spend three months at the German Development Institute, then two more as a researcher in residence at the Centre for Excellence at Goethe University in Frankfurt/ Main to continue work on her study manuscript.\nShe aims to develop a political theory of climate action on a global public sphere.\n ']"

That’s Black Panther, the movie that is so deeply important.\nBlack Panther is so important that it makes the liberation from Transatlantic slavery and the Civil Rights Movement look like a fairytale. Malcolm X, who? Martin Luther King, where? Barack Obama, when? The release of Marvel’s Black Panther is now the most critical moment in black history.\nAll jokes aside, everyone is pumped to see this film. This movie is expected to top the box office this weekend, making $165 to $170 million in its opening weekend, and the lines will be wrapped around the corner with Marvel fans itching to watch it.\nI’m also expecting to see black people thrilled about watching a black superhero in a prosperous black country. A couple weeks ago, the hashtag #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe was trending on Twitter, and responses varied—from the portrayal of black people, to being represented on the big screen, to the portrayal of Wakanda. One user, @TerryTheWriter (NoDell Beckham), tweeted: “Finally, seeing BLACK people ruling their BLACK country on their BLACK continent, minding their BLACK business, thriving with their BLACK dollars, and BLACK resources. #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe.”\nThat tweet alone summarizes Black Panther in a nutshell. Black Panther is the epitome of black nationalism, which is the same form of nationalism Marcus Garvey advocated for in the 1920s, which he referred to as Garveyism. Black nationalism revolves around the notion that black people are a nation who must seek to develop and maintain a black identity. Black nationalists support political, social, and economic empowerment for the black community. In short: black nationalists are pro-black, in every sense of the word.\nIn comparison to black nationalism, Wakanda is a racially homogenous nation of independence, self-preservation, and self-determination. T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is on guard for his Wakandan people, and does anything to fiercely protect Wakanda at all costs. One instance of this is when he infiltrated the Avengers, assessing their potential threat level to Wakanda; or when Black Panther kept up the facade of Wakanda as being a third-world country, so that outsiders would stay away from their wealth.\nWhen watching the trailer, the protective nature of Wakanda is very much recognized. Not too many that have visited have made it out alive, except for their arch-nemesis Ulysses (Andy Serkis), who is seeking the vibranium that makes the country so technologically advanced.\nWakanda is the nation Garvey would have dreamed of. As Beckham puts it, Wakanda is a nation that thrives on its own efforts, with no help from anybody.\nNoticing the admiration on social media shows that black nationalism is not a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with putting your people first or defending your nation, like T’Challa does.\nThose watching Black Panther will be embracing black nationalism, whether they know it or not—and that’s nothing to be ashamed of.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nVanessa Chambers-Stewart | Contributor\nFeatured image | Courtesy of Pexels\nI’d tell you my name but you probably won’t remember. There are various reasons for that, but I’d rather avoid that conversation. I decided to write this to bring awareness to those of us who are still blind to the world we live in. I also wrote this for my friend Reuben. I haven’t heard from him in years but there are reasons for that. I hope that he’s lived a very good life and was able to enjoy his youth.\nI.\nMy parents always told me that Reuben and I got along really well. So they weren’t surprised when Reuben and I were around each other all the time. Even as children if we ever did get into a disagreement, it was always over within a matter of minutes. I never saw it as anything. I just figured we were two young boys who wanted to play video games and eat junk food all day.\nI wasn’t naïve, but I think I was in denial. It was the summer time; Reuben and I were excited about going off to middle school. We’d finally be able to walk and not have our parents drop us off in the mornings. Reuben and I walked to the convenience store. I remained outside. As I wiped my forehead on my T-shirt, a tall White man appeared in the distance. He was leaning against a dark blue Buick and had a toothpick in his mouth. I paid him no mind and continued standing under the shade.\nI hear the bell ring over the door as Reuben barges out.\n“Here, I got you one too.”\nI look at Reuben and then the freezy in his hand.\n“So now my shirt is gonna be dirty.”\nReuben laughs and replies: “I saw you wipe sweat on your shirt…who cares, just take the freezy!”\n“HEY!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?”\nI could already see that this man was going to be trouble. But poor Reuben, he didn’t understand.\nReuben shouts back: “WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?”\nThe tall White man yells: “DON’T YOU KNOW THEY CAUSE A LOT OF TROUBLE? YOU BETTER RUN ALONG BEFORE YOU FIND YOURSELF IN SHIT!”\nReuben looks at me and shrugs his shoulders. I jump onto my bike and begin leading the way.\nThe tall White man answers back: “A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU SHOULDN’T BE HANGING AROUND A BOY LIKE THAT!”\nHere is where I saw the issues of our skin. I can say that being a Black person in this world leaves you with little-to-no-options on how to feel about race situations. Being too calm makes you look oblivious and/or in denial, while displays of anger only feed into what they expect. What options are we left with?\nII.\nReuben and I were now in high school, and we didn’t miss any action. I did well in sports and was always asked to return, but my heart was in fixing things. Reuben, on the other hand, wasn’t the best in sports, but made teams because of his wealthy parents. It still worked out well for the both of us; I got the benefits of a funded team and Reuben got to experience first-class treatment. Everyone came out a winner, and we enjoyed it.\n‘Joy Ride’\nIt was the summer Reuben and I graduated from high school. His parents bought him a green 1999 Mercedes-Benz-E-Class. I was even happier when he insisted he take me out for a drive. Like I said, Reuben and I were always close. Despite his family being wealthy, Reuben got the emotional attachment from my family. Both of our parents respected each other and we all enjoyed each other’s company.\nReuben and I were driving down Neffe’s avenue when I saw the sirens flashing in the rearview mirror. Reuben pulls over and asks me: “Did I do anything wrong?”\nI shake my head.\nThe police officer exits the cruiser and walks over to Reuben’s door. Reuben rolls down his window and asks: “Hi officer, do you mind telling us why you’ve pulled us over? I was watching my speed limit and my tail lights work.”\nThe police officer doesn’t say a word but I can feel him looking at me. I continue looking straight ahead. “Let me see your driver’s licence.”\nReuben is oblivious to what is happening right in front of him. As he pulls out his wallet, the officer sticks his head in the window and asks: “Where were you two headed?”\nReuben answers, “Oh we’re just testing out my new car. My parents bought this for me.”\nThe police officer ignores Reuben and points his pen at me.“What’s your name, boy?”\nI remember my parents’ voice in my head. They’ve already warned me about this, and even though it’s wrong, they said that I should always be respectful. Before I can open my mouth, the officer interrupts: “So do you have a car of your own?”\nI shake my head and answer: “No sir, I do not have a car of my own.”\nThe officer removes his head from the window and walks over to my side of the car. Reuben looks confused and pulls out his cellphone. “If I’m the driver, then why are you questioning him, officer?”\nThe officer ignores him and taps on the glass for me to roll down the window.\n“So you’re saying that you don’t own a car of your own…then how do I know that you aren’t going to steal your friend’s car? How do I even know this is your friend? Maybe there’s a gun in the car and you’re holding him hostage until I leave.”\nReuben begins to get annoyed and interjects.\n“Officer, what you’re doing isn’t the law, and I will ensure my dad will have your badge.”\nI ignore both of them and answer the accusations as calmly as I can.\n“There is no gun in the car and he is my friend. He offered me the ride and I decided to take it.”\n“You ever been arrested, boy?”\nI reply: “No, I haven’t been arrested.”\nThe police officer answers back: “You must be one of the lucky ones.”\nReuben interrupts again: “Officer I just want to let you know that I’ve warned you, and I will now be calling our lawyer.”\nThe officer leans into the car again, but this time smiles at Reuben.“Now why are you gonna go and do that? I’m just talking to your friend here…we’re all adults now.”\nReuben ignores the officer. “You leave me no choice.”\nThe officer makes eye contact with me and doesn’t smile.\n“So where do you live?”\n“I live not too far from here, officer.”\n“Do you have any kids?”\n“No, I do not have any children.”\n“Are you married?”\n“No, I’m not married.”\nThe officer removes his head from the car and begins stretching. Reuben calls his dad’s office and tells his secretary where we’re located.\nI overhear the officer say: “Your people don’t believe in marriage, but you people multiply at a rapid rate. It amazes me.”\nThe officer takes out his notepad and begins writing down the licence plate. He removes his sunglasses and looks at me.\n“I’m going to run the info on the car. Don’t move.”\nAs the officer walks back to his cruiser, Reuben and I sit in silence. I can’t describe how I feel but I know it’s nothing good. I just continue to play my parents’ voice in my head because I know that if I say the wrong thing, this officer will definitely put me behind bars.\nTwenty minutes later, Reuben’s dad arrives with his lawyer. Reuben’s dad approaches our car and the lawyer approaches the cruiser. Blake is a successful public relations representative and spoiled Reuben with gifts. He’s a lot older than Reuben’s mom, but you could tell that he really loved her. He was dressed in a tailored brown suit and had his grey hairs freshly trimmed each week.\n“Are you guys okay?”\nReuben speaks for the both of us: “That cop is an asshole. He’s been interrogating us for almost thirty minutes.”\nBlake scratches his beard and pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket. He motions Reuben to pass him a pen. “It’s assholes like this that make our country a living hell.”\nThe lawyer walks back over to us and hands us a card. “This isn’t over. Just wanted to let you guys know that if this ever happens again to contact me—”\nThe rest of the conversation becomes a blur to me. What does he mean by this isn’t over? What about if this happens again? The question is…will this random stop ever happen with Reuben in his car by himself or with his group of White friends? This was just a chapter in Reuben’s life, but this is and always will be my life. This wasn’t my choice, but I knew that Reuben would never be able to understand. A good lawyer isn’t the issue, it’s my skin.\nReuben’s dad drives behind us. When Reuben pulls into my driveway, I don’t have much to say.\nHe asks: “Tomorrow?”\nI reply:“Bet.”\nAs I leave the car, I tell myself that this is the last time I’ll see Reuben. He and I don’t see colour, but the world we live in does. His skin is politically correct, while mine is urban and cool. We’re on the same side instead of playing against each other; to them we shouldn’t have anything in common. To them, this picture doesn’t make sense. Reuben will always be identified as a White man first, and I will always be his unanswered boy.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nJanelle Anastasia Wallen-Charles | Contributor\nFeatured image:\xa0We shouldn’t feel different or ashamed, and instead, feel liberated and proud. | Courtesy of Pexels\nSociety has painted black beauty as “ugly.” It has been imprinted into the minds of little black girls that wearing their natural, kinky curls is something to be ashamed of. We’ve hidden this shame under countless straightening until our hair starts to break off; we spend hundreds of dollars investing in long 18-inch Brazilian hair because we want to meet society’s demands. This is ruining young black girls’ psyche, because our “kinky curls” are considered “not pretty.”\nI spoke with entrepreneur Jacintha Wallen-Charles, and I asked her if little girls are taught to be ashamed of their curls. “Not only society, but the black community itself. It’s small things that we don’t recognize, like ‘you should sleek back your edges,’ or ‘what are you going to do with that hair?’,” she says.\n“Having baby hairs in its natural form is frowned upon by other black girls, because it is seen as ‘not doing your hair.’ Moreover, people of other races often look at our hair and ask: ‘What are you going to do with it?’ as if its natural state isn’t adequate enough to wear in public.”\nI remember when I got my first weave—it was an Onyx, 18-inch, straight, 1B. When I strutted down the aisle, about to graduate, with my weave sewn into my head, I felt beautiful. I no longer felt uncertainty. It gave me an identity. They called me a weava-diva! I could get any colour, style, and length.\nWeaves allow black women to feel beautiful; it allows us to hide from what we were given with. Ask a black woman if she’d rather wear her natural kinky curls or a Tokyo Stylez, custom made, 20-inch, Indian Remy hair, and see what she says.\nThe thing is, we have become so comfortable in the shell that we’ve grown up in, that it gets harder to break out of it.\nI spoke with a fellow employee, Jaya Hance, a black woman who often wears her hair straight. I’ve never seen her hair in it’s natural, kinky state, so I asked her why. “When I was growing up, I was moved from a mixed-culture school to a pure white school, and they didn’t understand my different hair. Because of this they made me feel different, and always pointed it out. This little boy even told me my hair looked like poop,” she says.\nEven if we come from different ethnicities, there should be a boundary where parents should teach their children right from wrong—and they don’t. Due to the bullying, Hance felt ashamed to wear her hair in natural braids, or out in an afro.\nWe have been criticized by the media, by society and even by our peers. But now the media, society and our peers want to take credit for African beauty and culture. Let me educate everyone. When Miley Cyrus started wearing what many called “Space Buns,” it got a lot of hype.\nThese Space Buns, however, are actually called Bantu knots, a hairstyle said to originate from Zulu tribes in southern Africa. When the Kardashians started donning what everyone called “Boxer Braids,” it became a hot new trend. Boxer braids are called Cornrows, and have been found in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara, dating as far back as 3,000 B.C., particularly in the Horn of Africa and West Africa.\nThese hairstyles are not new fashion trends that Miley Cyrus and the Kardashians came up with out of the blue. It shows the twisted way that, on a black girl, it’s seen as ugly—but on a famous white person’s head, it’s seen as trendy and new.\nHow are they going to look down on black beauty, then try to take credit for it? The problem is giving recognition to black women who’ve had these styles forever. Don’t rob us of that recognition. Don’t rob our culture from us.\nBlack women have started to become comfortable without the wigs, sewn-in weaves, and the constant straightening, because we’ve realized that we are beautiful; that we should not care about society’s opinions.\nWallen-Charles stated Viola Davis and Lupita Niyong’o, who are both Oscar-winning black actresses, show their natural hairstyles on the red carpet with confidence. We are seeing the beauty of the curls. We shouldn’t feel different nor ashamed, and instead, feel liberated and proud.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAngelica Babiera | Arts Editor\nFeatured image: “Detail In Conversation” (c) Gordon Shadrach. | Courtesy of the ROM\nOn January 27, the ROM opened a new exhibition titled Here We Are Here: Black Canadian Contemporary Art.

The York alumna’s “Hiking Black Creek” shows a “meditation on the emotional labour of belonging, of connecting with one another and one’s surroundings,” as the ROM explains.\nBrewster’s work has been exhibited internationally, and conveys themes of identity and representation. Her work reflects how intersectionality works with immigrants, as well as those who are deemed the minority.\nMichele Pearson Clarke’s video installations “Suck Teeth Compositions (After Rashaad Newsome)” is about the everyday oral gesture shared by black people and how the sucking of their teeth often has negative connotations. Clarke tries to break down this stigma and stereotype by normalizing the gesture with the video.\nAs for Charmaine Lurch’s “Being Belonging and Grace,” her focus comes down to expressing belonging and invisibility. Lurch is another York alumni whose large-scale gestures express emotion and ease; the conflict between trying to belong yet feeling invisible in the community—both in her own black community and the white community.\nMeanwhile, Sylvia D. Hamilton, Bushra Junaid, Esmaa Mohamoud, Dawit L. Petros, Gordon Shadrach, and Chantal Gibson’s respective installations all convey a sense of reflecting the history of trade and slavery, stereotypes, and the feelings of being “displaced” and “disappeared’ in Canadian narratives.\nWhile I explored the exhibition, I felt a sense of connection. As a Canadian immigrant, I know what it means to feel out of place; to feel awkward in transitioning into the Canadian standards while still upholding my own cultural beliefs. I have felt the wish to belong, yet still feel invisible in the eyes of my own people and the Canadian people.\nEach of the artists’ works are relevant in today’s society and issues. Each create conversations that not many people are aware of. The ROM’s Here We Are Here explores the idea of being black in Canadian society, and helps evoke a powerful response from visitors to challenge the norms and the stigmas that are still prevalent today.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nAngelica Babiera | Arts Editor\nFeatured image:\xa0What we need is more empowerment and the truth about the socio-political issues pinned on blacks in America and the rest of the world. | Courtesy of Pexels\nWhen you listen to Kanye West or Jay Z, or any rapper for that matter, listeners always hear a prominent theme in their respective songs: men should be the misogynistic materialists, while women are often sexualized into nothing but objects.\nAt the same time, in most hip-hop music videos, there’s always the rapper rapping their songs with 10 girls with big butts in the background dancing provocatively. Lil Wayne best described this theme in his song “Love Me” by rapping: “And all she eat is dick/ She’s on a strict diet/ That’s my baby.”\nDon’t get me wrong, I love hip-hop. It’s my go-to genre because it always puts me in a good mood and hypes me up whenever I need it.\nHowever, hip-hop is also very controversial. It conveys many demeaning themes and meanings that could easily affect people. Yet what gives hip-hop music so much more influence in mainstream media is its portrayal of black culture and black people.\nHip-hop is is a genre that conveys more stereotypes among a certain race than any other. Think about it: there are rappers that often say the n-word when it isn’t necessary, music videos often convey black men only wanting to have sex and money, while black women are sexualized.\nI don’t see a lot of white women prancing around in a hip-hop video. In fact, it’s often black or light-skinned women that are disrespected in hip-hop.\nThere’s also the image that hip-hop artists often convey to the public in the way they dress and act, promoting the ideas of these artists (who are mostly made up of blacks) as “ghetto,” criminals, aggressive thugs, and drug dealers who only come up from the hood.\nWhen people hear and see this, obviously they react to it: most of this is positive, making people believe that it is okay to degrade women, especially black people and those who are light-skinned, or saying the n-word, or believing in the stereotypes that people of colour are all about drugs and violence.\n“Rap can be seen as aggressive and loud, which could make others see blacks in a similar fashion,” Emmanuel Shakur, a third year Sociology major says.\n“Some rappers may rap about drugs, violence and the street or a lifestyle that not many blacks can relate to, but listeners may think is the norm with black people.”\nHaving the kind of power that hip-hop music holds can be dangerous, especially when dealing with worldwide recognition. When people all over the world listen to the genre and the kinds of diction it often uses, many may assume the stereotype is correct, creating a very wrong and misinformed image about blacks.\nThis can create a lot more hate and anger than there needs to be.\nYet, what we don’t get more of in mainstream hip-hop is the political songs that Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, A Tribe Called Quest, or Schoolboy Q makes.\nInstead, we hear the degrading kind, the dangerous kind. And this should be stopped because we don’t need any more drama or hate or stereotypes circling around about the black community.\nWhat we need is more empowerment and the truth about the socio-political issues pinned on blacks in America and the rest of the world.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/supplements/black-history-month/2018/02/17/my-kinky-kurls/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \nJanelle Anastasia Wallen-Charles | Contributor\nFeatured image:\xa0We shouldn’t feel different or ashamed, and instead, feel liberated and proud. | Courtesy of Pexels\nSociety has painted black beauty as “ugly.” It has been imprinted into the minds of little black girls that wearing their natural, kinky curls is something to be ashamed of. We’ve hidden this shame under countless straightening until our hair starts to break off; we spend hundreds of dollars investing in long 18-inch Brazilian hair because we want to meet society’s demands. This is ruining young black girls’ psyche, because our “kinky curls” are considered “not pretty.”\nI spoke with entrepreneur Jacintha Wallen-Charles, and I asked her if little girls are taught to be ashamed of their curls. “Not only society, but the black community itself. It’s small things that we don’t recognize, like ‘you should sleek back your edges,’ or ‘what are you going to do with that hair?’,” she says.\n“Having baby hairs in its natural form is frowned upon by other black girls, because it is seen as ‘not doing your hair.’ Moreover, people of other races often look at our hair and ask: ‘What are you going to do with it?’ as if its natural state isn’t adequate enough to wear in public.”\nI remember when I got my first weave—it was an Onyx, 18-inch, straight, 1B. When I strutted down the aisle, about to graduate, with my weave sewn into my head, I felt beautiful. I no longer felt uncertainty. It gave me an identity. They called me a weava-diva! I could get any colour, style, and length.\nWeaves allow black women to feel beautiful; it allows us to hide from what we were given with. Ask a black woman if she’d rather wear her natural kinky curls or a Tokyo Stylez, custom made, 20-inch, Indian Remy hair, and see what she says.\nThe thing is, we have become so comfortable in the shell that we’ve grown up in, that it gets harder to break out of it.\nI spoke with a fellow employee, Jaya Hance, a black woman who often wears her hair straight. I’ve never seen her hair in it’s natural, kinky state, so I asked her why. “When I was growing up, I was moved from a mixed-culture school to a pure white school, and they didn’t understand my different hair. Because of this they made me feel different, and always pointed it out. This little boy even told me my hair looked like poop,” she says.\nEven if we come from different ethnicities, there should be a boundary where parents should teach their children right from wrong—and they don’t. Due to the bullying, Hance felt ashamed to wear her hair in natural braids, or out in an afro.\nWe have been criticized by the media, by society and even by our peers. But now the media, society and our peers want to take credit for African beauty and culture. Let me educate everyone. When Miley Cyrus started wearing what many called “Space Buns,” it got a lot of hype.\nThese Space Buns, however, are actually called Bantu knots, a hairstyle said to originate from Zulu tribes in southern Africa. When the Kardashians started donning what everyone called “Boxer Braids,” it became a hot new trend. Boxer braids are called Cornrows, and have been found in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara, dating as far back as 3,000 B.C., particularly in the Horn of Africa and West Africa.\nThese hairstyles are not new fashion trends that Miley Cyrus and the Kardashians came up with out of the blue. It shows the twisted way that, on a black girl, it’s seen as ugly—but on a famous white person’s head, it’s seen as trendy and new.\nHow are they going to look down on black beauty, then try to take credit for it? The problem is giving recognition to black women who’ve had these styles forever. Don’t rob us of that recognition. Don’t rob our culture from us.\nBlack women have started to become comfortable without the wigs, sewn-in weaves, and the constant straightening, because we’ve realized that we are beautiful; that we should not care about society’s opinions.\nWallen-Charles stated Viola Davis and Lupita Niyong’o, who are both Oscar-winning black actresses, show their natural hairstyles on the red carpet with confidence. We are seeing the beauty of the curls. We shouldn’t feel different nor ashamed, and instead, feel liberated and proud.\n ']"

With last year’s 12 per cent turnout, the question remains: what went wrong?\nWhen asked why she didn’t vote, an anonymous third-year student replied: “I didn’t know anything about the election, I didn’t know who was running or the parties involved.” A response that seems to be the general consensus among the student population. Some students hold a ‘what would one vote do?’ attitude, while others seem to genuinely lack interest entirely.\nIf those reasons don’t seem to hit the nail on the head, then it’s not from a lack of interest, but more from a lack of knowledge in the political happenings of the school that led to a lackluster election. An anonymous third-year Schulich student didn’t vote because she said nothing ever changes. Last year, YFS’ biggest accomplishment was the procurement of a Fall reading week—something that felt inevitable given the fact every other all post-secondary institution has one.\nDuring the three years I’ve been at York, YFS has been promising a fight for free tuition, with no progress made. The unrealistic goals of the student government not only deter students from participating in school politics, but makes student government seem like a hoax. It seems they spend the year planning for a welcome-back concert that ends with a last-minute obscure artist, who most students have not heard of and have no interest in seeing. They spend a compounding period promising to eradicate tuition. Not only is this a far-fetched dream that is both unreasonable and highly unattainable; it’s a mockery of student government.\nBy championing themselves throughout the year as the voice of students dedicated to making a change, but having no concrete results at the end of the year, shows no progress. How can students become more interested, when there’s nothing for them to see?\nVoting during election period is also a hindrance as there’s no access to online voting. In the age of technology, not providing a means for online voting is almost as counterproductive as promising free tuition, only for OSAP funding to be cut.\nThe YFS does not publicize debates, which effectively keeps students in the dark. No one really knows what’s happening behind the scenes. YFS has been contacted numerous times, but without fail, have always refrained from speaking to the media. How can students be informed or aware of what’s happening in their own student government, when the government fails to disclose such information?\nThe fact of the matter is, we don’t really know what goes on behind closed doors—where our tuition money goes, or whose pocket it goes into. Unfortunately, that just seems to be the way it is. Nothing is permanent and everyone comes and goes (just recently, the University of Ottawa’s administration terminated their agreement with the student union due to corruption).\nSo here’s hoping the new student government does better—while we accept that things will very likely stay exactly the same.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nVictoria Silman |\xa0News Editor\nFeatured Image: The 2018-19 Student Financial Leaders (SFS). | Courtesy of YFile\nA student financial peer support team, established through the government’s Mental Health Services Grant, has helped thousands of students with their financial woes.\nEstablished in September 2018, the service is run by students trained to help peers with their financial concerns. According to Advisor and Deputy Spokesperson for the university, Yanni Dagonas, the team has had a significant impact on helping York students.\n“So far this year, the team saw more than 5,700 queries related to student finances during the fall semester, and have been incredibly impactful in helping York students navigate their concerns in a peer-to-peer setting,” he says.\nStudents were trained during the last two weeks of August with Student Financial Liaison Officer, Sylvia Spizzirri, and Financial Aid Trainer Mary Santoli.\n“The team has been extensively trained on issues related to student financial services so they can provide helpful advice,” Dagonas says.\n“They work closely with York’s student financial advisors to address a variety of questions related to student accounts and OSAP queries, and to provide information and support regarding scholarships and bursaries,” he adds.\nAccording to Dagonas, the team is comprised of six student leaders this year: Isabela Bibulovic, Joanne Ong, Sarah Labib, Lorenzo Panate, Ilia Azari, and Hammad Saif.\nThe university is currently hiring next year’s student financial leaders (SFS) team. With changes to student funding through OSAP, concerns with how students will handle the stress of finances are being addressed by the service.\n“Training will take place every summer before the start of the academic year and will reflect the policies and procedures of the OSAP program,” Dagonas says.\n“York is committed to a mentally healthy campus, providing access to a variety of resources, services, and programs to help manage life’s challenges and enhance well-being,” he adds.\nIn a statement, Ong describes her experience working with the SFS: “It’s been so rewarding to work with students to help them navigate their financial questions. Over the semester we’ve really grown as a team, and not only been able to help students, but also learn more about finances for ourselves.”\nThe support team can be found on the first floor of the Bennett Centre each week on Monday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Tuesday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nShahroze Rauf |\xa0Assistant News Editor\nFeatured Image:\xa0Students will now have the choice to opt-out of paying certain ancillary fees this September. |\xa0Dylan Stoll\nLast week, a meeting regarding the new changes to student tuition and ancillary fees was held.\nBusiness Manager at Excalibur Publications, Eric Rail, attended the meeting. No decisions were made, and everything is still to be determined; however, important information was shared about how opting out of the ancillary fees will work for students.\n“Students would have a chance to opt-out only in September. They wouldn’t be able to opt-out or opt back in at a later date. The number of students who did opt-out would be known early in the school year to allow student organizations to plan accordingly,” says Rail.\nHowever, opting out of these fees will affect a lot more than just the university newspaper. Services such as the Food Support Centre, which helps students who are struggling financially to feed themselves, are funded by student ancillary fees.\nIn a recent interview, outgoing YFS President Rawan Habib expresses her concerns for the negative impact the now optional ancillary fees can have on student services, specifically the Food Support Centre.\n“Every month we see more students registering. It’s something they desperately need,” Habib says.\nHowever, some students are thankful for a chance to be able to choose where their money goes.\n“I appreciate the choice. A lot of students have existing coverage, such as dental and health, with our parents. So, it’s an expense I can avoid,” says fourth-year health studies student Maria Marquez.\nOther students feel differently about how these ancillary fees affect student life, and whether they use certain services or not.\n“If you think about it, by paying to increase the quality of life at York and funding these services, even if you never use them, you in turn improve your own school experience because everyone around you will be positively affected. So, I guess it’s probably a good thing to keep it mandatory,” says fourth-year art history student Sara Amoosoltani.\nAt this time, Rail cannot confirm whether or not it is absolute, but he says students may be able to pick and choose what fees they wish to opt out of.\n“It appears that organizations would be listed individually, so that students would be able to pick which ones to fund, as opposed to picking groups and opting out of funding every organization under one group. Because funding to certain student groups would be curtailed, events like Frosh Week, for instance, would not run for an entire week but perhaps one or two days,” says Rail.\nThese changes can only be seen going forward in the following school year. For now, many student organizations funded by ancillary fees are simply waiting for the ball to drop.\n“In any case, it’s a tough call because by making these fees mandatory, we are asking students to pay for university services they may never use. But at the same time, these services benefit the student body and their quality of life at York as a whole. So the real question is more along the lines of the interests for the individual versus that of the collective,” says Amoosoltani.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nAbdeali Saherwala |\xa0Contributor\nFeatured image courtesy of Arlene Moscovitch\nAli Kazimi, an associate professor in the department of cinema and media arts has won the Governor General Award, one of the most prestigious lifetime achievement awards in Visual and Media Arts.\n“These are the most prestigious prizes in Canada for career achievement in visual and media arts, rewarding accomplished artists that have left their mark and changed art history,” says Tara Lapointe, director outreach and business development at the Canada Council for the Arts.\nTo receive this award, an individual in the field of media and visual arts has to nominate someone based on their achievements, accolades, and projects throughout their life.

It’s an older building; many of the door frames are narrow, and some of the offices are not big enough for wheelchairs to fit inside. Also, there is only one elevator which was built after that fact, and the washrooms are smaller,” he says.\nRozinskis adds: “As far as we can tell, there is no gender neutral-washroom. We have also found out there is a mold problem.”\nProfessor Geoffrey Raume says the fire doors also cause major accessibility issues. “The fire doors do not have accessibility buttons, which is absolutely essential,” he says.\nRozinskis also points out that this change could create accessibility issues for those who take Wheeltrans. According to him, Wheeltrans drops students off near Vari Hall, where the program has an accessible classroom. Should the program move, he says, WheelTrans could move to dropping students off near the Aviva Centre.\n“Wheelchair users can only use the front door of Stong. If WheelTrans is dropping people off close to Stong, they might be dropping them off close to Aviva Centre,” Rozinskis says.\n“To get to campus walk, you have to find the elevator in Calumet to take up to campus walk, but it’s not very well marked,” he adds.\nReferencing the issue of accessibility during snowstorms, specifically that of Ali Imrie, the Osgoode student who posted a video of herself struggling to get her wheelchair across campus following a storm, Rozinskis also points out that the slope going down to Stong College could pose some safety issues, especially with ice. \n“That slope is slippery if it’s not properly maintained,” he says.\nIn a response from the university, Chief Spokesperson of Media Relations Barbara Joy says the Dean of the Faculty of Health has taken steps to organize a meeting with students and staff after receiving an open letter regarding the issue.\n“York is committed to principles of respect, inclusion, and equality of all persons with disabilities across campus.

With the help of a 2017 study conducted by Statistics Canada and Health Canada, researchers at York’s Faculty of Health found links between alcohol and drug use with e-cigarette use today.\n“Given that among all age groups, Canadian youth and young adults have the highest prevalence of e-cigarette use, the objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with e-cigarette use among this population, and to specifically examine the association between alcohol, marijuana and illicit drug use,” says MSc candidate in the Faculty of Health and lead author of the study published in BMC Public Health, Vrati Mehra.\nThe study concludes that more than six percent of young Canadians, aged 15 to 24, use e-cigarettes within the month; 23 percent of which reported to have used an e-cigarette everyday. Almost one in every four of the same age group have reported trying e-cigarettes.\nMehra, who worked on this research with York’s professor Hala Tamim and psychology professor Yvonne Bohr, also reported that over 70 percent of youth that have vaped received their e-cigarettes through friends or relatives. The top reason these users tried e-cigarettes was simply to enjoy the flavours.\nThe debate over vaping and e-cigarettes began when serious cases of youth being hospitalized occurred in America. As of September 23, the American death toll for vaping has increased to nine. Health Canada has also warned Canadians that with vaping and e-cigarette use comes the risk of pulmonary illness. Although there has yet to be cases involving pulmonary illness in Canada, the US reported several.\n“Until now, no single substance or e-cigarette product has been consistently associated with illness,” reported the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the end of August.\nThe CDC has reported approximately 530 cases across the US. Whether or not vaping and e-cigarette use causes pulmonary illness in most cases, the CDC has advised people not to use vaping products.\nAs a response to these new cases, Deputy Premier of Ontario and Minister of Health Christine Elliott issued an order under section 77.7.1 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act. Now, public hospitals in Ontario will be required to give statistical and non-identifying information of vaping health incidents to the Chief Medical Officer of Health.\n“This information, not previously available to the Ministry of Health, will be critical as we continue to engage with leading experts to identify evidence-based solutions that protect our youth from the potential dangers of vaping,” says Elliott.\nFor now, government health agencies and officials are discouraging first-time vapers from using vapes and e-cigarettes, especially youth. Health reporter for the Globe and Mail Andre Picard says that this issue is just too new.\n“Smoking is like jumping off the hundredth floor of a building. Vaping is like jumping out, we just don’t know which floor yet,” says Picard.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nShahroze Rauf | News Editor\nFeatured Image:\xa0One of the Conservative Party posters found on post-secondary campuses.\nLast week, York’s Keele campus saw posters by the Conservative Party of Canada calling students to volunteer. However, the rhetoric used by the posters caused frustration to boil on campus.\n“Because you can only hear the same left-wing talking points from your professors so many times,” the poster states.\nConservative party leader Andrew Scheer replied to the remarks over the poster by saying he does not mean anything regarding his influence over who gets hired in post-secondary positions.\n“It’s a way to get people engaged on campus and it’s meant to be a launching pad for discussions and debate and hearing other points of view,” Scheer says.\nBut this type of rhetoric can be detrimental according to professors at post-secondary institutions.\n“There’s a Conservative message going out that somehow colleges and universities are these indoctrination centres, that they’re more like campuses in Paris in 1968 than they are currently,” says Executive Director of the Canadian Association of Teachers David Robinson. “They are diverse.”\nSome students agree with this sentiment. Second-year journalism student James Mackin could not find the humour in the poster.\n“I just think he’s pandering to people who were already going to vote for him no matter what. But it’ll probably vilify left-leaning students against him as well,” says Mackin.\nHowever, as most students may believe that the posters painted professors as left-wing advocates, there are others who agree with Scheer’s humour.\n“I do not find professors are professional. I can only think of a handful of professors who haven’t passionately expressed their political views. Of the ones who have declared themselves, only one was right-wing. Universities are indoctrination centres,” says third-year student Celia Lewin.\nLewin adds that the posters are meant to mobilize conservative students and recruit volunteers, rather than attracting new voters.\n“Students are a hard demographic to reach, especially because the schools are governed by people who have a personal interest in keeping those students from getting involved,” Lewin says.\nHowever, YFS Director of Environmental Studies Abdeali Saherwala disagrees with Lewin’s opinion. He believes that such an assumption could prove dangerous that social issues and education are all left-wing.\n“I feel that most universities are left-wing. But that is not the institution’s fault nor are professors chosen for their political beliefs. I think with education on history, feminism, equality, equity and racial issues, people become left-wing or people who want to teach become left-wing,” Saherwala says.\nYork University Acting Chief Spokesperson Yanni Dagonas provided a statement from York saying that the university is committed to providing a non-partisan environment and would never comment on the activities of a political party during a federal elections.\n“York considers the privilege afforded by freedom of speech as vitally important to robust and respectful dialogue.

Periodontitis — the stage after gingivitis — results when so much bacterial plaque accumulates on the surface of the teeth that subgingival pockets are formed between the tooth and the gum. With time, the tissue and bone that hold the tooth and gum together deteriorate until the tooth falls out. In those who have reached this stage, P. gingivalis is highly prevalent.\nFascinatingly, researchers have also found the bacterium in the brains of people who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease.\nLeading the research behind this bewildering connection is a pharmaceutical company called Cortexyme. Using mice, they have shown that the subjects given the bacterial infection of P. gingivalis suffered neurological damage — the kind seen in human Alzheimer’s cases.\n\xa0Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, P. gingivalis, and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis,” said Dr. Stephen Dominy, co-founder of Cortexyme and lead author of the paper.\n“This demonstrates the potential for a class of small molecule therapies to change the trajectory of disease.”\nAs strange as this may sound, there have already been a few studies conducted that link oral and mental health. In 2016, a study was conducted that determined those with both Alzheimer’s and gingivitis experienced a more rapid neurodegeneration. Even more astonishingly, the Herpes Type I virus, an STI, has also been linked to Alzheimer’s.\nIt should be noted that more research is required before it can definitively be determined that one disease causes the other. Though an individual may have Alzheimer’s, he or she may also have been avid brushers; though an individual may have lost all of their teeth, he or she may be in perfect mental health.\nA list of preventative measures that one can take to avoid developing the neurodegenerative disease can be found at alzheimers.net. Some of the suggestions include: quitting smoking and drinking; engaging in social activities; giving your brain daily challenges, exercise, a good diet, and managing stress effectively.\nRemember, this may seem like a possible problem too far in the future, but the bad habits you develop as a young adult may stay with you into your later years. It’s better to be in the know now than regretting your ignorance later.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nDylan Stoll | Health Editor\nFeatured Image: Microdosing is defined as the act of taking very small amounts of a particular substance to improve mental well-being. | Courtesy of Pixabay\nA peculiar new trend has caused more than just a stir in the medical community lately. Microdosing is the act of taking drugs such as acid, DMT, mushrooms (psilocybin), or MDMA in very small quantities over the course of a period of time. This method has become the new form of treatment in the fight against depression and anxiety.\nMany are hailing microdosing as the miracle cure, but how can one be sure that one isn’t just needlessly subjecting the brain to mind-altering drugs on a daily basis?\nIn spite of what the general consensus may be, the information behind this phenomena is slim to none. A review in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, written by a team of researchers hoping to define and analyze medicinal microdosing (specifically that of psilocybin) more sufficiently, found little in the way of actual solid data. As such, they feel that it is too early to say anything definitive on the subject.\nDr. Kim Kuypers of the Maastricht University in the Netherlands, the first author of the study, told MedicalNewsToday:\n\xa0Patients might feel attracted by those reports to try it but may actually not be helped by it. We try to emphasize the lack of scientific proof that microdosing is indeed effective in combating certain symptoms and hope that this will give impetus to new lines of research in this area.”\nBut what is microdosing exactly? Professor David Nutt, the Edmond J. Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, is the senior author of the review. After researching the ins and outs of microdosing, Nutt and his team define the phenomena by three main characteristics: very low doses that neither cause perceived change in the imbiber nor impair any normal functioning; multiple, scheduled dose times over a period of time; and a desire to enhance one’s self though microdosing. The amount itself, the ‘microdose,’ is defined as “approximately one-tenth to one-twentieth of a recreational dose.”\nAs for the lack of information related to microdosing, Nutt told MedicalNewsToday that the legalities of the substances are the main deterrent to gathering relevant data, but he and his team hope that the recent publicity will be of use in removing the red tape.\nKuypers holds the same sentiment: “This review is timely as a lot of hope is generated by positive media reports about alleged effects of microdosing.”\nSo, before you pop a few mushroom caps to write your next exam, remember that the data simply isn’t available yet and anecdotal evidence is hardly evidence at all without an empirical approach.\nAs Nutt and his team put it: “Rigorous, placebo-controlled clinical studies need to be conducted with low doses of psilocybin to determine whether there is any evidence for the claims of microdosing.”\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nVictoria Strassler | Copy Editor\nFeatured image courtesy of Pixabay\nThe holiday season can be far from winter nights sitting by the fireplace sipping hot cocoa. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a medley of holidays or none at all, December is often regarded as the “ideal” time of the year. It is a month typically free from university classes and full of non-stop gift-giving and quality time with family and friends.\nHowever, for some, this period is far from being “the most wonderful time of the year” – but why is that? Why is this time of year, synonymous in society with glee and relaxation, often not experienced by many in such a joyous way?\nSome may categorize themselves as having the “holiday blues” during the holiday season.\nAccording to Gordan Flett, Personality & Health professor, the holiday blues is “the idea that a substantial proportion of people feel sad and depressed during the holidays. It also suggests someone who is quite lonely and isolated from others.”\nWoo Kim, International Student & Scholar Services associate director at York, says the holiday blues may be experienced for various reasons for some international students in particular.\nKim describes that an international student may be in a mundane mood because “they may not be going home over the December holidays and won’t get to see their family and friends. This may lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, at least temporarily.”\nAparna Mehta, third-year English student at York, explains how she was impacted during the past holiday season when she was unable to visit her family in Delhi, India.\n“The holiday season tends to be a time for family. As I was unable to travel back home and be with my family last year, I did feel a little unhappy and homesick.”\nKim also explains how “for other students, this may be their first, or one of their first, winter. If they’re from a country where the weather stays fairly mild or hot in winter and stays sunny, the early darkness and grey winter days may cause them to feel less energized and ‘blue.’”\nSarah Irwin-Gardner, York’s Graduate Student Wellness Services manager, lists some factors that generally may impact students’ well-being during the holiday season. One factor Irwin-Gardner mentions is “feeling pressure to produce or experience a ‘perfect’ holiday.” Cassandra Carcasole, third-year English student, describes how she feels this expectation Irwin-Gardner describes.\n\xa0The holidays do cause some stress for me because there are so many things on my mind. I also feel like I need to buy everyone the perfect gift, so there’s always some pressure there,” Carcasole says.\nBrian Villa, third-year Business Administration student, also has experienced this type of pressure. “My stress derives more from what to do on Christmas so that everyone will be happy.”\nIrwin-Gardner discusses how the holiday season may affect a student because they tend to “manage multiple demands on one’s time.” Such demands may include balancing time for holiday shopping and social gatherings with time for final exam and assignment preparation, on top of working a part-time job.\n“Other than being a student, I work two part-time retail jobs. Right now, it’s definitely a lot. I don’t have any days off,” Carcasole says.\n“I am able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments, but it is not easy and definitely not the ideal situation.” Villa adds.\nCharles Matthew Mishiyev, second-year history student, explains how becoming accustomed to a hectic routine is his key to balancing a hectic season.\n“I am somewhat able to balance holiday preparations and celebrations with other commitments because I have worked in retail during the holiday season for two years and have adapted to it,” Mishiyev says.\nAdelaide Dolha, third-year Devised Theatre student, recalls her experience working in retail during the holiday season.\n“Last year when I worked in retail, I had more hours due to more people being needed and these were 5 a.m. shifts. I even had one on Christmas Eve which made me tired for the rest of the day.”\nAnother factor Irwin-Gardner adds to the list of potential reasons for stress during the holidays is an “increase in academic pressure and the effects of working intensely leading up to the holidays.”\n“I am able to balance my schedule as I usually start preparing for the holidays only once exams are done,” Dolha adds.\nIrwin-Gardner also lists “feelings of isolation or feelings of loneliness” as a contributing factor for one’s holiday blues. Silsila Bahrami, fourth-year communication studies student, shares her feelings of discontentment with this time of year.\n“I do not typically enjoy the holiday season. I am not a fan of the cold weather and I usually feel left out of the festivities, as my family does not celebrate the holiday season. I try to keep myself busy during this time period, but it is difficult when most people are away and/or celebrating while I am at home.”\nOther factors listed by Irwin-Gardner include: “Distance from loved ones; increased financial demands/pressures; change in routine; missing loved ones who are far away or no longer alive; seasonal effects on mood (SAD), and difficult or distressing family dynamics.”\nIf you feel as if you may have experienced, or are currently experiencing, the holiday blues, there are other students at York, and in the country, who share your discontentment. But, how many students do the holiday blues impact?\nUnfortunately, there has not been any research conducted that has established a relationship between the holiday season and an increase in stress and unhappiness among students, according to Flett. Nonetheless, there are still students who may feel a sense of unhappiness at one point during the holiday season due to the aforementioned potential factors.\n\xa0I look at the holidays as a time for relaxation and enjoyment for some people, but potentially hellish for others. It is a difficult time for any student who is preoccupied mentally and emotionally with not having done well in the fall term or who is returning to a less than optimal interpersonal situation or who is just feeling isolated and lonely,” Flett explains.\nFlett also further supports the factors listed by Irwin-Gardner as to what could contribute to the holiday blues.\n“It is more stressful for those who are focused on happier times in the past and why aren’t they so happy now. Or, for someone who is overly focused on comparing their holiday experience to the idealized accounts of life over the holidays provided by other people. Also, some people really buy into the notion of the perfect holiday season and they can exhaust themselves and others by trying to live up to an idealized image of how it should be or could be. Others are disquieted because they are so work-obsessed, they don’t know how to respond during times when the focus should be on rest and replenishing oneself.”\nLouise Hartley, York’s Psychology Clinic director, comments on how marketing is also a contributing factor for those experiencing the holiday blues. Marketing has surrounded us with a narrative of how the holidays “should be,” despite it being unattainable for some.\n“The holiday season can be difficult for anyone because there are these expectations built in through the excessive advertising – that this is a ‘happy’ time of year.”\nSo, how can one cope with the holiday blues?\nMayo Clinic shared 10 tips to coping with stress and depression during the holidays. The Mayo Clinic staff recommended that if you are experiencing the holiday blues for any of the aforementioned reasons, you should try to do the following: “acknowledge your feelings; reach out; be realistic; set aside differences; stick to a budget; plan ahead; learn to say no; do not abandon healthy habits; take a breather, and seek professional help if you need it.”\nIf you often feel lonely during the holiday season or you feel yourself feeling in such a way in the next few weeks, registered psychologist, Dr. Ganz Ferrance explained to CTV News that “if you are isolated from your family, find other ways to connect with people. Make time for friends or volunteering to help combat loneliness.”\nKim provides information on how York students will be able to connect with other students staying in the city to avoid feelings of isolation or loneliness this holiday season.\n“International students who aren’t going home and staying in Toronto may want to connect with other international students staying over the break or with domestic students who live locally. This year, York International will be running a few events and outings in the city for any international students staying in Toronto so they can connect with other students staying over the break.”\nThe Mayo Clinic staff put it best: “Don’t let the holidays become something you dread. Instead, take steps to prevent the stress and depression that can descend during the holidays. Learn to recognize your holiday triggers, such as financial pressures or personal demands, so you can combat them before they lead to a meltdown. With a little planning and some positive thinking, you can find peace and joy during the holidays.”\nIt is very important to reach out for support if you have concerns about your mental health or wellness during the holiday season or at any point during the year.

Images of students marching to American Embassies or toppling statues of some tyrant comes to mind when we think of student activism. This is inherently wrong.\nIn young students who, for the first time, hear their voices in society, they develop an impulse to correct the oppressive ways of the old. Our education, which bores us to death, does not fulfill us intellectually; this produces a loud and boisterous beast of a mob that overtakes all rationale.\nWestern civilization owes its success to free discourse and debate. In fact, this is the exact notion that universities should aim to do — this is the only value that we as students should learn. If someone honestly believes in a cause, or in the case of the events of last week’s events, against a cause, they should not chant and try to silence others. This will only regress us to the barbaric past we are trying to avoid.\nIf you believe someone’s message is wrong and/or detrimental, then prove it. Set up a booth, and call people to hear the facts.\nThere needs to be a shift in the understanding of student activism. Let’s change hoisted fists as logos for organizations (cough, YFS) to pens and microphones. Let’s take up booths rather than banners, as this and nothing else, will drive us forward.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nMatt Render | Contributor\nFeatured Image: Many York students from Hong Kong have been called back to York out of concern for their safety back home. | Courtesy of Fatema Ali/Excalibur\nWith protests surging in Hong Kong, many residents have had their lives put into danger. Some of these residents are students who are there on exchange programs from Canadian universities.\nAs a result, York and other Canadian universities have requested that the exchange students come back to Canada out of concern for their safety.\nAfter Hong Kong was returned to China after being a British colony in 1997, Hong Kong still maintained a certain level of independence as a separate entity from China.\nSince June, protests have escalated as Hong Kong has put forward a bill which threatens to have criminals from Hong Kong extradited to China for punishment.\nThe protests have gradually become worse. They have been characterized by Chinese officials as riots and have led to many protestors being killed, injured, and detained.\n“I think it is reasonable for them to call back the students,” says Kevin Gu, first-year language student. “The protestors have attacked the universities,” he adds, emphasizing that the severity of the protests were putting Canadian students’ lives in danger.\nOne student, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of a reaction from the Chinese government, had a different outlook.\n\xa0Canadians are safe in China. Canada has always been viewed positively by the Chinese, ever since Mao. This is all being blown out of proportion. China doesn’t see Canada the same way as other Western countries,” says the student.\n“If the protests continue to grow more violent, based on history, it could lead to a civil war, and Canadian students could be caught in the crossfire,” says third-year history student Eric Solomon.\n“I don’t know how bad it actually is, but studying abroad is stressful enough, having this going on would take a toll on one’s mental health,” adds Solomon. “Even if Canadian students aren’t being targeted, they’re getting affected one way or another. Everybody is hurting. No one wins.”\nFirst-year interdisciplinary studies student Katherine Mu challenged whether the overall concern from Canadian universities was for the best of all involved.\n“Are we valuing some lives more than others? Why don’t we focus on creating a safer environment for everybody rather than just calling these students back? For any university or country to only call back their people from a situation like that shows they are valuing some lives more than others,” says Mu.\nDespite being across the world, many students at York are engaging in discussion and protesting around the current situation in Hong Kong. For now, all students can do is hope for the safety and well-being of those affected by the conflict.\n ', ' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nShahroze Rauf | News Editor\nFeatured Image: The event was held at the Bear Pit where students wrote letters to government officials across the world. | Courtesy of Shahroze Rauf/Excalibur\nAmnesty International at York invited students to write letters to advocate for human rights across the globe.\nThe event, held on November 19 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., saw students arrive throughout the day to write for a variety of specific issues.\n“Amnesty International holds Write for Rights every single year, where they pick ten cases — different cases around the world in different countries,” says third-year law and society student and Vice-President of Amnesty International at York, Nada Abdel-Maksoud.\nThese cases will often involve political prisoners and human rights injustices, according to Abdel-Maksoud. Then, students and supporters will come together and write to the governments who are committing said human rights violations to try to invoke change.\nThe event garnered a good amount of attention last year, sending out just under six million letters and messages from over 200 countries.\n“The past years, we’ve had to send out over a hundred letters,” Abdel-Maksoud says, discussing the York extension’s impact. “In the years I’ve seen the event happen, it has attracted a lot of attention, so we’re glad about that, and it really helps because it seems like such a small thing but it makes a big difference.”\nAnd the event has made a difference. In 2014, film director Oleg Sentsov was arrested by Russian authorities on charges of plotting terrorism acts. Amnesty International, alongside other human rights organizations, took to his side to defend him and label the accusations by the Russian court as fabrications.\nAfter being released on September 7, 2019, Sentsov thanked activists and people who wrote letters during his incarceration.\n“I brought two bags. The second contained 22 kilograms of paper, mostly letters. I did not throw a single one out. I brought them all and kept them, as they are so dear to me. There are books, notebooks, a big pack, 15 of them. They are completely filled with writing.”\nAbdel-Maksoud says the letters are not directly connected to the remediation of these human rights violations; however, they could be a factor that help individuals around the world.\n“Those letters, because they are so personal, you can write them to the people facing that injustice or the government itself. It really makes a difference because people get to read, people that are in solidarity with them, and governments get to see how much people want these injustices solved,” says Abdel-Maksoud.\nYork students attended for their own personal reasons, and explained how they were touched by specific cases that Amnesty International was working on.\n\xa0I, myself, wrote to the case about people arrested for helping refugees in Greece. They volunteered for a rescue mission, and were arrested. Although they’ve been released on bail, they are pending charges,” says fourth-year communication studies student, Olivia Graham.\n“This seems like such a small thing, and people always seem to think that writing letters and signing petitions are small actions. It’s the most basic form of mobilization for your rights and the rights of others,” says Abdel-Maksoud, urging others to attend the Write for Rights event.\nThe official event by Amnesty International will take place on December 10.\n ']",['https://www.excal.on.ca/features/2019/11/28/is-this-really-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year/'],"[' York University Community Newspaper \n\xa0\nVictoria Strassler | Copy Editor\nFeatured image courtesy of Pixabay\nThe holiday season can be far from winter nights sitting by the fireplace sipping hot cocoa.

Or, for someone who is overly focused on comparing their holiday experience to the idealized accounts of life over the holidays provided by other people. Also, some people really buy into the notion of the perfect holiday season and they can exhaust themselves and others by trying to live up to an idealized image of how it should be or could be. Others are disquieted because they are so work-obsessed, they don’t know how to respond during times when the focus should be on rest and replenishing oneself.”\nLouise Hartley, York’s Psychology Clinic director, comments on how marketing is also a contributing factor for those experiencing the holiday blues. Marketing has surrounded us with a narrative of how the holidays “should be,” despite it being unattainable for some.\n“The holiday season can be difficult for anyone because there are these expectations built in through the excessive advertising – that this is a ‘happy’ time of year.”\nSo, how can one cope with the holiday blues?\nMayo Clinic shared 10 tips to coping with stress and depression during the holidays. The Mayo Clinic staff recommended that if you are experiencing the holiday blues for any of the aforementioned reasons, you should try to do the following: “acknowledge your feelings; reach out; be realistic; set aside differences; stick to a budget; plan ahead; learn to say no; do not abandon healthy habits; take a breather, and seek professional help if you need it.”\nIf you often feel lonely during the holiday season or you feel yourself feeling in such a way in the next few weeks, registered psychologist, Dr. Ganz Ferrance explained to CTV News that “if you are isolated from your family, find other ways to connect with people. Make time for friends or volunteering to help combat loneliness.”\nKim provides information on how York students will be able to connect with other students staying in the city to avoid feelings of isolation or loneliness this holiday season.\n“International students who aren’t going home and staying in Toronto may want to connect with other international students staying over the break or with domestic students who live locally. This year, York International will be running a few events and outings in the city for any international students staying in Toronto so they can connect with other students staying over the break.”\nThe Mayo Clinic staff put it best: “Don’t let the holidays become something you dread. Instead, take steps to prevent the stress and depression that can descend during the holidays. Learn to recognize your holiday triggers, such as financial pressures or personal demands, so you can combat them before they lead to a meltdown. With a little planning and some positive thinking, you can find peace and joy during the holidays.”\nIt is very important to reach out for support if you have concerns about your mental health or wellness during the holiday season or at any point during the year. York University’s Student Counselling & Development Services offers walk-in counselling Monday to Friday between 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. More information can be found at counselling.students.yorku.ca\nThe Good2Talk Helpline is a free, confidential helpline for post-secondary students in Ontario that is available 24/7 as well.\n ']"

Despite all that, my frozen Halloweens are some of my favourite childhood memories, even when I had to wear snow pants and a parka over all of my cute costumes. Over the past three years, with living in Toronto, I’ve gotten the chance to experience a warmer, more social Halloween at York. You can walk outside in your insufficient costume without being camouflaged with snow, and you can wear heels outside without worrying for the safety of your toes. Because of COVID-19, I am back in my snowy town, surrounded by an incredibly disappointed family. Halloween was always my family’s favourite holiday; we’d dress up our house like it was a Blumhouse set.

Big credit to my parents for being able to stop us from fighting for two seconds and pose for a picture. (Courtesy of Shivam Sachdeva)\nHalloween has been a pretty eventful time of year for me since as early as I can remember. Whether it was the innocent days of dressing up in a costume I’d planned months in advance or being taken trick-or-treating by my parents, or even all the fleeting memories captured inside bars and house parties years later, the 31st of October has always been far from dull. This year however, as we all know, the usual celebrations won’t be possible. But rather than sulk about what cannot be, I am trying my best to accept the situation simply for what it is: a pause on life. The more social activities of Halloween have gone on for years before this pandemic and there’s no reason to think they won’t continue once we’re out of this mess. This year, I’ve put up some Halloween decorations around the house to keep the spirit up as much as possible, but the holiday will likely be a lot more laid back and family-oriented than it has been before. Scary movies, board games, and lots of candy will likely be on the agenda. And though it isn’t what I would have expected going into this year, I am looking forward to all of it.\xa0\xa0\nHALLOWEEN CANCELLED…TWICE!Sergiy Slipchenko, Sports Editor\nHalloween was not something we celebrated or even heard of in Ukraine. When my family moved to Toronto, in October of all months, I had quite the puzzling experience. I was suddenly immersed into the spooky atmosphere already well underway at school. I was already frightened of school as I didn’t know English and everything seemed foreign to me — the fact the walls were plastered with paper cutout witches, skeletons, and gravestones was not helping. Eventually I understood what the holiday was about so I was able to relax and enjoy the traditions — pounds of free candy were certainly persuasive. Although I enjoyed the holiday, it never caught on as a yearly tradition. Many years went by and I have yet to properly go trick-or-treating, until this year — or so I thought.\xa0\nMy three-year-old daughter was excited to go in her Elsa dress (after some negotiation I got picked as Kristoff instead of Olaf). We planned to go out and reap free candy, and quite honestly I was excited to go out for the first time as well. Unfortunately, the news of COVID-19 resurging crushed those dreams and I was dreading how to explain to a three-year-old that it may not be safe to go this year. However, just a week before Halloween, fate did its thing and disappointment was avoided…kind of. After watching a “scary” Halloween episode of her favourite cartoon, she has condemned “Lalloween” (as she calls it) and decided we will be skipping it in favour of Christmas. So while you celebrate at home with pumpkins, scary movies, and candy, you now understand why my living room has a christmas tree, christmas music, and a strict ban on all Halloween paraphernalia. Hopefully next year the allure of candy will outweigh any fear and I will finally get to go trick-or-treating.\nMY SPOOKY SEASON BIRTHDAYCéleste A. LaCroix, Arts Editor\nSome brief decorations in my house since our celebrations haven’t happened yet. (Courtesy of Céleste A. LaCroix)\nWhile Halloween has been cancelled around the world, it seems like my roommates didn’t get the memo. I’m not sure if it’s their Halloween spirit or if they’re just trying to make my Halloween birthday feel special, but the second our Friends-giving dinner was over, they turned our whole house into a miniature Halloween Haunt. Believe me when I say it, theatre kids do not take decorating lightly. Halloween happens to be only a day away from my birthday, so naturally, I’ve hosted the Halloween parties every year since I stopped trick-or-treating. The only difference this year will be the size. Instead of inviting over half my program and filling my house with strangers, I’ll be celebrating both my birthday and Halloween with my roommates and girlfriend. We’ve been planning activities like pumpkin carving and costume contests because apparently the global pandemic is no match for Spooky Season. I have no doubt that this year will be different, but certainly not less special, as my friends made sure of that.\xa0\nFROM WALLOW’S EVE TO ALL HALLOWS’ EVEBhabna Banerjee, Creative Director\nOur Film & TV themed Halloween party, 2019. (Courtesy of Bhabna Banerjee)\nFairly new to the country, the excitement of this day didn’t quite strike me for the longest time. Perhaps, it was because the holiday coincided with my father’s birthday, or that it coincided with the largest festival in my culture — each Halloween spent here meant that I was missing the two most important days of my year, thousands of miles away from my family and friends. And no surprise there, but pretty much every year, I chose to wallow. It’s clear that in my short time here I haven’t created any traditions, but after three years of avoiding this day, last Halloween I finally gave it a try to spend the day with my friends rather than alone on my couch (even though this might have been the spookier option). I commuted an hour to attend a good ol’ Village Halloween party that a group of film kids religiously hosted, and not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was also transported to the most extraordinarily decorated house (apparently film kids too, do not take set decoration lightly). To stay on-brand, we spent the night dressed as and talking about film characters, and I left quite happy after having a chance to channel my inner Cher Horowitz. Granted, this year I’ll be back to my old ways of spending the holiday cooped up on my couch alone, spooked out by absolutely everything going on outside. I now have fond memories of this holiday to hold on to, from a time that was spent here, with a new (and pretty amazing) family.\n \nInterested in becoming a contributor?

But alas, here we are — more exhausted than ever (mostly because of the mentally draining life of stagnicity), and stressed about the economy, our health, and our well-being.\nTalking about mental health is now, more than ever, critical for our population. For students like Wasifa Noshin, a third-year theatre production and design student, mental health has been a prevalent concept throughout her life — something that I’m sure many students find relatable.\xa0\n“My perspective on mental health has changed quite a lot over the past few months and years,” Noshin says. “When I was younger, I would always put my mental health on the back burner even though I was simultaneously struggling with multiple mental health struggles of my own and I chose not to prioritize it.”\xa0\nWith Noshin’s perspective on mental health shifting throughout her life, it begs the question of whether mental health is more prominent now, or whether it’s just talked about more.\xa0\nAssistant Professor Jeffrey Wardell, who specializes in substance-use behaviour, says that some mental disorders, such as depression, may be on the rise.\n“There’s some debate as to what might account for apparent increases in the prevalence of mental disorders — it may be that the mental health issues are becoming more prevalent, but it may also be that more people feel comfortable talking about their mental health and are more likely to seek out a diagnosis and treatment because of increased awareness of these issues,” Wardell says.\nIn addition to this, Wardell notes that mental health disorders may be more easily recognizable than they used to be — even the definition of mental disorders has changed over time. “Overall, it’s complicated,” Wardell says, “but at the end of the day I do think there’s a greater recognition of the prevalence of mental health issues and more public discussions of these issues, which is an important change.”\n“I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”\nIn regards to reducing stigma, Professor Marina Morrow of the faculty of health says that, in a positive sense, perhaps the reason for higher diagnoses is the “decreasing stigma around mental health for some forms of mental health problems,” most prominently with depression and anxiety. In addition to this, Morrow notes that the more normalized the language, the higher the possibility that people are “always influenced by our social and economic context,” where “people are more likely to use the language of mental health as a way of expressing any kind of distress.”\nEchoing these sentiments, Professor Megan J. Davies of the department of social science, who is also involved in Madness Canada, adds, “I see a whole new focus on and interest in mental health and addictions. Though for sure there is a widespread distress now during the pandemic, I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”\nFor Noshin, mental health troubles stem from her busy life — something she says she has developed through societal values. “Part of the issue I think stems from the culture that I’m a part of: the hustle and grind culture — this culture promotes ambitions, yet with a huge flaw. The flaw is that our ambitions, accomplishments, and success comes at the cost of our health and mental health.\n“We live in a world where being a part of this culture has resulted in me compulsively checking my emails, social media, and phone notifications at 12 a.m. instead of getting proper sleep — the stress of living up to my bar of accomplishments and having to increase it every time by coming up with new and more innovative ideas,” she adds. “Meanwhile my mind was struggling beyond repair and I just started losing it in my downtime, and lashing out at the wrong people for no reason.”\nIn a statement from Active Minds at York University (AM@Y), a student-run organization dedicated to providing students a safe space to talk about mental health, they say that society definitely seems to be more comfortable talking about mental health.\n“Mediums like the media are normalizing mental health issues and talking about it, so that makes people more willing to talk about it as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that at the same time there is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect,” they state.\xa0\nRegarding the last year, one parched of serotonin, AM@Y adds, “Because of COVID-19, people are feeling more isolated, and this is affecting their mental health. So we would not say it is one or the other; both of these go hand in hand. There is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect and we are more willing to talk about them due to the stigma being reduced.”\nAlongside this, according to a media release published by the Canadian Mental Health Association in June 2020, “the pandemic has caused intense stress and disruption for all people in Canada, and is causing pronounced mental health concerns, including suicidal thoughts and feelings, in various subgroups of the population.”\xa0\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association adds that in 2019, 2.5 per cent of Canadians said they had thoughts or feelings of suicide, while in May 2020, that number rose to six per cent.\nAlongside concerns of suicidal thoughts, substance abuse may be on the rise. “There is some research showing that alcohol and other substance use increased among certain individuals early in the pandemic, but again this is mixed,” Wardell says.\nWardell’s research from the early stages of the pandemic suggest that sound people decreased their alcohol consumption, “probably because they were staying home instead of going to bars and parties,” but also others increased consumption to deal with the stress of the pandemic.\nThe CBC recently reported that Canadians overall have increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, something that Canada’s chief of public health, Dr. Theresa Tam, noted in a statement released on December 31, 2020.\xa0\nWardell adds that research has indicated the increase in alcohol consumption has resulted from “depression and social disconnection, as well as being a parent with young children at home, were associated with drinking to cope during the pandemic.”\nHe adds: “There are definitely some risk factors that may make certain individuals more susceptible to experience drug or alcohol problems during COVID-19.\nIn addition to the pandemic’s increased strain on Canadians, a poll conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies found that the mental health of women has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\xa0\nMorrow notes that even the women in her life are experiencing increased hardships as a result of the pandemic. “I even see it amongst a pretty privileged group at the university with my colleagues. Many of them have to be in these meetings all day long and they’ve got small children they’re trying to look after. Their partners may not be working outside of the home or may not be available to support them. They might be single single moms,” she says.\nMorrow adds: “Statistically we’re seeing a lot. I think in regards to Canada, women are giving up their jobs more readily than men and more likely to take on the family responsibilities — and not just at home, but the elder care piece, I think is huge in this as well. The fact that we’ve got a heightened anxiety around our older population, it’s no doubt that women have taken on the care and the concerns on this piece.”\n“Women are giving up their jobs more readily than men and more likely to take on the family responsibilities.”\nBut, Morrow states, other marginalized communities have also borne the brunt of the stress the pandemic has put on the population.\xa0\n“I think if you start to look at race and class into that conversation more, there’s so many people who just don’t have the option to work from home,” she says. “Many of those are women who are working in the health care sector or working as migrant workers in the fields and in agriculture, or in factories. Most sectors are also being terribly impacted, but I think it’s important to look at all those different factors to best understand the impact of the pandemic.”\nDavies adds that our elderly population has also faced increased hardships, pointing out the issues of for-profit long-term care homes (LTC) in Ontario. LTC homes have been a huge topic of conversation in the media over the past year, with detrimental issues coming to light amid COVID-19.\xa0\n“Think about how elderly people with dementia are doubly disadvantaged, and consider what they might do to treat these elders like human beings,“ Davies says.\nOn the other side of the world, Vipul Singh, an international student remotely studying documentary and non-fiction media production at Seneca@York from his home in India, says that COVID-19 has had profound impacts on his community.\xa0\nWith less regulation and more exploitation, Singh says that life has continued as normal due to fear of people losing their livelihood.\xa0\n“Most of the people were very, very stressed out and in fear of what they might lose, such as their jobs — my father included,” he says. “There is this one mindset that goes around and it’s that we have to die anyway, but it’s better to die with COVID-19 than from having an empty stomach. Some of the people I know went to work even during the lockdown.”\xa0\nSingh adds that these people would say: “If I have to die, I left because of hunger. If I do not go to work, I lose my job. And if I don’t have my job, I won’t be able to feed my family.”\nWith this, Singh says that his community has returned back to normal. “It does not seem as if there is a pandemic going on. There are crowds on the street, nobody actually cares about a\xa0 pandemic anymore in the area that I live, in the state that I live, because everywhere I’m going I see a lot of crowds”.\nBut with life returning back to normal in his community, Singh still attends classes via Zoom, despite the frustrating complication of having an unstable internet connection due to his remote town.\nSingh says with his remote location, his internet isn’t necessarily strong enough to get the full experience of a successful Zoom lecture. “If somebody asks if I had to choose between offering classes in person or online classes, I would absolutely go for in-person classes because it has more benefits,” he says.\nWith a lack of social interaction taking hold throughout the world, Children’s Mental Health Ontario has reported that there are increased issues with youth mental health and the pandemic response.\xa0\nWhen asked about increased issues of mental health in students on campus, the AM@Y states they cannot be certain about the effects on the rest of the community, but note their own experiences have proved to be difficult.\nThe members of AM@Y have also noted uncertainties have increased their stress and anxiety levels. “We speak purely from our experiences. A lot of us feel an uncertainty due to COVID-19. There is a suspense that makes people anxious. COVID-19 is like a traumatic experience and the uncertainty of it is more likely to make us feel anxious and depressed,” they say.\n“A lot of us feel an uncertainty due to COVID-19. There is a suspense that makes people anxious. COVID-19 is like a traumatic experience and the uncertainty of it is more likely to make us feel anxious and depressed.”\n“There will definitely be a long-term impact to the mental health of individuals once COVID-19 is over. And like we said, people feel more of a disconnect that makes them feel isolated which affects their mental health,” AM@Y adds.\nFor some students, such as Noshin and Singh, studying from home hasn’t necessarily been more taxing, but it does come with its challenges.\n“It has slowed me down a lot, but that’s a good thing, I think,” Noshin says. “It has really allowed me to step back from the hustle and grind lifestyle. I can really go at my own pace now and it really allowed me to spend time by myself in a productive way.”\nSingh adds that, despite issues arising with online learning, staying home still hasn’t proved to be too taxing.\n“In the past two or three months I have become a very relaxed person,” Singh says. “I’m the kind of person who hates to be at home everyday — so I’m used to traveling a lot, whether it is going to my friend’s house or any other place. Being at home I became lazy, to be honest.”\nWith the difficulties of living in a virtual world, AM@Y says working remotely has made it difficult to gauge the impact COVID-19 has had on the York community.\n“There have always been mental health issues, and because of COVID-19, there have been more factors that add on to pre-existing mental health issues,” they say. “However, we cannot speak with certainty that students have been facing more mental health issues as we have not been able to reach students that easily because of the online system.”\nDavies says that moving forward there is still room for improvement, in language, such as the stigmatization of the word ‘crazy,’ but also treating those with mental health disorders better.\xa0\n“I think overall the greater openness to talking about mental health is really helpful. The stigma is less, but the discrimination against people with mental health differences is no less at all,” Davies says. “They are still largely excluded from the labour market, have difficulty finding housing, and don’t even get me started on how we treat our elders with dementia.”\nAM@Y adds that, going forward, they ask the community to be more open in the conversation about mental health. “People should know they are not alone in the issues they are struggling with. Another thing to point out is that if you are speaking to someone it is important to be empathetic towards others’ experiences and not to be judgemental or insensitive. It is important to be open and accepting,” they say.\n“Also, it is important to understand that just even letting people know you’re there for them is such a big gesture.

I research a lot of books, and then I start reading them.”\nWhile students may have some outlets for relieving stress, there are still resources available for those who need them.\xa0\nWardell encourages more open discussions about mental health and addiction, as it “is important to raise awareness and decrease stigma around these issues.\xa0\nHe adds, “I would want readers to know that if they are struggling with their own mental health or substance use that they are not alone.

But alas, here we are — more exhausted than ever (mostly because of the mentally draining life of stagnicity), and stressed about the economy, our health, and our well-being.\nTalking about mental health is now, more than ever, critical for our population. For students like Wasifa Noshin, a third-year theatre production and design student, mental health has been a prevalent concept throughout her life — something that I’m sure many students find relatable.\xa0\n“My perspective on mental health has changed quite a lot over the past few months and years,” Noshin says. “When I was younger, I would always put my mental health on the back burner even though I was simultaneously struggling with multiple mental health struggles of my own and I chose not to prioritize it.”\xa0\nWith Noshin’s perspective on mental health shifting throughout her life, it begs the question of whether mental health is more prominent now, or whether it’s just talked about more.\xa0\nAssistant Professor Jeffrey Wardell, who specializes in substance-use behaviour, says that some mental disorders, such as depression, may be on the rise.\n“There’s some debate as to what might account for apparent increases in the prevalence of mental disorders — it may be that the mental health issues are becoming more prevalent, but it may also be that more people feel comfortable talking about their mental health and are more likely to seek out a diagnosis and treatment because of increased awareness of these issues,” Wardell says.\nIn addition to this, Wardell notes that mental health disorders may be more easily recognizable than they used to be — even the definition of mental disorders has changed over time. “Overall, it’s complicated,” Wardell says, “but at the end of the day I do think there’s a greater recognition of the prevalence of mental health issues and more public discussions of these issues, which is an important change.”\n“I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”\nIn regards to reducing stigma, Professor Marina Morrow of the faculty of health says that, in a positive sense, perhaps the reason for higher diagnoses is the “decreasing stigma around mental health for some forms of mental health problems,” most prominently with depression and anxiety. In addition to this, Morrow notes that the more normalized the language, the higher the possibility that people are “always influenced by our social and economic context,” where “people are more likely to use the language of mental health as a way of expressing any kind of distress.”\nEchoing these sentiments, Professor Megan J. Davies of the department of social science, who is also involved in Madness Canada, adds, “I see a whole new focus on and interest in mental health and addictions. Though for sure there is a widespread distress now during the pandemic, I think that new medical diagnoses are kind of like new motorways — build them and cars will fill them up.”\nFor Noshin, mental health troubles stem from her busy life — something she says she has developed through societal values. “Part of the issue I think stems from the culture that I’m a part of: the hustle and grind culture — this culture promotes ambitions, yet with a huge flaw. The flaw is that our ambitions, accomplishments, and success comes at the cost of our health and mental health.\n“We live in a world where being a part of this culture has resulted in me compulsively checking my emails, social media, and phone notifications at 12 a.m. instead of getting proper sleep — the stress of living up to my bar of accomplishments and having to increase it every time by coming up with new and more innovative ideas,” she adds. “Meanwhile my mind was struggling beyond repair and I just started losing it in my downtime, and lashing out at the wrong people for no reason.”\nIn a statement from Active Minds at York University (AM@Y), a student-run organization dedicated to providing students a safe space to talk about mental health, they say that society definitely seems to be more comfortable talking about mental health.\n“Mediums like the media are normalizing mental health issues and talking about it, so that makes people more willing to talk about it as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that at the same time there is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect,” they state.\xa0\nRegarding the last year, one parched of serotonin, AM@Y adds, “Because of COVID-19, people are feeling more isolated, and this is affecting their mental health. So we would not say it is one or the other; both of these go hand in hand. There is a rise in mental health issues due to a disconnect and we are more willing to talk about them due to the stigma being reduced.”\nAlongside this, according to a media release published by the Canadian Mental Health Association in June 2020, “the pandemic has caused intense stress and disruption for all people in Canada, and is causing pronounced mental health concerns, including suicidal thoughts and feelings, in various subgroups of the population.”\xa0\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association adds that in 2019, 2.5 per cent of Canadians said they had thoughts or feelings of suicide, while in May 2020, that number rose to six per cent.\nAlongside concerns of suicidal thoughts, substance abuse may be on the rise. “There is some research showing that alcohol and other substance use increased among certain individuals early in the pandemic, but again this is mixed,” Wardell says.\nWardell’s research from the early stages of the pandemic suggest that sound people decreased their alcohol consumption, “probably because they were staying home instead of going to bars and parties,” but also others increased consumption to deal with the stress of the pandemic.\nThe CBC recently reported that Canadians overall have increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, something that Canada’s chief of public health, Dr. Theresa Tam, noted in a statement released on December 31, 2020.\xa0\nWardell adds that research has indicated the increase in alcohol consumption has resulted from “depression and social disconnection, as well as being a parent with young children at home, were associated with drinking to cope during the pandemic.”\nHe adds: “There are definitely some risk factors that may make certain individuals more susceptible to experience drug or alcohol problems during COVID-19.\nIn addition to the pandemic’s increased strain on Canadians, a poll conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies found that the mental health of women has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\xa0\nMorrow notes that even the women in her life are experiencing increased hardships as a result of the pandemic. “I even see it amongst a pretty privileged group at the university with my colleagues.

The Ministry of Health reported over the weekend that this big decline in case numbers has resulted in a provincial positivity rate of 1.4 per cent.\xa0\nThis relief in cases can be most appreciated within our hospitals, as COVID-19 hospitalizations saw a drop from 378 on Friday to 336 patients being cared for as of Saturday. Of these patients, 335 are in ICUs and 221 are currently requiring a ventilator to assist in breathing.\xa0\n“Where I work, critically unstable hematology patients requiring ICU admissions for care were having to be triaged in order for them to receive care, sometimes outside of a formal ICU setting due to all the COVID-19 cases we had to take care of,” says Anju Vyas, a pharmacist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.\n“I’ve never witnessed such an acute demand on an already strained nursing, physician and other allied health care staff resource pool.”\xa0\nThe downtrend of case numbers has allowed us to enjoy some freedoms again, as Stage 1 of reopenings began on June 11. This first stage — afforded to us as 60 per cent of adults received one dose — means we can once again gather outdoors with up to 10 people, visit patios, dine with up to four people per table, and shop at non-essential and essential businesses within 15 and 25 per cent capacity respectively. Additional details on what is currently permitted can be found on Ontario’s COVID-19 website.\xa0\nStage 2, set to begin once 70 per cent of adults have received one dose and 20 per cent of Ontario is fully vaccinated, will expand outdoor gatherings to 25 people and indoor ones to five people while patio tables will see an increase to six people.\xa0\nNon-essential retail capacity will also move up to 25 per cent. Amusement parks, town fairs, water parks, sports leagues, and cinemas will be permitted to open during this stage as well. The government states that each stage will be active for at least 21 days before moving onto the next.\xa0\nAs of Monday, 20 per cent of Ontarians have been fully vaccinated — the mark needed to move to the second stage. The province has also announced that it will be moving up second dose appointments for a number of groups shortly, and by June 28 all adults will have the opportunity to get their second dose.\xa0\nWhat remains concerning, however, is the highly transmissible variants currently circulating around the world. Ontario health officials have identified approximately 400 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 variants, the majority of which appear to be the Alpha variant first discovered in the United Kingdom.\xa0\n“With more and more people starting to get vaccinated, I feel safer than I have in a long time. I am, however, concerned with whether or not the vaccines will be able to protect us against the Delta variant,” says third-year health science student Marc Delado.\xa0\nThe Delta variant, first found in India, also remains at large. Last week, Canada saw a 66 per cent increase in COVID-19 cases attributed to the Delta variant, with case counts totaling just over 2,000 as of Friday, June 18. The Delta hotspot list also has some new additions and now includes Toronto, Peel Region, York Region, Waterloo, Porcupine, Halton Region, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, Durham, Hamilton and Simcoe Muskoka.\xa0\n“Recent numbers suggest that two doses of the vaccine are still fairly effective against combatting this variant, however, there is still a clear decline in the effectiveness in comparison to combatting the Alpha variant,” says Swar Shah, a first-year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.\xa0\n“For example, the Pfizer vaccine has been stated in a recent study to be 92 per cent effective against the Alpha variant, but 79 per cent against the Delta. However, it is undeniable that the progression of vaccination in Canada is comforting, and I would not believe that any additional measures would need to be taken at this time,” says Shah.\xa0\nWhile accelerated appointment availability has been offered to these locations, it has unfortunately not been followed up with an increased share of vaccine supply.\xa0\nThe Waterloo Region has been hit particularly hard with the Delta variant, with Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang stating that residents should assume it is the “dominant strain circulating in the region.”\xa0\nProxy data for the region has led health officials to believe that 65 per cent of cases between June 6 and 12 were the Delta variant.\xa0\n“I believe that our hope in controlling the Delta variant lies in not backing off on our current vaccination efforts, including appropriate allocation to existing and upcoming hotspots,” says Vyas.\xa0\nOntario and Canada as a whole continue to make solid progress in combatting the pandemic, however, factors like the variants serve as a reminder that it is still far from over. The safest course of action remains following health guidelines such as regularly washing our hands, wearing masks, and maintaining social distance while also staying within the current regulations of Stage 1.\n \nShivam is a driven undergraduate Political Science student with a penchant for health, wellness, and communicating it to people.

The Delta hotspot list also has some new additions and now includes Toronto, Peel Region, York Region, Waterloo, Porcupine, Halton Region, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, Durham, Hamilton and Simcoe Muskoka.\xa0\n“Recent numbers suggest that two doses of the vaccine are still fairly effective against combatting this variant, however, there is still a clear decline in the effectiveness in comparison to combatting the Alpha variant,” says Swar Shah, a first-year medical student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.\xa0\n“For example, the Pfizer vaccine has been stated in a recent study to be 92 per cent effective against the Alpha variant, but 79 per cent against the Delta. However, it is undeniable that the progression of vaccination in Canada is comforting, and I would not believe that any additional measures would need to be taken at this time,” says Shah.\xa0\nWhile accelerated appointment availability has been offered to these locations, it has unfortunately not been followed up with an increased share of vaccine supply.\xa0\nThe Waterloo Region has been hit particularly hard with the Delta variant, with Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang stating that residents should assume it is the “dominant strain circulating in the region.”\xa0\nProxy data for the region has led health officials to believe that 65 per cent of cases between June 6 and 12 were the Delta variant.\xa0\n“I believe that our hope in controlling the Delta variant lies in not backing off on our current vaccination efforts, including appropriate allocation to existing and upcoming hotspots,” says Vyas.\xa0\nOntario and Canada as a whole continue to make solid progress in combatting the pandemic, however, factors like the variants serve as a reminder that it is still far from over. The safest course of action remains following health guidelines such as regularly washing our hands, wearing masks, and maintaining social distance while also staying within the current regulations of Stage 1.\n \nShivam is a driven undergraduate Political Science student with a penchant for health, wellness, and communicating it to people.

He had just taken on a new job and was in the process of turning his life around to better provide for his daughter, whom he so greatly loved.\nThe same applies to Breonna Taylor: She did not give her life for our enlightenment — she was viciously killed while in pursuit of greater circumstances for herself and her patients. She was a nurse who had recently taken on longer hours and shifts to aid in the fight against COVID-19 and was killed while in her own home trying to catch rest for her next shift.\nI put it to you that Black History Month should not be the designated time only for a celebration of Black people — Black excellence is something to be celebrated all year round. Neither is it appropriate that in this month we only glamorize our efforts to make a change. Instead, we should consider it a time for honest reflection and transparency, to see that our university incorporates the very same systems that perpetuate the oppression of Black individuals all around the world, and this is something that it is actively working to address.\xa0\nBut when addressing these issues, what should be counted as true progress?\nTrue Progress — A Definition\nIt is crucial that Black, Indigenous, and racialized individuals be at the forefront of the conversation around racism, seeing as oppression is their story, and no one can speak to what progress is better than those who are most affected by it.\xa0\nWilson identifies as a Black woman, stating that she was born and raised by two parents who are immigrants to Canada from Jamaica, continuing to say, “My dad is Black, and my mom is Indian, and I think it’s really important to contextualize where I’m coming from as a settler — a racialized settler to Turtle Island — to understand what progress would look like in this particular context.”\xa0\nIn reflecting on the progress made by our own university in terms of enforcing racial inclusivity, it is imperative that we define what true progress is within this context.\nWhen asked about what she considered to be true progress, Wilson states that “racial inclusivity and progress would essentially be summed up when individuals can be their true authentic selves in spaces, feel heard, have really good health and outcomes for their communities, and when conversations around racial justice are not situated around the basic needs that people need to survive in life.\xa0\n“If we’re having conversations around basic human rights — which are things that we need to survive — we can’t even get to the place of having conversations around how we thrive, how we build, how we transform spaces in a way that allow our communities to really flourish,” Wilson continues.\nYork’s Efforts — A Rundown\nIn keeping with the collective strive that has been made by general society to correct its ways in dealing with race, York has made a concerted effort in the past year to improve circumstances for students, teachers, and staff alike.\xa0\nAs detailed in a joint statement made by President Lenton and Vice President of Equity, People and Culture, Sheila Cote-Meek, York’s plans to achieve a racially inclusive environment include, but are not limited to “hiring a minimum of 12 new Black faculty members by 2023, creating a new physical space to facilitate meetings among Black faculty, staff and students, increasing funding for scholarships, bursaries and other forms of financial aid in support of Black students, and establishing a new, culturally safe tool for complaints about racial discrimination and harassment, available in English and French.”\nThese plans were made in March 2021 during what was considered a wildly successful virtual town hall. In keeping with what Vice-Provost of Students Lucy Fromowitz outlined in a summer 2020 statement wherein she implored the York community to “listen closely before we act.” This town hall was held after consultations with over 200 Black community members.\xa0\nIn the same statement, it is outlined the goals that York has already achieved in this plan, including the following: “Twelve new Black faculty members have been welcomed to the university, with one additional Black faculty member confirmed for 2022,\xa0$150,000 has been committed to support Black scholars in 2021-22, and consultation has begun on the formation of a funding program for Black scholars, with the goal to launch by early 2022.”\xa0\nThe statement added that as part of a $2.25-million commitment over the next three years to advance equity, diversity, and inclusion through community engagement and research activities, “$50,000 per year has been committed to Black community engagement projects and $250,000 per year to Black research and knowledge mobilization projects, beginning in 2022.”\xa0\n“The Department of Community Safety has taken steps to undertake a review of services and to explore alternative community safety models,” the statement also said, adding that the The Centre for Human Rights, Equity and Inclusion will continue to offer its Anti-Racism Training to community members.\nSo, Did YU Do It…Right?\nThe list of changes that have already been made within our university sounds, to be frank, impressive.\xa0\nThe very fact that the town hall was held with the consideration of the opinions of 200 Black folks from our university is a sign that York is paying more attention to Black voices, which is keeping with the notion that Black, Indigenous, and racialized individuals must be the ones at the forefront of this conversation.\nThe hiring of 12 new faculty members means more skilled and talented Black folks getting a stable income — this is money that more than likely gets funneled back into Black families and communities.\nThe establishment of the Black Excellence at York University (BE YU) mentorship program is also a definite plus as it serves as a safe space for incoming Black students to learn and grow from older students who know what it’s like to be in their shoes. This is most definitely worthy of celebration, isn’t it?\xa0\nAnd let’s not forget the funding of projects within Black communities, as well as the lending of further support to Black scholars — these are all wins, are they not?\nWhile these changes sound — and are — impressive, they cannot fundamentally resolve any issues regarding racism because they are what Wilson defines as “add-ons.” In responding to a question about the changes being made within the City of Toronto, Wilson articulates that “the work that they’re doing there is really important and impactful; it has an impact for the community. But when I think about what’s truly needed to address racism, it requires a transformation of the entire system, not just add-ons.”\xa0\nShe further proposes that “the reality is that to address the fundamental issues of racism that we’re experiencing, it requires an entire overhaul and transformation of culture and policies, procedures and how we operate.”\xa0\nMoving forward, structural changes need to be made, or else the ‘progress’ made will not last.\nIn an announcement made in September 2020 by York’s AMPD sector titled ‘AMPD’s Commitment to Equity,’ it is detailed that the AMPD department intends to enforce “Diversity in Faculty Hiring, Increasing BIPOC Student Support, Ongoing Anti-Oppression, Anti-Racism Training,” and more. These changes are all well-intentioned, but to what extent have these changes been implemented effectively by the department, and to what extent are these changes even effective to begin with?\nA Black AMPD student — who wishes to remain anonymous — gave a detailed response as to what their experience has been at York and within the AMPD department, going as far as to explain how York could make more meaningful improvements.\xa0\nThe student says that while they can’t speak for all of AMPD, they have felt safe on campus with some of the initiatives made at York in the past years. “For example, the changes made in course materials provide a better-rounded education that is more inclusive of BIPOC theatre history in North America,” they say.\xa0\n“But I still think that we have quite a long way to go in terms of decolonizing the curriculum. Combatting racism has to go outside of the curriculum and into the daily lives of students, and part of that is having BIPOC instructors in our learning spaces. Students need to be able to see what their lives could potentially look like, specifically in the production area. I’ve noticed that when first-year BIPOC students are making their choice to stream, more go into acting conservatory or devised theatre, and rarely do they go into production.”\nThe student adds that they believe an important part of these choices have to do with the lack of instructors that look like them and that they can relate to.\n“You see a lot of Black actors and performers in the media, but never really see any who work in the background as production managers or sound designers or video editors. And I think it would be beneficial to have more BIPOC instructors in the space to show them that doing production work is a viable career,” they conclude.\nThis student’s response echoes the previous motion that structural changes need to be made.\nFurther evidence of this is the act of vandalism on York’s Keele Campus in January, in which “deliberate damage was caused to Skennen’kó:wa Gamig,” as stated in a York wide email sent out by Lenton. The fact that we are still dealing with racially motivated acts of vandalism on our campus is a clear sign that we still have a long way to go.\nWe Must Embrace Proactive Strategies\nWe have added on new initiatives, bursaries, and racialized faculty. We acknowledge that we are visitors on this land and that change needs to be made. We have been responding to the tragedies of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery.\xa0\nBut responsive strategies can only take us so far.\n“The entire institution needs to change culture and radically shift in the way that it thinks and functions.”\nThere are no two ways about the fact that we have indeed taken steps forward, as a university organization, and as a community. But the only way we can truly make lasting progress from here on out is to embrace proactive strategies.\nWhen addressing the basis of her position as Senior Manager of Anti-Racism Response, Wilson notes that the existence of her job serves as a starting place.\xa0\n“The problem with creating these roles is that they often become glamorized. They often become seen as ‘this is the solution to all our issues’ when I — as one person doing an anti-racism response — can never be the solution. The entire institution needs to change culture and radically shift in the way that it thinks and functions.\xa0\n“I think that there is value and purpose in these roles needing to exist right now because racism is real; it is hurtful,” adds Wilson. “It is impacting Black people, Indigenous people, and racialized people on a daily basis. However, it’s not the end-all-be-all. So, when someone says, ‘our solution to the problem is to create this role to respond to racism’ that tells me that clearly there is not enough understanding of what needs to happen in order for there to be true transformation to implement anti-racism work and to do that work fully.”\nThe most proactive thing our university can do is look inward and change its structure so that it truly embraces and enforces the elevation of Black, Indigenous, and racialized students, staff, and professors.\xa0\nWe as individuals must also embrace the proactive strategy of honest reflection, as it inevitably leads to honest and lasting change. By establishing a lasting change within ourselves and our communities, we can better engage with one another, whether we are the oppressors or the oppressed. This engagement results in the cultivating of meaningful relationships with each other — and isn’t this truly the answer to winning this fight?\xa0\nRacism truly is relational, so, hand-in-hand, let’s continue to push forward for better together here at York.\nA special thanks to Jennisha Wilson for entertaining my questions and lending her time, as well as to the student who willingly contributed their voice to this article.

But the only way we can truly make lasting progress from here on out is to embrace proactive strategies.\nWhen addressing the basis of her position as Senior Manager of Anti-Racism Response, Wilson notes that the existence of her job serves as a starting place.\xa0\n“The problem with creating these roles is that they often become glamorized. They often become seen as ‘this is the solution to all our issues’ when I — as one person doing an anti-racism response — can never be the solution. The entire institution needs to change culture and radically shift in the way that it thinks and functions.\xa0\n“I think that there is value and purpose in these roles needing to exist right now because racism is real; it is hurtful,” adds Wilson. “It is impacting Black people, Indigenous people, and racialized people on a daily basis. However, it’s not the end-all-be-all. So, when someone says, ‘our solution to the problem is to create this role to respond to racism’ that tells me that clearly there is not enough understanding of what needs to happen in order for there to be true transformation to implement anti-racism work and to do that work fully.”\nThe most proactive thing our university can do is look inward and change its structure so that it truly embraces and enforces the elevation of Black, Indigenous, and racialized students, staff, and professors.\xa0\nWe as individuals must also embrace the proactive strategy of honest reflection, as it inevitably leads to honest and lasting change. By establishing a lasting change within ourselves and our communities, we can better engage with one another, whether we are the oppressors or the oppressed. This engagement results in the cultivating of meaningful relationships with each other — and isn’t this truly the answer to winning this fight?\xa0\nRacism truly is relational, so, hand-in-hand, let’s continue to push forward for better together here at York.\nA special thanks to Jennisha Wilson for entertaining my questions and lending her time, as well as to the student who willingly contributed their voice to this article.

Or, maybe you’ve noticed that BIPOC characters are not included whatsoever in a story or series where they should be?\nThis is whitewashing.\nMerriam Webster’s dictionary describes ‘to whitewash’ as altering something in a way that favours, features, or caters to white people. As an example, this might be portraying something in a way that increases the prominence, relevance, or impact of white people and minimising or misrepresenting BIPOC people.\n“The erasure of Black, Indigenous and Asian people — especially the darker skinned people within these groups — in order to centre whiteness, is something that I have witnessed countless times,” says Aysha Campbell, a masters student in the department of humanities with a research focus in Black studies. Campbell is specialising in the use of sound and space to depict Black life within literature.\nPratik Virwani, a first-year student studying public relations, says that, “whitewashing, I believe, is more common when it comes to politicians and the side that the news channels are inclined towards. The most common cases and widely used scenarios are when a news channel majorly focuses their coverage on an external event if something negative surfaces about the side they support, instigating ignorance.”\nEvidence of whitewashing is not difficult to find when looking at the statistics — 52 per cent of the members of parliament in Canada are comprised of white males, while they only make up 36 per cent of the population. In an article published by The McGill International Review in 2020, it was found that less than 15 per cent of staff at CBC were BIPOC.\xa0\n“I feel like white washing is very prevalent in historical and contemporary western cultures and media,” says Campbell. “The fact that I read and watched The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo in and outside of school growing up and I never found out that the author, Alexandre Dumas, was a black man until I was an adult is an example of whitewashing.”\xa0\nAlong with politics and journalism, Hollywood films are notorious for whitewashing. As an example, Mickey Rooney, a white actor, played Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961). The role is described as “horribly racist” through Rooney’s over portrayal of stereotypes. Despite being a white actress, Emma Stone played the role of Allison Ng in Aloha (2015), a character who described herself as being a quarter Hawaiian and a quarter Chinese.\nOlivia McClymont, a second-year education student, explains that, “a big example of whitewashing is the overwhelming negative reaction to the new live-action The Little Mermaid being played by a woman of colour instead of someone who is white. Some people are claiming the character as ‘their princess’. The fact that it matters a lot to the community that she can’t be Black is ridiculous.”\nThe Little Mermaid (1989), a popular animated Disney film about, well, a mermaid, is fictional. Ariel is quite literally a mythical creature who has a tail — part of what makes myths and fairy tales so important is that they become cultural products, reflective of our own social evolution.\xa0\nCampbell says that, “the type of erasure that occurs when whitewashing is demoralising to communities of colour because it tells Black people, Indigenous people, Asian people, and other people of the global minority that they are not worthy to be at the centre, to be seen, or to tell their own stories. The lack of representation also hinders the imagination of children of colour when they don’t get to see themselves in the media they are being offered.”\n“Less subtle and more overt examples are the use of white actors to play the roles of characters or depictions of real life Black, Asian or Indigenous people in cinema and TV,” adds Campbell.\xa0 “More recently with TikTok, we have black creators making viral dance trends and white creators copying them, becoming the face of these trends, and getting the credit for them.”\nSheldon Pearce’s article, “The Whitewashing of Black Music on TikTok” published by The New Yorker in 2020, discusses just how prevalent the whitewashing of Black art, specifically music, is on TikTok. They also consider how “the optics play into a long, infamous history of white appropriation of Black arts.”\nCampbell explains that, “the impact that whitewashing has on the financial gains of people of colour can be seen with TikTok and the likes of Addison Rae and Charli D’Amelio, who rose to fame and riches off doing dances and not giving credit to the Black dancers who created them — like Jalaiah Harmon and her Renegade dance —ultimately denying Black creators access to the money, fame, and sponsorship deals they were getting off of doing those dances.”\nAlong with music and dance, whitewashing can also be found in various fashion or makeup trends, including the “clean girl aesthetic”.\nThe clean girl aesthetic, as explained by Nena Lezama in their article “Why the #CleanGirlAesthetic TikTok Trend is Problematic” is a tightly slicked back bun with hair parted in the middle. The look is completed by adding simple gold jewellery accessories, such as hooped earrings or necklaces. This look has been garnered by famous influencers and celebrities, such as Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber, and Kendall Jenner.\nBy becoming a trend, it implies that this look is something new and innovative — but, it’s been rocked by women of colour for decades.\n“This phenomenon with TikTok is not new but part of a long history of white people appropriating Black cultural production and getting the recognition and money off it while the Black creators are erased from history,” explained Campbell.\nMajor fashion companies, such as Louis Vuitton, are exploiting the keffiyeh, a scarf that has become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism, as a high-end fashion item. Meanwhile, individuals are suffering due to political unrest in the Middle East.\nSarah Ayoub, a fourth-year film and media arts student, says that, “I notice in the media how the keffiyeh is being seen. What once was a symbol of resistance for my people is now being portrayed as a fashion symbol that people wear without knowing the meaning of. My family will wear a keffiyeh during the war, but people will wear it as a cool pattern and don’t know why we wear it, nor what it means.”\n“In the fashion world, women are able to wear a scarf over their head and it’s seen as peak fashion, but when I wear the hijab, I get called names and people assume I don’t speak English or that I’m oppressed,” adds Ayoub.\nWhat’s more, religious clothing has historically been stigmatised and persecuted. In countries such as France, Denmark, and India, the hijab has been banned while headscarves flooded runways this past spring.\n“Whitewashing is harmful because the history of these issues gets erased,” continues Ayoub. “When hijabs become just a scarf and no longer a piece of clothing women use for modesty, and keffiyehs become just a pattern being sold by Gucci and Shein, our history gets erased.”\nWhitewashing even goes as far as to impede on the wellness industry.\nReema Kumar, a first-year environmental engineer and biology PhD student says, “I was born and brought up in India and have observed numerous traditions and cultures across the country. After social media took over, I saw a lot of these practices being altered according to the West. Indeed, there is a lot to aspire to, however, certain traditional practices fade away in the masses,”\xa0\nKumar explains that, “yoga and meditation are often ‘sold’ as different products. However, because of the lack of clear understanding of yoga, people are unaware that one is a part of the other. Yoga has been practised in the Indian subcontinent for ages, long before globalisation.\xa0\n“There are numerous aspects to it, and it is not just exercising. It is indeed a great practice of inclusion in one’s life, but a thorough knowledge would bring a lot more wonders than picking up just a few points out of it.”\nNabihah Parkar, in their article published by the Huffington Post in 2022, explains how a yoga teacher was banned from using Sanskrit terms in their practices, as well as chanting “Om” or saying “Namaste.” In addition, there is a general lack of representation of BIPOC yoga teachers in Canada.\n“Everytime I see these occurrences happen, I experience a mixed bag of emotions: frustration, anger, disappointment, annoyance, and even resignation because it’s been happening for so long and so often,” says Campbell. “Even as I’m discussing this topic now, I’m getting heated because of the harm this racist practice causes Black communities and communities of colour.”\nUnfortunately, these examples only scratch the surface of where whitewashing might be experienced. Ayoub further encourages consumers to critically assess items and educate themselves before making purchases. \n“Ask yourself, is this new or have I just seen this on a different skin tone? Is this new or might this have a history behind it, and how can I educate myself?”\n“Whitewashing is a way of diminishing the meaning behind something in one’s culture. Everyone’s culture and background matters, so the fact that someone could think that theirs is more important than anyone else’s is wrong, especially when they claim things that are not theirs to own,” explains McClymont.\nKumar adds to McClymont’s thoughts, saying that there is a vast variety of cultures and traditions in the world and many experiences to be had. “If everything gets seen or experienced from one perspective, we lose the authenticity of it. It’s true that we share our experiences but imposing our perspectives as the ultimate truth does injustice to the original experience,” says Kumar.\nWhile adverse impacts of whitewashing are evident in various forms, it is important to have an open mind, stay informed, and to be aware of the harm that it causes.\n“People need to gain information from various perspectives, even outside their scope of learning,” says Virwani. “Most things taught during our childhood may turn out to be wrong as there is new research and evidence surfacing everyday, so it is important to keep an open mind.”\xa0\n“It is important to develop an understanding about anything you see around you, even if it doesn’t concern you at the moment, it might hold some relevance or connection to a part of your life. Ultimately, and most importantly, don’t judge people or information blindly, negative or positive,” continues Virwani.\nWe must remember to approach new (and already established) ideas with an open mind, always being ready to learn and to show respect to one another. Experiencing and learning new things outside of your own culture can be extremely enriching and provides a well-rounded perspective on the world. While it’s encouraged to appreciate cultures, it’s not okay to appropriate or whitewash.\narts@excal.on.ca                \nSydney is in her third year at York University studying Dance.

Now as they redesign the toonie in commemoration of her, this article is written in hopes to expose the dichotomy of a \xa0 government which acknowledges that the land that their institutions were built on were initially inhabited by Indigenous communities, but continues to hold the very colonial relics in place that took these lands.\nSimply put, you can’t apologize to Indigenous communities for the crimes committed against them and then continue to run your government in the name of the British monarch under whose seal these atrocities were carried out. Because, are you really apologizing then?\xa0\xa0\nFirstly, why do we choose to hold onto the monarchy? There aren’t any economic benefits to being a part of the Commonwealth Realm — a term for countries which acknowledge the British monarch as their figurehead. The Commonwealth is the broader term which refers to an international organization largely composed of the United Kingdom’s former colonies, even if they choose not to acknowledge the monarch as their head. The Canadian government’s website concerning Canada and the Commonwealth \xa0states that the Commonwealth is “a forum for deliberation, problem solving, consensus decision making and action on matters of importance to its membership.”\nThis goal can be achieved without making the monarch our official figurehead. After all, we are the second largest contributor to the Commonwealth, having spent around $11 million on the organization last year, as reported by the Government of Canada.\xa0\nI believe the solution is to run a government in the name of our Indigenous communities.For a start, the constitutional figureheads of our country could be representatives from the indigenous population. So, instead of the British monarch as the nominal head of Canada you could have the ‘Chief’ or any other title that the indigenous communities of Canada settle upon as appropriate. The same should apply to other largely ceremonial positions like ‘the Lt. Governor’ and ‘Governor General’. The term ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be phased out by a new phrase that represents the claim of the indigenous population over Canada. If we had to have a monarch, shouldn’t it be an indigenous person? Or perhaps words like ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be changed to a phrase which acknowledges Canada as the land of all people, but in the language of the indigenous population, to change the starting point of Canada’s history from one based on British expeditions to one that begins with this land’s settlement by the First Nations.\nWe can simply have Indigenous communities vote for a leader they believe should be the constitutional head of our country and for each of the provinces and territories.

The 12-month, full-time program covers three four-month terms, with 16 courses on topics like financial management, marketing, organization, digital health, leadership, public policy and more. It will receive its first students in September 2023 and will be open to York undergraduate students graduating by June, as well as healthcare practitioners wanting to work in administrative roles.\nThe program was approved by York University’s senate in December 2022 and has now been sent to the Ontario government for approval, expected in March 2023.\nTraditionally, health administration curricula included topics like finance, marketing and organization. The MHIA program was designed by faculty members in Schulich’s Krembil Centre for Health Management and Leadership, who supplemented traditionally covered topics with emerging fields like data analytics, informatics, epidemiology, and supply chain management.\n“We surveyed all Canadian programs as well as successful programs at Harvard, Duke and John Hopkins University,” says Mawani. “The task force also sought input from management practitioners in industry and government, consultants, and industry associations to fully understand the emerging trends and the knowledge requirements for health administration careers.”\nIn a press release, Schulich School of Business Dean Detlev Zwick promoted his school’s track record in health education: “Over the past two decades, Schulich has been developing health industry leaders through a number of programs, including the health industry specialization in our MBA program, through innovative executive development programs such as our Mini-MBA for Physicians and, beginning in Fall 2023, through our new Master of Health Industry Administration.”\nMeanwhile, Mawani believes the MHIA fills a gap in health administration education. “[MHIA] is designed to address an unfilled need in post-graduate management education,” he explained. “There are currently few programs in the field of health administration offered by business schools — both in Ontario and globally.”\nThe program is being announced in the wake of crippling staff shortages in healthcare facilities across Canada. Many hospitals are calling the situation a crisis and urging government officials to take action.\xa0\nAt the same time, many publications say jobs in healthcare — and specifically administration — have a strong employment outlook. Job search website, Workopolis, forecasted in Dec. 2015 that the sector would continue to grow rapidly past 2020, and the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics reported strong starting salaries. The Healthcare Management Degree Guide also reports increasing prospects for health administration degrees.\nMore information on the MHIA can be found here.\nhealth@excal.on.ca                ', ' York University Community Newspaper \nMental health is a concern for many people, and students often report particular difficulties with their well-being.\nThat’s the motivation behind a series of seminars, activities and events being held this week in what York University is calling Well-being Week. York University’s website states that the school “prioritizes all interdependent components of wellness – such as physical, emotional and mental health.”\nThe series runs from Jan. 16 to Feb. 1, both over Zoom and in-person at the Keele campus. There are still many events to choose from, with seminars about improving sleep and promoting mental health, resources on meal planning and health effects of vaping, classes in yoga and cooking, and more.\n“I am most excited to attend the webinar being hosted by FGS [Faculty of Graduate Studies] about coping with stress,” says Tina Ranta, assistant director of well-being at York’s Student Counselling, Health & Well-being. “That is open to all community members so that we can learn from one another and build connection.”\nRanta is also “excited to see so many skills building-related events,” which are offered by peer health educators, as well as cooking classes hosted by Food Services.\xa0\nWell-being Week is hosted by various organizations at York, and follows a long history of well-being and mental health resources at the university. “Well-being Week is one of the many ways York University demonstrates our commitment to fostering a culture of well-being across our campuses,” said Mary Catherine Masciangelo, York’s assistant vice president of human resources, in a press release.\nRanta similarly explained that “this campaign and events feed directly into the work being led at York in creating a Well-being Strategy that aims to support all community members to be well in this shared environment, as wellness is a necessary precondition to learning and working.”\nMasciangelo has also outlined some ideas for destigmatizing mental health, such as education through organizations like the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; engaging empathetically when talking about people’s mental health; awareness of attitudes and behaviours that may affect others’ well-being; and simple respect and care for people in your immediate circle and wider community.\nFor more information on Well-being Week, including the full schedule of events, click here.\xa0\nIf you need support as a York student, keep.meSAFE is a free service that offers online resources and phone lines to connect to mental health professionals, 24/7.

Now as they redesign the toonie in commemoration of her, this article is written in hopes to expose the dichotomy of a \xa0 government which acknowledges that the land that their institutions were built on were initially inhabited by Indigenous communities, but continues to hold the very colonial relics in place that took these lands.\nSimply put, you can’t apologize to Indigenous communities for the crimes committed against them and then continue to run your government in the name of the British monarch under whose seal these atrocities were carried out. Because, are you really apologizing then?\xa0\xa0\nFirstly, why do we choose to hold onto the monarchy? There aren’t any economic benefits to being a part of the Commonwealth Realm — a term for countries which acknowledge the British monarch as their figurehead. The Commonwealth is the broader term which refers to an international organization largely composed of the United Kingdom’s former colonies, even if they choose not to acknowledge the monarch as their head. The Canadian government’s website concerning Canada and the Commonwealth \xa0states that the Commonwealth is “a forum for deliberation, problem solving, consensus decision making and action on matters of importance to its membership.”\nThis goal can be achieved without making the monarch our official figurehead. After all, we are the second largest contributor to the Commonwealth, having spent around $11 million on the organization last year, as reported by the Government of Canada.\xa0\nI believe the solution is to run a government in the name of our Indigenous communities.For a start, the constitutional figureheads of our country could be representatives from the indigenous population. So, instead of the British monarch as the nominal head of Canada you could have the ‘Chief’ or any other title that the indigenous communities of Canada settle upon as appropriate. The same should apply to other largely ceremonial positions like ‘the Lt. Governor’ and ‘Governor General’. The term ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be phased out by a new phrase that represents the claim of the indigenous population over Canada. If we had to have a monarch, shouldn’t it be an indigenous person? Or perhaps words like ‘His/Her Majesty’ could be changed to a phrase which acknowledges Canada as the land of all people, but in the language of the indigenous population, to change the starting point of Canada’s history from one based on British expeditions to one that begins with this land’s settlement by the First Nations.\nWe can simply have Indigenous communities vote for a leader they believe should be the constitutional head of our country and for each of the provinces and territories. Organizations like the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) and Congress of Aboriginal People (CAP) represent the interests of a substantial portion of Indigenous people, and the chief of the Assembly of First Nations is elected by the representatives of its Member Nations.
