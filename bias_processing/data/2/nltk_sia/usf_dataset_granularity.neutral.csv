2009-01-04,USF,study,"As coach Jim Leavitt stood on the pier in St. Petersburg he was all smiles. He was shaking hands, talking to people and getting ready to coach his fourth bowl game in as many years. There was something different about him.


This wasn’t the same guy who ran up and down the sidelines screaming at anybody within earshot during football games. Nor was it the guy who admitted to being the worst interviewee in the Big East Conference earlier this season.


After a season of trying to dodge the media with one-word responses and podium-slapping endings to post-game press conferences, Leavitt looked happy.


In fact, as a St. Petersburg native, Leavitt was happy.


“I don’t want to sound biased, but I really like this situation,” he said.


Why wouldn’t he? His team was about to play what was realistically a home game against a 6-6 Memphis team from a weaker conference (Conference USA).


And, as fate would have it, the Bulls ran away with the St. Petersburg Bowl trophy, finishing the season 8-5 — one game worse than the 9-4 they finished in the previous two seasons.


Leavitt said he liked the St. Petersburg Bowl because everybody wants to play in Florida, and it helps with recruiting.


Well, if Leavitt wants USF to be mentioned in the same breath as Florida, Florida State and Miami — all schools that have won National Championships in the past 10 years — then the Bulls’ first trip to the St. Petersburg Bowl needs to be their last.


The game itself was a snoozer, with USF jumping out to an early lead, then trying to score enough points to make everybody forget that it allowed a Sun Bowl-record 56 points to Oregon last year.


The Bulls — victims of another midseason collapse — had every chance to play in the Orange Bowl. However, they lost three of five conference games by a total of 62 points, including a 33-point loss at home to Rutgers.


Other than the Rutgers game, and a 24-10 loss to Cincinnati on Oct. 30, the Bulls had legitimate opportunities to win three more games. That would not only have given USF its first 10-win season, it would have given the team the opportunity to play in a storied bowl game — not a scrimmage against a weak team 20 minutes from campus.


Leavitt was excited after the game, playfully boasting about USF winning “the inaugural game of two different bowls.”


That’s great, coach, but even though the Bulls won a bowl, nobody seems impressed by a team that finished with a 2-5 record in what was perceived to be a weak conference by “experts” on ESPN before the season started.


Restoring interest in the team and ensuring that the Bulls steer clear of another postseason performance at Tropicana Field starts with recruiting.


Leavitt should be awfully busy this year replacing the talent he will lose. USF is losing two starting linebackers, three safeties, a cornerback and a defensive end — not to mention the potential departure of two-time All-American defensive lineman George Selvie to the NFL draft.


On offense, the Bulls will lose nearly as much. USF was a team built to win now, but it didn’t get the job done. As players got injured throughout the season, it became obvious that depth was a real problem and contributed to the team losing five of its last seven games.


Getting talented players — a lot of talented players — to fill the roster is a must for the Bulls. If Leavitt can’t acquire more than a few talented starters next year, USF will be lucky to make the St. Petersburg Bowl.


With all the new faces, he needs to preach discipline to a program that sorely needs it. The Bulls have finished in the bottom 10 out of 119 teams in Division I football in penalties every year since joining in 1999.


The Bulls also sat three starters — junior corner Jerome Murphy, and seniors Cedric Hill (tight end) and Carlton Williams (safety) for violating team rules before the St. Petersburg Bowl.


If Leavitt’s players aren’t under control on and off the field, it will be hard to keep the Bulls competitive in the Big East.


It could also mean a return to the Rays’ home stadium.

2009-01-05,USF,study,"YouTube is no longer just for water-skiing squirrels and pre-teen girls facing off about which of the three Jonas Brothers is the hottest. In light of record-low unemployment rates, the user-created video Web site is putting Americans back to work — in front of their webcams.


In October of 2006, youtube.com, then in only its second year, was bought by search engine giant Google for  $1.65 million. Before the buy, Google Video was YouTube’s biggest competition, allowing all its users to upload lengthy videos, whereas on YouTube uploads were limited to a length of 10 minutes unless granted a director account. This brought advertisers and viewers looking for full-length pictures like the conspiracy theory film phenomenon Zeitgeist: The Movie over to Google’s side of the fence.


Google Video used its fan base and advertising power to create an Internet super-hub for self-expression via YouTube. In early 2008, to promote this self-expression — and, of course, to generate revenue — Google created the YouTube Partner Program, a sector of Google Ads used to pay YouTube stars for their work.


According to the partnership’s homepage, “YouTube partners are independent video creators and media companies who are looking for online distribution and who meet (the partnership’s) qualifications. Becoming a partner gives you the ability to share in ad revenue from your YouTube videos.”


This may come as music to the ears of relentless vloggers and undeclared college students searching for their lot in life, but becoming a YouTube partner isn’t as simple as becoming a partner at your local food co-op. To become a partner, users must meet three qualifications: They must create original  videos suitable for representation by YouTube, own the copyrights for all video and audio used and upload videos regularly that are viewed by thousands of YouTube users.


Such exclusivity is unusual for Google Ads, as on blogspot.com anyone who wishes to add the application can. This is because Google Ads on BlogSpot are all from Google’s small business AdSense program, which doesn’t bring in nearly as much money per advertiser as YouTube, according to an AdSense support representative. Support of Google Ads on blogs typically brings in 3 to 5 cents per hit for bloggers.


The YouTube Partner Program, on the other hand, deals with the big corporate bucks. Sponsors include the likes of Sony, Verizon, LG, CBS and McDonald’s, to name a few, and their advertising dollars will be spent only in a medium in which they can reach hundreds of thousands of people. Michael Buckley of buckhollywood.com was one of the first handful of video creators to make it as a YouTube partner. His online show What the Buck?, a commentary on all things celebrity, comes out three times a week and averages more than 200,000 views an episode. Buckley told the New York Times that his show earned him over $100,000 in 2008,  the year in which his videos were most viewed.


Buckley may be a case of one-in-a-million YouTube stardom, but one doesn’t have to be a household name to gain sponsorship. Newer YouTube channels with only a few videos at 25,000 views a piece have gained sponsorship, and YouTube moderators help give potential partners a jump start by featuring some of their favorite videos of the day on the homepage.


Heather Jayne, a senior majoring in social work, is grateful for the partnership program because even if not everyone can make it big on YouTube, everyone can benefit from it.


“Everything is online now, so everyone gains from this. The people who make the videos make money, the people who make the ads make money and the people watching these videos get free entertainment,” she said.


Commenting on the press coverage of the YouTube Partner Program on his live BlogTV webcast last month, Buckley shared this sentiment with his viewers and all of YouTube:
“It’s nice to see people off of YouTube getting successful and creating positive press attention. It’s (no longer) like a viral and freakish ‘Oh! Do you believe these kids did that on YouTube!’ kind of thing anymore. It really is a great day for YouTube.”

2009-01-06,USF,study,"America has been a great nation since its start and it developed relatively quickly. Other nations have been around for centuries yet had little influence on globalization and the world, leading one to ask how America achieved its success. The answer to that question is America became a world leader so rapidly because of the moral fabric it was based upon.


America was built with the middle class as its backbone. As a society, citizens have worked together toward insurmountable-seeming achievements. They have done so through respect, doing what is right and working for the greater good.


Many other countries have not achieved what America has because they have too much classism and greed. When the majority of society is working efficiently and cooperatively, the greatest results are seen. This can be seen in cultures such as that of ancient Rome.


America’s moral fabric could also be said to be the foundation of the country because it was the shared morality of its founders that inspired them to declare independence.


It seems, however, that this moral foundation has been crumbling over the past few decades. The respect that was once given is not there anymore. Many people feel they must get respect to give respect, but this thought is, essentially, the basis of the problem and needs to be changed.


In this time of economic crises it seems particularly important to reiterate that respect must be given before it is expected in return. This is a time unlike any most have seen before. This generation can’t relate to the Great Depression or World Wars and doesn’t seem to understand what hard times really are.


Society overcame those crises because people banded together and helped each other. The standards of decency were higher because of a stronger sense of ethical responsibility.


As a society, people have forgotten what the true source of our problems is. It is easy to look at individual situations and feel helpless, but we are only truly helpless if we give up.


Members of the younger generation don’t give their elders the respect they deserve. They neglect to remember that they owe many of the opportunities they have today to the efforts of their parents, grandparents and ancestors before them.


These days, everyone is feeling the recession and lack of health care and other public services — and it shows. People are upset about the situations they are in and take it out on everyone else. One person disrespects another, who shows dissatisfaction by disrespecting others in a vicious cycle.


People live in a “take what you feel you deserve” world instead of an “ask and receive” one. People need to remember that much of the country is struggling under the same pressures.


The irony is, when people feel wronged and deal with it as they have been doing, the injustice expands because the source has not been identified or corrected. If people are more supportive of each other and deal with problems as a group, they accomplish much more.


It is unfortunate that America’s moral fabric is deteriorating, but that situation can be reversed in an ethically sound way. It is pertinent that this country strengthen the foundations upon which it was founded. That is the only way we will overcome the current economic struggle and persevere as a nation. Let’s bring America back into the great ranks that it once held and can hold again.

2009-01-07,USF,study,"Later this month, students will be able to pay for their laundry on campus using USF Bull Bucks ― but it will come at a price.


Washer and dryer use has increased in price to $1 each, up from 75 cents.  Upon returning this semester, students were unaware of the price increase.


“Economic times over the past several years made it necessary to increase laundry prices,” said Kelly Best, associate director of Facilities and Maintenance for Housing.


The difference will help offset University costs, as well as help pay for a program that will allow students to swipe their ID cards and use Bull Bucks to pay for their laundry.


Bull Bucks are part of a program set up in May that allows students to spend electronic money on campus at places such as the dining facilities, the bookstore, the pharmacy, and on printing and copying at the Library and computer lab, said Chris Akin, associate director of Information Technology (IT).


“Students, faculty and staff can deposit funds into an electronic account for use on campus,” Akin said. “It’s kind of like a gift card.”


Before May, students could pay for laundry with a “vend stripe” on their card, Akin said.  When USF initiated the Bull Bucks program, the electronics needed to allow students to use Bull Bucks were not available. Until the equipment is up and running, coins must be used to operate the machines.


At the start of this semester, students found a sign in the laundry rooms that reads: “All machines are coin-only until further notice. Card reader scheduled to come online mid-January.”


Best said that hardware and wiring is already in place, and that the machines will be installed and programmed this semester to work with the IT department.


Money generated from laundry facilities is used to fund resident programs such as events, meetings and alcohol awareness, said Lucy Willis, associate director of business for Housing.


“One hundred percent of those costs are from laundry commissions,” she said.


One advantage of using Bull Bucks is that students will not have to worry about finding quarters to use in the machines, said Samantha McLean, a fine arts major.


“(The system) is more convenient,” said biology major Tatiana White, “because people will not have to find change.”


Students have differing views about the increased price, though.


Though McLean said she thinks people can afford the price increase, she added that the previous price of 75 cents was still too much to pay for laundry.


Chris Jenkins, a music major, said that even though people have the money for it, “people will always complain.”

2009-01-08,USF,study,"Attacks have been waged on single mothers. The weapons of choice: Implements of destruction in the form of vacuous diatribes from self-righteous and unsympathetic pundits and politicians:


Ann Coulter wrote in her book Guilty : Liberal ‘Victims’ and Their Assault on America, “Look at almost any societal problem, and you’ll find it is really a problem of single mothers.”


Emily Yoffe of Slate magazine called out-of-wedlock births a “national catastrophe.”


Colorado State Rep. Larry Liston said during a GOP caucus lunch that covered issues regarding teen pregnancy: “In my parents’ day and age, (single mothers) were sent away, they were shunned, they were called what they are. There was at least a sense of shame. There’s no sense of shame today. Society condones it … I think it’s wrong.They’re sluts.”


While some statistics show higher crime rates among children raised by single mothers, one must not confuse correlation with causation. An innumerable amount of factors contribute to the environment in which a child is raised.


It is intuitive that more good would come from efforts put forth to mentor children, rather than attacking their mothers’ circumstances.


Single mothers are not bad parents merely by being unwed. It is unreasonable to determine a person’s value and character based on marital status — but these false characterizations and speculations are foundational to the argument that single mothers are ruining America.


Emphasizing the nuclear family’s additional parental support is one thing — admonishing single mothers is quite another.


If those so adamantly slandering single mothers put as much effort into trying to reform social welfare and education programs, perhaps our “national catastrophes” could be remedied, at least in part.
Unfortunately, all they seem to contribute is empty criticism and finger-pointing.


It serves no sustainable good to look down on mothers without husbands. Shaming those in fatherless families solves nothing. People so concerned for children’s welfare should consider supporting rather than shunning them.


Venomous words serve no purpose other than alienating and disparaging a group based on false generalizations.


A positive — and perhaps more valid generalization — would be that many single mothers want only the best for their children.

I love the worlds the gaming industry has been creating through the years: They have always been a welcome getaway from my own boring life. After a successful 2008 gaming year, my hopes are high for 2009. Here are my top picks for games to play this spring.


F.E.A.R. 2 (1)
I spent most of the first award-winning F.E.A.R. game screaming like a little girl, and I have high hopes for its sequel. F.E.A.R. 2 still has excessively bloody moments, frightening creatures and that dead psychic girl who makes missions both difficult and terrifying.


The story has changed and the graphics are slightly better, but overall it’s looking like more of the same from F.E.A.R. I’m not complaining — why fix something that’s working just fine anyway?

Street Fighter IV (2)
Capcom is boldly rehashing its 1990s fighter with an artistic twist in the long-anticipated Street Fighter IV — and it works. I haven’t gotten my hands on a preview copy, but screen captures have sold me already.


The game promises the return of beloved characters like Ryu, M. Bison and Chun-Li, but also adds some new faces. With both new and old moves — complemented by breathtaking backdrops — Street Fighter IV is guaranteed to please old fans and attract new ones.

Sims 3 (3)
No game has me more excited for the new year than Sims 3. As a die-hard Sims fan, I’ve been pleased with each new installment in the series — and the newest version looks flawless.


The levels of customization border on the infinite, allowing each Sim to be completely unique with options ranging from a Sim’s body weight level to the paint job on his or
her car.


Neighborhoods are no longer limited and the open world of Sims 3 lets characters move freely from lot to lot, leaving more opportunities for chance encounters and events.


Sims 3 is all about unending possibilities, which is what gamers have been clambering for from the series since its birth.

Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop (4)
Dead Rising was released for the Xbox in 2006, but in 2008 someone at Capcom read my mind and thought that bashing zombies with a Wii remote would be the best direction for the series.


Unfortunately, sacrifices will be made in graphics, and picture-taking is no longer a part of the game thanks to the new first-person camera, but these losses are made up for with adjustable difficulty and multiple save slots.


Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop isn’t innovative or new — it’s just fun. My recommendation: Find a park bench, fashion it as a weapon and go crazy on the undead.


Release: Feb 27


Consoles: Wii


Killzone 2 (5)
Released just in time for those finishing up the batch of 2008 first-person shooters, Killzone 2 continues the popular trend of sci-fi war games.


Players with a small budget or an Xbox will be out of luck with this PlayStation 3 exclusive. The graphics and gameplay are stunning, featuring an interactive environment complete with climate and all the conditions expected from a war-tattered planet.


Another great addition is the online multiplayer, in which up to 32 players can face off against one another. But don’t expect to splatter online friends on the front of a vehicle or defeat the story co-op right away — these features won’t be available until they distribute a patch sometime after the game’s release.

MadWorld (6)
Tuck the kids in early before playing MadWorld — it is not your average Wii game. MadWorld takes place in a city quarantined after a deadly virus that forces citizens to fight for their right to live.


What’s really unique about this game, though, is its art style. The cartoonish graphics are reminiscent of Sin City and are strictly black and white — except for the blood. No More Heroes needs to get its act together in its sequel or MadWorld will take its place as the most graphic, disturbing game on Wii.


Release: March 10


Consoles: Wii


Resident Evil 5 (7)
RE5 takes what was great about Resident Evil 4 — like the style and the battle system — and adds to it. Though some gamers were disappointed by the game’s Japan-only demo released last December, I feel they set their sights too high.


RE5 has enough changes to keep you interested, and the story line is phenomenal. This new installment also has a co-op mode — with main characters Chris and Sheva — where players can shotgun their way through story mode with a friend.


For fans of Resident Evil 4, this game only looks better. And gamer gals like me can look forward to the ladies of RE5 kicking some major butt.

Batman: Arkham Asylum (8)
A trailer hasn’t gotten me this excited for a video game since Kingdom Hearts. It’s dark, it’s creepy and it’s Batman.


I’m not a fan of superhero games — usually because they seem poorly made and have no point — but this game looks too good to pass up. From what I’ve seen so far, the game has moved away from standard comic-book game stereotypes and is leaning more toward the feel of the Silent Hill series.


Though not much has been released on this game, there are rumors of a free-roam Gotham City, and some classic characters are expected, like the Riddler, the Joker, the Penguin and Killer Croc. For more information and rumors, check out the Eidos forums at batmanarkhamasylum.com.

2009-01-13,USF,study,"South Florida senior guard Shantia Grace finally understands how challenging the Big East conference is.


“Everybody should know how hard we have to play to win in the Big East,” Grace said after Saturday’s 81-71 overtime victory over St. John’s.


The Bulls will play one of their toughest opponents of the season when they host No. 7 Louisville tonight at 7 at the Sun Dome.


Coming off the win, Grace said she is confident in USF’s ability to win two straight in Big East play, despite losing the first two conference games to Marquette and No. 1 Connecticut.


“Louisville is another top 25 team,” she said. “It will be another hard, grinding game, but we should be able to come out with a win.”


Hard, grinding games are staples in the Big East.


Including tonight’s opponent, the only team without a winning record on USF’s remaining schedule is Providence (7-9), who the Bulls play Jan. 20.


Coming off a 64-59 victory over Rutgers on Sunday, the Cardinals (16-1, 3-0) have won 11 straight games, 10 of which have been at home.


All-American senior Angel McCoughtry leads Louisville in scoring and rebounding, with
21.2 points per game and 8.7 rebounds. With her help, the team ranks in the nation’s top 30 in scoring offense.


The Bulls (14-3, 1-2) are led by Grace’s 15.9 points per game. South Florida has the third-best scoring offense in the country.


Coach Jose Fernandez said he’s hoping for USF’s offense — and a home crowd — to fuel his team to an upset.


“It’s just another (Big East team) we have to play,” he said. “We have them at home. You play better at home because that’s where you practice every day.”


South Florida guard Janae Stokes said even in light of Louisville’s success, the Bulls will not approach the Cardinals differently than any other opponent.


“We just have to stay together, play as a team and keep our heads up,” she said. “We have to keep the mind-set that nothing is going to be easy.”

2009-01-14,USF,study,"It wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that, even as they read this article, at least some USF students are text messaging friends, logging on to Blackboard for assignments, listening to music and checking Facebook. All this activity may give off the illusion of hyper-productivity, but studies suggest that the practice known as “multitasking” might be one of the best ways to underperform.


Recent studies by the University of Michigan and UCLA have both concluded that dividing one’s attention among several different things makes the person less efficient in his or her work, and can cause considerable stress.


In November 2008, the University of Connecticut published the study “Distractions, Distractions: “Does Instant Messaging Affect College Students’ Performance on a Concurrent Reading Comprehension Task?” Researchers found that students engaging in a reading comprehension exercise while carrying on an instant message conversation took significantly longer, indicating that “concurrent IM use negatively affects efficiency.”


Researchers also found that the more students said they instant messaged in everyday life, the lower both their test scores and reported GPA were.


These instances of multitasking are counterproductive, but they are certainly not the most dangerous. A study conducted by the RAC Foundation and the Transport Research Laboratory in the U.K. shows that nearly 50 percent of people aged 18-24 text message while driving. The study also determined that texting while driving is more hazardous than being under the influence of alcohol (up to the legal limit) or marijuana.


If cell phones and the Internet are to blame for robbing the attention span of American youth, Apple’s iPhone could be a prime offender. Apple calls it “a revolutionary phone, a widescreen iPod and a breakthrough Internet device” — a description that screams multitask. Such marketing rhetoric embraces the idea that one device must be able to perform a multitude of tasks, and the 10 million iPhones sold in 2008, as reported by macdailynews.com, support the importance society places on the ability to multitask.


And it’s not only students — just ask an adult who tries to hold a phone conversation while typing an e-mail.


USF psychology professor Michael Coovert said any person — child, teen or adult — who tries to do multiple things involving the same brain functions will be hindered.


“The key issue is if the new activity — for example, phone usage — is demanding cognitive or perceptual resources that are already engaged,” he said.


However, Linda Elliott, a research psychologist for the U.S. Army stationed in Fort Benning, Ga, said the product of multitasking depends on the individual.


“Some people can manage their attention processes, process information and perform at higher levels than others,” said Elliot, whose work is concerned with improving soldiers’ multitasking ability.


“If there are several tasks that are related to a single goal — for example, navigating cross-country to a waypoint safely (in enemy territory) — it’s best not to overload a single sensory channel,” she said. “The soldier should not have to be focused on computer screens when he or she needs to be alert to surroundings.”


For this situation, she said a mechanism that vibrates in eight directions could be placed on the soldier’s belt — allowing him or her to navigate hands-free, eyes-free and even, she said, “mind free.”


Research like Elliot’s should help make jobs that require rigorous multitasking easier but doesn’t discredit studies showing multitasking’s negative effects. Whether multitasking is a counterproductive waste of time and efficiency or a useful tool that can be developed, it is something that everyone can expect to increase as technology advances.

2009-01-15,USF,study,"Despite trailing early, No. 7 Louisville beat South Florida 76-60 at the Sun Dome on Wednesday night with the help of a late first-half surge.


“We did a very good job of breaking the press and scoring off of it,” said Louisville coach Jeff Walz. “I thought they stopped pressing us because we scored in transition.”


The Cardinals were able to force 24 turnovers on USF, but despite their success, Walz said his team did a poor job of defending against two USF players.


“Our goal was to try and keep (USF) out of the paint,” he said. “(Forward Jessica) Lawson and (forward Brittany) Denson, they rebound the ball as well as any team in the country. They absolutely owned us in the paint.”


With Lawson’s help, the Bulls cut the Cardinal’s lead to 56-50 with six minutes remaining. However, a 9-2 run allowed Louisville to pull away.


Lawson scored 16 points and grabbed 14 rebounds on her way to her second double-double of the season — and all this after being unable to practice earlier this week because of a knee injury. USF coach Jose Fernandez said he was proud of her effort.


“She didn’t practice the last two days just because she has knee swelling,” he said. “I think she’s really working hard for us down there and finishing around the basket.”


Lawson said USF’s turnovers made a major difference in the game.


“They turned us over and just got us out of our element,” she said. “I think they just scored on most of our turnovers.”


South Florida guard Shantia Grace went 6-of-7 from the free throw line en route to 15 points.


“Every loss we can learn from,” Grace said. “And for us to compete with top 25 teams is a great experience for us. It motivates us to know how good we can play and how well we can play against  top-ranked teams.”

2009-01-16,USF,study,"Actors Danny Glover and Felix Justice inspired an audience Thursday night, through the words of Martin Luther King Jr. and Langston Hughes.


The lecture was more of a performance, as both Justice and Glover fully assumed the personalities of King and Hughes. Glover used his character to connect with the audience personally, while Justice connected through the powerful words of King.


“When Felix Justice and I began this journey of coming to campuses years ago it was with the intent or engaging young men and women in this dialogue,” Glover said.


The audience found the performance engaging as the room filled with silence and awe at the words of two men. Standing ovations and applause were actions repeated throughout the entirety of the event.


Thursday night’s lecture took place in the Sun Dome. About 600 people attended the event, ULS student director Lindsey Grossman said.
“It was fun, although the turnout was not as great as we might have thought,” ULS student director Amy Bortzfield said.


After the lecture, Felix and Justice held a question and answer session. The topics varied from politics to movies, when one middle school student asked Glover what his favorite character to play.


“Overall, it went very well. I really liked the Q&A because you get more candid responses from the speakers,” Grossman said.


The topics covered in the lecture covered the major political events of King’s time period. Glover spoke about the role of young people, asking for change, in the recent presidential election.


“Change is not an event but a process,” Glover said.
Robert Gray, a senior majoring in economics said that while he wished there would have been more time with Danny Glover, he still enjoyed the event.


“They were both really good. I really liked the MLK speech that Felix did. It was neat to hear it on his birthday,” Gray said. “Also to was good to see the little kids get this experience of history that they probably wouldn’t have otherwise.”

2009-01-20,USF,study,"In their eighth studio album, released today, Animal Collective continues a roll of innovative releases that has snowballed into the band’s finest opus.


Merriweather Post Pavilion is the most approachable experimental album of the decade and is the crowning achievement of a band that has so far appealed only to a small niche group. If one thing stands out in this album as the biggest change to Animal Collective, it is the level of professionalism.


The group’s early releases were either poorly produced or poorly thought out, which resulted in immense criticism for their ability as live performers. They relied so heavily on computer-generated music and electronically manipulated vocals that their onstage performance was an absolute disaster.


Bare-bones Animal Collective was essentially just one guy screaming inaudible lyrics and banging on a trash can while a few of his buddies wandered around the stage.


Such harsh criticism is unlikely to continue if the band performs this album as it was recorded. Though Merriweather Post Pavilion is its most electronic album to date, it’s also the most likely to work live for two good reasons: There are no frantic tribal noises and, for the first time since the band’s beginnings, lead singer Panda Bear is actually singing.


His vocals have been good in the past, but up until now they’ve served as just another layer of noise. The vocals on Merriweather Post Pavilion stay within a range below falsetto that sounds more suited to their singer and the words are enunciated clearly — which is essential, as this release is host to the band’s best poetry yet.


Much like Radiohead’s 2008 release, In Rainbows, Merriweather Post Pavilion is an album that celebrates life. Its lyrical focus is broad and accessible, setting the album apart as one of the group’s only releases that could be considered timeless.


But like many great works, appreciation for the album only increases with age.


Merriweather Post Pavillion’s layered sound is impactful and nearly overwhelming to begin with, but deconstructs with a closer listen. The individual pieces of the barrage of sound make themselves clear with each listen — and it’s quite a thing to admire. An immeasurable amount of work must have gone into assembling this album.


It may be wrong to assume an artist could have set out to imitate the style of others, but it’s hard to doubt that Animal Collective is stealing pages from the books of other alternative bands. Luckily, they’ve been reading some pretty great books.


Many of the tracks’ tonal structures feel like Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots-era Flaming Lips, and vocals on deep ambient tracks like “Daily Routine” are reminiscent of Peter Bjorn and John’s debut album.


These big changes, however, don’t make Animal Collective a copycat band. Merriweather Post Pavilion is just an improvement on genuine Animal Collective sound. There are still astonishing moments of simplicity in the album, most notably in “My Girls,” a track that begins slowly and completely changes its key signature and feel with the addition of a single repetitive tambourine hit.


Other tracks like “Summertime Clothes” refine old drumming techniques to fit with the band’s newfound musicality, and sounds fit into the pieces they garnish rather than popping up at random.


Merriweather Post Pavilion is a wonderful labyrinth — with a new surprise around every corner, confusing at times and beautiful throughout. This is the best improvement by a band in years and Animal Collective was pretty decent to begin with. It may be a bit early to call, but don’t be surprised if this ends up as the best album of 2009.

2009-01-21,USF,study,"Tiffany Coakley couldn’t head to the nation’s capital to see Barack Obama take his oath of office.


But that didn’t stop the communications major from being photographed with America’s 44th president Tuesday.


“I may not have been in D.C., but I can say that I took a picture with him and that I witnessed history being made,” she said, referring to the life-size cutout of Obama in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom.


Coakley was one of the estimated 900-plus students, faculty and staff members who filled the room at noon to watch Obama’s inauguration.


Every chair in the ballroom was filled, attendees said, and people lined the walls and craned their necks to see the event on one of the room’s two projector screens. Across the hall, others gathered in the Oval Theater, but the inaugural experience wasn’t confined to the second floor of the center.


Just below these parties, students clotted the walkways to Beef ‘O’ Brady’s and, halfway across campus, they clustered in the lobby of the Communication and Information Science (CIS) Building, as well as the Grace Allen room of the Library.


“It was all over campus — it was what everyone was doing at that certain time,” said English major Sommer Geck.


Provost Ralph Wilcox sent an e-mail Tuesday to faculty members, encouraging them to tune in to the event. Wilcox left it up to instructors’ discretion whether to cancel class for the occasion.


Many students said their afternoon classes were noticeably thinner and some who decided not to skip said resisting the temptation to sneak a glimpse of the inaugural coverage proved difficult.


Environmental science and policy major Kris Caldwell and biomedical science major Sarah Monson said they logged on to cnn.com during their biology class to watch streaming video of Obama and Vice President Joe Biden’s swearing-in ceremony.


Apparently, they weren’t the only ones.


A notice on the CNN Web site stated that users would have to wait since the program couldn’t stream video to all of the people on the site at once. After about 10 minutes waiting for the video to load, Caldwell and Monson decided to pack up their laptop and wait for the end of class.


“We ran from class to the Marshall Center,” Monson said. “We were standing in the middle of Beef ‘O’ Brady’s, just watching. Everybody got very quiet and very focused when Obama gave his speech. It felt very historic.”


Just before Obama delivered his address, CNN reported it had 1.3 million people watching live online, with 21.3 million live video streams worldwide since 6 a.m. That’s more than four times CNN’s total daily streaming record of 5.3 million, set on election day.


CNN also created a special Facebook tool for the event, which received an average of more than 4,000 comments a minute during its peak, the U.K.’s Times Online reported.


During Obama’s 20-minute speech, he addressed America’s need to usher in a new era of responsibility, saying it was the risk-takers and doers of the past who made the nation prosperous. The United States’ capacity for greatness — its ability to invent, care and achieve — hasn’t waned in the time since, he said, underscoring his campaign motto of creating change.


“What I really admired about this speech is that he said he will do these things — that they will happen, not that they might happen,” Geck said, referring to Obama’s pledge to forge friendships in the Middle East, extend a hand to nations in need and defeat terrorism.


Though the crowds in the buildings on campus weren’t nearly as massive as the million or so who gathered on the west front of the Capitol, many said they didn’t mind watching in somewhat cramped quarters.


“It seemed like the kind of event where people would rather experience it shoulder to shoulder, all crowded together, than watching it by yourself,” said Dewey Rundus, associate director of Undergraduate Research.


He watched the inauguration in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom, he said, arriving about two minutes before Obama’s address.


Students clapped and cheered in agreement with portions of the speech, he said.


“Everyone was acting as if they were there,” Croakley said. “We all stood up when we were asked to. It was crazy. I didn’t see it, but I heard some people were tearing up.”


In the CIS building, mass communications major Derek Smart-Gordon said he was headed to a meeting, but when he saw the television broadcasting the inauguration, he stopped.


“I just felt it was important enough to drop everything and watch it,” he said. Smart said he thought about 50 to 70 people were watching, with some leaning over the railings on the second and third floors of the atrium to listen to the event.


Meanwhile, 897 miles north of USF, political science and history double major Christopher Leddy watched the inauguration live in Washington. At first, he said he was disheartened to hear a roar of boos from the audience as former President George W. Bush was formally introduced to the crowd.


“I thought it was kind of disrespectful,” he said. When Obama took the stage, Leddy said the atmosphere completely changed. Leddy said one moment seemed to resonate with the audience during Obama’s address: when he said that 60 years ago, his father wouldn’t have been allowed to dine with a white person in a restaurant — and today, his son could stand before 300 million American citizens to become their commander-in-chief.


“It was electrifying,” Leddy said. “He’s helped restore hope to an older generation and instill it in the younger generation. He’s inspiring.”

2009-01-22,USF,study,"Should USF dip into the millions stored in its rainy day fund to shelter itself from the state’s storm of budget cuts, or tuck its funds away to help weather future downpours?


That’s the quandary Leroy W. Dubeck — a Temple University physics professor and National Association Budget Handbook author — will give  a  presentation about USF’s financial situation today at 2 p.m. at the Marshall Student Center.


Dubeck, who garnered attention for raising awareness of the $240 million USF had left untouched in its unrestricted reserves, will discuss not only whether the University has spent — and saved — its funds in the most prudent manner, but said he plans to explain the budget issue in a greater context by assessing the administration’s fiscal decisions in light of the nation’s worsening economic state.


“The recession hasn’t hurt USF as of June 30, but what happens in the future is a different question,” Dubeck said. “We know what happened in the past, but different people may have different opinions about what might happen in the future, and that factors into what the administration might want to do with the money.”


USF spokesman Michael Hoad said the USF administration is “very afraid” of the upcoming Florida legislative session in March because it could set the stage for further budget cuts in July even greater than last week’s cut of 4 percent.


Hoad said he supports Dubeck’s appearance and hopes it will be helpful to Student Government, the Faculty Senate and the United Faculty of Florida’s USF chapter, but said the deciding factors on how the money will be spent are the Legislature’s budget cuts and the national recession.


“You start to have no flexibility to deal with an additional cut,” he said. “It’s much harder to deal with — you can’t just do a little bit of cutting here and there. If there are more cuts in July, it could become very serious.”


Dubeck also said the recession would be a deciding factor, but thought the House of Representatives’ proposed stimulus package — which would provide $39 billion to public schools and universities to combat cutbacks — would help benefit a university coping with the latest round of budget cuts.


“(President Barack) Obama wants this done quickly. I think he will get most of what he wants, but I can’t guarantee the bill — I’m no Nostradamus,” Dubeck said. “Florida will see $1 or $2 (billion) of those $39 billion, which is no small pocket change, and an increase in Pell Grants for students of $15.6 billion. I think your problems will be solved with that kind of money.”


Dubeck said he’ll address the potential impacts of the stimulus package and Obama’s plans to boost the economy at the presentation.


Ultimately, one of the presentation’s major goals is to inform the public about the University’s budget and spending, said Faculty Senate Vice President Steve Permuth.


“There is a lot of miscommunication (between the Senate and the administration),” he said. “When the issue of the $240 million was raised, there was kind of a silence at first, and what we were trying to say is that the issue was there. (Provost Ralph) Wilcox said that there is a plan for the reserves, but I don’t know how many people have seen it.”


The conference is free and open to the public and will be followed by a panel discussion.

2009-01-25,USF,study,"The Republicans emerged from the 2006 and 2008 elections in dire need of Extreme Makeover: Political Edition. Some prominent Republicans should cross their fingers in the hopes that Ty Pennington and his camera crew will arrive on the steps of the Capitol at any minute.


U.S. Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, a Republican, had it right when he said: “Voters didn’t elect the Democrats in 2006; they unelected us.”


The Grand Old Party, emphasis on the “old,” has sustained its image as the party of America’s grandfathers with its inability to appeal to the younger constituency. Talks of rebranding the party have been circulating for a while now.


California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger warned of the dangers of keeping with business-as-usual Republican politics in May.


“The Republican idea is a great idea, but we can’t go and get stuck with just the right wing,” he said in the San Francisco Chronicle.


It has become more apparent than ever that Republicans must restructure or face political extinction. But what exactly led to the recent demise of the Republican Party?


Most obviously, eight years of disapproval for a Republican president. Former President George W. Bush finished off his second term with the lowest approval ratings in history, an embarrassing 22 percent, according to CBS News.


Unfortunately, the American population views many of Bush’s failed policies as bona fide Republican dogma. The role of big government expanded rapidly thanks to the Bush administration’s Patriot Act and social programs such as No Child Left Behind. It would not be farfetched to suggest government spending under Bush was spinning out of control.


This spending was not exactly the fiscal conservatism traditionally associated with Republican politics.


America’s view of Republicans suffered another blow with the recent McCain-Palin campaign. John McCain touted himself as a maverick politician who was a proud, non-traditional Republican. These claims may have been true for McCain before the transformation that occurred once he won his party’s nomination, but he soon resorted to the same tactics that he had spoken against years earlier: political mudslinging, petty pandering and unsound judgment. In an effort to appease the Republican base, McCain picked the infamous Sarah Palin for vice president.


This move was effectively the final nail in the coffin for McCain’s already decrepit campaign. Palin brought nothing to the table except appeal to far-right Republicans, a group that would never have dreamed of voting for Obama anyway.


Independents were scared away by such brash decisions. Unable to pull from the center, McCain lost the election.


Consequently, this has become an important lesson for those attempting to salvage the Republican image. In order to weather the change in political winds, Republicans must learn to appeal to the more Independent center.


Republicans should not ignore the fundamentals of conservatism and finding a platform that falls just right of center fiscal responsibility is key. America has suffered from many years of both Republicans and Democrats ignoring calls for more responsible government spending.


However, certain aspects of traditional Republican ideas have to be refurbished. Hawkish policies from trigger-happy politicians are not a substitute for traditional diplomacy. But don’t label me as a peacenik. When attacked, America is justified in retaliating. In an effort to promote democratic ideals and America’s interests, certain interventionist policies must be adopted. Diplomacy, however, cannot be ignored as an effective tool.


Tax cuts for working Americans, meanwhile, are an important aspect to stimulating the economy, and Republicans must embrace this fact. How can the average American contribute to the retail heartbeat of our consumer society when he or she is being smothered under the weight of heavy taxation? While taxes are a necessary component to a democracy, America cannot afford to let them get out of control.


To see the effectiveness of such strategies, one can examine the victory of President Barack Obama. Tax breaks for “95 percent of working Americans” and eliminating wasteful spending were key tenets of his campaign.


It is my distant hope that Republicans will wise up and follow suit by taking a few pages out of Obama’s book and strive for cross-party integration. Unfortunately, the audacity of such a hope may not be based in reality.

2009-01-26,USF,study,"A little less than $240 million rests in part of the University of South Florida’s coffers — enough so that if every dollar were stacked on top of each other, they would stretch from the floor to the ceiling of the four-story Marshall Student Center roughly 1,401 times.


These funds mark the “unrestricted” portion of the University’s reserves, which the USF administration can use however it legally sees fit, according to its 2007 budget audit. In a time when the University has been struck by budget cuts that have lopped $52 million from its funds over the past two years — with the looming threat of additional cuts this spring — Temple University physics professor Leroy Dubeck visited the Tampa campus Thursday to inform the University community of these untouched funds and other ways the University can combat a shrinking budget.


“These are real dollars,” he said. “The question is, are they going to be used for addressing the budgetary crisis, instead of laying off more people and doing other things that’d be more detrimental to the University?”


Dubeck, who has sat on collegiate budgetary committees and authored books on the subject, compared the use of the unrestricted funds to buying a car. A person could set aside some of his paycheck to replace his old clunker, Dubeck said, but then, if he gets laid off from his job, he may need to spend that money so he doesn’t lose his house. Similarly, while some unrestricted funds are designated by the university’s governing body — the Board of Trustees (BOT) — for certain uses, they can legally be undesignated to address more urgent needs.


No restrictions, only  designations
Re-designating funds isn’t as simple as deciding not to sign the lease on a shiny new car, however. Faculty Senate President Larry Branch said that once a budget has been submitted to the state, any changes — or re-designations of unrestricted funds — must get state approval first.


Florida law also requires the University to keep an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the Educational and General revenue USF receives from the state in a cash reserve in case of an emergency, said USF spokesman Michael Hoad.


Even without those funds, Dubeck said the University would have about $190 million in unrestricted money that it could use to offset budgetary shortfalls. In an e-mail to faculty, USF Provost Ralph Wilcox said that about $53 million of these funds have been allocated to departmental operating expenses, visiting instructors’ and adjuncts’ salaries and support for graduate students, among other costs.


“From the outset, the judicious spending down of these cash reserves has been an important and integral part of our plan to balance the budget,” he wrote.


Since reserve funds are non-recurring, the University cannot depend on having them year after year, so it can’t use them to pay for base salary increases or other annual expenses, Wilcox said. This also presents a challenge when deciding how much of the unrestricted funds to use at once, since it is uncertain when the budget cuts will end.


A stimulating discussion
Dubeck said he estimates that the United States will pull out of its recession within two years, but some analysts suggest it could last up to five. If Dubeck’s estimate is correct, he said that university administrators should look into using a portion of these funds to stave off additional job losses, bloating class sizes and other issues.


Even if it isn’t, Dubeck said USF could look to other sources of funding to help the situation, such as the House’s proposed stimulus package. If approved, the package would provide about $79 billion for state education systems, with about $39 billion going toward local schools and universities.


Based on the state’s population, Florida would likely receive about $1-$2 billion, Dubeck said.


“You know, a billion here, a billion there. It helps,” he said.


This brought Dubeck to his second question of the afternoon, which served as one of the underlying purposes of the presentation: How could the University see a healthy portion of this money?


“From what I’ve been told about Florida’s Legislature — I live in New Jersey and work in Pennsylvania, so people here would know better than I would — it’s going to take mobilization on the part of students, faculty, staff and, ideally, the administration,” Dubeck said. “What we did at a local level today, you’ll later have to do at the state level. It’s old-fashioned political lobbying.”


What’s next: demanding transparency
Dubeck advised the audience — a mix of about 100 students, faculty and staff in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom — to do two things: first, seek a breakdown of how exactly administrators plan on spending the portion of unrestricted reserves they intend to use, and second, take an active role in lobbying for more money.


Faculty Senate Vice President Steve Permuth said he praised Wilcox for listing how the administration intends to use the unrestricted funds, but that the next step is finding out how much is being allocated to each endeavor, and making sure that the funds primarily benefit  students.


Dubeck’s presentation was based on an analysis of USF’s audited budgets from 2003 to 2007, as well as the unaudited budget for the 2007-2008 fiscal year. Once a university completes its budget, it must be sent to the Auditor General for official review by the state.


Though Dubeck concluded that the University was in “excellent financial condition,” he did note two areas of concern.


Dubeck found that the percentage of expenses going toward instruction had steadily decreased from 2003 to 2008, falling from 32.23 percent to 27.96 percent.

The change doesn’t reflect a decline in funding, but a dramatic increase in the amount of money USF has received toward research, said USF spokeswoman Jacqui Cash.


“It’s all a percentage of the whole — when one number goes up, others will shift,” she said, referring to the 4 1/2 percent climb research funding took during the same years. “It can only equal 100 percent at the end of the day.”


Dubeck also noted a “significant deficiency” in the 2007 financial audit. The Auditor General randomly selected about 20-30 grants and contracts from the University’s list of reserves and found that the money listed as owed to USF on six of the awards had been overstated by about $6.7 million. Similarly, USF’s deferred revenue for these awards — money that USF has received for work that hasn’t yet been completed, for instance — was overstated by $7.1 million.


This meant, Dubeck said, that some money hadn’t been collected in a timely fashion or that the amounts had been misreported.


“That was as of June 30, 2007,” he said. “We won’t know until the Auditor General completes last year’s audit if the issue has since been corrected, or if it’s been repeated.”


In an official response to the Auditor General, then-Chief Financial Officer Carl Carlucci said USF had created a special unit within the Contracts and Grants division of the Department of Research Financial Management. According to the statement, the unit will be responsible for accounts receivable collections and award closeout so that the University can keep better tabs on collecting awards before the availability period expires.


Though Dubeck analyzed all four types of University reserve funds — restricted expendable, restricted nonexpendable, net related debt and unrestricted — he focused on unrestricted funds because they are the ones the administration has the most control over. The restricted funds — such as the restricted expendable, which is the University’s endowment — are essentially a pool of gift money, grants and contracts that are legally bound to being spent in a certain way.


After delivering his presentation, Dubeck said the most important aspect to him was seeing the turnout.


“It shows that students care about what’s going on,” he said. “For change to occur, we’ve got to continue these discussions, and students have to get involved.”

2009-01-27,USF,study,"While many businesses struggle during hard economic times, others, such as thrift stores, have experienced increased sales partly because of the nation’s weakening economy.


Many thrift stores around USF reported that their sales have increased within the past year, and students seem to be spending their money at thrift stores rather than more expensive retail stores.


According to the National Association of Resale & Thrift Shops, the industry has experienced a growth in its number of stores — approximately 5 percent per year for the past three years.


Selena McCullugh, store manager of the Tampa Goodwill Superstore, credits the store’s slight increase in sales and larger clientele to the current economic situation.


“A lot of people want the same things but don’t have the money to do so,” she said. “Shopping at our store allows them to get that same quality without the price tag.”


Life’s Treasures Thrift Store also reported higher sales within the past year.


Manager Terry Hudson said the store is seeing new customers on a regular basis, especially those buying clothing and furniture.


“Overall, people are so much more conscious of what they’re spending,” Hudson said.


Chelsea Tieu, a sophomore double majoring in chemistry and history, volunteers at Life’s Treasures. She said customers wait for the store’s sales because, in the end, it comes down to money.


“The first Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the month, we have a 50 percent off sale. We get cleared,” she said. “It’s really crazy on the weekends.”


Not all thrift stores have had the same luck.


Pam McCoy, manager of Second Image Thrift Store, said sales shot up in October but have recently decreased.


“It slowed down around Christmas — most people would like to buy their loved ones a new item,” she said. “Even though we have tons of new things here, it’s kind of a mind thing.”


Many college students frequent the store, McCoy said, but she hasn’t seen a noticeable increase in student clientele. She added that the store should start to pick up again when sales begin.


Another factor to take into account may be the number of donations the store receives.


Major Don Smith, administrator of the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in Tampa, said he noticed a moderate decrease in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which he attributes to fewer items being donated to the stores.


“In times of recession, sometimes that level of donations begins to decrease,” he said.


Smith said more people are holding their own yard sales to generate extra money rather than donating their used belongings to the Salvation Army. He said he hopes this trend reverses itself.


Students who frequent thrift stores said they have been more cautious of how they spend their money.


Austin Hutchinson, a senior majoring in English, said he has been more careful with his finances.


“Other things cost more money now, so I use less on clothes,” he said.


Regardless of the economy, Tieu said she has always been cautious with her money.


“When I spend more than I want to, I’m not too happy about it,” she said. “I buy    anything on sale.”


Manuel Penton, a senior majoring in biomedical science, said he likes that he never knows what he will find. Penton, who is in a band, said he found a synthesizer from the 80s while thrift store-shopping with a friend.


“It was great — it was really cool,” he said. “You can’t find that anywhere else besides a thrift store.”


Penton also bought a Banana Republic jacket for $3. New jackets from that brand cost up to $350.


James Leavitt, a senior majoring in elementary education at USF’s  St. Petersburg campus, said he has been shopping at thrift stores since his freshman year. He comes from a large family and grew up wearing hand-me-downs.


Leavitt said that a white suit at a regular retail store may cost $50 or more, but he found one at a thrift store for $6.


“I wore that outfit to a work Christmas party — a formal — and when I worked at a camp for a ’70s day where I looked like John Lennon,” he said. “You can find the coolest things at thrift shops — everything’s cheap.”


Thrift shoppers might even find wedding attire, Leavitt said.


“There’s no way I would do that for my wedding, though,” he said. “I’m not that cheap.”

2009-01-28,USF,study,"Higher unemployment rates have caused many USF students to look beyond the job market and create jobs of their own.


According to the  US  Department of Labor, Tampa’s unemployment rate in November was 7.8 percent, up from 4.5 percent in 2007.


A suffering economy is an important risk to factor into the equation of starting a new business, but the alternative is the risk of unemployment in a bad job market, said Thomas J. Carter, an economics professor at USF St. Petersburg.


“It might be tough to find a good job with a regular company, so starting a business might be more productive for some,” he said.


Business partners and USF alumni Jay Mize and Van Sefair began their entrepreneurial careers in real estate development. Even as the real estate market boomed, Mize said he realized that wouldn’t always be the case, so he and Sefair started the dry cleaning company Drytec Cleaners in November 2006.


“The economy is having an effect on all businesses,” Mize said. “It has forced true entrepreneurs to get creative and think outside the box and it has forced us to out-think the competition.”


Mize, who has a bachelor’s degree in finance, said his time at USF has had a lasting impact on his entrepreneurial career.


“My entire spirit of influence can be traced back to my USF contacts — from my friends to my former football teammates,” he said.


Mize said the weak economy might be a blessing in disguise for those considering starting their own businesses.


“There may not be a lot of capital or funding available, but in every down economy there is a silver lining and better opportunities available. It just takes finding the right niche to make it work,” he said.


Carter said he agreed that opportunities are available for those in the right industry, and funding depends on the product or service.


“There are just certain types of businesses that may improve with bad economic times — like pawn shops or job training services,” he said. “The financial market is making it difficult to get loans right now. It is dependent on what type of business you are starting, since people are cutting back on their spending — especially on luxuries.”


Hard economic times often affect the sale of luxury items and services first, but USF alumnus Andrew Dundas’ company Feed-a-Bull has so far been unaffected by the economy.


Dundas said he started the food delivery service after three  months of unsuccessful job hunting.


“I always figured I would work for a company, but I started (Feed-a-Bull) because there wasn’t enough of a job market,” he said. “Instead of being another employee, I decided I would be an employer.”


After six weeks of planning, Feed-a-Bull was started in September 2007, and now delivers food to customers of more than 20 restaurants in the Tampa area. Dundas, who co-owns the business with fiancé Linda Walter, said he started it from the ground up after conducting research on similar establishments in other areas of the country.


“When the economy suffers, luxuries are usually the first to go, but we fit in with pizza delivery and there will always be a market for our service,” he said.


Mize and Sefair provided a new twist to dry cleaning, which they said they credit for assuring their futures as entrepreneurs. The eco-friendly dry cleaning business has a coffee shop, JavaTinto, conveniently located inside.


Not all luxury-based businesses are having financial trouble.


What started as a joke for USF alumni Eddie Zaragoza and Connie Ramos is now a clothing design and T-shirt screen-printing company. NaimBran Apparel, a fashion design company, and Brisk Prints, a screen-printing company, were started in the fall of 2007 with the sole financial backing of Zaragoza’s credit card.


Zaragoza, who graduated in December with a bachelor’s degree in marketing, said the economy has not affected his business much because of its target market — which includes many groups at USF.


There are many advantages to being your own boss, Zaragoza said: He enjoys the freedom of being able to set his own schedule as well as the opportunity to meet new people. But there are also downfalls to being in charge.


“You have to be self-motivated because it’s all on you and there is no one else to blame,” he said. “It can be easy to get sidetracked.”


Dundas said he warns new business owners that work can consume their lives, but the pride that comes with the accomplishment of a dream makes it worthwhile.


“The reward, if you’re a person that is a hard worker and proud of your accomplishments, is a lasting business. This company will be here for as long as the University is here,” Dundas said of Feed-a-Bull.


Mize said pride is also an important factor for him.


“The gratification and reward of seeing something that was originally a thought written on a napkin (become) a viable business is the best part of owning a business,” he said.


Sometimes an extra push is all that is needed to make a dream a reality, Zaragoza said.


“I think definitely do it, because otherwise you will wonder if you could have done it. There are workshops you can take that will help you on things like taxes — and a lot of it is free, too,” he said.


The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) at the USF Downtown Center offers five to six seminars to the public each week, all focusing on advice for small business owners or those interested in starting a business.


“Some are free, some have a low fee, and they are in a large range of topics — anywhere from accounting and taxes to marketing, advertising and financing,” SBDC Director Eileen Rodriguez said.


The SBDC also offers free one-on-one counseling available to residents and business owners in the 10-county region it serves.


The center has seen many entrepreneurs coming in for help to combat the struggling economy, Rodriguez said.


“A lot of people have been downsized and are finding it hard to find jobs, so they are starting a small business instead,” Rodriguez said. “People who own small businesses currently are also having a hard time finding financing and are seeking advice just to stay afloat.”

Chairman of the Super Bowl Host Committee and former BOT chairman Richard Beard presented the NFL with a proposal in 2005 and said he knew that afternoon that Tampa would host the 2009 Bowl.


To host the Super Bowl, a city must meet certain criteria. The NFL sent the Tampa committee a book outlining what it was looking for in a Super Bowl city, Beard said.


He said the book asked questions such as how many hotels were in the Tampa area and what types of transportation systems would be available.


Committees are formed  several years before the Super Bowl because host cities need a group to make the pitch, USF spokesman Hoad said.


USF will benefit from the Super Bowl when it hosts a breakfast Saturday morning at the Sun Dome.


Hoad said the breakfast is normally hosted at a resort.


“That was a deliberate effort by the people who were involved to involve more students and involve the University as a whole,” Hoad said. “There’s some student organizations (working) as volunteers that work the breakfast at the Sun Dome.”


The NFL and Super Bowl committee often laud the economic benefits of the Super Bowl, but USF will not directly profit from it, Beard said.


“But there is an economic benefit to Tampa,” he said. “USF is a big part of that community.”


Though the NFL reports that cities may make millions of dollars hosting the Super Bowl, economics professor Philip Porter said that was “virtually impossible.”


While the Sun Dome may earn money from the breakfast event, he said, no one has ever been able to prove any definitive economic benefit generated by the Super Bowl.


Researchers look at factors such as income, hotel stays, air travel statistics and sales in the area tow determine the game’s economic boom to cities.


“No one’s ever found any obvious impact that the Super Bowl was (in any city),” he said.


Tampa may or may not benefit financially from the Super Bowl, but the city will profit in terms of national    recognition.


“Hosting a Super Bowl, I think, does give you that sense that you’re enjoying the success of the city,” Hoad said. “Tampa and USF are similar in that they celebrate the success of each other together.”

2009-02-01,USF,study,"Forty-four years from now, comedian Dane Cook will still be talking about you.


Well, maybe not you, exactly, but he said that even when he’s 80 he’ll remember the night thousands of students accepted his invitation to eat at Bennigan’s after his performance at Round-Up, USF’s fall comedy show, back in 2005.


Since then, he has starred in multiple movies, gone on a series of comedy tours and broken Richard Pryor’s stand-up endurance record by performing for more than seven hours straight.


Before Cook returned to Tampa Bay to give a pre-Super Bowl show at the St. Pete Times Forum on Saturday, he got up at 7 a.m. (his time) to talk to the Oracle about the catharsis of comedy, dealing with criticism and what he — albeit jokingly — wants people to remember him for. (Sorry, Cook fans — it has nothing to do with his cashew-launching abilities or his dream of having a talking, fighting monkey as a pet.)


The Oracle: First off, let’s travel back about four years. You stopped by USF for our fall comedy show called Round-Up. At the end of the show, you called up the hostess and asked about making a reservation for 10,000 at Bennigan’s. Did you ever think that so many people would show up?


DC: Yes. I knew that we were setting ourselves up for, eventually, one of the most memorable post-show after-parties. (It was) impromptu. That was — gosh — I have some great pictures from that night, and I remember when we arrived at the parking lot and people started showing up — what you need to realize is that, you know, that was also happening at a time when I was just starting to realize how many people were really kind of die-hard fans and coming out in support.


I’ll be talking about that when I’m 80 years old, looking around that restaurant and that parking lot and seeing the outpouring of people who appreciated what I was doing. It was just unbelievable. It was really wild.


O: Have you made an offer like that before or after?


DC: None like that, no. Before, I’d ask a couple people in the front row of a club to go grab a sandwich after — never 10,000 people to the challenge of, hey, let’s all meet at this local eatery here.


No, nothing like that, and I certainly haven’t done anything like it since because there’s a little bit of fear or trepidation. I wouldn’t want it to turn into something where people would get hurt or anything like that.


It was just one of those last-minute things that was very authentic … I’ll always look upon that as just a real eye-water moment that I shared directly with my fans.


O: How did this Saturday’s show differ from your other shows?


DC: I’ve been working on this brand-new hour, hour and a half of comedy all year. I purposely kind of went back to basics. I didn’t do any films this year because I literally wanted to be in the clubs night after night, and I felt like my fans deserved that (level) of dedication to bring to stand-up comedy. I mean, I continued to put out content over the last couple years, but I really wanted to get the “all new” above my name. It’s also my way of saying thank you to all of my fans for helping me to achieve success.


O: What’s the process like for coming up with new material?


DC: My process this year was digging the truth out of myself. Talking about what it’s like dealing with success. Talking about what it’s like having lost my parents. Talking about this new president. Talking about this new America.


… People came up to me at this show last week and said, “I’ve been watching you for the past 17 or 18 years and I’ve never seen so much vulnerability, but at the same time I’ve never laughed so much at some of these difficult kinds of topics.”


It’s great. You’re laughing and there’s also this great kind of therapeutic relief — that you get to share something tough that you went through and you know that maybe some other people have gone through. And isn’t that what the best comedy should be? Truth mixed with escapism.


O: Speaking of your performances, how did you manage to perform for seven hours at the Laugh Factory?


DC: Stay properly hydrated. I never expected to ever stand up on stage for seven and a half hours. I certainly was not in the mindset of wanting to break any club records. I’m proud to say it was very good — it was very authentic … I think the crowd wanted me to break the record more than I wanted to break the record. It just kind of happened. It wasn’t forced. That seven and a half hours was accompanied by the greatest sleep of my life.


O: How exhausting was it being up there and performing? You’re known for being a pretty physical performer.


DC: The term “pacing yourself” was put into play … it wasn’t hard to downshift and sometimes do stuff that was a little more old-school kind of joke-style, and there’s storytelling style and there’s definitely physicality and some more outrageous behavior. I kind of just made it a potpourri, and when I needed to rest my lower back I would just kind of plant my feet and stand and stretch for a little bit.


I went through the crowd and I talked to every single person in the crowd that night and basically dedicated a chunk of time to their life and tried to find something funny in everybody.


When we finished that show, I took a picture with that entire crowd because we all knew each other. Everybody knew everything that they could, probably, about one another. I have this great group photo of the most personal event, because it really did feel like we did it together.


It was something I would not want to repeat, but it was fun to try.


O: It seems like every time comedians come into the spotlight, critics accuse them of stealing people’s jokes and stuff like that. How do you respond to those kinds of  allegations?


DC: It’s like the crack in the dam, and you put your finger in it, but another crack comes. I actually found that there was a certain period of time when I was trying to respond to everything.


What I realized was, oh, wait a minute, no. People don’t want the truth … what I found was some people aren’t seeking out the true response. Some people are seeking out more mayhem.


I went through the spanking machine — I definitely took my hits.


O: What would you like people who meet you to walk away thinking of you?


DC: I would hope that first they’d say, “Dane Cook has the freshest breath that I’ve ever experienced,” because fresh breath is certainly an important thing to me. (laughs) I don’t know. I guess I don’t — I’m starting to sound like a grizzled old veteran here, but I don’t really think about what people take away from meeting me. That stuff was stuff I used to care about when I was younger — what people think of me.


… If I may be so candid, you can’t f*** with the truth. That’s what a good friend once said to me.


When he said that, it was like a punch to the face. It was so important for me to hear that. I said, “You know what? I’m just going to live in the truth and put my honesty forward and when I leave the room, I’m not going to wonder how people accepted what I am and what I left in there.”


O: Ending this on a light note, do you have any pre-show rituals or trailer demands — like no brown M&Ms?


DC: No. I just always have to get potassium. I have to eat a banana, and that’s about it.


No superstitions, no strange little meditations or throwing up in buckets. It’s really — I live for the show. I live for the show. God, I sound incredibly corny and cliché, but I’ll stand by it. I live for these moments — these caliber shows — this kind of sharing. This is the good stuff in life.


As long as people sit, want to come out and take time out of their lives, and go out of their wallet and throw a few bucks down and laugh, then damn it, that’s where I want to be. I want to be front and center and making people laugh their a**es off.


No pre-show rituals. Just a little potassium, and let’s do this — where’s the mike?

2009-02-02,USF,study,"Last month, University Police (UP) Chief Tom Longo became the first UP chief to be elected president of the Tampa Bay Area Chiefs of Police Association.


One of the largest Chiefs of Police Associations in the country, the association comprises most of the law enforcement heads in the Tampa area.


“Our goals are to promote the profession, hold training seminars and also have a scholarship program that we are in the process of reinvigorating now,” Longo said.


Captain Bob Staehle, UP operations commander, said Longo interacts with people in all levels of UP and relates to other agencies at director and chief levels.


“It speaks volumes both for Chief Longo and USF to say that he was the first UP chief to be named president of this association,” he said. “It is putting USF in the spotlight in an arena that would not normally have occurred had it not been for Chief Longo.”


Longo has been working in law enforcement for more than 30 years, a career he began in the military as a sergeant in the Marine Corps Reserve before he went to college. While in school he transferred to the Army as an intelligence officer, and upon retiring he joined the civilian police force.


Longo has worked with university police departments for 10 years. He began at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and served as assistant police chief at Florida State University before becoming police chief at USF in May 2006.


“(Being a police officer) was a dream I had since I was a kid,” Longo said. “A lot of kids grow up with a dream of becoming a cop or a firefighter, but it stuck with me.”


Longo said he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who had been a police officer in the military.


“He had a health problem that kept him from realizing his full potential,” he said. “It was a natural thing for me to go into it, and I’ve been with it ever since.”


As police chief, Longo oversees the police department, including the 911 center. He also orchestrates all the patrol cars and uniformed officers on campus, including traffic enforcement and DUI checkpoints.


After receiving his bachelor’s in political science from Eckerd College, getting a certificate in criminal justice education and earning a master’s in public policy from Regent University in Virginia Beach, Longo still dedicated to learning.


While serving as police chief, he is also writing his doctoral dissertation for law, which he hopes one day to use to begin a post-retirement career in   teaching law.


At the conclusion of Longo’s one-year term as president, he will remain on the association’s Board of Directors.


“I’m honored to be elected to this position of trust in the Tampa Bay area,” he said. “I think this demonstrates the high regard our law enforcement peers have for the USF Police Department, and the importance of the University in our community.”

2009-02-03,USF,study,"Jessica Lawson is the Oracle’s athlete of the month after an impressive performance in January for the South Florida women’s basketball team.


The 6-foot-3 senior center averaged 10.8 points and 7.1 rebounds per game for the Bulls in January.


And she did it battling lingering injuries in both knees.


Coach Jose Fernandez said Lawson will not practice for the remainder of the season, but she continues to play in games for USF.


With Lawson’s help, South Florida pulled off one of the best wins this season Sunday when the Bulls defeated Rutgers 59-56 on the road.


The Edgewood native, who transferred to USF from California in 2006, had eight points and six rebounds.


Lawson’s injuries began in the 2005-2006 season, when she tore her anterior cruciate ligament and fractured her left kneecap.


Lawson is second on the team in blocks with 21 this season. She will play through injury again tonight against Marquette.

2009-02-04,USF,study,"South Florida failed to capitalize on its momentum from Saturday’s upset victory over Rutgers.


The Bulls came out sluggish and fell 71-56 to Marquette on Tuesday night at the Sun Dome.


It’s second time the Bulls have lost to Marquette this season.


Coach Fernandez attributed the loss to his team’s effort on the floor. The Bulls turned the ball over 20 times.


“When you have to coach effort, that’s a huge problem,” he said.


The Bulls played tight with the Golden Eagles in the first half, but fell victim to a 12-5 Marquette run and trailed 33-26 at halftime.


“Overall, the word I can use for this game is effort,” said USF junior guard Janae Stokes. “They had more than we did. They didn’t do anything offensively or defensively that we couldn’t match. All the loose balls, all extra hustle plays, they won.”


Stokes went 3-for-10 from the field and scored nine points. She said the loss to Marquette has had a major effect on her emotions.


“It’s just frustrating,” she said. “We win a big game on the road, then come home and lose worse than (we) did when (we) played them at their place.”


USF lost 68-60 to Marquette in their Big East opener Jan. 3.


Shantia Grace led USF with 13 points.


“Before the game, we had no energy,” Grace said. “We just weren’t together coming into the game, and it carried over into the game.”


The Golden Eagles shot 37 percent from the field.


Fernandez said he won’t blame anyone in particular for the loss.


“It falls on all of us,” he said. “It falls on our players, it falls on our staff and it falls on me.”

2009-02-05,USF,study,"The Bulls landed what may be their biggest recruit in program history when Armwood High School defensive end Ryne Giddins signed his letter of intent on Signing Day, Wednesday.


Giddins is ranked No. 4 in the country and No. 1 Florida by
rivals.com
.


With help from George Selvie and Craig Marshall, Giddins will lead what could be the strongest part of the Bulls’ defense.


“We’ve got one of the top defensive lines in the country,” Giddins said. “It all comes with Selvie staying here. I am very proud of him making the decision to stay here and helping me work as a team. We can work together and make something happen at USF.”


The No. 10 best Florida prospect said he hopes to learn a few things from his predecessor.


“Technique and how nasty the game is down there at the line of scrimmage, because it all starts right there,” Giddins said. “What to do, what not to do and how to hold my composure.”


As a high school junior, Giddins broke the school’s season record of 18 sacks with 21. He made 98 tackles the same year.


Armwood coach Sean Callahan said Giddins is a team player.


“He’s done a very good job for us,” he said. “He represents us well and understands what the word ‘team’ means.”


Coach Jim Leavitt received more defensive end signings than any other position in this year’s class.


“I’ll just say bam!” Leavitt said. “And Ryne will know exactly what I’m talking about … I love him. He’s the best.”


Boca Ciega High School’s Julius Forte will join Giddins and four other incoming defensive ends.


“There’s a lot of competition, because Giddins has committed and Selvie is still there,” Forte said. “(Competition) always brings out the best in me. I’m looking forward to it.”


Giddins, the No. 2 ranked pass rusher in the state, has been looking forward to playing college football.


“When I was a freshman, I saw (Dougie Thompson and Donald Rivers) signing and I was like, ‘Man I want to be in their shoes,'” Giddins said. “I pressed forward and worked out with my defensive line coach every day after school.”


Giddins said he chose USF over Florida after his campus visit.  He also turned down offers from Tennessee, Auburn, Clemson, Florida State, Miami and North Carolina.


“At Florida, I felt not at peace there, like I always have to impress somebody,” he said. “At USF, I can be myself and impress everybody.”


The incoming freshman said the relationship with the coaches helped his decision, too.


“(Leavitt) is a great coach — a wild coach,” he said. “He fits my personality. I love that. He’s just as good as any other coach.”


Giddins’ mother is happy he is staying close to home.


“I’ve seen Ryne grow,” she said. “He’s matured very much into a man. I was hoping he would choose (USF), because in my heart I feel that’s where God wants him to be. I think he’s going to make a difference at USF. He is going to be a big impact.”


Giddins joins 28 other incoming and finalizes what could be the best USF class in school history.


“I am ready for the competition,” Giddins said. “I’m getting ready right now — my legs, my arms, my chest. I’m getting ready mentally. I’m ready for that pressure and the ball to come to me so I can snatch it and run.”

2009-02-09,USF,study,"South Florida men’s tennis coach Don Barr said he’s certain the only way his team will get better is by playing strong competitors.


This season, the Bulls are getting plenty of opportunities to do just that.


USF went up against individuals and teams ranked in the top 50 this weekend in Arizona and finished with a 1-1 record.


“It’s definitely what we need to do to get our program established as a top tennis school in the country,” Barr said. “The only way we’re going to be able to do that is to compete and beat the players that are consistently at the top.”


Though No. 45 Arizona upset No. 34 USF 5-2 on Friday, Barr said he hopes going up against tough teams will attract more players to the program.


“Not only is our team getting stronger, but recruits will be looking at our schedule and see that we play one of the toughest in the country,” he said.


Barr said the most disappointing part of the loss was the close doubles competition. No. 18 duo Lucas Jovita and Thomas Estrada fell 9-8 and 7-3. Meanwhile, Romain Deridder and Wael Kilani lost 8-4 as Arizona won the doubles point.


“When we lose that doubles point against top teams, it’s very difficult to win matches,” Barr said. “We have to stress more on winning that doubles point. It’s a crucial part.”


The Bulls defeated No. 55 St. Mary’s 6-1 on Saturday, sweeping the Gaels in doubles and winning five of six singles.


“I thought our excellent showing was in Kilani,” Barr said. “He looked so strong.”


After the freshman defeated Arizona’s Andres Carrasco 6-2 and 6-0 in the No. 4 position, Barr moved Kilani to No. 2 where he beat St. Mary’s Maxime Olivan 6-4 and 6-2.


“I was in good shape and playing so well,” Kilani said. “I am comfortable and feel good in that role. I think I can play second position every weekend.”


This is the second weekend in a row the Bulls have bounced back from defeat to win the next day. USF lost to TCU on Jan. 31 and then defeated UC-Santa Barbara the next day. Barr said that’s because of the team’s effort.


“It’s about us fighting for every play,” he said. “We’ve learned to do as well as you can and not worry about wins and losses. It’s important to see how you’re competing and focus on the level that we’re playing.”

2009-02-10,USF,study,"The University keeps finding ways to put itself on the map — and this time it’s reaching across the Pacific. USF’s Department of International Affairs and the College of Business are the first American hosts to photo panels of Japan’s World Heritage sites.


Thirty-one of the 61 panels were transported from the Japan Foundation of New York. The purchased photography collection, titled World Heritage Sites in Japan, had already been promoted in Asia and Europe.


“It’s an honor to be able to host the panels for the first time in the United States,” said Amanda Gilmer, communication and marketing officer of International Affairs. “I know that there is a long list of people after us who have been wanting the panels, so we’re really excited.”


The idea to present the international exhibit at the University came from Mitsuo Ogishima, coordinator of USF’s Japan Outreach Initiative. His aim is to promote the understanding of Japanese culture and language in the USF community.


“It took about half a year to hold this exhibit after finding the sponsor,” Ogishima said (translated from Japanese). “I repeatedly made a request to the Japan Foundation that I wanted to show the beautiful photos in Tampa, where they have relatively much less opportunity to communicate with Japanese culture compared to other cities.”


He said the exhibit’s purpose is not just to showcase the wondrous beauty of Japan’s nature and cultural heritage sites, but to remind people how important it is to preserve such legacies for future generations.


“We in Japan have 14 World Heritage sites and are proud of all of our unique culture and national treasures, but especially these treasures which we share with the entire world,” Ogishima said.


The World Heritage Convention was adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1972. It helps to preserve 878 properties of “outstanding universal value” in 145 nations, according to its Web site, whc.unesco.org. America has 20 World Heritage sites —  including Florida’s Everglades National Park.


“Some of the World Heritage sites are in critical condition,” Ogishima said. “We have a responsibility to protect them because our ancestors kept conserving them over generations.”


The World Heritage photo exhibit includes works by Kazuyoshi Miyoshi, a world-famous Japanese photographer.


“Anywhere you look in Japan, one can see that it has a lot of beautiful places — such as the mosses growing in the deepest parts of the Yakushima Island, the forest speared by the shining light and the silhouette of the temple in front of the sunset,” Miyoshi said (translated from Japanese).


At 27, Miyoshi is the youngest recipient of the Kimura Ihei Award, a Japanese award that recognizes the achievements of new photographers. He said his passion for capturing images of paradise began on a trip to Okinawa when he was 13 years old.


Since then, he has done work in Tahiti, the Maldives, the Sahara, the Himalayas and Antarctica. Some of his photographs are in the permanent collection of the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography & Film in New York.


“If you want to see (Miyoshi’s) works in different places, you have to pay about $10 — but you don’t have to pay here,” Ogishima said.


Approximately 120 people attended the opening ceremony Feb. 6 at the College of Business Atrium.


“This is a very good event and it was a nice to see the Japanese community at Tampa come together,” said August Garnsey, a senior majoring in business management. “It was great to see such a collection of artwork of Japan.”


The exhibit will be on display at the College of Business Atrium until Feb. 19 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

2009-02-11,USF,study,"Sophomore guard Dominique Jones was scoring at will, but it wasn’t enough for South Florida to make history.


Jones finished with 29 points and eight rebounds, but Providence’s hot shooting prevented USF from winning consecutive Big East games, and the Bulls fell 77-62 Tuesday night at the Sun Dome.


“I don’t know what to say,” said USF coach Stan Heath. “I know Dominique was hungry. He was a little teary-eyed after the game. He was really disappointed.”


Jones went on a 5-0 run by himself with the Bulls trailing by 11 points late in the game. However, Providence forward Brian McKenzie hit a crucial three-pointer with 4:03 remaining — quieting the crowd of 3,340 — and the Friars never looked back.


Heath said it was tough to come back after that play.


“That was a big shot,” he said. “We knew they were going inside … McKenzie hit that shot and that was it. As poorly as we played, we were in the game, though.”


USF (8-15, 3-8) was hurt by poor shooting. The Bulls went  5-of-16 from the free-throw line and finished 3-for-19 from three-point range, while Providence shot an impressive 51 percent from the field.


“It’s frustrating that people don’t take things more serious,” Jones said. “People don’t have it in their heart to come out and play hard.”


Led by sophomore guard Marshon Brooks’ 10 points in the first half, the Friars (15-9, 7-5) went on a five minute 13-2 run to take a 41-32 halftime lead.  Jones had almost half of USF’s first-half points, scoring 15 on 6-of-9 shooting.


The Bulls have never won back-to-back conference games since joining the Big East in 2005, but Jones said he was looking forward to possibly breaking that mark.


“I like doing stuff so that we can be remembered forever and for everyone to not take that seriously — it’s a real disappointment,” he said.


With the loss, USF is tied for 14th with St. Johns and faces a tough stretch. The Bulls play Notre Dame, Georgetown and No. 1 Connecticut in the next three games.


“It’s all relative in this league,” Heath said. “When you look at Notre Dame playing on the road at Louisville, we could end up having the same record when we play. Who would have thought that at the beginning of the year?”

The Bulls (8-15, 3-8), coming off a 77-62 loss to Providence on Tuesday, will face Notre Dame in South Bend on Sunday and play Georgetown and Connecticut the same week.


USF will try to improve upon a poor shooting performance against the Friars. The Bulls shot 39 percent from the field and went 5-of-16 from the free-throw line.


Coach Stan Heath said the team needs to improve from the line.


“You work so hard to fight and get to the free-throw line, but those numbers are just not where they need to be,” he said. “We went to the line and couldn’t capitalize and that was one of the frustrating things.”


While the Bulls are suffering with 57 percent shooting from the free-throw line, they are getting improved performances from the bench.


After junior Mike Mercer was dismissed from the team and senior B.J. Ajayi suffered a season-ending injury, freshman guard Justin Leemow has seen an increase in minutes. Heath said Leemow has improved the team’s defense.


The Bulls will need to play defense well against one of the best post players in the country. Notre Dame center Luke Harangody leads the Big East in scoring with 24.3 points per game.


The Fighting Irish have struggled recently, however — and a USF win could see the Bulls jump them in the Big East conference.

Giovanni incorporated history and poetry to get the audience understand her beliefs about the last three decades of civil rights.


“It’s kind of hard for young people like those in the room to understand what a nickel means. If a nickel was on the floor very few of you would stoop to pick it up,” Giovanni said. “I want to take a moment to understand what a nickel really meant. Land was a nickel an acre. For the lack of a nickel, people were lynched, people were burned, people were beaten.”


Giovanni presented her topic seriously, but also used humorous examples to engage the audience. Applause and standing ovations were repeated throughout the event.


“I was happy with it (the lecture). The crowd was really interactive too. I was kind of impressed with that. I wasn’t sure how that would go, but they seemed very excited to have her,” said Amy Bortzfield , the ULS Student Director.


Thursday night’s lecture took place in the Marshall Center Oval Theater. A crowd of about 300 gathered to see Giovanni speak, Bortzfield said.

ULS experienced some minor difficulties during the questions and answer session. Giovanni felt like she couldn’t see over the podium, so they had to make adjustments with their microphone equipment.


“The Q & A could have been a little smoother,” Bortzfield said. “We were supposed to have two microphones, but we had to transfer one of them to use for her microphone, so it made it (go) a little slower.”


After the question and answer session Giovanni was presented with tokens of appreciation by the Tampa chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and the Black Emphasis Month Committee.


Nicole Crawford, a graduate student majoring in social work and public health said she thoroughly enjoyed Giovanni’s lecture.

Wayne Bright, manager of Wilson Funeral Home in Tampa, had mortuary aspirations from the age of 12. However, his exposure to the business started at age 7, when his father and older brother purchased a funeral home.


Morticians don’t lead a punch-the-clock existence, Bright said.


“It’s not a 9-to-5 position,” he said. “Death is unpredictable, and you are always on call and you have to be prepared to respond.”


The initiative to start Wilson Funeral Home came from brothers Clarence and Ray Wilson — both licensed morticians. The idea came to Ray, who broached the idea to Clarence while he was serving in the Korean conflict. They both approached Clarence’s wife, Curtiss Wilson, who was not enthusiastic about the idea at first.


“My first response was, ‘Are they kidding?'” she said.


But through a little coaxing, personal savings and an agreement from Ray’s wife, the Wilsons opened their doors in 1952 and began serving Tampa’s segregated black community.


As the years passed, the funeral home became almost entirely a family affair. Both wives quit their jobs as teachers in the early ’70s to help with clerical work, and Clarence and Curtiss Wilson’s son, Clarence Wilson Jr., eventually became a licensed funeral director.


In 1998, because of the elder Clarence’s declining health, the family decided to sell the business to Liberty Family Services Inc. However, Curtiss Wilson and Clarence Wilson Jr. remain involved in the day-to-day aspects of the business.


Clarence Wilson Jr. was born into the industry — he said he began working with his father at age 8 — but it is the science of embalming bodies that keeps him in the family business.


When Bright and Clarence Wilson Jr. are not working with actual cadavers, they are dealing with families affected by death.


Curtiss Wilson, Clarence Wilson Jr. and Bright described the industry as extremely people-oriented.


“You are dealing with people who are going through an array of emotions. You have to conduct business without losing your cool,” Clarence Wilson Jr. said.


Bright said dealing with people who have lost loved ones is one of the most difficult aspects of the job.


“Every service is different, every family is different, and it’s always a challenge,” he said.


Morticians also have to be able to work quickly. Bright said they typically have three to five days to contact newspapers, cemeteries, churches, printers, florists, limo services, musicians and ministers.


Bright named the “challenges of nature” as the most difficult part of the job. He said that though they try to bring the deceased as close as possible to how he or she looked in life, restoration may or may not work, depending on the circumstances of the death.


Curtiss Wilson said a common misconception about morticians is that they don’t grieve.

2009-02-16,USF,study,"A USF graduate has been nominated by President Barack Obama to be the next drug czar, said an administration official Thursday.


R. Gil Kerlikowske, Seattle’s police chief since 2000, graduated from the University with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in criminal justice.


If the Senate confirms Kerlikowske, he will be in charge of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is a component of the Executive Office of the President.


Ethan Nadelmann — executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit organization promoting alternative policies to the “war on drugs” — said to the New York Times that he would have preferred someone with more of a public health background.


“But, he’s likely to be the best drug czar we’ve seen,” Nadelmann said. “Not that that’s saying much.”

2009-02-17,USF,study,"Faculty Focus, on display at the USF Contemporary Art Museum, brings together artwork from the University’s home turf — featuring three professors from the School of Art and Art History.


“The Faculty Focus exhibition was an alternative — a smaller alternative — of what we used to do, which was a larger group exhibition of all of the faculty that would happen about every four years,” said David Norr, curator of the event.


“This is more of an intimate setting,” he said, adding that the show was an opportunity for the artists to have more space and a chance for people to spend more time with each artist’s work.


Unlike previous Faculty Focus shows, this year’s exhibit doesn’t have a theme. Instead, emphasis was placed on showcasing three very diverse artists.


One painting, “The Field That Feels Like” by Neil Bender, consists of 15 individually painted square canvases joined to form one large piece.


“I wanted to make a big painting where I didn’t know the image,” Bender said. “I worked on these squares. I didn’t know what they’d look like. I was responding to the process of seeing and forming these images.”


It’s not just the size of the painting that makes it noticeable — its provocative subject matter is an instant attention-grabber. The painting uses striking colors to juxtapose fragmented images of human sexual organs.


“I think my body of work is similar — it all deals with (addressing) sexuality in a multitude of formats — both moral and physical,” Bender said.


In addition to his oil painting, Bender has on display a series of smaller collages that incorporate a variety of materials such as fabric, cotton balls, magazine clippings
and glitter.


“I’m restless, materially,” Bender said. “So, while the underlying consistency is addressing flesh — and the clothing and unclothing of flesh — the format changes a lot. So, you get that restless quality, always wanting to investigate the subject matter in a variety of ways. I feel it pervades every aspect of our being.”


Elisabeth Condon’s painting is on the wall opposite Bender’s. “Birdsong” is similar to her previous work in that it features landscape elements, multiple layers of vividly pigmented paint and various textures. Though her individual works are similar, they begin in a way that is random and unpredictable.


“I start a painting by pouring out paint (directly onto the canvas) and then I build,” Condon said. “Whatever comes to me at that time, I’ll build from the pour … At the time, I’ll grab from whatever is in front of me — sort of intuitively — so the paintings get planned the later they go, but at the beginning they’re not planned.”


In addition to environmental themes from her childhood homes in Los Angeles and Florida, Condon’s paintings are influenced by her experiences traveling. There’s always an element of surprise, she said, and a sense of loss
of control.


“There’s an element of freedom that comes with such loss,” Condon said. “A painting has that same kind of engagement for me where, suddenly, that painting became alive and I couldn’t control it anymore.”


Cesar Cornejo’s installation, nestled in a wide corner of the gallery, is quieter than its neighbors but equally striking in detail. “Museumorphosis” depicts an image of the Guggenheim museum overlaid upon the rooftops of a rustic shantytown.


The complete image of the museum can be seen through a mirror hung from the ceiling above the installation. The houses of the town — each crafted and individually placed in the installation one at a time — form a mass of brick and clay and seem to merge into the walls of the gallery.


“I’m trying to bring together two realities that are not normally close to each other,” Cornejo said. “One of the shantytowns and the other of museums — I’m trying to bring them together as one in an attempt to make us think, what is our position regarding shantytowns or regarding museums? Do we think they relate? How do they relate?”


“Museumorphosis” is a reflection of a community project Cornejo is involved with in his native country of Peru. Cornejo works with a rural town to expand the living space of its inhabitants. He does this for free, with the condition that he be allowed to exhibit artwork within these living spaces, essentially turning the entire town into a contemporary
art gallery.


The title of Cornejo’s work references Franz Kafka’s story “The Metamorphosis” and the theme of transformation.


“It’s almost like, is it museum to shantytown or shantytown to museum?” he said. “I tried to play with that image.”

2009-02-18,USF,study,"Students lined up across the second floor of the Marshall Student Center, waiting to see pop icon Bill Nye hours before the lecture. The “Science Guy” told the 1,300 students they were part of the space and climate generation.


The lecture on Tuesday was structured like his ’90s PBS television show, Bill Nye the Science Guy, in the way he combined science and humor to entertain the audience.


He talked about the possibility of finding life on Mars, sundials, climate change and shadows.


“If you’ve never done this, I strongly encourage you to do this. Go outside on a sunny day with something very white, like a white shirt, or a napkin or a piece of paper. Cast a shadow on it with a pen, or your finger. Or your friends head,” Nye said. “If you look at the shadow, the shadow will be gray.”


Nye then said why he wanted them to examine an ordinary shadow.


“If you look closely enough, then you will see that the shadow is ever so slightly light blue,” he said.


Nye educated students about what people need to create to help stabilize the climate and the innovations of space technology.


He showed students pictures a spacecraft took on Mars.


“The color of the rocks, gives you the first idea of what the rocks are made of,” Nye said.


Students were also continuously encouraged by Nye to invent new technology.


“If you can do it, you will get rich,” Nye said. “Then maybe, you will change the world.”


Before the lecture, students created a variety of cheers demanding Nye’s presence.


Nye showed he felt like he connected with the University, when he assured one student that he would do his best to come back to USF and perform an energy analysis of the Tampa campus.


ULS Student Director Tim Repass said there were about 800 people in the Marshall Student Center Ballroom and 500 people in Oval Theatre overflow seating.


“It worked out great. There was a lot of people who took advantage of (overflow seating),” said Repass. “I was surprised how full it was. Maybe we can use it for (future) lectures if they enjoyed it.”


Repass said that although the lecture started a little late, he was pleased to see the audience cooperation and excitement.


“There was a lot of energy in the room,” he said.

2009-02-19,USF,study,"Ruckus, a free college-only program that allowed students to share music and download more than 3 million songs, closed this month.


The company closed because of legal issues, inability to continue providing free music, employee loss and layoffs.


Alex Campoe, USF’s associate director of information technology, said a Feb. 6 message on the Ruckus Web site stated that the site was being worked on. A few hours later, another message explained that the site had been shut down.


Jason Herskowitz, vice president of product management for TotalMusic, the company that owned Ruckus, released a statement in his blog lamenting the loss and explaining that economic issues forced the Web site to shut down.


“It should therefore come as no surprise that these small sites and services don’t have the resources, or desire, to deal with licensing content directly,” he wrote. “And for that matter, nor do the content owners — imagine the legal and contractual management overhead.”


Michael Pearce, USF’s chief technology officer, said the service was originally brought to USF in September 2007 because of the issues surrounding online file sharing. Before adopting the program, the University placed 11th in the nation in illegal downloading.


“Ruckus was one of the few offerings (in music downloading software) that did not have a membership fee,” Pearce said.


Within three months, more than 6,000 members at USF downloaded millions of songs, and the University dropped from its high ranking, as reported by the Oracle in 2007.


Pearce said he thinks students will continue to make wise choices about downloading music and that the ranking will not rise again.


“It’s not about one solution, it’s about education — making students aware, giving students references for where to find other alternatives,” he said.


Campoe said he suggests that students use Slacker, Pandora and Last.fm to listen to music for free.


“These programs allow students to start building up (their) playlists and do so by rating songs,” Campoe said.


Campoe said there is still a system in place that monitors computers used on campus. The system lets USF know the time and date of any illegal downloads and the IP address of the computer.


The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities determines the consequences for illegal downloading, he said. Students are notified of violations by mail and may lose their right to use the University network.


Jen Alexandre, a junior majoring in secondary English education, said she will not miss the program.


“I didn’t like the renewal business, so after a while I converted to iTunes” Alexandre said.


Junior criminology major Derek Hayward said he was not happy about the company’s closing.


“It’s annoying that now I have to pay for songs when I’m not sure if I will like them,” he said. “Before, I could listen to someone’s playlist, but now I have to use iTunes, which only lets me preview 30 seconds.”

2009-02-22,USF,study,"Each year, the planet’s population of 6.7 billion grows by another 82 million people. Some argue that to make the planet truly sustainable, people must look beyond surface issues and focus on the underlying problem — population growth.


“The bottom line is there are too many people and not enough resources,” said Werner Fornos, founder of Global Population Education, a nonprofit organization that raises awareness of the ramifications of rapid population growth, according to its Web site.


“Other countries are leading the way for solving the international population crisis while America trails behind,” Fornos said.


Jordan Stone, president of the Alliance of Concerned Students at USF, said the belief that there are not enough resources to sustain the current population is a common misconception.


“Right now, there is enough food to feed the world two times over. The problem is with the distribution of those resources,” Stone said.


According to the Population Institute, global aid for family planning helps prevent 60 million unplanned births, 105 million abortions, 22 million miscarriages, 3 million infant deaths and 685,000 deaths of women during pregnancy. However, 200 million women are still in need of assistance. President Barack Obama has already lifted a ban on funding for global family planning programs.


“The global impact of population growth on forests, topsoil, climate change, and food and water resources tells a cautionary story — one that presents a convincing case for prioritizing population stabilization,” Fornos said.


As it stands, 1.1 billion people on the planet consume unclean water — while 90 percent of sewage and 70 percent of industrial waste is dumped into surface water.


According to the Sierra Club’s Web site, sierraclub.org, all environmental efforts may be
short-lived if they do not address population growth, such as by increasing access to voluntary family planning services, health care education and economic opportunity.


Environmental leaders hope more people will recognize the connection between global population problems and environmental sustainability issues.


Robert Bair, former vice president of Students for Social Justice at USF, said high consumption often raises a population’s quality of life but at the same time damages the environment. The United States, with less than 5 percent of the world’s people, consumes more than 25 percent of its resources, according to the World Resources Institute.


“As Americans, we need to lead by example, voice opinions to political leaders and become a culture that is OK with consuming less,” Bair said. “We can’t function if people stop consuming, but we can consume things that are better for the earth.”


The Sierra Club offers a way for students to better understand how personal consumption habits stack up in terms of environmental degradation. The “Calculate your Personal Ecological Footprint” link on its Web site has a short questionnaire to calculate the environmental impact of personal consumption choices.


One way for students to get involved, Stone said, is to engage with friends and the community in local and global movements for social change by joining student and non-governmental organizations.


“If people would think with their hearts, they would realize that life is precious and we are all interconnected,” Stone said.


The many active student organizations on campus are listed on the Center for Student Involvement Web page involvement.usf.edu, along with meeting times,  locations and contact information.

2009-02-23,USF,study,"It didn’t begin well for the South Florida men’s basketball team, but that didn’t stop the Bulls from giving Connecticut some trouble Saturday.


Despite a dysfunctional offensive start, USF grinded with tough defense but eventually fell to the top-ranked Huskies 64-50 at the XL Center, giving the Bulls their fourth-straight defeat.


“I’m never happy with a loss, but how well you play has more of an effect on you, and defensively I thought we did a terrific job,” said USF coach Stan Heath. “I thought we got back well and we hustled in transition. We even battled with them on the boards.”


It was offense, however, that hurt the Bulls.


USF didn’t score until the 14:11 mark, which resulted in an early 9-0 deficit, and finished 29 percent from the field and 1-for-11 from the three-point line in the first half.


“The way we played, we had a legitimate chance to pull off an upset, if we did one thing — we had to hit three-point shots,” Heath said. “The area around the basket was just not available for us, and we had to do everything we could to make our shots.”


UConn’s 7-foot-3 center Hasheem Thabeet finished with 21 points and nine rebounds, helping the Huskies to a slim 44-40 rebounding margin for the game.


Despite the slow start, the Bulls trailed Connecticut 46-40 after sophomore guard Dominique Jones cut the lead with a dunk at 11:50 in the second half. However, a three-point shot by UConn senior guard A.J. Price and a 9-0 Huskies run put the game out of reach.


USF junior guard Chris Howard, who had 11 points and eight assists, said playing well against the Huskies will encourage the team.


“We definitely feel like this can give us confidence in the future — despite losing — as we approach the end of the schedule,” he said. “It’s kind of a catch-22 sort of thing.”


Jones finished with 14 points — leaving him just short of the 1,000 career point mark at 999.


USF was without senior guard Jesus Verdejo, who sat out with a right ankle injury. Heath used freshmen Gaby Belardo and Justin Leemow, and junior walk-on Ryan Kardok to try and take his place. Leemow played 34 minutes.


“I think a guy like Leemow has grown to where we don’t even consider him freshman anymore,” Howard said. “At the same time, it’s tough not having Jesus (Verdejo), but I think it’s great that he got to play a lot and is gaining more experience.”


USF finished 32 percent from the field and only had three free-throw attempts in the game. Heath said the Bulls’ shooting performance was disappointing.


“It’s just one of those games where you have to make shots against a team like UConn,” he said. “There’s no way to sugar coat it because you have to hit them when they give them to you.”

2009-02-24,USF,study,"When talking about abusive relationships, a physical punch or a verbal bashing are the sorts of things that come to mind. Unfortunately, what many don’t know is that abuse can be sexual, financial, emotional and social as well.


Police photos of a battered Rihanna were leaked onto the Internet on Thursday. The photos show the diva’s face marred with bruises and scratches.


The attacker? R&B superstar boyfriend Chris Brown, according to the police report.


While it’s negative publicity for both artists that these photos are circulating the Web, the event has brought attention to the prominent issue of dating abuse.


According to a Harris Poll, 15 percent of adults have admitted to being abused in a relationship at some point in their lives. A 2000 study by the Bureau Justice Special Report on intimate partner violence found that of 500 women, ages 15 to 24, 60 percent were currently involved in ongoing abusive relationships.


Sadly, even these statistics can be underestimated.


Many surveys on domestic and dating abuse are worded or interpreted as referring only to physical, instead of all forms. And even in today’s open society, a lot of men still do not like to admit that they are victims of abuse by women.


Anyone who has been forced into sex or restricted from seeing friends and family has been a victim of abuse.


Another issue is that some women won’t reveal if they’re in abusive relationships even when they are. Some fear further abuse, and some believe that the aggressor loves them and will someday change.


What the Rihanna/Brown case exemplifies is that relationship abuse can happen to anyone — even to a woman who embodies success and confidence with numerous singles on the top of the Billboard charts.


Dating violence does not discriminate. It can happen to men and women, the pretty and the plain, the leader or the follower and even, as evident, the famous and the anonymous.


People in abusive partnerships should know they’re not alone.


Liz Claiborne Inc. sponsors an organization called “Love is not abuse,” which works to raise awareness for women and men on dating and domestic abuse. The organization’s Web site has statistics and handbooks about the prominence and the dangers of abusive relationships.


The site also has a listing of help resources for people trapped in violent relationships or even people looking to help a friend.


The Spring House (thespring.org) is a safe house for victims of any type of violence located in Tampa.


The key to fighting domestic violence is to know the facts. The Center for Relationship Abuse (stoprelationshipabuse.org) lists early signs in a partner that can hint to future violence.


Keep in mind that it’s easier to end an abusive relationship before it starts. If you see the signs, walk away as soon as you can.


Unfortunately, 80 percent of women in abusive relationships will stay with their partner, according to a study by Teen Research Unlimited.


Though Rihanna’s only official words are through her publicist, thanking fans for support, polls are circulating the Internet asking if fans think the couple will stay together. If the allegations against Chris Brown are true, the best thing Rihanna can do is leave the relationship, setting a good example for all the people who need the courage to do the same.

2009-02-25,USF,study,"While the USF men’s basketball team has struggled on offense all season, the Bulls are learning to do things on defense.


Using strong defense, USF has pulled off surprising wins in the Big East this season, and the Bulls will look for the same effort when they face Seton Hall (14-12, 5-9) at 7 p.m. in Newark, N.J.


“We’re all on the same page defensively,” said USF junior guard Chris Howard. “It falls on (sophomore guard) Dominique Jones’ shoulders, and it falls on my shoulders to make sure the effort is there.”


The effort has been there lately. Despite ranking last in the conference with 59.8 points per game on offense, the Bulls are sixth in the Big East in scoring defense, holding their opponents to 65 points per game.


In the last three games, USF (8-18, 3-11) has held its opponents to less than 70 points, including 64 against No. 1 Connecticut.


“After the (UConn) game, (Huskies coach) Jim Calhoun came over to me and said ‘coach to be honest with you, you guys do a great job defensively,’ and that meant a lot to me,” said USF coach Stan Heath. “We’re fighting pretty hard out there.”


Heath said his focus remains on improving the team’s offense.


“Really, except for maybe a couple games, we’ve been able to hang around and fight in games,” he said. “It comes down to us being able to improve our shooting skills.”


Jones, who leads the team with 18 points per game, is one point shy of 1,000 in his career. When he breaks the record tonight, he will be the third player in school history to reach 1,000 career points, and the second-fastest to do it. The 6-foot-4 guard will set the mark in his 58th career game. Tony Grier reached 1,000 in 51 games during the 1980-81 season.


“I think from an individual standpoint, what he (Jones) brings to our program, it’s a huge step,” Heath said. “I’m more into team goals and winning and things that represent USF, but a part of that is having talented players.”


Heath is awaiting the status of  another important player. Senior guard Jesus Verdejo, who sat out of the Connecticut loss, is struggling with plantar fasciitis in his right foot. Heath said Verdejo should be able to play, though.


“Our team continues to fight, to compete as hard as we can, and we’re trying to spend extra time on different areas,” he said. “We have guys coming in the mornings to shoot free-throws and extra shots. I feel we can really improve in that area down the stretch.”

2009-02-26,USF,study,"Two student body election straw polls have yielded similar results, with candidates Juan Soltero and Bruno Portigliatti garnering the most votes and the green fee passing by more than 70 percent.


Student Alliance for a Politically Active Campus (SAPAC), which conducted the polls, counted votes only from students planning to vote in the SG election next week,
tallying 203  responses from the 236 students who voted in Wednesday’s poll.


Though the results are not scientific, 37.5 percent of Wednesday’s participants supported candidates Soltero and Portigliatti.


Candidates Christopher Leddy and Kayla Richmond were supported by 21.3 percent of voters, Christopher Cano and Jaime Lane by 12.3 percent and Ralph Reid and Robin Roup by 7.8 percent. Torend Ebner Jr, who dropped out of the race last week, received 0.4 percent of the vote.


SAPAC decided to conduct polls over two weeks to see if the level of campaigning changed from week to week or trends could be noticed. However, all candidates placed in the same order in both polls.


The campus green fee was approved by 76.8 percent of those polled Wednesday, similar to last week’s 73.7 percent.


This week’s results showed a larger amount of students were undecided, 20.7 percent, compared to last week’s 16 percent.


During both weeks, the poll was conducted at two locations: inside the Marshall Student Center and outside of Cooper Hall.


Christian Marble, president of SAPAC, said the organization hoped for more volunteers than it received, which limited the group from dispersing itself throughout campus.


“I feel that if there were two spots to pick on campus that have the most traffic and the most diversity of students, that we picked those two,” he said. “If we had a more standard operation in the future, we’d want to expand to at least Argos or Andros — the cafeteria areas — and perhaps to some other parts of campus, such as the College of Engineering or the College of Business.”


Marble said he was satisfied with the overall turnout of the event.


“Two hundred and thirty-six is a good sample size,” he said. “You can’t exactly pool every single college in every single time zone that students operate by.”


Susan MacManus, a political science professor, said straw polls are not meant to be scientific at the college level.


Straw polls are meant to educate students about an election and be fun for students, she said.


“A number of students have become aware (of elections) because of the straw poll,” Marble said. “I feel that because of that it was a pretty successful first event for us.”

Trailing by three with less than a minute to play, senior guard Shantia Grace made a crucial play to propel a 52-50 USF (21-9, 8-8) victory over Villanova (18-12, 10-6) at the Pavilion.


With 40 seconds left, Grace made a basket and hit a free throw to complete a three-point play and tie the game 50-50. Senior Jazmine Sepulveda then got a steal with nine seconds left and drained a shot to give the Bulls their 21st victory this season.


“Coach told me it was going to have to come from me,” Sepulveda said. “I just stole it and took it to the basket.”


At the end of the first half, the Bulls trailed by six and coach Jose Fernandez gave his team advice.


“He told us we had to talk more on defense,” Sepulveda said. “He told us we had to keep fighting the battles.”


Battle they did.


South Florida trailed by as many as seven in the second half but a jump shot by Sepulveda gave the Bulls the lead with 10:49 remaining. The Wildcats then took control of the game, but Fernandez told his team to stay together.


“He told us to keep our composure,” Sepulveda said. “He told us to play one defensive stop at a time.”


With a Georgetown and Marquette loss, the Bulls can climb into eighth place in the conference, earning them a first-round bye in the Big East tournament.

2009-03-04,USF,study,"Entering this weekend, USF softball coach Ken Eriksen said the Bulls haven’t played to their potential yet.


Coming off a doubleheader with Maine on Tuesday, the Bulls (13-9) will try to reach that potential when they host the Under Armour Invitational at the Eddie C. Moore Softball Complex in Clearwater.


“Right now, we can’t take any games for granted,” Eriksen said. “We have played lots of games this season that we’ve had a chance to win but were unable to capitalize on the little things.”


Sixteen teams will play in this weekend’s tournament, split into four pools of four teams each. USF will be in Pool A with Virginia Tech, Fordham and the Lehigh Mountain Hawks. The Bulls face the Hokies at 4 p.m. Friday.


Virginia Tech (5-10) appeared in the Women’s College World Series in 2008, making it the third team the Bulls have faced this season to do so.


The Hokies have struggled this year, beginning the season 2-7, but senior second baseman Britta Giddens said the Bulls won’t be focusing much on their opponents.


“(Eriksen’s) philosophy is to not play the name game,” she said. “We can’t worry about who we’re playing. We can only worry about how we play.”


USF will play Fordham (5-6) on Friday at 6 p.m. and the Mountain Hawks on Saturday at 1 p.m. Lehigh (7-3) made it to the NCAA tournament last season. The Bulls’ opponents for the remainder of the weekend will determine on their record leaving pool play.


The tournament also hosts teams including N.C. State, Villanova, Connecticut and Western Michigan. However, Eriksen said he wants the Bulls to worry about themselves.


“I think that recently our biggest opponent has been us,” he said. “Our main priority right now is this team, and we’re not worried about Virginia Tech or any of the other teams. In order to play good softball, we have to worry about ourselves and let everything else fall into place.”

2009-03-06,USF,study,"Next week, student body presidential candidates Christopher Leddy and running mate Kayla Richmond, and Juan Soltero and running mate Bruno Portigliatti will face off in a run-off election.


Soltero and Portigliatti led in the original race with 43 percent of the vote, and Leddy and Richmond trailed with 25 percent. There will be a run-off because no candidate received over 50 percent of the votes.


Candidates Christopher Cano and Ralph Reid will not move on to the final election.
Campaigning for next week’s elections begins as soon as candidates turn in their budgets, said Supervisor of Elections Michael van Hoek.


Richmond said she was “ecstatic” about their accomplishment.


Leddy said for the upcoming campaigning, the two would focus on making students more aware of the elections and getting them to vote for a second time.


Soltero and Portigliatti said they were very “excited” about their success.


“We knew we were fighting a strong campaign all along, and we’re gong to continue to do that until Wednesday,” Soltero said. “We hope all of our supporters come back and vote once again.”


After hearing the results, Cano said that he was just happy that students voted.
“Honestly, we ran the cleanest campaign,” he said. “We’re proud of the way we carried ourselves.” Reid’s running mate Robin Roup said she was “surprised” by the results. Reid and Roup probably won’t endorse another ticket, she said.


Reid could not attend the Election Night Announcement Social because he was in Tallahassee with the Political Honor Society, Roup said.


There were more than the presidential candidates to vote for on the ballot. Students could also vote for several non-binding referendums on the ballot. Though the votes will not directly decide any courses of action, they were meant to gauge student interest in the proposals.


A majority chose to use Capital Improvement Trust Fund money for a combination facility, with recreation center expansion and a nutritional dining facility in the Sun Dome, van Hoek said. The most-favored type of dining facility students voted for was a “grab and go” style of dining.


Students also chose to allocate the Tech Fee money for classroom capture technology, he said.


The Green Fee initiative was also supported by a majority of student voters, van Hoek said.


However, Student Environmental Association president Lyndsey Scofield was concerned over a last-minute change in the language of the Green Fee referendum on the ballot. Soltero said the language change will probably be looked into Friday.

2009-03-08,USF,study,"Student Government officials hoped for 10,000 educated votes in the student body election poll, but only 3,236 students voted.


Though the number of voters dropped, Supervisor of Elections Michael van Hoek said he was happy some of the “nonsense” from years past — including candidates giving pizza to voters or bringing laptops to parties where students were drinking — was eliminated. Last year, 5,165 students voted.


“We were able to get nearly 3,300 (voters) under actual, real circumstances,” van Hoek said. “From that angle, it was a success.”


SG marketing director Nathan Davison said that despite a complicated election week, there was much less corruption this year — but there were other unforeseen challenges, such as the issue with Blackboard.


“I would have liked to have seen more presence from candidates on campus,” he said.


This week, students will get a chance to vote again in a runoff election between candidates Christopher Leddy and running mate Kayla Richmond, and Juan Soltero and running mate Bruno Portigliatti.


Soltero and Portigliatti led in the original race with 43 percent of the vote, and Leddy and Richmond trailed with 25 percent. There will be a runoff because no candidate received more than 50 percent of the votes.


Candidates Christopher Cano and Ralph Reid will not move on to the final election.


Students can vote in the runoff election Tuesday and Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.


Before the voting results were announced, there were mixed feelings in the Oak Room of the Marshall Student Center (MSC).


Portigliatti said that if a runoff were to occur, it would be between the Soltero and Leddy tickets.


“It would be historical if it doesn’t go into a runoff,” he said. “Anytime you have four tickets, it is nearly impossible not to go into a runoff election.”


Soltero said he felt good but anxious, while Leddy said he was nervous but excited.


“A lot of people said they voted,” Leddy said. “Some people said they voted for me.”


Cano said he just wanted the winning candidates to have the student body behind them.


Roup said she felt some voting issues should have been resolved beforehand, such as the IP address problem that made voting more difficult for students living in off-campus apartments.


Aside from those issues, Roup felt the voting went well and said she was “trying to be optimistic” about the results.


Richmond said she was ecstatic about she and Leddy’s accomplishment.


Leddy said that in the upcoming campaign for the runoff, the two would focus on making students more aware of the elections and getting them to vote for a second time.


Soltero said the significant percentage felt good.


“But the election is still open — we’ve got to stay focused on the message. We’re going to keep fighting strong,” he said.


Both candidates said they have planned their first action in office.


Leddy said his first action would be to save the $1,000 he pledged for a scholarship fund and immediately start lobbying and talking to legislators.


Soltero said he wants to get his main cabinet members appointed as early as possible so they can gain the knowledge they need from this year’s members and transition smoothly.


Cano said he was not bothered by the loss but was happy students voted.


“Honestly, we ran the cleanest campaign,” he said. “We’re proud of the way we carried ourselves.”


Reid’s running mate Robin Roup said she was “kind of surprised” by the results. Reid and Roup  probably won’t endorse another ticket during the runoff election, she said.


Reid did not attend the Election Night Announcement Social because he was in Tallahassee with the Political Honor Society, Roup said.


Aside from presidential candidates, students also voted on several non-binding referendums. Though the votes will not directly effect any changes, they were meant to gauge student interest in the proposals.


A majority of students chose to allocate Capital Improvement Trust Fund money for a combination facility, which would include Campus Recreation Center expansion and a nutritional dining facility in the Sun Dome. Voters’ most favored type of dining facility was a “grab and go” style, like the MSC.


Students also chose to allot the Tech Fee money for classroom capture technology, which would provide video footage of class lectures that students could access online.


The Green Fee initiative was approved by 58 percent of voters.


However, before results were announced, Student Environmental Association (SEA) president Lyndsey Scofield said she was concerned about how a change in the language of the Green Fee referendum might affect voters’ decisions.


Scofield said the wording on the ballot asked if students would support a green fee for “green projects.”


“We actually had worded it as ‘renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on campus,'” Scofield said. “(The ballot) didn’t really say much about what a green project is or what it would actually be spent for. We were kind of disappointed in that.”


Soltero, as the SG Senate president, said the language issue has not yet been addressed in SG and that he will speak with Scofield and the Election Rules Commission about it.


He said the main goal of the referendum had not changed, so it was unclear whether it would require a re-vote.


Scofield said USF’s support of the Green Fee has made the case for the Green Fee legislation at the state level much stronger. She said SEA hopes to lobby state representatives to pass the Green Fee legislation during this session.

2009-03-09,USF,study,"Bathed in the light from the stained glass cross at Crystal River Methodist Church, a white “84” glinted off a dark green jersey.


That number had seen the triumph of the Bulls’ first bowl game victory. It had been pressed against a football as the person who bore that number, former USF football player Will Bleakley, ran across the field in games against UCF, Syracuse and East Carolina.


But this weekend, that number didn’t just represent Bleakley’s role as a tight end for the Bulls. It stood for the man who loved to play sports of any kind, who could beat just about all of his friends at golf but wouldn’t harass them too much about it, and whom friends said they revered as much for his book smarts as his athletic ability.


He was their friend, their teammate, their Will, and on Saturday afternoon, football coach Jim Leavitt, running backs coach Carl Franks and more than 100 people from the USF community gathered for a memorial service in Bleakley’s honor.


So many people attended the service they couldn’t all fit in the church, said former USF quarterback Grant Gregory. To let all the additional guests hear the service, the church set up speakers outside, which is where Gregory and other USF football players including Andrew Ketchel, Armando Sanchez and Carlton Mitchell gathered.


Though they didn’t get to sit inside, Gregory and Ketchel said the most important part of the service occurred afterward, when they had the chance to talk to Bleakley’s parents.


“It gave me some closure, just to hear from them and get a few words in,” Ketchel said.


One week ago, Will Bleakley and three friends — including NFL players Marquis Cooper and Corey Smith and former USF player Nick Schuyler — went fishing in the Gulf of Mexico when their boat overturned. The Coast Guard searched more than 20,000 miles of the Gulf’s waters but found only Schuyler clinging to the overturned 21-foot boat. Though the Bleakleys didn’t want to give up the search for their son, Betty Bleakley, Will’s mother, said that after talking with Schuyler as he recovered from hypothermia at Tampa General Hospital, they knew their son wouldn’t be returning home.


Schuyler, recently released from the hospital, also traveled to the service, limping as he walked — a reminder of the struggle the four men endured and the 40-plus hours Schuyler spent in the water.


“He was as devastated as anyone would be, having gone through that, but he’s doing real well,” Gregory said. “He’s lost some weight, but he should be back to normal soon.”


During a press conference Wednesday, Dr. Mark Rumbak said Schuyler had been experiencing some pain in his legs and left ankle as a result of hypothermia but is expected to make a full recovery soon.


Ketchel said that though he saw Schuyler the day before the service, spending time with him face-to-face made the past week feel all the more real.


“It gave me the realization that it all really did happen,” he said.


Though Bleakley was best known at USF as a football player, if his mom had it her way, he might never have donned the number 84. When he was in kindergarten, Betty Bleakley signed her son up for soccer and baseball, but she said she didn’t feel comfortable with the thought of him playing a sport as aggressive as football.


“I never thought I’d let him play because I was afraid he’d get hurt,” she said.


And then, when Will was in seventh grade, he came home from school with a form in his hand, she said. It was a permission slip to join the Sharks Football League. He had filled it out entirely, she said, and told her all she needed to do was sign it.


“I thought, ‘What am I going to do?'” his mother said. “So I said OK, and I signed it.”


Scott Miller, one of Bleakley’s childhood friends, played football and basketball with him in middle school. They also played baseball, and their passion for sports continued throughout college as the pair joined a men’s league in Clearwater and regularly played golf at the Claw while taking classes at USF.


Though Miller had scrimmaged against Bleakley countless times and played alongside him in a variety of sports, nothing compared to seeing his friend don a gold helmet and green uniform as he walked onto the field at Raymond James Stadium.


“Seeing him out there on the football field the first few times made me feel so good,” Miller said. “I was so happy to be a part of his journey to get to that place.”


On the field, teammates said Bleakley was the player new members turned to for guidance and support. He was a fifth-year senior when Ketchel began his freshman year, and though there are sometimes barriers between older and younger players, Ketchel said Bleakley never acted that way. Instead, he focused on helping others adjust to playing college football.


“He really provided the mentorship I needed,” he said. “It wasn’t just on the field, though — he invited me to go out on weekends and hang out with him, too. I never expected a starting senior to do that, but that was just him. He always reached out to other people.”


As Ketchel approached Bleakley’s parents, he said he worried it’d be difficult to find the right words to say to them. He grew more comfortable as he spoke to them, he said, drawing courage from their quiet strength, and decided to share with them the story he felt displayed their son’s character best: the way Bleakley broke down player age barriers, taking charge and guiding new team members through a world of two-a-day practices, adrenaline-pumping games and major lifestyle
adjustments.


“I wanted them to be able to have personal stories to take away from this and show what an impact he had,” he said. “He was such a good, caring person.”


During the service, football players, coaches, friends and family stood together not just to remember a number emblazoned on a jersey or Bleakley’s successes on the field.


They were there for something bigger: They were there for Will.

2009-03-10,USF,study,"The Suncoast Battalion, USF’s Army ROTC program, received the Army’s MacArthur Award — placing the program in the top 3 percent in the nation.


The award — given by the United States Army Cadet Command, headquartered at Fort Monroe, Va. — recognizes the achievement of the AROTC mission to produce the most commissioned second lieutenants out of an institution.


“Out of 273 host schools and 40 brigades, the Suncoast Battalion placed in the top eight programs,” said Lt. Col. Jim Botters.


Botters said this is the first time in the program’s 33-year history that the battalion has received the MacArthur Award.


“We have an amazing group of students in our program. We use peer mentoring in order to aid in student retention and also to create teamwork within our group,” he said. “It takes the whole program’s involvement to have a cadet graduate.”


Suncoast, a battalion comprising students from USF and other local universities — such as USF St. Petersburg, Eckerd College and St. Leo University — was recognized for the award based on overall GPA, physical training ability and rank of the cadets in the Army program.


The battalion was given a plaque commemorating its achievement, in addition to a streamer to place on the ROTC’s flag representing the win. The MacArthur Award also gave the program a $2,500 check to aid in operational and training expenses.


Botters said the extra funding will help USF purchase additional training uniforms and equipment for cadets.


“This award will draw more prospective students to our program, and our goal for next fall is to have 200 cadets,” he said. “Right now we have about 170 cadets, but our program is always growing and (is) expected to grow further due to this recognition.”


The battalion has increased attention to the program’s curriculum, said Senior Cadet Trey Ferguson.


“The MacArthur Award represents our abilities to produce qualified second lieutenants,” he said.


Botters said he believes the award is a culmination of the program’s curriculum and teamwork.


“Our partnership with the Florida National Guard for the past two years has been amazing. Since then, we have commissioned the most second lieutenants than any other state program and went over the goal we had previously set,” he said.


Carter Houndas, public relations chair of the battalion, said the MacArthur Award helped
reaffirm his decision to transfer to USF.


“I was not sure if my choice of transferring to USF was correct, but after winning this award, I feel certain I made the best decision,” he said. “We are now one of the top programs in the country and it is assuring to know that we are receiving the best training possible.”


Botters said USF is one of only 38 programs in the nation with established programs in all three ROTC branches.


“Seeing a cadet starting off as a first year, then seeing them graduate, and finally being commissioned as a second lieutenant is rewarding,” he said. “And the recognition of being in the top 3 percent in the nation just adds to each cadet’s achievement.”

2009-03-11,USF,study,"President Barack Obama’s message of hope and change, as well as his plan to put Americans back to work, is reminiscent of Franklin D. Roosevelt taking office after Herbert Hoovers’ continuous economic failures. Now that the stimulus package has passed, the big question is: Will it work?


Unfortunately, the measures taken by FDR did not solve the Great Depression. Rather, they prolonged and exacerbated it — as will Obama’s economic stimulus plan, if history is any indicator.


FDR implemented his own version of Keynesian economics in an attempt to rescue the country.


Keynesian economics was introduced in a book titled The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money by John Maynard Keynes. In a nutshell, Keynesian economics follows the principle that when the economy enters an off period, it can be fixed by the government borrowing money and injecting it into the economy. While that may sound good — and even work out in mathematical formulas — it does not always work out so well in the real world.


Keynesian economics overlooks one point: Government cannot inject money into the economy without first taking money out of it. This does not increase the available cash in the economy — it merely transfers the wealth.


This is evidenced by history. Hoover took office in 1929 amid a government surplus and low unemployment. The stock market bubble created by the Federal Reserve was beginning to deflate, and in response Hoover increased spending, funded by borrowing. The result was a budget deficit of 4.5 percent of the GDP and widespread unemployment. Roosevelt, while better on trade issues, followed the same approach as Hoover — with the same dismal results.


Obama’s “new New Deal” is reflective of FDR’s New Deal, which ballooned the U.S. budget with spending on local projects. The first New Deal failed because trying to spend your way out of a mess won’t work.


Still more examples — such as Gerald Ford’s tax rebate stimulus, Japan’s 0 percent interest rates, and George W. Bush’s high deficit spending and stimulus packages — demonstrate the overall failure of this economic policy.


These policies do not work because they over-liquidate the market. The last thing this country needs is more inflation — inflation being defined as an increase in the money supply.


Americans now face Obama’s economic plan — building bridges and roads and spending federal money to try to stimulate the economy. Sound familiar?


Obama’s recovery plan just might be the one to bring the U.S. economy to its knees. Americans have lived in a fantasy world of debt-financed consumption, and the nation will try to get out of its overconsumption-based economic woes with more debt.


America’s “phony economy,” as economist Peter Schiff calls it, is collapsing beneath its citizens. Obama must finance most of this debt via inflation. With the Fed already priming the pump with nearly $4 trillion of newly created stimulus just in the past year, America’s economy may become saturated.


Remember, Obama can inject more money into people’s pockets, but that money will have less purchasing power than before. It is not how many dollars but what those dollars can get you.


America could create a hyperinflationary depression with too much printing and spending — a situation everyone wants to avoid. However, if printing, borrowing and spending is this administration’s plan, that may be our inevitable future.

2009-03-12,USF,study,"Students can get many things at the campus Bookstore: textbooks, apparel, school supplies and now video games. Last week, the online video game service GameFly launched its G-Box — the latest in video game rental technology.


G-Box is a kiosk that allows patrons to rent a variety of games with just a swipe of a credit card and a push of a button. Located in the Bookstore, G-box rents a selection of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games for $2.49 per day, as well as Wii and PlayStation 2 games for $1.99 per day.


The bright yellow G-Box uses a simple touch screen that lets customers browse through popular genres including adventure, role playing and sports. The kiosk also has a slot for returning games.


Sean Spector, co-founder and senior vice president of business development and content of GameFly, said the service is perfect for on-demand gaming.


“There are those moments when you really want a game that day or that night, and the G-Box caters to that desire,” he said.


Spector, a gamer in his own right who is currently playing Mario Kart and Gears of War 2, said GameFly plans to keep the G-Box as up-to-date as possible.


“Our goal is to refresh the inventory a couple of times a month — if not more,” he said.


Spector also said that while there is no option to buy games from the G-Box, renters who wish to keep a game can simply choose not to return it and will be charged only up to the retail price of the game plus a small restocking fee.


The kiosk accommodates students who are unable to leave campus to rent games, as well as those who don’t want to sign up for one of GameFly’s online subscriptions


To promote the G-Box, the Bookstore is handing out promotional one-day rental coupons at the cashier’s desk.


Customers should have no trouble locating the kiosk. Bradley Keville, a sophomore majoring in mass communications, said it’s hard to miss.


“It was the first thing that caught my eye as I walked in the Bookstore — I had to at least go check it out,” he said.


Keville said he doesn’t consider himself a “video game aficionado,” but thought the G-Box was easy to use and inviting even to the not-so-avid gamer.


“I wasn’t quite satisfied with their selection, but it’s a good start — I’m definitely interested,” he said.


Bookstore employees are also excited about this latest feature.


“We hope that it becomes a service that students come to count on and enjoy,” said Grace McQueen, Bookstore manager.


She also said she doesn’t anticipate any problems with the G-Box.


“Our association with GameFly has been very responsive. It’s a brand-new machine, there is a help line that the customer can call — so I’m not anticipating any service issues, and if there were any they would be addressed immediately,” she said.


Once construction is finished, the G-Box will be relocated to the new Marshall Student Center Atrium.

2009-03-22,USF,study,"University administrators completed their review concerning Dr. Abdul Rao last week, and though no decisions were made that will directly affect Rao, recommendations were made to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.


The review, conducted by Paula Knaus, associate dean for Faculty and Staff Affairs in the College of Public Health, and Senior Vice Provost Dwayne Smith, concluded that though Rao believed his intentions were good and altruistic, he did not seem to grasp the full meaning of his actions.


“There is no question that Dr. Rao’s ability to serve as a senior administrator would have been substantially compromised for some time by this incident,” the report states.


The “climate” of the Byrd Institute at USF Health was also an issue of concern. One recommendation dealt with ensuring that the environment of the center was “productive.”


When the Byrd Institute merged with USF Health, it had no funding from the state and many staff positions were cut, which may have left a negative atmosphere among
employees, said USF spokesman Michael Hoad.


The posting of video surveillance posted on YouTube could have changed the outcome of the situation, and its effects should be looked into to prevent similar incidents in the future, the report states.


A video of Rao and an acquaintance, Victor Waiters, a homeless man, was posted on YouTube on the morning of Feb.12. The video shows the two men pull up to the loading dock of the Byrd Institute between 8 and 9 p.m. on Feb. 9, take a bicycle from the dock and drive away.


The bicycle was returned Feb. 10 just after 12:30, as seen on further surveillance video — but not before the student who parked the bike there, Christine Dillingham, found it missing. The bike belonged to her friend, graduate student Timothy Boyd.


Rao told the Oracle that the bicycles under the loading dock appeared to be abandoned, and that such a possibility was not unlikely because many employees who had recently been laid off had left belongings at the institute. When he aided Waiters in taking the bike, Rao said, he did not feel the was doing anything wrong because he was simply borrowing it.


Controversy surrounded the issue because video of the incident was posted on the Internet before authorities had time to take proper action. When the surveillance video was viewed Feb. 10, Boyd asked to receive a copy of the tape, but the report states that he maintained he was not the person who posted the videos to YouTube.


“We found the widespread viewing of the Byrd Institute security video occurred in an atmosphere void of any procedural guidelines,” the administrative report states. “It is our opinion that copies should not have been transferred to anyone without following proper protocol for release of a public record that may become evidence in criminal or civil litigation.”


Rao resigned from his position before any disciplinary action or reviews could yield decisions regarding the situation.


“As soon as I learned of the incident, I placed the administrator on annual leave and removed his administrative responsibilities,” wrote Stephen Klasko, dean of the College of Medicine, to Knaus and Smith. “Shortly thereafter, he chose to resign and has left the University.”


For future issues, Knaus and Smith suggest in the report that guidelines be set up for viewing and distributing security tapes.


“Our concern is predicated on the fact that the unfettered access demonstrated in the case discussed here could seriously compromise future investigations and/or prosecutions of serious criminal or civil matters,” the report states.


Klasko wrote that a lot of the surveillance equipment had not yet been integrated with USF’s systems.


“We will continue to integrate those systems to achieve the goal (outlined), which is to preserve a secure chain of evidence,” he stated.


When reviewing tapes and conducting interviews, Knaus and Smith were unable to determine whether the bike was locked at the loading dock — a fact that differed among interviewees’ accounts and could not clearly be determined by watching the surveillance tapes.


Another controversial topic that varied among accounts of the incident was whether Rao put pressure on Boyd to drop the charges once the bicycle was returned.


Rao called Boyd into his office Feb. 11 after he learned of the events that transpired after the incident. He apologized for taking the bicycle and asked Boyd to consider refraining from taking action against him. Boyd, however, felt Rao pressured him to drop the charges.


“Mr. Boyd indicated … Dr. Rao was civil in his request and was not threatening or intimidating in his manner of address,” the report states.


However, administrators wrote that tensions among employees that originated when USF and the Byrd Institute merged were evident in interviews.


“Mr. Boyd’s opinion of Dr. Rao was clearly negative,” they stated. “We believe that such tensions contributed significantly to the volume and far-reaching extent of the ensuing furor.”


Knaus and Smith interviewed several sources to determine further steps and recommendations regarding the investigation. Dillingham and Boyd were both spoken to in the presence of Boyd’s attorney. Byrd Institute employees Christine Tam, interim director of operations, Zoe Gustafson, chief financial officer, and Patrick Zorn, security and building assistant, were spoken to, as well as Dr. Huntington Potter, senior research scientist and former director of the Byrd Institute. Knaus and Smith also spoke with Mike Chapel, the Siemens technician who first obtained and watched the tapes.


Rao declined an interview on the advice of his attorney, the report stated. Instead, the administrators used police statements from both Rao and Waiters to construct their side of the story.


Klasko stated that further integration between the Byrd Institute and USF is needed.


“We are scheduling a retreat to address the big issue: creating a sense of identity for all the researchers and clinicians who now call the Byrd Institute home,” he stated.


Hoad said this ends any involvement by USF in the case.

Earlier this month, the Board of Trustees approved an affiliation between USF Health and Lehigh Valley Hospital (LVH) in Allentown, Pa. USF is now preparing to submit a request of approval to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to host an off-site program in Pennsylvania with LVH.


LVH would supply USF with funding for the program.


USF would provide the salary for a new position of associate dean for LVH, who would report to Klasko.


“They are going to give us $2 million to renovate the medical classrooms, and that will probably be matched by the state,” said Stephen Klasko, dean of the College of Medicine.


Some LVH doctors would become part of the USF faculty and travel between Tampa and Pennsylvania as needed.


Vice Dean of Educational Affairs Alicia Monroe will work with the faculty at LVH to develop an educational program on the USF campus.


“Students in this program would get all the basic medical curriculum with some additional education in the areas of physician leadership, quality and safety, and efficient use of resources,” Monroe said.


She said students on the leadership track would spend their first two years in Tampa completing medical school course work followed by two years as residents at LVH.


The program would be valuable to all USF medical students because the College of Medicine would have the opportunity to  both revise and enhance its curriculum, and offer more electives, Monroe said.


LVH looked for specific criteria in its search for a new medical school partner, Klasko said. It looked for a medical school and health science center that had integrated medicine, nursing and public health.


“With USF Health, we’ve probably done that as well as anybody,” he said.


Klasko said the hospital wanted a university that understood the importance of leadership in health care.


“We’ve actually created a center for transformation and innovation which encompasses the leadership that is now used by hospitals around the country,” Klasko said.


He said LVH looked for a medical school interested in the uses of information technology.


USF Health demonstrated its interest in information technology by holding a conference to discuss how to transform Tampa Bay into a completely electronic health care city, Klasko said.


Klasko said he thinks the additional hospital affiliate will be good for USF since the University has no on-campus hospital at this time.


“In a place like the University of Florida, students would do their residency at the University of Florida’s hospital, Shands (Health Care). We don’t have a hospital, but we have hospital affiliates,” Klasko said. “Our medical students go to Tampa General Hospital, the Moffitt Cancer Center, the VA Hospital or All Children’s Hospital.”


Klasko said he thinks the program will benefit LVH because it is more consistent with the  hospital’s goals than past partners have been.


The program will draw students from out of state that otherwise may not have considered USF when selecting a medical school, he said.


“For us and for Florida, what is great about it is (the partnership) would bring a new medical school, with decreasing state funding,” Klasko said. “New resources on behalf of all of our students in the medical school are important.”


USF Health will submit official paperwork for the program approval April 15. If the LCME approves the program, USF can begin designing the official curriculum for the health care leadership track.


The first class would be admitted in summer 2011.

2009-03-24,USF,study,"Students may find it hard to sleep when exams and term papers are looming in the near future. The pressure and stress has caused many to turn to prescription sleep aids.


A Reuters’ study released this year shows that the number of college-aged adults 18-to-24 using prescription sleep aids has nearly tripled in the last decade.


Dr. Leonard Kirklen, clinical psychologist in the USF Counseling Center, said he seldom suggests prescription medications for sleep problems because they are addictive.


The medications also include many side effects and are not recommended to be taken for long periods of time. He often recommends natural products because they tend to sedate the body, leaving it relaxed so sleep is more natural.


“Three-fourths of the students I counsel are not aware of the natural options in the market or that many of them have been thoroughly tested,” Kirklen said. “However, natural doesn’t mean no side effects and not all products labeled natural are truly all natural, so students should read labels and talk to their doctors.”


Doctors in other countries routinely prescribe natural remedies over prescriptions, Kirklen said,  while in the United States the pharmaceutical companies heavily market their easy-fix products leaving natural aids lagging in the dust.


Carmen Stein, a doctoral student and licensed psychotherapist, cautions against natural aids because they have not been regulated or rigorously tested.


“With regulated medication we know how much a child can take versus an adult and which medications just shouldn’t be taken together,” Stein said. “If there was some great natural product out there the pharmaceutical companies would have snatched it up.”


Lauren Johnson, a sophomore majoring in education, started struggling in school because of sleepless nights and has turned to natural sleep aids sold at the local Whole Foods Market.


“I have been taking Relaxity to ease stress and make my body and mind calm before going to bed,” Johnson said. “So far, it seems to be helping me fall asleep and not have stressful anxiety during the day. I do not take the pills everyday, but have not yet noticed negative side effects since starting it two months ago.”


Johnson said she has not consulted her doctor about her natural remedy intake and is not all that worried since the products are labeled as natural.


“I am really looking forward to trying another sleep aid by the name of Dreamerz because it comes in chocolate bars as well as fruity and chocolate drinks,” she said. “It seems fun because its ingredients are not packaged in a pill.”


Take the time to unwind from the day


“Ideally an hour, but even 20 minutes, needs to be taken to clear the mind of the things of the day before lying down to sleep,” Kirklen said.


A common mistake students make is studying right before going to bed, he said.


“There may be a lot of legitimate time pressures, but if they do not take some time to put the books aside and make the transition from the day, they will spend countless hours trying to fall asleep afterward,” Kirklen said. “The brain cannot simply shut off after going to classes and studying all day.”


To get an easy night’s rest without the assistance of pills, Stein suggests a few things. She said the warmth of a hot bath is always helpful and listening to slow, soft music can relax one to sleep. She also said a classic warm cup of milk releases enzymes that allow the brain to rest.


Find the cause


There are many triggers inhibiting sleep, including test anxiety and depression, but the No. 1 cause is stress. The inability to fall asleep — or an unproductive sleep — leaves the body exhausted the next day.


To fall asleep and get a good night’s rest, the body needs to be relaxed physically, emotionally and mentally. Many students find it hard to relax because they are worrying about financial, school and personal issues.


“Students need to balance and prioritize. When trying to put 100 percent into everything, the numbers just don’t add up,” Kirklen said.


“If there is no downtime away from school, you will mentally burn out and not be able to concentrate and become less productive.”


An inconsistent schedule is another factor in poor sleep because it does not allow the body to get on a regular timetable of knowing when to fall asleep and can restrain the normal stages of sleep.


“I feel that my sleep problems are stress-related because I do not have trouble when I am not taking classes and I am always stressed during the school year,” Johnson said.


Stein said sleep problems could be the result of a medical condition rather than stress or an inconsistent schedule, so it is important to find the source and learn how to treat it.


Students can go to theCounseling Center to speak with a psychiatrist or psychologist for free to try to determine what is triggering their sleep-related problems and how to best solve them.

2009-03-25,USF,study,"It was a night USF coach Lelo Prado would like to forget.


“It was terrible,” Prado said. “It was bad from the very beginning. I knew we were in trouble. Every guy in that locker room should be disappointed.”


The Bulls’ six-game win streak came to halt Tuesday night in a 4-3 loss to Stetson filled with defensive miscues and squandered opportunities.


With the Bulls (13-8, 3-0) leading Stetson 2-1 in the bottom of the seventh, three consecutive bunt singles by Mike Consolmagno, Peter Brotons and Ryan Lockwood loaded the bases.


Stetson reliever Jake Hitchcock retired the next three batters, however, to get out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam.


“We had the bases loaded with no outs and didn’t score a run with the middle of the lineup,” Prado said. “If you don’t score at that time or get one or two runs, you’re not going to be a very good club.”


USF starter Teddy Kaufman, coming off a complete game win March 18 against FAMU, allowed only one run until the eighth inning, when Stetson, trailing 2-1, scored three runs, giving the Hatters a 4-2 lead to put the game away.


Kaufman didn’t walk a single batter and struck out five. Three of the four runs he gave up came in the eighth inning.


“(Kaufman) did a great job — both starters did a great job,” Prado said. “We just weren’t ready to play.”


USF jumped out early with runs in the first and second inning but missed opportunities late, failing to score with the bases loaded in the eighth.


“We scored two runs early, but I knew we were in trouble,” Prado said. “You’ve got a win streak, and you’ve got a chance to keep it going. I don’t understand how you can’t be ready to play. Days like this make it tough.”


USF had some untimely miscues in the field, including a failed attempt to cover second base on a0 Stetson steal attempt in the eighth inning.


“When you don’t cover a bag, when a guy’s stealing, you know you’re mind’s not in the game,” Prado said.


Prado said he hopes for improvements in today’s game at Bethune-Cookman at 5 p.m.


“When you’re trying to get to where you want to go, you can’t have nights like this,” Prado said. “They’ve got to understand that, they’ve got to bring it to the ball park every day, and we didn’t do it. I apologize to the USF fans because that isn’t the way we’re supposed to play.”

2009-03-26,USF,study,"Students focused on traffic safety during the biannual N.I.T.E. Walk.


Nearly 150 students and staff members who joined the student organization Necessary Improvements to Transform our Environment (N.I.T.E.) Wednesday night.


Traffic on campus was a main concern for James Hyatt, senior vice president of finance and business. He said there are plans in the budget to install a traffic light on the corner of Holly Drive and 50th Street, where many traffic accidents occur. Sidewalks are also planned for the high-traffic area.


Students said the many automobile and bicycle crimes around USF were also a big concern.


Zain Nensey, a junior accounting major, said there needs to be a student safety awareness program during orientation, especially regarding car theft.


“Although there are budget cuts, safety is something you cannot ignore,” he said.


The N.I.T.E. Walk is an event that allows students to assess safety issues. Students, joined by several staff members including Hyatt and UP police chief Thomas Longo, broke into nine groups of 10 to 12 people and marched off to seek out unsafe areas.


“We take the reports from each group and put the concerned issues onto two lists,” said Eileen Dabrowski, president of N.I.T.E. “Things that are inexpensive and necessarily easy to fix, such as trimming shrubs and replacing blubs, we sent to Physical Plant.”


She said these issues are almost immediately taken care of, but larger issues that are more expensive and timely go on a wish list of sorts.


Each year N.I.T.E., vice president of Public Safety Bruce Benson and Student Government work together to accomplish several of their top wish list items.


“This year one of our top wish list items is a stop sign on Alumni Drive, which is a top accident spot on campus,” said Nicole Randazzo, SG chief of staff.


Last November, N.I.T.E. walk volunteers and members reported that the yellow lights around campus were very dull and several of the emergency lights on campus were out. While all of the emergency lights were lit this time around, students said the blue lights seem to be too dull and not very visible.


Also, students were not allowed to test the blue light emergency system buttons during the walk because it would stall the system if there were an actual emergency on campus.


Students said they were disappointed they were unable to test the emergency buttons, but Longo said the system is tested monthly and that all the lights do work.


He also said that police officers are one to two minutes away from an emergency because the station is located on campus.


“In some areas it takes police 10-20 minutes to respond to a call, and it only takes our guys one to two minutes, which allows us to snatch the robber,” he said.


Overall, Longo and students said USF is a fairly safe campus despite minor issues that need to be fixed.

2009-03-29,USF,study,"In Tampa, art is in the eye of the beholder — if it can be found.


For USF students, the on-campus Contemporary Art Museum (CAM) offers no shortage of visual stimulation for those who seek it out. But for art aficionados out and about in the city, it takes a bit of searching to find the great art it has to offer.


Bleu Acier
For a wide range of art from the U.S. and across the pond, Bleu Acier is a fine host. Bleu Acier is a residence, print shop, studio and gallery space owned and operator by artist Erika Greenberg-Schneider.


“I though it would be a good place to introduce international art and bring European artists to arena,” she said. “I show a lot of works on paper and prints and I bring original works here occasionally when I can afford to.”


Bleu Acier hosts beginning, mid-career and established U.K. and U.S. artists and offers a wide variety of genres and themes anyone can enjoy.

Lisa Harasiuk, founder and curator of three04, likes to bring outsiders’ art to Tampa.


“I want to expose people to things outside of the Tampa culture that they don’t see every day and to broaden people’s horizons on all things beautiful,” she said. “I like sculpture and I have so far shown drawings and paintings with a pretty wide range (of artistic styles).”


The gallery accepts submissions through the Web and is funded by donations from local artists and art lovers.

Though most curators share the goal of expanding viewers’ horizons, Tracy Midulla Reller, founder and affiliate of [5]art, has a more simplistic primary goal.


Reller said she just wants to bring the community art that is professional and relatable.


She also said she wants to promote working artists and give the local community a way to engage in visual arts.


“Because we work as a collective, we basically toss all of our ideas in the hat. We always try to keep emerging and mid-career artists — mix it up,” she said.


The collective shows contemporary and emerging art and hopes to usher student artists into the working world.

Flight 19’s main function is to provide a space that supports local community artists of all mediums. The venue is an abandoned baggage claim that the artist collective Experimental Skeleton uses with permission from the city of Tampa. The collective hosts visual art, live music and performance shows, projects, lectures and workshops.


Past visual art shows have included Mark Mothersbaugh’s Beautiful Mutants, vintage portrait photographs manipulated by Mothersbaugh; LOUDART, a collection of Tampa punk show flyers from the ’80s and ’90s; and Furniture Challenge, a reality show pilot in which contestants competed to build the highest-quality chair.

2009-03-30,USF,study,"Campus administrators met Monday to follow up on a gun scare that occurred last week and determined that the event should have been held in the Marshall Student Center (MSC).


Any events that are not academic in nature and include more than 60 people are not allowed to take place in Cooper Hall, where the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity held a talent show Thursday night, said Dean of Students Kevin Banks.


During the talent show, David Joseph Thornton, who is not affiliated with USF, brandished a gun outside the Cooper Hall Auditorium after he was booed offstage and asked to leave the event. He pointed the gun at a group of about 100, said UP spokeswoman Lt. Meg Ross.


“(The event) should have been in the MSC,” Banks said. “We want to find out what steps didn’t happen that led the event being moved to that venue.”


Administrators are still gathering information about the incident so conclusions can be made, said assistant chief of police Major JD Withrow, who led the meeting.


He said the meeting was planned late Friday, so there had not been much time to investigate.


“We opened up more questions than answers,” Banks said.


He said administrators would try to determine how and why the event’s planning happened as it did.


“(We will) see if we need to do something different with protocols of events on campus,” Banks said.


Withrow said administrators plan to talk to fraternity brothers as well as event coordinators, and Banks said the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life would also meet with the organization.


The Events and Meeting Services Office will also follow up with its staff for further clarification on where the event was supposed to be held and whether it was correctly scheduled, Banks said.


“We have to finalize those questions and make determination whether we have to say that organization was or wasn’t responsible,” he said. “When you plan properly, you prevent poor performance.”


He said the Univeristy needs to make sure people are educated about how to properly plan an event.


“In the long run I think it’s going to be helpful,” Withrow said.


Administrators at the meeting Monday included Banks and Withrow, as well as associate director of the MSC Greg Jackson, academic services administrator Lynda Farris, Safety and Compliance Manager for Environmental Health and Safety Carneal Smith, and director of the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life Megan Vadnais.

2009-04-01,USF,study,"First dates, blind dates and secret setups by mothers are all landmines for singles on the dating circuit. When all other attempts seem to fail, the World Wide Web offers a new-age alternative to old-school dating.


I decided to try my luck at downtoearth.com, a free dating site launched by match.com in January. The site promotes itself as the most “honest and respectful free dating community on the Internet,” and it uses an accuracy rating system to weed out dishonest daters.


First I had to eliminate singles who didn’t meet my requirements. Then I eliminated users with distorted photos, lengthy descriptions of kinky bedside preferences, poor grammar and questionable sexual orientation. I then needed to find someone who was looking for preferences that I fulfilled.


The lucky bachelor made his first dating faux pas during our initial phone conversation. After playing phone tag, we finally got an opportunity to speak, and he proceeded to thank me for a wonderful evening — but we had never met.


Further conversation revealed that he had mixed me up with another girl! After I explained that it was the first time we’d talked, he struggled to recover the conversation by explaining that he had accidentally mistaken my number for that of friend with whom he’d recently had dinner.


I tried to give the poor guy the benefit of the doubt and accepted his dinner invitation. I was cautious about meeting a stranger and insisted on meeting him at a restaurant I frequent often.


I was relieved when I met him and saw that his pictures and profile information seemed to be completely accurate. He didn’t try to kidnap me and did not appear to be lewd or psychotic, so he had already earned points over some of my past first dates.


As I was new to the online dating scene, I expected our meeting to be awkward. I soon realized it was no different than any other first date I had been on. We exchanged typical banter about ourselves, our hometowns and our hobbies. As expected, there were the lulls in conversation and moments of awkward silence typical of first-time meetings. We found common ground by discussing our experiences with the Web site we had used to meet each other. It was the first time either of us had experimented with online dating.


My date was seven years older than me, much older than anyone else I have dated, but he didn’t seem concerned about the age difference and had said in his online profile that he was interested in younger women. One time he did point out how young I was with a sarcastic joke, but otherwise it didn’t seem to matter.


I was pleasantly surprised that he seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He was very polite — a gentleman, in fact — and was enjoyable company. He completely exceeded my expectations of online prospects. The date went better than most of my past first date experiences have: He treated me well, opened doors, bought dinner and drinks, and never tried to put a move on me. Before we parted ways he told me not to expect an immediate phone call the next day because he didn’t want to overwhelm me right up front with too much contact. I took that as a brush-off and figured I wouldn’t hear from him again, but he ended up texting me.


Though we got along well, I wondered how much we would have in common after the novelty of getting to know each other wore off. Would we have anything to talk about? Neither of us expected anything serious to come out of using the site. He was new to the area with no nearby friends or family and was using the site to meet people. I was upfront about using the site as a social experiment and admitted that I would be writing an article about my experience. The evening ended with a hug and I sensed that we both knew it wasn’t going to work.


Online dating offers a great chance to meet a huge pool of prospective singles. To my pleasure, I didn’t encounter any creeps or forum trolls that online dating stereotypes play into. Though it was an all-around rewarding experience, I’m not sure I would try it again. Call me an old-fashioned girl, but I still enjoy the novelty of chance first meetings and love at first sight.

2009-04-02,USF,study,"Redshirt freshman quarterback Evan Landi is used to making adjustments, so it wasn’t too hard to fit in when he started working with the wide receivers last week.


“I just want to help out in whatever way I can,” Landi said.


Less than a week later, he might be doing more than he expected.


With coach Jim Leavitt’s announcement Tuesday that senior wide receiver Jessie Hester will miss the rest of spring practice with an ankle injury, Landi may see more opportunity to play in the Bulls’ spring game April 11.


USF is also without junior A.J. Love, who is recovering from an ACL injury suffered in the
magicJack St. Petersburg Bowl on Dec. 20.


“Landi’s doing good … and he’s adjusting real well at wide receiver,” said USF offensive coordinator Mike Canales. “He’s that type of athlete, wanting to do things like change positions.”


Landi, who played as both quarterback and defensive back in high school, said he prefers playing quarterback but is happy for the opportunity to play at wide receiver. Leavitt even placed Landi on the starting kickoff return team at Wednesday’s practice.


“I really want to be a quarterback someday, but it’s been good spending time with the receivers and seeing how they do things in practice,” Landi said. “Hopefully, I’ll be able to help the team out next season.”


Landi, a Coral Springs native, was 2A first-team all-state as a senior, throwing for
11 touchdowns on offense with three interceptions and 60 tackles as a safety. Leavitt said he’s hoping to use Landi’s athleticism this fall.


“Obviously, I’m wanting to play him (this spring) to get him ready for the fall,” he said. “He’s going to play a lot of football for us this fall, and I’ll be shocked if he’s not in our regular rotation at receiver.”


Leavitt said Landi will work at the receiver position and as backup quarterback this spring.

2009-04-04,USF,study,"For the first time in school history, a USF basketball team ended the season in different fashion: victory.


Despite playing in front of an opposing crowd of 16,113 and having to fight a late Kansas (22-14) run, the USF women’s basketball team defeated the Jayhawks 75-71 Saturday to win the 2009 WNIT Championship.


The victory marks the first men’s or women’s postseason title in basketball, and USF ends the season with a program-best 27-10 record.


“I could not be prouder of this group,” said USF coach Jose Fernandez. “This is a memory they will never forget — this is what college athletics is all about.”


USF entered halftime on a 10-2 run with an eight-point lead, and the Bulls pushed the lead to 10 during the second half.


However, Kansas came back to cut it to 69-66 with less than four minutes remaining. But tight defense helped the Bulls to pull away at the end.


“We’re a great second half team,” said USF senior Jessica Lawson. “I really give credit to our leadership. We pulled each other together and calmed each other down.”


Falling behind early in the first half, USF mounted a 10-2 run before the midway point that fueled a defensive effort to keep Kansas to less than 10 points in the first nine minutes. With a free throw from Jazmine Sepulveda, USF retained a one-point lead and never trailed again.


Senior Shantia Grace, who was awarded the WNIT MVP trophy after a 14-point performance, said it was a high-intensity game.


“We knew they were a great team,” Grace said. “We just had to attack them just like they attacked us.”


Lawson said Grace led the Bulls Saturday.


“(Grace) is our leading scorer, but she’s also been our leader vocally,” she said.


After the game, the Bulls gathered at mid-court celebrating and holding the WNIT trophy. The players and coaches ascended a ladder and cut down the net. At that point, Lawson said her emotions began to sink in.


“It’s still surreal,” she said. “I’m full of emotions. I’m happy we won, but I am sad that it was my last game.”


Six other seniors completed their final game. Lawson said Saturday’s victory and her relationship with the team is what she’ll remember.


“It is a blessing that we won,” she said. “Only two teams get to say that they won at the end of the season — we are one of those teams. This shows that we are strong, and that we can overcome anything if we work together.”

2009-04-06,USF,study,"The age-old stereotype of the dumb jock may be coming to an end, as a new study suggests that physical fitness can lead to improved spatial memory and increased brain function.


Several studies have indicated that bigger is better when it comes to the hippccampus, and now researchers at the University of Pittsburg and the University of Illinois have linked its size to physical fitness.


The hippocampus, located deep inside the medial temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex, is essential to memory formation. The first part of the brain to be affected by Alzheimer’s disease, it is essential for spatial navigation, relational memory — which allows the brain to connect disparate pieces of information — and information recollection.


Previous studies have indicated that the hippocampus deteriorates with age, causing memory to decline. Past research has linked exercise and increased hippocampus size in rodents, but psychology professors Art Kramer and Kirk Erickson, who led the study, and their colleagues have demonstrated the same effect in humans.


Larry Mengelkoch, a professor at the USF School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences, said an active lifestyle can promote neurogenesis, the development of nerve tissue, and protect the nervous system from injury and disease.


The study measured the cardio respiratory fitness levels of 165  adults aged 59 to 81. Researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to examine hippocampus size and spatial memory capacity.


The study reflected a significant correlation between physical fitness and hippocampus size. The results are important because the hippocampus controls the part of the memory that people rely on daily to store new information.


Few studies have examined how physical activity affects the academic performance of young adults, Mengelkoch said. Research on children aged 4 to 18 has shown a correlation between physical fitness and cognitive ability, including perception, IQ, academics and test performance, he said.


Though student athletes at USF may not have noticed a significant correlation between their physical fitness and memory, many believe their fitness routines have had a positive influence on their academic performance.


“I seem to get more work done in a more timely manner,” said mechanical engineering major Rafsan Syed, who plays intramural soccer. “My studying seems to be more   effective.”


Pre-medical science major Kay Kay Enigbokan also said his participation in intramural sports on campus has led to better grades.


“I didn’t play any sports during my first semester and also didn’t take many classes. Now I take 18 credits while also playing basketball and soccer,” he said.


Biology major Alysha Romero said sports give her the energy to study more and do better in class.


Student athletes are not necessarily at an academic advantage because studies indicate that even moderate physical activity is enough to maintain brain function, Mengelkoch said. Most students will be able to sustain memory function with simple aerobic exercises, he said.


The results of this study are significant because they support the concept that an active lifestyle can benefit one’s mental health, Erikson said


“Basically, if you stay fit, you retain key regions of your brain involved in learning and memory,” he said.

The Bulls’ hard work has paid off.


USF has earned a spot in the Blue Gray National Tennis Classic held March 2010 in Montgomery, Ala. The event will feature 16 teams and is the second-oldest tennis competition in the country.


“It’s probably one of the biggest team tournaments in the country other than the NCAAs,” said USF coach Don Barr. “It’s a privilege to be invited. It’s a good sign.”


This is the third time Barr — the longest tenured coach at USF — has taken the Bulls to the tournament.


“We never really got to the finals, so those would be a nice new experience,” he said. “They have very good teams.”


No. 43 Virginia Commonwealth, No. 18 Arizona and No. 20 Notre Dame are among the tournament’s participants USF has faced this year.


The Bulls have two ranked singles players: Sophomore Lucas Jovita, USF’s No. 1 player, ranks No. 75 and freshman Wael Kilani ranks No. 97 — his first collegiate ranking.


Junior Thomas Estrada and Jovita, USF’s No. 1 doubles team, rank No. 44.


When USF struggled in doubles, freshman Yannick Yoshizawa replaced Romain Deridder as Kilani’s partner. Yoshizawa and Kilani hold a 6-3 doubles record.


“I’m really happy because it will be my second year here,” Yoshizawa said. “I’m excited about this program.

2009-04-08,USF,study,"A proposition to lower the gambling age in Florida from 21 to 18 years old will be voted on by the Florida Senate next week.


Passing this proposition may pose a risk to college-age students looking for a quick way to lessen the burden of hefty loans and living expenses, as their age group is at the highest risk for developing a gambling problem.


However, being legal adults means 18-year-olds should have a fundamental right to do what they want with their money, provided it does not harm the lives of others.


Those who are 18 and older can already bet in greyhound and horse races and play the lottery, which essentially are no different from Las Vegas-style gambling.


The risk posed by gambling has entirely to do with one’s personal investment.
Eighteen-year-olds have the ability to make cognitive decisions by law, so odds are that they have the ability to comprehend the risk of betting their own money.


Though some of the table games not yet legal for 18-year-olds have higher buy-ins, they should not be forced into a separate legal category. There is no difference between betting $100 on a game of no-limit poker and buying 100 $1 scratch-offs.


In fact, a player’s odds of getting a royal flush — the best hand in poker — is more than 100 times greater than the odds of winning the PowerBall, a game in which 18-year-olds can already legally participate.


As for the concerns for a young individual’s possible change in lifestyle because of gambling, it would be better for them to start at an age in which they will play sober. It is a given that a number of underage persons do engage in the consumption of alcohol, but in public it can be regulated. This could prevent a large amount of 21st birthday bashes which result in a night of drunken, uneducated, high-stakes gambling.


With a $6 billion deficit, Florida’s economy could benefit from the legalization of the 18-year-old legal gambling age. Other famous gambling locations — including Las Vegas and Atlantic City — do not allow 18-year-olds to gamble, so youths from other states might begin to travel to Florida, which would stimulate the state’s economiy.


When all is said and done, it comes down to the basic right to live freely in one’s adulthood — and it seems that gambling is one of the few age-restricted privileges that is a no-brainer.

2009-04-09,USF,study,"A bill in Florida Senate proposes to lower the gambling age from 21 to 18, but a USF study shows youths are at the greatest risk for developing gambling problems.


While 18-year-olds can play the lottery and poker or bet on horse and greyhound races, they can’t play slots, blackjack or other Las Vegas-style games. This was one of the reasons behind the bill.


“We wanted it to be uniform all the way across,” said Sen. Dennis Jones (R-Seminole), according to an article in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. “We felt that 18 was a good age.”


Natalie Mullett, deputy director for the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling, said that if this bill passes, the state will put the most addictive methods of gambling within reach of the group at the greatest risk of  becoming addicted.


Those aged 12-18 are at the highest risk for developing a pathological gambling problem — four times more likely than the rest of the population, Mullett said.


She also said slot and lottery machines are known to be the most rapidly addictive among any population.


The study, “Gambling and Problem Gambling Prevalence Among College Students in Florida,” estimates that 50,000 Florida college students have symptoms of pathological gambling, and that 10,975 of those are problem gamblers and 10,065 are pathological gamblers.


H. Roy Kaplan, an associate professor at USF who worked on the study, said he does see the why 18-year-olds are granted the right to gamble in the lotto and races.


“Casino gambling is fast-paced and has certain kinds of characteristics that are not found in other forms of gambling,” he said. “When you play cards, shoot craps, when you have roulette, these are all very quick pace, quick pay-off, and that is the type of activity that can cause problems for people because of the psychological impact that type of gambling has.”


Gamblers betting at the dog track have to wait 25 minutes between races, Kaplan said, while the casino is instantaneous.


“In adolescence, and that goes right through the 20s, the brain isn’t fully developed,” he said. “That’s why (adolescents) are more impulsive in some behaviors — they are more reckless in the way they drive and some other activates they engage in.”


According to the study, dropping out of school, poor academic performance, criminal
behavior, disrupted relationships, and social and interpersonal problems often accompany gambling problems.


Mullet listed the signs that may indicate a gambling problem.


Compulsive gamblers often spend money they don’t have and may even max out multiple credit cards, she said.


People with a gambling problem often lie about what they are doing with their money, or brag about their winnings while neglecting to mention bigger losses, Mullett said.


“College students with a gambling problem may skip class and stay home to play Internet gambling games,” she said. “They also may lose academic scholarships.”


If the state makes it easier for younger people to gamble, then it has a responsibility to educate them about the risks of gambling and treatment facilities for compulsive gamblers, Kaplan said.


“The larger question is, is this the way to fund the state government?” Kaplan said. “The government and its leaders have to become far more responsible leaders and need to find alternative sources of funding.”


The bill will not be addressed by the Senate until after this week because legislators are off for the Passover and Easter holidays.

2009-04-12,USF,study,"USF’s redshirt freshman quarterbacks gave Raymond James Stadium a brief, bright look into the Bulls’ football future Saturday night.


Both backups for senior quarterback Matt Grothe, B.J. Daniels and Evan Landi, used quick starts to propel impressive performances before a crowd of about 5,000, with Daniels gaining the last laugh and leading the Green team to a 21-20 victory in the
spring game.


It was Landi, however, who nearly stole the show.


Trailing 21-14 and pushed back to its 12-yard line with 2:13 remaining in the fourth quarter, the White offense was led by Landi to the Green’s six-yard line with 10 seconds remaining. As time expired, the redshirt freshman dropped back to pass and found a diving Colby Erskin, who made the catch to cut the lead to 21-20.


The White team went for the two-point conversion, but Landi’s pass attempt to Theo Wilson in the corner of the end zone was slightly overthrown, and the Green team rushed the field to celebrate the victory.


“That was an exciting game, as an exciting game in the spring you may ever see,” said coach Jim Leavitt. “You go across the country, and I don’t know if there will be one more exciting than that.”


Daniels finished 11-for-19 with 181 yards passing, adding to his three-touchdown performance. Landi impressed with a 20-for-30 and 189-yard showing, throwing
two touchdowns. Grothe played only in the first quarter and threw for 26 yards.


“We thought initially that we’d play Matt (Grothe) up until the half, but we got him in for a quarter or a series just to get him in there … Our biggest agenda was to go out there and see what the young guys could do,” said offensive coordinator Mike Canales. “Both B.J. (Daniels) and Evan Landi showed really good things for freshman quarterbacks.”


Daniels got out to an impressive start, connecting with junior receiver Dontavia Bogan for a 56-yard strike on the second play of the game. It was a sign of things to come.


Daniels hooked up with Bogan twice more, including a 46-yard game-winning touchdown in the third quarter. Bogan finished with 105 yards receiving.


“We were playing OK out there on the run,” Bogan said. “It was a lot of fun. B.J. and
I were able to connect a few times on some big plays.”


Daniels made big plays with his feet, too. The 6-foot-1, 217-pound Tallahassee native used his speed and agility to scramble all over the field, creating problems for the White team’s defensive line. He finished with 33 yards rushing and one touchdown on the ground.


“I’m always open to try and get out of trouble and make things happen when there’s nothing (open) on offense … I was comfortable out there,” Daniels said.


The biggest defensive play of the game came off Daniels’ arm as well.


With the Green team at the White’s five-yard line, sophomore cornerback Quenton Washington intercepted Daniels’ pass for an interception. Washington eluded a couple of tackles and danced across the goal line for a 95-yard touchdown return to tie the game at 14-14 in the second quarter.


“Wow, ‘Q’ (Washington), what a great play he made. We may have to move him to running back or receiver, because what he did with the ball was really special,” Leavitt said.


USF’s defensive line put together six sacks, forcing constant pressure on the freshman quarterbacks. Senior Aaron Harris led the Green team with three sacks.


Defensive coordinator Joe Tresey said he was impressed with the line’s performance despite the absence of All-American defensive end George Selvie, who sat out as a precaution against injury.


“We were getting good pressure and we only had about five guys or so. Those guys really played an entire football game,” Tresey said. “Usually, we try to run our two deep (substitutes), but we were short, so I was really proud of them and how they played.”


The Bulls have two remaining practices Tuesday and Wednesday to finish up
spring ball.

2009-04-13,USF,study,"University Police (UP) officers went door to door evacuating residents in the Holly C apartment building on campus because of a bomb threat called in Sunday night.


UP spokeswoman Lt. Meg Ross said a call was placed at 6:30 p.m. notifying UP of the threat. The caller said a note was found on a door stating that a bomb would go off in the building at 10:50 p.m.


UP searched the building’s common areas and found nothing, Ross said.


Melissa Walford, a sophomore marine biology major, said she had just returned to Holly C when she saw another resident on the phone.


“A cop car pulled up and I was like, something doesn’t seem right,” she said. “I just went back up to my room and didn’t think anything of it until the (officer) pounded on our door.”


Students said officers knocked on every door instead of sounding the fire alarm because they didn’t want people going down stairwells.


Melissa Cannatella, a sophomore majoring in history, said UP officers told students, “Just put on some shoes, let’s go.”


“They had to go door to door to get everyone out. They said it’s probably going to be a while because they still have to get the bomb squad in every room,” said Jenni Budai, a sophomore majoring in criminology.


Budai said the officers sent Holly C residents across the street. Students were told not to use cell phones near the building because they could be detonators.


Nicholas Flammia, a freshman majoring in mass communications, said he was concerned for his safety and surprised that UP sent out no MoBull alerts for the bomb threat after sending them for a chemical scare last fall.


“You would think, if for anything, this would definitely be the situation where they would send one out,” Flammia said.


Resident assistants urged students to go to Holly J, a recreation room, while waiting for the building to open again.


Students played games, watched TV and studied under RAs’ supervision in the waiting room. Pizza arrived around 9 p.m. for the 25 students who decided to wait out the threat.


Joe Frezza, a junior majoring in anthropology, said it was inconvenient because he wasn’t able to get his computer from his room and had planned to finish a take-home test online.


“I kind of wish they could have told us we would be out here for this long,” Walford said.


Residents were not allowed to re-entry until 11:20 p.m., at which time UP officers blocked off Holly Drive with a police car and told residents they could cross the street and re-enter the building.

2009-04-14,USF,study,"Will Bleakley’s death is still being felt, and it’s prompted some of his closest friends to honor him by hosting a baseball tournament in his name.


The St. Petersburg Storm baseball team, which Bleakley was a part of before his death, will host the Will Bleakley Memorial Baseball Tournament from April 29 to May 3 at multiple venues in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, aiming to raise money for a USF scholarship in his name.


“This has really become my full time job and I am honored to be able to do it,” said Anthony Turchetti, team manager and tournament director.


The tournament will feature 12 teams from all over the state, competing for a chance to play in the championship game at Bright House Networks Field. Ticket sales, team fees, concessions and auctions will help fund the tournament — and a $5,000 USF scholarship in Bleakley’s honor.


Other venues of the tournament will include Frank Tack Field and Joe DiMaggio Complex.


On March 1, Bleakley and three friends — NFL players Marquis Cooper and Corey Smith and former USF football player Nick Schuyler — went missing in the Gulf of Mexico when their boat overturned. The Coast Guard searched more than 20,000 miles of the Gulf’s waters but found only Schuyler clinging to an overturned 21-foot boat.


“I was on deck at our game the day we found out,” said Turchetti, who was also a friend of Bleakley’s. “It wasn’t like him to miss a game. I was shocked, but in my mind I thought they would find them.”


Tampa Bay-area businesses, as well as the University, are sponsoring the tournament and scholarship.


The scholarship is intended for one or more high school graduates who exemplify the courage, kindness and commitment Will showed, according to the offical Web site.


Bleakley led the Clearwater League last season in batting average, home runs and saves, helping the Storm win the league championship. In high school, he helped Crystal River High School make the state final four in baseball at Legends Field in 2002.


“Will was quiet in the dugout but had a powerful personality and a strong presence on our team,” Turchetti said. “We spent a lot of hours together playing twice a week for the past year.”


Every team that enters will get three games guaranteed, with the top four progressing to the semifinals. Team entry fees are $250.

2009-04-15,USF,study,"After not being alerted by MoBull of a bomb threat in a residence hall, some students are wondering about the use and reasons behind the MoBull service, while University officials feel the system still works well.


The MoBull service, launched in 2002, is used to alert students, faculty and staff of
emergencies through text messages and e-mail. Bruce Benson, assistant vice president of Public Safety, said 45,000 people are signed up with the service.


Its most recent use was Tuesday, when MoBull sent out a severe weather warning for all campuses at 8:39 a.m. At 8:58 a.m., it reported that there was a tornado warning for North Hillsborough County until 9 a.m.


However, after a bomb threat in Holly C on Sunday, some students, such as Smita Kothari, a senior majoring in economics and marketing, said they wondered how the administration decides when to use MoBull.


If a text message was withheld to prevent panic, Kothari said, then that needs to be expressed.


For a crime, Public Safety decides whether the situation requires the use of MoBull after being contacted by University Police.


Benson said each of the decisions is a judgment call.


“We use that phrase ‘a timely warning,'” he said. “If there is something we need to warn people about, if there is something they need to do to take action — like to seek shelter if tornadoes are coming — if there is value in giving that timely warning for people’s safety, then as soon as we can package together something meaningful, we are going to send it out.”


After the decision is made, Public Safety contacts Media Relations, which posts the information on the USF Web site and sends the MoBull text messages to those signed up for the service. The information is also displayed on on the digital screens in the Marshall Student Center, among other places on campus.


The reason MoBull was not used for the bomb threat, Benson said, is because the situation was “contained.”


On Sunday soon after the call, a police supervisor then met with Housing officials and Resident Assistants and determination of what they needed to do, Benson said.


“They pretty quickly evacuated the building and they had other officers there,” he said.


The building was blocked off and officers didn’t let anyone in that area.


“If that was in the broad daylight in a classroom building during the week, we might put a MoBull message out for students to know if they were heading to their classroom that that building was secure and they are not to go to their classroom,” Benson said. “In this case, there was no value to the community in alerting people because we were fully in charge of that scene and contained.”


Benson gave the same reason for not informing students of the gas leak in the Crescent Hill parking garage Saturday night. Tampa Fire Rescue shut off the gas and stopped the leak. Later, TECO Peoples Gas fixed the problem.


However, some students said they wanted more information.


“I would have preferred to hear the news (of the bomb threat) from an e-mail,” said Emily Johnson, a senior majoring in international business. “Then we wouldn’t hear it from other places.”


Another problem one student faced was finding out how sign up with the program. Elliot Dickson said he had heard of MoBull, but didn’t know the details.


“I honestly don’t know how to sign up,” he said.


Benson said he still thinks MoBull works well.


“We are hoping to get a software interface system in the future, where we would still send MoBull out separately,” he said.


The software package would allow the University to send messages through MoBull, signs and the Web site at once, but would still allow only text messages to be sent.


“If we get that system, which we are working on now, that would speed up that process,” Benson said. “I think the system we have works very well — it’s a good system.”

2009-04-16,USF,study,"Seventeen vacant seats in the Student Government Senate prompted the Election Rules Committee to call for a special election in hopes of filling as many of its 60 total seats as possible.


If student body president-elect Juan Soltero chooses to appoint any Senate members to his cabinet, there will be even more vacant seats, said Supervisor of Elections Michael van Hoek.


The College of Nursing and the College of Public Health have no seats filled. The colleges have three seats and one seat open, respectively.


Several other colleges also have vacant seats: the College of the Arts has one available, the College of Education has four, the College of Engineering has one and the College of Business has the most with seven.


The special election will give students who were unfamiliar with the application process another opportunity to run for a Senate seat, said van Hoek, as well as some students who tried to run in the first election.


“A couple students wanted to run but had been disqualified by the Election Rules Committee,” van Hoek said.


The special election will allow one student who was disqualified in the initial election to run again. The student petitioned the disqualification, and the court ruled in the student’s favor.


“I can’t think of a greater gift to give to the incoming administration than to give them a senate that’s as full as possible,” van Hoek said.


Van Hoek said he decided to hold the election before the end of the semester because the supervisor of elections is in office only during certain dates, and the next possible election would be the midterm election in December.


Applications for Senate seats are due by 5 p.m. Monday, van Hoek said. When students turn in applications, they will be given statutes and rules. The same rules governing campaigning and budgeting apply as during the regular election, he said.


Students with declared majors will be able to run and vote only in their designated college, if seats are available, while undeclared majors can choose one college for which to vote.


Voting will run from 9 a.m. April 29 to 7 p.m. April 30. Students both on and off campus will have access to voting through Blackboard, but there will not be polling stations set up as in the regular election.


Results will be announced April 30 at 7:30 p.m.

2009-04-19,USF,study,"Physical Plant is reducing the USF Tampa campus’s water usage in response to restrictions declared by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) because of an area drought.


Before the Phase IV or “critical water shortage” restrictions which went into effect April 3, Physical Plant used approximately 1.6 million gallons of water a week for irrigation purposes, said Physical Plant Director Adrian Cuarta.


But by reducing watering duration times, installing low-volume units and not watering certain areas of the Tampa campus, Physical Plant expects to use about 30 percent to 40 percent less water, Cuarta said.


Physical Plant uses water from wells and the city of Tampa to irrigate the lawns and landscaping on the Tampa campus, which is divided into seven watering zones.


Zones that use water from the city, specifically the landscaped area around the Health Sciences Center, will be watered only by hand, Cuarta said.


He said the remaining zones will be watered with sprinklers once a week from midnight to 4:00 a.m. or from 8:00 p.m. to midnight, in accordance with SFWMD restrictions.


The athletic fields will continue to be watered at a reduced rate for safety purposes, said Trudie Frecker, associate vice president of Administrative Services.


Cuarta said the decorative fountains in the Administration Building courtyard and Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza have been turned off.


However, the fountains in the retention ponds south of Castor Hall and north of the new residence hall will remain on to prevent the growth of algae and scum, Cuarta said.


One watering problem is sprinkler heads that pour water onto nearby sidewalks, roads and grass.


Frecker said Physical Plant personnel constantly monitor the irrigation system, but sprinkler heads frequently get knocked out of balance.


“Something as simple as being stepped on or knocked by a cart can impact the flow and direction,” Frecker said.


The malfunctioning sprinkler heads are generally fixed as soon as they are identified, she said.


With the new watering restrictions, Cuarta said the Tampa campus will see “damage and loss of plant material, with a diminished appearance of the campus landscaping.”


The SFWMD Phase IV water restrictions, voted on by the district governing board, are scheduled to expire June 30. The restrictions apply to all water uses in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties.

2009-04-20,USF,study,"Eating healthy can prove difficult for busy college students on the go. The USF Tampa campus is crowded with tempting dining options that may not fit the regulations of the food pyramid. Even the surrounding area is crowded with sinful fast food restaurants that tempt passersby with delicious value meals.


These drive-thru restaurants make healthy eating difficult, as most don’t make their nutrition information readily available to diners. Instead, many establishments direct patrons to their Web site — a convenience only for those who want to Google the restaurant on their iPhone while waiting in line.


If fast food is your only dining option, here are some healthier menu options to choose from.


McDonald’s
Menu items with less than 200 calories and 9 grams of fat include the Premium Southwest Salad, Premium Bacon Ranch Salad and Premium Caesar Salad — all without chicken.


Add chicken to boost your protein intake, but be wary of dressings and condiments that quickly pack on calories and sugar.


All meals can substitute apple slices for french fries and water instead of sugar-filled soft drinks.


Chick-fil-A
Chick-fil-A offers low-carb meals that serve any Chargrilled Chicken Club or Classic Chicken Sandwich “protein style,” with two tomato slices, a strip of bacon and provolone cheese wrapped in a lettuce leaf.


Other smart choices include the Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich, Chargrilled Chicken Garden Salad or the Chargrilled and Fruit Salad, all of which have less than 270 calories and 6 grams of fat.


Avoid the waffle fries and opt for a fruit cup or carrot and raisin salad instead.


Taco Bell
Taco Bell’s healthier Fresco Menu features 8 menu items with less than 9 grams of fat ranging from 150 to 330 calories. Items include crunchy and soft tacos with chicken or steak, chicken or steak Fresco Burritos and the Fresco Bean Burrito.


The key here is portion control, since it’s easy to order many of these items in quantity.


Moe’s
Moe’s has a few menu options that will help you make better nutritional choices. Opt for a crispy corn taco shell rather than the soft flour tortilla to reduce calories, sodium, carbohydrates and sugar.


For a good low-carb option, order your meal item “streaker style” without the tortilla or shell. Avoiding the rice and beans will also reduce the carb count. For lower fat content, skip the sour cream, cheese and dressings.


Avoid fajitas, nachos and salads, as they all have more than 800 calories and 40-90 grams of fat. As difficult as it may be, say no to the chips and queso.


KFC
This restaurant chain offers a Roasted Chicken Caesar Salad (hold the dressing) at 350 calories. Other healthy choices include the Tender Roast Sandwich with a side salad or a skinless Original Recipe chicken breast and side of mashed potatoes with no gravy.


The best choices for sides include green beans, corn on the cob or three-bean salad.


Burger King
Burger King is the least healthy fast food option. Its Web site promotes a “fat conscious” menu that boasts items with as much as 20 grams of fat.


If Burger King is a must, order a sandwich without the bun. Low-carb Whopper Juniors, BK Veggie Burgers and Tendergrill Chicken Sandwiches all have less than 200 calories and 10 grams of carbohydrates.

Before their showdown for first place in the Big East with West Virginia this weekend, the Bulls will step out of conference today at Florida at 6:30 p.m., for a game that means a whole lot more than state bragging rights.


“(Wednesday) is a pretty big deal for us even though it’s not in the Big East picture,” said USF center fielder Ryan Lockwood. “It’s important for us to win these games. We haven’t done a good job with (the midweek non-conference games) lately. It’s an opportunity to get a win against a quality opponent.”


The Bulls have lost their last three non-conference games, including a doubleheader at the hands of FIU on Wednesday.


Despite their recent non-conference pitfalls, USF coach Lelo Prado said it comes down to a simple approach.


“We have to keep playing hard,” Prado said. “We didn’t do that last week (against FIU) and got beat twice. We played the game the right way this weekend and really had a chance to sweep.”


Junior Teddy Kaufman is expected to start tonight for USF.  Kaufman pitched well in his start Wednesday, giving up only one run in 5 2/3 innings while striking out five. Kaufman didn’t make it out of the second inning in a non-conference loss to Jacksonville on April 7.


“Good stuff or not, I have to put us in a position to win,” Kaufman said.


The Bulls (24-14, 12-3) have sole possession of first place for the first time in the Big East conference. USF joined the league in 2006.


USF is ranked No. 29 by the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper, its first national ranking since Feb. 26, 2007, when the Bulls were ranked No. 30 by the same poll.


USF and West Virginia shared the top spot in the Big East for two weeks before last
weekend, when the Mountaineers lost two games to Notre Dame.


Prado said it’s a nice position to be in, but complacency is something the team can’t afford right now.


“We have exams and a lot going on this week, so we must remain focused,” Prado said. “We have four more Big East series’ left, so we have to continue playing the way we’ve been playing.”

Playstation 2: Katamari Damacy and We Love Katamari


The concept of rolling a colorful ball around various scenes to pick up things including sumo wrestlers, cows and skyscrapers as they defy physics by gravitating to it may not seem like a brilliant idea, but that’s exactly what happens in the Katamari games — and it’s addictive.


There is no serious plot behind the game, but the single-player campaign tells an entertaining story, illustrated with intentionally cartoonish animation.


The main character is called “the prince” and, following instructions from his royal, flamboyant, rainbow-loving father, he spends his entire life rolling up completely random stuff with his brightly colored katamari (Japanese for “star”).


This is the entire point of both Katamari Damacy and its sequel, two of the most original and entertaining games on the market, certain to suck up plenty of hours of summer boredom.

Playstation 3: Valkyria Chronicles


A rare PS3 exclusive, Valkyria Chronicles was released by SEGA in late 2008 but never got the promotion it deserved. With a lengthy war-packed story line, this game is a perfect choice for summer play.


Though classified as a tactical RPG, the game features a unique battle system, which plays like a mix between a classic RPG and a first-person shooter. It has a turn-based combat system, but the screen focuses in on a selected individual during his or her turn, giving the player direct control over the unit’s aim.


The game’s visuals are stylized, to say the least, and the story plays out like a painting in motion. The artistic merit is in nice contrast to the game’s somewhat dark story line.


The game sold well in Japan and was praised by critics. It is worth a handful of useless summer hours to experience the beauty in both the game’s art direction and its play.

Burnout Paradise is the fifth in a series of games whose whole point is to crash into other cars to create the biggest possible wreck of twisted metal and fire. The difference between this game and all the others, however, is that its races and crash mode can be started at any point during the game. This is not a game for people who like to color — or drive their cars — inside the lines.


Burnout Paradise introduced a free-roaming world to the series. During a race, players can drive any route of their choice to arrive at their destination.


After a crash, players are able to keep driving and causing mayhem — as long as they can keep all four of their tires. Players can even use motorcycles after downloading the bike pack.


With an insane amount of downloadable content, including a cops and robbers pack being released April 30, and events based around online multiplayer, Burnout Paradise is sure to impress itself on players and keep them entertained all summer.


-Runner-up: Eternal Sonata


Wii: Elebits


The Wii has no lack of mindless, time-consuming party games, but most are popular remakes of classic games such as Super Smash Brothers or Mario Kart. Elebits brought some much-needed originality to the system, which won it both Best Action Game and Most Innovative Design for the Wii from IGN in 2006.


Players might be reminded of Pikimin, as the games have many similar elements, but Elebits adds a more beautiful design and the use of a Wii remote. Instead of a miniature man in a space suit, the main character is a little boy named Kai, who is left alone by his parents to fix an unexplained power outage.


Kai is not a fan of the Elebits and uses his parents’ “capture gun” — which the player controls with the Wiimote — to capture hiding Elebits and steal their electricity. Levels are completed when enough watts have been collected, and the game progresses by moving from rooms in the house to areas in the city.


Elebits is able to register players’ specific movements of the Wiimote, unlike most Wii games, in which players can complete events simply by wildly waving their arms around. The nunchuk is used to move, duck and stretch, while the remote is used to open drawers and doors and smash items against the wall.


The game is worth a few hours just for the fun of it, but its novelty and charm will keep players coming back for more electric fun.


-Runner-up: Dewy’s Adventure


PSP: Patapon


Patapon was released by Sony and solely for Sony, and created by Pyramid and Japan Studio. Japan Studio’s earlier releases, like Siren, were never big hits, and never very good. But Sony hit the jackpot with Patapon, a rhythm based tactical strategy game that names the player god.


The player is given the responsibility of commanding the army of patapons, a creature that looks like a big eyeball, through various war chants and beats. The game was rated at 9.2 by IGN who called it “one of the best rhythm games ever released.”


Though the concept is simple, the levels are not always easy. Players are given opportunities to build up their army and create new types of warriors through musically based rituals.


For continued fun all through the summer, Patapon 2 will be released on May 5.


-Runner-up: N+


DS: Linerider


What started out as a flash game created on DeviantArt became an online sensation, spawning YouTube videos and McDonald’s commercials. Few people are aware however, that this game was made available on the DS.


The concept of the game, drawing lines for a little boy on a sled to travel on, is perfect for the DS’ stylus and screen set up. Since the levels are literally created by the player, the number of possibilities are endless, making it the perfect portable game that can be enjoyed the whole summer and played anywhere, no headphones required.


-Runner-up: Professor Layton and the Curious Village


PC: Psychonauts


Psychonauts was created for consoles but back in 2005, but is now available through Steam for PC gamers. The game is highly underrated among gamers, despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and predicted sales.


One speculation is that the screenshots from the game turned potential players away. To be sure, the graphics of Psychonauts cannot hold a candle to the games on today’s systems—but the game is worth so much outside of its outdated images.


The story is set at a summer camp that is really a government training facility for psychonauts, or soldiers who fight with their extraordinary mind abilities. The main character, Raz, escapes his circus life to join them only to find that the kids and the camp are having their brains stolen.


The story is original; the graphics, though outdated, are colorful and fun and the gameplay works like most adventure games, but features special psychic power abilities like pyrokinesis.


What really gives Psychonauts its charms, however, is the dialogue and direction. The game is funny. The interactions between the characters have several laugh out loud moments. Players will learn to love the characters and that is what makes this game genuinely fun to play all summer long.

2009-04-23,USF,study,"For more than a decade, lack of support has prevented construction of a light rail system in Tampa. However, the Tampa Rail Project (TRP) may have found an opportunity to receive funds and has gained additional attention from USF students.


Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio met with the Hillsborough County Transportation Task Force on April 1 to discuss a one-cent sales tax referendum to fund the TRP. For the first time, the county commission voted to begin writing a ballot for November 2010 that would include a referendum about the TRP.


“It was a very exciting meeting that ultimately led to Hillsborough County coming closer than ever to putting a mass transit referendum on the ballot,” said Elaine McCloud, transit manager for the city of Tampa.


The first leg of the TRP would stretch 13.3 miles and is expected to cost up to $70 million per mile, McCloud said. It would connect the USF area and downtown Tampa and, later, include Tampa International Airport.


USF President Judy Genshaft said recent plans project part of the rail to be on Fowler Avenue with stops at the Botanical Gardens, USF Health and the James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital. Feeder buses including the Bull Runner will transport students and faculty to and from those sites.


“I’m so convinced it is such a plus for this region to have rail,” Genshaft said. “When I was in San Diego visiting the University of California, the light rail went right to the student union. It was so great because then it’s a central place for students to move in terms of transportation, and it cuts down on the need for cars around the campus.”


McCloud said there would be a fee to ride the rail similar to the area’s bus fares. Hillsborough Area Regional Transit charges a $1.75 one-way cash fare for the local street bus and a $2.75 one-way fare for the Express buses.


“The (TRP) fee will not be enough to cover operation costs,” McCloud said. “It will only cover somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 percent of the operating costs.”


The Federal Transit Administration will supply funds, but the city must generate local funding in order to receive federal funding. In 2002, the TRP failed to receive federal funding because the city lacked a local funding source.


The one-cent sales tax will help fund additional legs of the rail project and other mass transit plans, including doubling the bus systems, as well as non-transit plans.


Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization’s Executive Director Ray Chiaramonte said 75 percent of the tax revenue has to be used for transit-related projects, but 25 percent can be put to other use. He also said the proposed one-cent sales tax could increase or decrease.


“We would figure out what systems we could accomplish with the penny or what we could accomplish with half a penny,” Chiaramonte said.


McCloud said she spoke to professor Elizabeth Strom’s Geology Regional Planning class April 1 about the benefits of mass transit for Tampa.


“I talked to them about how they experience parking problems first-hand and the traffic congestion right there on campus and Fowler Avenue,” McCloud said. “We talked about some of the challenges in terms of Howard Franklin Bridge and the number of people who cross that bridge every day.”


Strom’s students presented group research projects related to mass transit planning Thursday.


“My goal wasn’t to make them advocates of (the rail project) — although many of them probably are — but rather have them look at all sides of the issue and how they come out feeling about it,” Strom said.


Junior Aiden Reidy and senior Lyndsey Scofield, environmental science and policy majors, presented a project on how Tampa can learn from both national and local groups that generate support for their cities’ mass transit projects.


“I think it is an excellent idea. I think it has a lot of potential to do plenty of things,” Reidy said. “For USF in particular, it could unite not only Tampa campus with other (USF) campuses but with other colleges and universities in the area as well.”


Reidy said he believes the recent support for the TRP is because of increased knowledge of environmental and population issues.


“I think this particular area has just been stagnant due to people stuck in their old ways,” he said.


Scofield said she is used to public transportation — especially light rail — from growing up in the Northeast, and would like to see a rail system in the Tampa area.


“I think it’s a great option, because it transports a lot of people at once,” she said. “It reduces the load of cars coming. At USF, that’s clearly an issue — with so many people circling the parking lots for parking and the continuous building of parking garages and how long it takes just to get out of this area with Bruce B. Downs and Fletcher being so congested.”


McCloud said USF is a key component of the mass transit and light rail network.


“(The students and I) agree that we’re at a critical juncture in our mass transit and regional efforts,” McCloud said. “We ended (the class) by saying it’s going to take all of us to make mass transit that includes light rail a reality. It really comes down to one question — if not rail now, when? We have been trying to get light rail for the last
20 years, and we can’t wait another 20 years.”

2009-05-10,USF,study,"After winning its first Big East championship this April, the USF men’s tennis team drew No. 19 Auburn — a team that defeated the Bulls in February — in the first round of the NCAA tournament Sunday.


That defeat reflected this meeting, which saw the Tigers drop USF 4-0 at the Scott Speicher Tennis Center in Tallahassee.


“(The match) was basically a repeat of when we played them earlier in the season,” said Bulls coach Don Barr. “It was close, but we just couldn’t get the job done.”


In all but one loss this season, the Bulls dropped the doubles point. They lost it again on Saturday.


Playing in the No. 1 doubles position, USF’s Lucas Jovita and Thomas Estrada lost 8-1 to the No. 10 ranked doubles tandem in the nation, Alexey Tsyrenov and Tim Puetz.


USF’s Wael Kilani and Yannick Yoshizawa were leading 6-5 in the No. 3 doubles slot when Auburn’s Lucas Marsoun and Alex Stamchev defeated Mahmoud Hamed and Jamal Adderley 8-6, clinching the point for the Tigers.


“The match came down to the doubles point — which is just so important,” Barr said. “If Hamed and Adderley forced a tiebreaker, I think they would have won the match and we would have taken the point and momentum heading into singles play.”


Auburn needed to win just three of the six singles matches to eliminate the Bulls. The Tigers got victories from their No. 3, 4 and 6 positions, putting an end to USF’s 2009 season.


Despite the early exit from the tournament, Barr said he was proud of his team for all of their accomplishments this season.


“It was a really great season,” he said. “Injuries hurt us earlier on but our new players filled in nicely. Overall, I thought our guys did a really good job.”


The Bulls will return all of their players next season except for Mahmoud Hamed, who just graduated.


“I was glad to see some of our younger guys step in and play well,” Barr said. “It shows that we have a bright future ahead.”


The Bulls (14-9) had impressive victories over then-No. 11 Florida State on Jan. 19 and
in-state rival Miami on March 13. And USF won its first Big East championship by defeating DePaul on April 19 at the USF Varsity Tennis Courts.


“With a young team it takes a while to learn the system and achieve team camaraderie,” Barr said. “Our new guys gained a lot of experience and I know they will come back strong next year. I’m already looking forward to next season.”

2009-05-11,USF,study,"Incidents at other universities, like the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, prompted the installation of an Emergency Notification System (ENS).


On April 30, USF contracted the service through Federal Signal, a leading corporation in advancing security technology. Testing of the ENS began on May 4 and continued throughout the week.


The ENS consists of eight emergency warning stations that will be manned 24/7 by UP. One station is located on each of the four parking garages. The other four are located on poles throughout campus.


Tom Cisco, safety and compliance manager of public safety, said plans to install the system began in January 2008 after a gunman killed a total of 32 students, faculty members, and himself at Virginia Tech in April 2007.


“The department intends for the emergency warning stations to be a combined effort to inform students on dangerous campus happenings,” Cisco said.


He said USF looked at surveys from other universities that showed the ENS was an effective device for informing people of emergencies quickly.


“The emergency signals are intended to get a very quick broadcast that reaches the masses and used in assistance with other campus safety (information measures),” Cisco said.


Each emergency warning station includes a siren, loudspeaker and a clear strobe light. When there is an emergency on campus, UP can trigger the start of the siren from its main office.


A siren blast will occur for 15 seconds on a medium sound level, then a short voice message will come across the loudspeaker, followed by another siren blast at a higher volume.


Eleven emergency situations would prompt the sirens to sound: chemical spill, fire, bomb threat, armed intruder, active shooter, power outage, tornado, natural gas leak, chemical release (vapor), lightning and a Westminster Chime all-clear signal, which announces that safety precautions no longer need to be taken.


Once the emergency stations are activated, students are encouraged to check their phones for MoBull text messages, check their student e-mail, log on to the University’s home page or watch a campus television for more information regarding the situation.


“The Emergency Notification Systems could serve to be a great informer for me because many times I forget my phone at home or I am not around a computer,” said Clark Quackenbush, a senior majoring in environmental policy.


Vanessa Reynolds, a junior majoring in elementary education, said she feels safe on campus, but “any addition to help protect me is a great idea.”


Both Quackenbush and Reynolds are enrolled in the MoBull emergency text-message alert system.


A public demonstration and a public awareness campaign hosted by USF President Judy Genshaft is scheduled in early fall to officially introduce the emergency warning stations.

2009-05-13,USF,study,"The USF baseball team needs just one win in a three-game series at Louisville this weekend to clinch its first Big East regular season championship in school history.


However, the Bulls want more than one victory over the Cardinals in the series, which starts Thursday at 6 p.m.


USF holds a 18-6 conference record and a 2.5 game lead over Louisville, which carries a 16-7 record into this weekend. With a three-game sweep of the Bulls, the Cardinals could take the top-seed in next week’s Big East tournament.


“You can’t go into a three game series with a mindset of just winning one game,” said centerfielder Ryan Lockwood, who had three hits in five at bats in USF’s 11-6 victory over North Florida on Tuesday night. “That’s the wrong attitude and we’ll lose all three if we take it.”


Sophomore Derrick Stultz is expected to start Thursday for the Bulls, followed by Shawn Sanford on Friday.


No. 1 starter Randy Fontanez isn’t expected to pitch this weekend, but will start the first game of the Big East tournament Tuesday.


Louisville (37-14, 16-7) is ranked No. 23 by Baseball America. USF is receiving votes in the latest USA Today Poll.


“Rankings are rankings, numbers are numbers. It doesn’t affect us at all,” said freshman Sam Mende, who also had three hits Tuesday.


The series could also have implications for USF’s hopes of making it to regionals. USF is projected to be a No. 4 seed by College Baseball.


“We’re not going up there to win one game, we have to win at least two for regional purposes,” said USF coach Lelo Prado after Tuesday’s doubleheader.

2009-05-14,USF,study,"In what began as a dream 12 years ago, Marcelo da Luz stopped by USF on Tuesday to showcase his eco-friendly car that runs on sunlight energy and has never been plugged in.


The presentation was hosted by USF’s SMART (Students for the Marketing and Advancement of Renewable Technology) Club. The car was shown at the USF Research Park.


Da Luz was inspired to make a positive impact by a news broadcast about being environmentally friendly.


“A light went off, but I thought I wouldn’t be able to do it,” he said.


Da Luz carried his dream through college in Brazil, where he received a degree in marketing, then in 2001 he left his 10-year flight attendant career with Air Canada.


He said he spent more than half a million dollars building the car by spending all his savings, taking out house mortgages and loans and using credit cards.


After two years of research and three and a half years of requesting permits from the government, he spent almost three years building the car.


“The most difficult thing was believing I could do it,” he said.


The top of the car detaches from the bottom so da Luz can lie down before he closes the hatch-like top. Mirrors on the car were avoided to reduce drag, so da Luz wears glasses with cameras on the sides that allow him to see behind and along the sides of the car.


On June 12, 2008, he started driving around the Great Lakes and reached the Arctic Circle 46 days later. He set a new world record of 15,000 miles — the longest distance a solar-powered car has traveled.


His car also became the first to reach the Arctic Circle and operate below freezing temperatures.


While da Luz wants to promote clear air, he also carries a message hoping to inspire others.


“You learn, you try, you also make mistakes along the way,” he said. “I’m not special, I don’t have special talents. If I can do this then anybody can.”

2009-05-17,USF,study,"With a Big East championship and an NCAA Elite Eight appearance behind it, the USF men’s soccer team unveiled its 2009 schedule Thursday with high expectations to make its third consecutive postseason appearance.


The Bulls, seeking their 14th berth in the NCAA tournament, will face five opponents from last year’s tournament in their schedule: St. John’s, Louisville, Notre Dame, Dartmouth and Akron (exhibition).


“My goal is always to schedule top teams from around the country,” said USF coach George Kiefer. “We were able to do that once again this year.”


The Big East got five teams in the NCAA tournament last season and Kiefer said the conference will be just as tough in the fall.


“Competing in the Big East automatically gives us one of the better schedules in the country, but we work really hard to get a strong schedule from the six games outside of the conference,” he said.


USF will begin the Big East conference portion of the schedule at home against Marquette on Sept. 18 and Notre Dame on Sept. 20. The Fighting Irish advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament in 2008.


The Bulls will host their first exhibition against the University of Tampa on Aug. 18, the fourth consecutive season the programs have met for the Rowdies Cup.


“We are really excited to play Tampa because it’s not only a great game for our team, but for the community as well,” Kiefer said.


The Spartans turned in an impressive 18-4-1 record last season and advanced to the NCAA Division II Final Four for the first time since 2001.


“Head coach Adrian Bush over at Tampa has done a great job with their team and we are really excited for the matchup to open up the season,” Kiefer said.


The Bulls will then head to Lee Jackson Field on Aug. 21 for the first time since edging out the Zips in a 1-0 overtime decision in the postseason of 2007.


“We like to get a lot of questions answered in the pre-season,” Kiefer said. “I think we will be able to do this playing Akron on their field.”


One of the questions facing the Bulls is who will fill the gaps left by five starters not returning in 2009, including forward Jordan Seabrook, who was drafted by the Colorado Rapids in Major League Soccer, and Yohance Marshall, who plays for the Los Angeles Galaxy.


“We have five guys leaving us that have started with us for the last four years, so there are a lot of guys competing for spots as we head into the season.”
Kiefer said.

2009-05-18,USF,study,"Search efforts continue for USF graduate Aly Lakdawala, who was reported missing on Saturday afternoon when he failed to return from a swim in the Pacific Ocean near the town of Matapalo, Costa Rica.

The Costa Rican Coast Guard, American Embassy, American Red Cross, local police and lifeguards have been searching for the student since Saturday.

Lakdawala and three others went swimming while on an alternative summer break trip on which a total of fourteen students were doing volunteer work.

“The problem is it’s an area where riptides are common cause of death in Costa Rica,” said University Spokesman Michael Hoad.

Maria Crummett, dean of international studies, arrived in Costa Rica on Sunday to assist Lakdawala’s father, who also went to Costa Rica, said Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Tracy Tyree.

Tyree said Rene Sanchez, a coordinator in International Affairs and Education Abroad, went to Costa Rica along with Crummett.

“They’re trying to provide any assistance they’re able to,” Tyree said. “They will do anything they can.”

Tyree said 11 other students ended their trip and returned to the United States on Monday night. She said the remaining two students are flying back Tuesday. Director of the Center for Leadership and Civic Engagement Jennifer Espinola was supervising the students but stayed in Costa Rica to assist in the search process.

“(Espinola) is there to be helpful,” Tyree said. “She is the one person that knows what they were doing.”

Espinola’s husband, Wayne, attended the trip as well and escorted the students back to the U.S.

The trip was part of the Center for Leadership and Civic Engagement. The group left May 8 for the capital, San Jose, to work with the International Volunteer HQ.

The students volunteered at an orphanage for three days then went to assist a Costa Rican biologist on a turtle conservation project in Matapalo.

Lakdawala, 21, graduated earlier this month with a double major in international studies and philosophy.

2009-05-19,USF,study,"Authorities found the body of Aly Lakdawala early Tuesday morning on the beach near Matapalo, Costa Rica, where he went missing Saturday afternoon.


Lakdawala and three other students, who were on an alternative summer break trip with the Center for Leadership and Civic Engagement, were swimming when “an enormous wave” began to pull them from shore, said University Spokesman Michael Hoad.


Hoad said the three students went with the current then slowly swam back to shore as it subsided. He said the students thought Lakdawala was with them.


USF Vice President of Student Affairs Jennifer Meningall received a phone call around 3 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday that Lakdawala’s father had identified his son’s body.


“Let me first say that losing a student is a tragedy for the University,” Meningall said at the news conference. “It is heartbreaking.”


Meningall said Costa Rican authorities believe the body had drifted back to shore. Dean of International Studies Maria Crummett was on the beach with Lakdawala’s father when the body was identified.


Hoad said helicopters and several boats assisted in the searched for Lakdawala. During a second flight, a helicopter had to make an emergency landing in a pineapple field, but no injuries were reported.


He also said Lakdawala’s father rented his own boat to help search.


“It’s a beach that’s remote from the capital (San Jose), but it’s a popular surfing beach,” Hoad said. “There are lifeguards there and there are beach patrol.”


He said six lifeguards were at the beach when Lakdawala went missing, but further details are unknown.


Fourteen students, including Lakdawala, left for Costa Rica on May 8 to volunteer with International Volunteer HQ. The students arrived in San Jose where they volunteered at an orphanage for three days. The group then went to Matapalo to assist a Costa Rican biologist in a turtle conservation project.


The students were supposed to come back Sunday, but 11 students returned late Monday night with Wayne Espinola, the husband of Jennifer Espinola, both of whom were supervising the students. Jennifer is the director of the Center for Leadership and Civic Engagement.


Rene Sanchez, a coordinator in International Affairs and Education Abroad, also went to Costa Rica with Crummett to assist the family.


The remaining two students were scheduled to return to the United States on Tuesday night along with Lakdawala’s father, uncle and USF officials. Hoad said one of the two students who remained had a fever and chose not to fly.


USF President Judy Genshaft said Lakdawala was involved in many activities at the University.


“Aly was a smart, wonderful young man, who participated in many volunteer activities at (USF),” Genshaft said at the news conference. “He was on the board of USF’s Center of Leadership and Civic Engagement and helped plan our alternative spring break trips.”


Lakdawala participated in the center’s alternative spring break trip in South Carolina, where he volunteered at a boys’ home. He graduated earlier this month with a double major in international studies and philosophy.


“Losing a student or any member of our USF community is a tragedy for our university,” Genshaft said. “It’s heartbreaking that this would happen to anyone, but especially to a young man who was going to help serve the world.”


Hoad said the University will continue to have these volunteer trips, but there are plans to review the policies and procedures of future trips.


Meningall said students attend a pre-trip orientation that includes conditions of the country the students plan to visit. USF has grief counselors available and students may contact the counseling center.


“We are significantly concerned that we not only provide support to (Lakdawala’s) family, but also the other students that were participating on this trip and to help them get back to a place where they’re able to fully function,” she said. “This has been a tragic event and we will continue to do what we can.”

2009-05-21,USF,study,"Randy Fontanez has waited and waited … and waited.


Nearly two weeks since his last start — and after Tuesday night’s game was postponed — USF’s ace finally took the mound, recovering from a slow start to lead the Bulls to a 12-2 first-round victory over Pittsburgh in the Big East baseball tournament at Bright House Field in Clearwater on Wednesday.


Fontanez, who’s given up 26 percent of his runs this season in the first two innings, delivered his sixth complete game, giving up two earned runs on eight hits while striking out one to move his record to 7-3 on the year.


“Of course, it was nice to get out there (and pitch),” said Fontanez, who was named first-team All-Big East this week. “I think that’s why in my first two (innings) I didn’t pitch well — because I was so excited. In the third I felt good and after that it felt natural.”


The seventh-seeded Panthers took a 2-1 lead on a RBI single by sophomore outfielder John Schultz in the second and a solo home run by second baseman Chris Sedon in the first.


The USF bats answered, however, bringing in three runs in the bottom of the third. After loading the bases with no one out, outfielder Stephen Hunt sent a ground ball up the middle and Sedon couldn’t field it, giving the Bulls two runs on the error. Designated hitter Chris Rey then grounded out for a double play that drove in first baseman Todd Brazeal.


The second-seeded Bulls added three runs in the fifth, two in the bottom of the sixth and three in the eighth from shortstop Sam Mende’s three-run homer, which ended the game because of the 10-run rule.


USF coach Lelo Prado said it was important for the offense to support Fontanez when he struggled early.


“Especially after last weekend (at Louisville) when we didn’t do a good job offensively, it was nice to see our bats get going again,” he said.


The Bulls were swept in three games last week at Louisville, preventing them from clinching the Big East regular season title.


On Wednesday, USF was led at the plate by Jonathan Koscso, who went 3-for-5 with three runs scored. The Bulls also got two-hit performances from outfielder Junior Carlin, Brazeal, Rey and Mende.


With the win, USF moves into today’s winner’s bracket game against sixth-seeded Connecticut at 4 p.m. at Bright House Field. The Bulls lost two of three during the regular season to the Huskies. Junior right-hander Shawn Sanford, who is 5-3 this season, is scheduled to start for the Bulls.


“UConn is a good team, and they beat us up there,” Prado said. “They beat us in the first and second game, so we’ve got to be ready for them. They’re well coached, and they’re playing good baseball right now.”

After falling to Connecticut 4-2 in the quarterfinals of the Big East baseball tournament at Bright House Field in Clearwater today, the Bulls face elimination against West Virginia at approximately 5:30 p.m.


“If we lose, we go home,” said freshmen Sam Mende, who went 2-for-3 and scored a run.  “It’s up to us, not anyone else.  We just have to wake up and play.”


USF picked a bad time of the season to struggle offensively.  After scoring 12 runs against Notre Dame in the first round on Tuesday, the Bulls managed just two runs on five hits — tied for the second lowest all season.


“You don’t hit, you don’t win,” said USF coach Lelo Prado.  “We didn’t hit today.  If we want to win the tournament, we have to swing the bats.  We didn’t do a very good job for eight innings.”


After entering the ninth down 4-1, USF mounted a rally.  The Bulls loaded the bases on UConn closer David Erickson and Ryan Lockwood hit an RBI single with two outs, scoring Chris Rey to trim the lead to 4-2.  The next batter, Peter Brotons, grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game, however.


USF’s Shawn Sanford and UConn’s Matt McDonald were locked in a pitcher’s duel for most of the game.  After only allowing just an earned run on three hits through the first seven, Sanford allowed two runs on two hits and two wild pitches in the eighth.


“I got the first two outs in the eighth and felt the strongest I felt all day,” Sanford said.  “If I just got that last out in the eight, that little spark in the ninth would’ve meant something.  It stinks that I couldn’t close the eighth.”


The game was originally scheduled for Wednesday, but inclement weather yesterday pushed it back until today.


“Obviously, everyone is more comfortable on a schedule,” Sanford said.  “But that’s part of the game.  Delays are going to happen. “


The Huskies added runs in the fourth and sixth inning. USF has now lost three of four games against the Huskies this year.


The winner of the USF and West Virginia will face UConn in Saturday’s semifinal, which has yet to finalized.

After the Bulls and Mountaineers went back and forth for six innings, USF pulled away in the top of the seventh, scoring six runs on five hits.  Junior Peter Brotons keyed the rally with a one-out, two-run double.


“That was a huge hit because we were battling back and forth and that hit put us up a couple,” Prado said.  “He had been struggling with the bat so it was nice to see him get going.”


Brotons said he’s just glad to keep playing.


“We expect the best, I’m just glad we got this game to keep our season alive,” he said.


With USF trailing 3-1, freshman Todd Brazeal hit a towering three-run homer in the fifth to put the Bulls up 4-3.


West Virginia answered in the bottom half of the inning as Dan DiBartolomeo hit a two-run homer to put the Mountaineers up 5-4.


However, the Bulls eventually proved to be too much in the seventh.


“After one hit, another comes,” Brotons said.  “It was a big momentum change after that inning.  That’s what wins games.”


Derrick Stultz left the game after five innings of work and Quackenbush held the best hitting team in the Big East in check, allowing only one run on six hits in four innings, while not walking a batter and striking out five.


“When you keep that team down like that, that’s pretty good,” Prado said.  “They’re scary down six in the ninth.  I can’t say enough about the job he did.”


Quackenbush said he was careful with the Mountaineers’ lineup.


“You can’t miss your spots with those guys.  They’ll hit it far,” he said.  “They’re a great hitting ballclub.”


With Quackenbush in a fair amount of trouble in the eighth, shortstop Sam Mende made a diving catch with two outs — and two on base — to limit the damage.


“That was a big league play,” Prado said.


Quackenbush was impressed.


“Unbelievable play,” he said.


USF pounded out 15 hits, tying a team record for hits in a Big East tournament game.


USF plays Connecticut tomorrow in the semifinals at 1 p.m., pending weather.  The Bulls have to beat the Huskies twice since they lost to them on Thursday.

2009-05-27,USF,study,"Following the Crate & Barrel’s preview party, more than $18,000 was donated to the First Generation Scholarship Program (FGSP) at USF.


Crate & Barrel held the pre-opening party Wednesday to celebrate the store’s new location at International Plaza. More than 200 attendees including USF alumni and local business owners donated to FSGP.


Along with private donations from the pre-opening party and a disclosed portion of the store’s first-week sales, the state of Florida matched one-hundred percent of the funds raised by Crate & Barrell.


“There were two goals (at the party), one to raise money and two to raise awareness. [The foundation and Crate & Barrel] have a wonderful partnership,” said Joel Momberg, chief executive officer of the USF Foundation.


This was the first time one of Crate & Barrel’s pre-opening parties was geared toward education, said Bette Kahn, chief executive officer of Crate & Barrel. She said the store approached USF about the opportunity.


“We believe in education. Many of my Crate & Barrel’s employees have a history in education or are ex-teachers. Like Obama, we believe in education,” Kahn said.


In 2006, the Florida legislature passed the First Generation Matching Grant Program that provides financial support to students whose parents never attended college, Momberg said.


There are 4,000 USF students that are considered first generation college attendees, Momberg said.


“[FGSP] was very appealing and emotional. The state of Florida agreed to meet our donation,” Kahn said. “As a whole we thought this scholarship was a compelling reason to help.”


Attendees had to pay $25 to enter the pre-opening party. USF graduate Nancy Alfredson said she wanted to support FGSP because she was a first generation college graduate.


“I was invited from the Alumni Association and I’m a large supporter of the (FGSP) program,” she said. “I was a first generation graduate and I was able to make it through college because of grants and scholarships. It really is a terrific program.”


Ivonne Rodriguez, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, is a FGSP recipient and attended the party.


“If it wasn’t for the scholarship I wouldn’t be attending any university,” she said. “I knew my family wasn’t able to help me because they struggle to make their household payments.”


FGSP assists students with paying tuition, housing, food, a laptop and provides $700 for books each semester.


“I am very grateful because I would not be here without FGSP,” Rodriguez said.


Additional donations to FGSP can be made directly on the USF Foundation website at http://giving.usf.edu/TheFoundation.aspx.

2009-05-31,USF,study,"A 14-year-old girl was raped and killed in her home by U.S. Army soldiers. One of the soldiers was sentenced to life in prison. This was the wrong decision — he deserved the death penalty.


According to The New York Times, Private Steven Green and other soldiers decided to commit this unthinkable crime while drinking Iraqi whiskey March 11, 2006. The soldiers testified that Green killed the girl’s mother, father and little sister, then each of the of soldiers each raped the girl and finally Green shot her in the head.


During the trial, lawyers for the defendant did not deny their client’s wrongdoing, but instead focused on building a case arguing that Green should not receive the death penalty. Soldiers that knew him testified that Green served in unusually stressful conditions, his unit suffered heavy casualties and he didn’t receive sufficient Army guidance and control.


Scott Wendelsdorf, one of Green’s defense attorneys, said, “Steven Green was responsible (for the rape and murders), but the United States of America failed Steven Green.”


How did the country fail Green? The country provided Green with a future — they gave him educational benefits, economic compensation and the chance to be a part of history.


In actuality, Green failed the United States of America. He knowingly breached his contract with his country and the Army. The defendant enlisted in the Army entirely by his own choice, knowing that he was going to war. This criminal knew what he was getting himself into and should suffer the death penalty for his ruthless actions.


Though Green served in an area of Iraq called the “Triangle of Death” and experienced traumatic events, as a conscious adult he should not have done what he did. As a soldier of the U.S Army, he was trained to handle these situations and in no way should any excuses be made for his unforgivable behavior.


According to the Boston Herald, Green was tried in federal court as a civilian for murder, rape and obstruction of justice charges because he was discharged from the Army before his arrest due to a “personality disorder.”


On May 21, 2009, the jury, which consisted of nine women and three men, could not come to a unanimous decision and therefore the life sentence decision prevailed. The other soldiers are also receiving life sentences with the eligibility for parole within 10 years or less.


The jury deliberated for 10 hours over two days for this case. Though no one knows the exact points the jurors were deliberating on, one argument that should have been brought up is, “What if this was your family?” If this happened to my family, I would want
payback. If America lets these criminals commit senseless crimes without proper punishment, it gives leeway for others to do the same thing.


The jury should have also taken into account the defendant’s actions after the crime was committed. According to statements from the other soldiers involved in the crime, Green bragged about what he had done, saying it was “awesome.”


Opponents may argue that the death sentence is cruel and unusual punishment, but this is not the case. Watching your mother, father and little sister be shot and killed, being raped multiple times and then being shot in the head, however, certainly qualifies.


The Iraqi civilians did not decide to go to war with the U.S. and are in no way responsible for the deaths of U.S. soldiers. The soldiers’ resentment toward the Iraqi government in no way justifies the punishment of innocent civilians.


According to Reuters, relatives of the 14-year-old expressed their outrage that the lead soldier received a life sentence instead of being executed. This former soldier killed a total of four people, raped one girl, and set her house on fire to cover up his crime. If he had not been a soldier, the jury would almost certainly have bestowed the death penalty.


Had they agreed upon the death penalty for the defendant, the jury would have made the consequences of this crime clear to others. This trial should have set a precedent that soldiers will pay for crimes committed while serving overseas. Instead, it showed that the U.S. court system is biased toward them.

2009-06-01,USF,study,"With changes set to take place in the credit industry, college students may soon find it harder to obtain credit cards. Students have mixed views on what a new bill requires them to do.


The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, which was signed by President Barack Obama on May 22, requires people under the age of 21 to prove that they can repay money or that a parent or guardian will pay their credit card debt if they default.


While the new bill eliminates surprise fees and interest rate increases, it also reduces
credit card companies’ willingness to lend money.


“A lot of young people aren’t responsible with money,” said Lorraine Dyer, a senior
majoring in business. “But so many things are based on credit now.”


Patrick Long, a senior majoring in international studies, said it’s a good thing the bill causes companies to limit loans, but it hinders opportunities for those who may not default.


“The bad part is it’s harder for students trying to build up credit,” he said.


The under-21 rules are only one part of the new bill.


Many credit card companies charge a fee for payments made over the phone. Beginning February 2010, companies must allow consumers to pay their bills online or over the phone with no fee.


Companies will also have to provide a 45-day notice accompanied by an explanation before increasing interest rates.


A 2008 report by Sallie Mae, a leading provider of student loans and financial aid, showed that college students are using credit to pay for college expenses more than ever before.


The report suggested that students who used credit cards to pay college expenses, including tuition and books, charged an average of $2,200 in spring 2008. Four years ago, the average was $942.


Ana Lopez, a senior majoring in finance and economics, said limits should be put on students who are irresponsible with their money.


“They spend more than they should,” she said.


Forty percent of the surveyed students said they had charged items to their credit cards knowing they could not pay for them and 82 percent carried balances on their credit cards.


Last year, the average number of credit cards per student was 4.6. The average balance was $3,173.


Because of the high balances, Jamie Mendez, a graduate student in biomedical sciences, said the bill’s limits are not such a bad thing.


“Most people under 21 end up with bills they can’t pay,” she said.


According to the report, 84 percent of undergraduates said they needed more education on personal finance and credit.


Aimee LeClair, a senior majoring in communications, said her first credit card had a $300 limit and a 38 percent interest rate.


“I wish there was a class that taught credit in high school because credit card companies target students,” she said.

2009-06-03,USF,study,"A group of USF architecture students are trying to make a difference in the community by applying what they have learned in the classroom to create a much needed multi-purpose building and pantry for a local church.


During the fall 2008 semester, the students began a Design/Build community project for the Noah Nothing Caring & Teaching Center at the Kingdom of God church in East Tampa, under the direction of Stanley Russell, assistant professor of architecture.


“Before we began this project, the church was using a termite-ridden shack from the 1920s as a pantry and place to help people in need,” said Paul Martinez, an architecture grad student. “Their biggest problem was they were limited in space.”


Design/Build is a program within the USF School of Architecture in which students gain experience in conceptualizing and constructing a building on their own, said Chris Podes, a senior architecture major working on the project.


“We do the work ourselves, so we are able to fully understand how a building is put together from start to finish,” he said.


Russell said Director of Noah Nothing Caring & Teaching Center Gloria Harmon approached him and asked for his help in designing and building a pantry and center for the church.


With a concept to use recycled materials in a “big way” for the project, the students used three 8-by-40-foot recycled shipping containers to create the facility, Russell said. The completed building will have storage space for canned goods, an office, a conference room, a lobby area, a computer room, a kitchen, an open multi-purpose area and restrooms.


“By creating this (building) it allows the church to offer more to the people who need help,” Martinez said. “It offers a safe haven for people on the street and will help keep them out of trouble.”


Podes said the project has already had a positive impact on the community.


“Just us being out there working every day has created a bond with the community,” he said.


The students were separated into two groups before they began building the facility in the spring semester.


One group worked at the site that would house the new building, digging trenches, pouring concrete and preparing the site for the placement of the shipping containers.


The other group worked to prepare the shipping containers for delivery to the church site, including cutting spaces for windows, doors and skylights.


While the students did most of the labor and design for the project, Russell said numerous local businesses also donated materials, labor and time.


Donations of concrete, slabs and gravel from the Florida Rock Industries helped alleviate the project’s tight budget, Podes said.


The students purchased the recycled containers from A AAmerican Containers, a local business that sells shipping containers, Russell said. The company also provided a work area for the project and employees to assist the students.


“For the most part none of us (students) had any construction experience — it was all new,” Podes said. “It helped that A AAmerican had experience and knowledge of the material. They were very accommodating during the process.”


Russell said the students have finished approximately half of the project and the building could be complete by spring 2010.

2009-06-04,USF,study,"Dr. Abdul Rao, former vice president of USF Health, won’t be prosecuted by the state.


State Attorney Mark Ober announced the decision Tuesday. Rao, who was caught on camera taking a bicycle, completed an intervention program and paid $195 in fines to cover the cost of his prosecution and investigation, according to the State Attorney’s Office.


The Misdemeanor Intervention Program is for first-time offenders and prevents a criminal record.


Rao also worked 18 hours of community service at the American Cancer Society, said his attorney, Stephen Romine.


“I think he is very satisfied there were no charges,” Romine said.


On Feb. 9, Rao was caught on surveillance camera taking a bicycle from the loading dock of the Johnnie B. Byrd Sr. Alzheimer’s Center & Research Institute and giving it to a man Rao said was his handyman.


The video was put on YouTube a few days later.


Rao resigned the next week from his duties at the University as senior associate vice president of USF Health, vice dean of research and director of the School of Basic Biomedical Sciences, for which he received a salary of $384,280.


He received a $50,000 settlement with his resignation. He later rescinded his resignation, but the University refused to accept the rescindment.


“(The case) appropriately ended with no criminal charges,” Romine said.


However, Christine Dillingham, who was using the bicycle that was taken, said she disagreed with the result.


She said Rao shouldn’t go to jail, but that he needed to be held accountable.


Tim Boyd, a doctoral student and the owner of the bicycle, said Rao was a lightning rod who rubbed people the wrong way.


“I would have filed charges on anyone who had stolen my bike,” he said. “If it had been anyone else at the University, they would have been prosecuted.”


Rao is now working at the Institute of Women’s Health of North America in Orlando as chief executive officer and executive director, said Romine.


“I can’t be happy about it,” Boyd said. “While he is under investigation he gets a government job.”


However, Boyd said he is glad it is over, since the case was a big hindrance to his work at the University.


Romine said Rao has moved on and is doing well.

2009-06-07,USF,study,"Fingerprint scans, 360-degree view cameras and detailed questions and answers sound more like parts of a James Bond movie than aspects of the educational system. However, some educators thought these were the lengths they had to go to satisfy the requirements of the Higher Education Act.


The act, which was re-authorized last month, covers guidelines that Universities would have to meet to monitor students taking online courses.


Initially, educators thought they’d have to cut online programs because of the expenses of buying gadgets like webcams and finger scans to meet requirements for preventing plagiarism, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.


Given the state of the economy, forcing Universities to go high-tech in the chase for cheaters would have been the wrong move.


Instead, the law was reworded and “would allow colleges to satisfy the mandate with techniques like secure log-ins and passwords or proctored examinations,” according to the Chronicle.


Cheating has always been a problem in schools and data and surveys indicate a steady increase in cheating, according to the book Student Cheating and Plagiarism in the Internet Era: A Wake-up Call by Ann Lathrop.


However, catching the few that wrongfully take advantage of online education to cheat and plagiarize shouldn’t be a main concern for universities right now. Money is tight everywhere, so schools and the government have to choose their battles.


One of USF’s definitions of cheating is taking an examination for or in place of another student. The suggested punishment is that “the enrolled student receive an F in the course and be suspended from school for one year and that the stand-in, if a University student, be suspended from school for one year.”


A cheaper way to discourage cheating is to make sure the punishment is well-known by all students. The University could even require students to come to class with their student I.D. for at least the midterm and final exam


The law was reworked for the right reason: to keep schools from tightening their budget belts even further. Maintaining a quality education for the many must take precedence over the ethical violations of the few.

2009-06-08,USF,study,"Because of advancements in technology and safety hazards, the USF Division of Public Safety eliminated the vehicle unlock program that was once offered to faculty and students.


The program assisted those who locked themselves out of their cars. However, the tools used were found to possibly cause damage to vehicles’ side air bags, while electronic locks made it difficult to unlock newer cars.


The end of the spring semester marked the end of the free service.


“I see it as ending a disservice,” said Bruce Benson, assistant vice president of Public Safety.  “It is an outdated service that can cause more damage to the person’s car.”


All security personnel on campus, including Allied Barton, Parking Enforcement and University Police, assisted in the program.


Officials used two different methods to open vehicles. The most common method was the use of a slim jim, a thin rod inserted between the door and the window, to pull the
lock open.


Slim jims can cause scratches on the window or puncture the side air bags that are common in newer cars.


“Electronic locks are no longer able to be opened using slim jims and side air bags could be damaged,” Benson said. “We do not want to risk setting off an air bag or damaging one so that if a person is involved in an accident it doesn’t work properly.”


Sometimes a crow bar was used, but this method ran the risk of bending the doors, causing them to close improperly.


Benson said the elimination of the program would have little effect, if any, because the service cost nothing for students or the Division of Public Safety.


“I don’t know if it is a good thing or bad thing,” said Melissa Sharrock, a senior majoring in history and anthropology. “It was a good program that they had for people.”


While some students may think that the program was a good thing, some have never had the need for it.


“I have AAA so I would never use it,” said Stephanie Greene, who graduated from USF in the spring with a degree in biology. “I can understand why they would cut it.”


Matt Fronk, a senior majoring in social work and member of Safe Team, said he was not even aware of the program.


“I don’t think a lot of students knew about it, and most people won’t miss it until they need it,” he said.


Benson said police officers are not locksmiths and that people who have locked
themselves out of their car and are a member of services such as AAA should call those companies for help.


If students need assistance contacting a locksmith, Benson said they can contact the department’s dispatcher using their cell phone or one of the emergency blue-light phones stationed around campus.


Benson said security officers are available to wait for a locksmith with anyone who feels unsafe.

2009-06-11,USF,study,"Area police were called to USF today when a white male was seen carrying a black handgun while walking near Greek Village.


University Police spokeswoman Lt. Meg Ross said the male, probably between 18 and 21-years-old, was wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt with the words “Go Greek” printed on it.


Ross said the male was seen walking along 50th Street near Fletcher Avenue,  50th and Holly Drive and was also spotted walking north on Fowler Avenue. Ross said UP and Hillsborough County agencies received three separate phone calls from people who spotted the suspect.


A MoBull alert was sent around 4 p.m. that stated, “Police responding to report of man with gun on NE side of campus near greek village. Avoid area.”


UP and the Tactical Response Team arrived at the Student Marshall Center to assist in safety measures for parents and prospective students who were attending an orientation session in the center. Prospective students and their parents were visiting booths where USF students advertised campus clubs and organizations.


Officers escorted two separate groups of students, orientation leaders and parents into the Oval Theatre and the balcony.


Sgt. Charlotte Domingo spoke to the group about the situation. She said that UP received a 911 phone call that a gunman was seen on campus.


“We asked that the family members of students stay together,” she said. “You will worry about each other less if you are together. If you see something suspicious, you’ll know that there are UP officers in the area. We would ask that you call one of us or dial 911. You guys are getting an unique experience today that we don’t usually have at orientation.”


Domingo used the incident as an example of how the University operates in emergency situations.


“You get a call, you go with the information you have — and you make the best decisions available,” Domingo said.


Ross said the Tactical Response Team, which are trained to be first responders in emergencies, were participating in a training session when the male was first seen. Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office sent helicopters to the scene to assist in the search for the suspect.


A second MoBull alert was sent around 5:30 p.m. that stated, “After reports of man with gun, police conducted thorough search of area. All activities continued as normal.”


Ross said authorities were unable to find the suspect, but UP and Hillsborough County officers will continue a “heightened patrol” on campus tonight. She said a detailed report will be available Friday.

“As we do with any bomb threat response, we pair up with the people who know the venue, who know the area,” he said.


UP officials were stationed around the outside parameter of the building while the bomb squad investigated the suspicious purse. Stahle said it appeared the purse had been there since yesterday but it was necessary for officials to take a “precautionary measure” because it was zipped.


“If we find something like that and can’t get anyone to claim ownership, we can’t take the chance,” he said.


Stahle said Moffitt has the purse in lost and found and hasn’t been claimed yet.


The front entrance of Moffitt was closed, but no one was evacuated from the building and no roads were closed.


“Because the questionable package or purse was located in a publicly-accessible area, fortunately, we were able to cord off that area with the safety parameter that met the needs of the bomb squad without having an impact on business in Moffitt,” Stahle said.


At 8:45 a.m., Moffitt received a bomb threat by phone, but it “lacked specificity,” Stahle said. Moffitt security contacted UP at 9:11 a.m. Stahle said UP had six officers on the scene within one minute.


Tampa Police Department, several units from Tampa Fire Rescue, including the Incident Hazardous Team also arrived at the scene.


A MoBull text-message alert was sent at 10:40 a.m. that stated, “USF Tampa: There is a bomb threat at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Avoid the area until further notice.”


Authorities called the search off at noon and another MoBull alert was sent that stated, “USF Tampa: A thorough search was conducted at Moffitt Cancer Center and no bomb was located. The location is safe to resume normal activities.”


Stahle said this case is an ongoing investigation, but it “will be brought to a quick conclusion.”


“We’ve had quite a few of these in our jurisdiction,” he said.


Stahle said the last time Moffitt experienced a bomb threat was about six months ago.


“That’s really an anomaly,” he said. “Of all the years that Moffitt has been a part of the University campus, it is extremely rare for it to occur in here.”

2009-06-14,USF,study,"As plans continue for a museum centered on the history of carnivals, the International Independent Showmen’s Museum (IISM) is looking to the USF Library’s digital collections to help them preserve the history of a dying breed of entertainment.


The IISM has been compiling carnival photos for two decades, but it was three years ago that Andrew Huse, the assistant librarian for Special Collections, approached IISM member Lee Stevens to initiate the University’s involvement with the project.


The significance of preserving the carnival’s history goes beyond the act, Huse said.


“The important thing to understand is that the carnival represents our first national culture,” he said. “Before the radio, before the Internet, before the television, these traveling shows brought national culture to small towns across America.”


Chuck Mayo, who is heading the digitalization project for the IISM, said the information provided by the Library will make many photos and the historic story of American carnivals available to anyone in the country.


“I’m researching photos, too, before they are entered into the digital collection (by the Library),” Mayo said.


The USF Library is also helping in other ways.


“The Library’s part has been to document the showman’s histories thorough interviews,” Huse said.


Huse, who interviewed some of the traveling performers, said the oral interviews give depth to the promotional photos. He said one interesting story was that of Stevens, who dropped out of high school to join the circus.


“He started from nothing, cleaning up after the circus and knowing nothing, to really
learning the trade from a lot of older greats,” he said.


Huse said Stevens went on to work with Ringling Bros. Circus and other big productions, but his roots are still in the small circuses.


Many of the museum’s photos are of unknown origin.


“Most of the photos are taken for publicity purposes — lots of promotional photos for rides and Ferris wheels, lots of pictures of freaks, juggling trapeze artists, lots of animal shows,” Huse said.


He said the photos date back to the 1800’s and were compiled from an array of organizations. The Community Foundation of Greater Sun City Center is funding the preservation effort.


“USF’s help with our project has encouraged us to immediately start with preserving these photos,” Mayo said. “The (digitalization) project would have been put off for several more years without USF’s direct involvement.”


The IISM is planning to supplement the digital photo collection with a physical museum.


“(Members) are looking to create a museum in Gibsonton, where the carnies have lived for many decades now during the offseason,” Huse said.


With a Ferris wheel as its centerpiece, the museum would exhibit objects and games found at carnivals, such as plaster dolls from the ’40s and ’50s.


However, the building project has been stalled and is awaiting a contractors’ bid in the fall to assess the cost of construction, Mayo said.


Until the museum’s completion, the best opportunity to view the evolution of American carnival’s history will be through USF’s digital collections.

2009-06-15,USF,study,"Legislation that increased tuition also restructed the Bright Futures Scholarship Program’s funding and student eligibility requirements.


Beginning July 1, changes  made by the Higher Education Appropriations Conforming Bill (Senate Bill 1696), which was passed June 2, will affect Bright Future recipients who enroll in college for the first time in the 2009-10 school year.


The scholarship has three award levels: Florida Academic Scholar (FAS), Academic Top Scholar (ATS) and the Florida Medallion Scholars (FMS).


Bright Futures will pay students a flat rate of $126 per credit hour for FAS and ATS recipients at four-year schools and $78 per credit hour at community colleges.  ATS recipients will receive an additional $54 per credit hour.


The program will pay FMS recipients $95 per credit hour at four-year schools and $59 at community colleges.


USF’s tuition and fees in the upcoming school year will be $150.10 per credit hour, said Billie Jo Hamilton, director of Financial Aid.


Only ATS recipients will receive enough to cover this amount.


Hamilton said Bright Futures is implementing a new process for refunding state money for classes dropped or withdrawn by Bright Futures recipients after the drop/add deadline.


This change makes students responsible for paying the full amount for any dropped or withdrawn classes during the school year, said Hamilton.


“Students are looking for more scholarships and money to cover the differences of the Bright Futures cutbacks,” said Vivian Fiallo, college and career counselor at Freedom High School in Tampa.


Fiallo said students are becoming more active in finding scholarships. She said she does not think the cutbacks will lower the number of students staying in Florida for college.


Hamilton said students may qualify for an exemption from paying back money if their class withdrawl was because of verifiable illness or injury. However, she said exceptions will be rare.


The changes will require the institution to refund all non-exempted monies back to Bright Futures within 30 days of the end of the semester, Hamilton said.


She said that in order to renew the Bright Futures Scholarship students cannot owe money for withdrawn or dropped classes. If a student does not repay the institution, an “accounts receivable hold” will be placed on the student’s account.


Such a hold could cancel the student’s upcoming semester registration, refuse registration for any future semester until fees have been paid, hold transcripts and grades and withhold a student’s diploma, among other things.


Last year, about $2.6 million was spent on classes that students withdrew from or dropped, Hamilton said.


She said students might not drop classes as much if they money will be coming out of their pockets.


Another change to the program is that full-time students must earn 24 credit hours in a school year and part-time students must earn a prorated amount based on their enrollment.


Hamilton said a grade of a D or better is considered passing under the Bright Futures requirements.


Bright Futures is also terminating the “college-related expense” payments for students, which paid for student lab and book fees.


Hamilton said even with the reductions in Bright Futures, Florida has a generous
scholarship program and the second cheapest state tuition in the country.


According to USF Office of Financial Aid, 15,407 USF students received $41.9 million in Bright Futures for the 2008-09 school year.


“I would not be able to go to school if I didn’t have Bright Futures,” said Nicole Bird, a junior double majoring in English literature and theatre arts who receives 100 percent Bright Futures.


She also said student’s grade point averages will likely suffer, because students may have to get a job to make up for what Bright Futures used to cover.


“My little brother is starting college next year and will be affected by these changes to Bright Futures,” said Tim Bender, a junior majoring in microbiology who receives 100 percent Bright Futures. “He learned two weeks after graduating high school that he wasn’t receiving as much money for college and now he feels cheated.”


Bender said Bright Futures was “a big incentive” for him to attend college in Florida.


Institutions are required to notify Bright Future recipients of the new requirements and changes made to the Bright Future Scholarship Program during the registration
process.


Hamilton said USF is already taking measures to inform prospective students and their parents of the changes by making announcements at student orientations and calling students.

2009-06-17,USF,study,"USF coach Stan Heath has put the finishing touches on the hiring of his coaching staff, with the most recent hire being last Friday’s addition of assistant Jeremy Cox.


Cox, who’s known Heath for seven years, worked as an assistant under Billy Gillespie at Kentucky and Texas A&M for the past four years. He has only been on campus for five days, but is already making an impression.


The Oracle recently caught up with Heath’s newest coach:


The Oracle:

What are your initial thoughts of the school in general? Have you been around campus?
Jeremy Cox:
Yeah. It’s a beautiful campus. It seems there is a tremendous amount of energy and spirit here. I’m really enthused to be a part of it.


O:

You coached under Gillespie for four years. Was it tough parting ways?
JC:
I think it’s tough leaving anywhere where you’ve had great relationships. It’s harder to leave a relationship than a place. I didn’t just have a relationship with (Gillespie), but other staff member and players. That was the tough part.


But I’ve known coach Heath for a long time and respect him as a coach. I look forward to working with him. That made it easier.
O:

Can you talk a little bit about the transition from a school that puts 20,000 fans in the stands to a school that puts 3,000?
JC:
We’ve got to change that mindset. You look up at the banners in the Sun Dome and look at who you have to play every night and realize it’s not that different from Kentucky. We have to have the mindset of playing at the highest level. The expectations are there, the resources are there, and the coaching is there.
O:

You said USF had the resources. Did you see an opportunity to help turn the program around?
JC:
No question. It’s exciting and it’s a challenge. A challenge is only exciting if it’s conquerable. This is a conquerable challenge. It has those three or four major things.


One, it’s in Tampa. It’s a beautiful place. Secondly, it’s in one of the best basketball leagues in the country. Third, you got a head coach who I can’t see any young man wouldn’t want to play for. You’ve got some things to sell.


O:

So you and Heath are pretty close?
JC:
We’ve known each other for a period of time. We’ve had a very good working
relationship.


O:
What are you thoughts about Dominique Jones and the USA World University Games Team competition?
JC:
From the little time I’ve watched on film and had a chance to meet him, he seems like an outstanding kid. Just to be invited to that tryout is a tremendous honor. They don’t invite guys who can’t play. He’s obviously an outstanding player and it gives you a reason to be very optimistic when you have players like that in the program.
O:

Stemming from an earlier response, what do you think it will take for USF to be
competitive in the Big East?
JC:
Two things. You have to continue to add good players and your mindset has to change from, “We deserve to have success” to, “We can have success.”


O:

Is there anything you’ve learned from previous jobs and experiences that can guide you here at USF?
JC:
Most jobs are the same. It starts with hard work and enthusiasm and if you can bring those two things everyday, along with a product to sell, you can have success. USF has those two things.

2009-06-18,USF,study,"The USF African Student Association (ASA) began a collection drive Sunday in commemoration of World Refugee Day 2009.


Donations of clothes, books, backpacks, shoes and other items can be dropped off through Friday on the third floor of the Marshall Student Center (MSC) in the Office of Student Programs.


ASA partnered with Lutheran Services Florida (LSF) to organize a World Refugee Day event at USF on Friday, said ASA Director of Activities Ijeoma Ekenta, a senior international studies major.


At the event, the collected donations will be given to LSF, an organization that helps refugees with their various needs, including transitioning from their country to the United States. LSF will then distribute the items to local refugees.


World Refugee Day was initially promoted by the United Nations and is celebrated worldwide, said senior computer engineering major Olisaemeka Echeazu, president of ASA.


A group of refugees will share their life experiences during Friday’s event.


There will be also free health screenings and children’s activities, including face painting, dancing and games.


The event will take place from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in the TECO room of the College of Education building. Everyone is welcome to attend.

PedEgg


What is it? The PedEgg is a small, egg-shaped device with cheese-grater-like blades that are used to remove calloused and dry skin from feet.


Feet must be clean and dry before use. When the device is rubbed repeatedly over troubled areas of the feet, shavings collect in the center of the PedEgg, which can be emptied afterward. The PedEgg can be washed in the sink and allowed to air dry. The blades become dull after a few uses, so refills must be purchased to support regular use.


Two PedEggs can be purchased for $10 plus shipping and handling.


Does it work? For a glorified cheese grater, the PedEgg delivered surprising results. After using the Peg Egg and moisturizing, my feet were soft and smooth.


The shavings collected by the PedEgg can fall out, so it is best to use the device in a bathtub or shower. Care should be taken when employing the product, as applying too much pressure or using it too often can cause feet to feel sore.


Overall, the PedEgg is a good investment and much cheaper than going to the spa.

ShamWow


What is it? Used on its commercials to absorb soda from the carpet and soak up a copious amount of water from a bowl, the ShamWow is a towel-like cloth that is marketed as holding “12x its weight in liquid” without dripping or spilling.


Its orange color is vibrant, and it can be cut to size if the consumer wants to use it for, say, a bath mat or a dog hair dryer. Priced at $19.99 plus shipping and handling, the ShamWow package includes four large and four small towels.


Does it work? In commercials, the ShamWow seems like a soft towel that soaks up an abnormal amount of water, but fresh out of the box it’s really nothing more than stiff, folded felt material.


The ShamWow took a long time to soak up the water from a filled sink — and did not work any better than a normal towel.


It did not hold the water in, either. It dripped continuously and definitely would not work if already wet, as the advertisements claim.


I’ve been told the ShamWow works better after being used several times, but it would
probably be better to just buy some felt from a fabric store.

Does it work? After watching a few hours of the Degrassi: The Next Generation marathon on The N, the repeating Bumpit commercial became quite annoying.


As annoying as the commercial is, I know the product works as advertised because I’ve seen it used effectively.


However, though it technically “works,” the device does not produce an attractive style. The “bump” will make anyone look like a reject from the Hairspray cast.

PediPaws


What is it? PediPaws, the “incredible pet nail trimmer,” is essentially an emery-filing wheel encased by a yellow cap and attached to a large handle.


The yellow cap features a small slot in which to place the pet nail and is designed to keep the filings from escaping into the air.


Advertisements for the product claim it provides a “fast, easy and gentle” way to trim pets’ nails and leave them “touchably smooth.” The ads also claim that the filing wheel is quiet, so as not to startle your pet.


Does it work? If you have a pet as skittish as my dog, who once scurried away in fear when I accidentally dropped a miniature pretzel, then the noise level of the wheel’s spinning — which is actually relatively loud — won’t help much with getting your pet to sit still long enough to trim their nails.


Also, the PediPaw does not work well on larger animals. It took hours to file my Labrador’s nails.


The PediPaw’s design makes it primarily effective for maintenance, so you will probably still need clippers to cut your pet’s nails.


Finally, the yellow cap covering the emery wheel is utterly useless. Dust clouds from nail filings will fill the room and leave you gasping for air. If you purchase the PediPaw, I suggest buying a surgical mask as well.

The Magic Bullet Blender


What is it? It chops, it minces, it blends, it’s the Magic Bullet Blender. Its cheesy
infomercial can be seen during the early morning hours and features the typical skeptical men, impressed women and perky hosts.


The product includes two different blades, a large and small cup, shaker/steamer tops and more. The Magic Bullet Blender costs $99.99 plus shipping and handling.


Does it work? I have been doubtful of “As-Seen-on-TV” products ever since my
disappointing experience with the Ab Slider. However, this product changed my perception.


The Magic Bullet is extremely versatile and has everyday value, though sometimes it takes more than a few seconds to blend. It also comes with an easy-to-follow recipe guide that includes dishes such as “It’s Ready Already Alfredo,” “Before You Know It Bean Dip” and “Six-Second Scrambled Eggs.” Homemade seafood Alfredo seemed like a difficult task, but the recipe was easy, quick and delicious.

Rubbermaid Produce Saver


What is it? The Rubbermaid Produce Savers are containers built to keep fruits and vegetables fresh. They come in three different sizes: two cups, five cups and 14 cups.


Much like an ordinary Tupperware container, the lid snaps on and keeps the food from being exposed to moisture. The difference is the Fresh Vent — vented slats on the bottom of the container that allow the food to stay fresh.


Does it work? The product works, but not as well as portrayed on television. Baby-cut carrots and cut-up romaine lettuce remained fresh a week after being placed in the
Produce Savers. In other containers, carrots lost their crispness and lettuce turned brown after only a couple of days.


Fruit, however, did not do so well — the watermelon put in the five-cup container quickly lost its freshness.

Betty Crocker Cake Decorating Kit

The kit comes with the materials to make flowers, fancy icing decorations and professional-looking words on cakes. It costs $14.95 plus shipping and handling and
comes with a plastic storage box.


Does it work? The kit includes all the necessary tools to create a good-looking cake. What it does not include is decorative skill.


Commercials seem to target children and adults looking for a creative outlet (which were the consumers hooked in my household), but the instructions do not make up for a lack of ability.


When buying this product, one must keep in mind that the “stencils” are simply stamps that can be pressed into the top of a cake and traced with colorful icing.


This is a tricky task, and no commercial product will automatically grant the user mastery of it.

2009-06-24,USF,study,"USF men’s soccer midfielder Francisco Aristeguieta got the call Saturday.


“Unexpected shock” filled the senior’s mind as he got an invite to join his country’s national team – the highest level in international soccer – for training this week.


Aristeguieta, USF’s captain, flew to Atlanta on Monday to join the Venezuela national team in preparation for Wednesday night’s match against Mexico in the Georgia Dome. Though he didn’t suit up for the game, he practiced throughout the week.


“It is very surreal to me because you see these guys all the time on TV and then you get to see them in person,” Aristeguieta said. “It’s like I’m playing with some of my role models. It’s very impressive, and it feels really good.”


“He approaches everything the same way, and he’s been our captain for three years, so he’s been such a consistent player for us,” said USF coach George Kiefer. “I bet this will give him some more confidence.”


Aristeguieta first raised eyebrows in the spring, when USF played an exhibition against the Venezuela U-17 national team, Kiefer said.


Aristeguieta also made a significant impact for the Bulls throughout the season, Kiefer said.


The Caracas native totaled six points from a defensive midfielder position with two goals and two assists. The goals came at a crucial point during the Big East semifinals, propelling the Bulls to a 2-1 victory over Notre Dame. USF went on to win the Big East championship.


“(Aristeguieta) is really valuable in keeping a hold of the ball, keeping possession for us,” Kiefer said. “A lot goes through him (offensively).”


Aristeguieta, who holds 4.0 grade point average, said he’s focused on using the momentum from last year’s Big East tournament to propel him offensively.


“The tournament was a great experience for me and I’ve been talking to coach Kiefer about being able to go forward offensively more,” he said. “Last year, (former USF midfielder) Kevon Neaves would be the one always going forward, so now I’m hoping that I can help there a little more next year.”


Aristeguieta said he sees training with his national team as a learning experience.


“These guys practice with a different rhythm, they play really fast soccer,” he said. “They have all this professional experience, so it’s a look at what things could be like after college. It’s been really good. It’s been hard to fit in, but hopefully I can get more goals and starting getting used to this stuff.”

Mariloly Orozco was nominated following the impeachment trial of ranking Student Government Chief Justice Sarah Heikkinen.


“We think she’ll do a great job,” Soltero said at the May 19 senate meeting. “We hope the transition begins soon.”


However, Soltero said Wednesday that Orozco will discontinue her role as acting chief justice.


Orozco was to be confirmed at Tuesday’s senate meeting, but her confirmation was removed from the agenda.


Senate President Pro Tempore Matthew Diaz said the Senate Executive Committee met and interviewed Orozco and decided they were not “in full support of the nomination.”


Diaz said that Orozco’s confirmation had been postponed to the beginning of July to give senators the chance to talk with her and learn more about her.


“I discussed with Ms. Orozco the nomination, and there have been a couple of concerns from senators,” Soltero said. “We decided to no longer pursue her confirmation.”


He said he could not comment on Orozco’s behalf as to why she decided not to pursue the nomination, but that it might be because she plans to graduate at the end of the fall semester.

2009-06-28,USF,study,"Playing for a Tampa Bay area football team is nothing new for former USF defensive end Jarriett Buie, who signed with the Tampa Bay Bucaneers off-season program May 4.


Since then, he’s spent his days in the weight room, watching films and learning what it takes to be a pro.


Buie, who joined the Bucs after impressing at their rookie minicamp, wakes up every morning at 6 to get ready for the day. He shares a hotel room with another Big East rookie hopeful, Rashaad Duncan, a former University of Pittsburgh defensive tackle.


“I give Rashaad a hard time since we are rivals, but we get along well,” Buie said.


After the wakeup call, Buie and his teammates take a bus across the street to the Bucs’ practice facility. A buffet-style breakfast is served before the morning workouts, which begin at 9 a.m. and last until noon.


“They have everything you would ever want to eat,” Buie said. “A lot of it is filled with protein, but I’m big on the Cheerios.”


Buie said the team has spent a lot of time in the weight room and going through drills in preparation for training camp, which begins July 25 in Lake Buena Vista.


Hitting the weights is a familiar routine for Buie, as he benched 225 pounds 32 times at the NFL rookie combine in late February.


Much of Buie’s time is spent studying in the team’s film room. He said he hopes to replicate techniques in practice to impress Buccaneers defensive coordinator Jim Bates.


“(Bates) is an old-school coach and a great guy to learn under,” he said. “He is always available and wants to have a personal relationship with all of his players.”


The 6-foot-4, 250-pound Buie started his football career at Seffner’s Armwood High School, just a few miles from USF. He was the second Buie to play for the illustrious
football program, following in the footsteps of his older brother, Chris, who played
linebacker at Virginia Tech for four seasons.


At Armwood, Buie was named Hillsborough County’s Defensive Player of the Year as a senior and helped lead the program to the 4A Florida state title in 2003 under coach Sean Callahan.


Callahan said the structure of the Armwood football program helped Buie’s development as a player and a person.


“He worked very hard and always wanted to help out his family and mother,” Callahan said.

2009-06-29,USF,study,"University Police (UP) will be able to pull over drivers for not wearing their seat belt – without having to observe any other violation – starting Tuesday.


The Dori Slosberg and Katie Marchetti Safety Belt Law, signed by Gov. Charlie Crist on May 6, allows seat belt violations to be primary offenses.


Prior to the bill, the law allowed officers to cite drivers only if the motorists had been stopped for another violation, such as speeding.


According to the bill, the provision will be a non-moving violation and violators will be subject to a $30 fine. With additional fees and court costs, the total for breaking the law could be anywhere from $68.50 to $89.50.


“We are concerned about keeping our public safe,” said UP spokeswoman Meg Ross. “This is another tool to help keep our students safe.”


The new law was named after the daughter of Florida Representative Irv Slosberg and a Durant High School student, whose families have pushed for stricter seat belt legislation since the deaths of their children in automobile accidents.


Edward Mierzejewski, who directs the USF Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR), said that before legislators passed the law, Florida had not conformed to federal government encouragement to have a primary seat belt law.


Because of this, the state had given up millions of dollars in federal highway money, he said.


According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the seat belt law makes Florida eligible to receive a $35.5-million grant from a federal safety belt incentive program.


Mierzejewski said the law was not passed previously because lawmakers and rural leaders thought the tougher seat belt policy was an intrusion of government.


Daniel Bergin, a senior electrical engineering major, said he agrees that the ruling is an infringement of government.


He said the seat belt law infringes on personal rights and is an example of the state using its power to control people’s lives.


“I think if someone wants to look out for their own safety, they will put on a seat belt,” Bergin said. “They don’t need someone to breathe down their back and tell them to do it or they’re going to get a fine. I see how it has some safety applications, but I don’t think the police need to be getting into personal safety matters.”


However, Mierzejewski said he wonders how people can argue against having a seat belt law. He said he picks up a newspaper every day and sees how the people who survive car accidents are the ones who are wearing their seat belts.


“I can’t imagine getting into a car and not putting my seat belt on,” Mierzejewski said. “It just blows me away that it takes a law to get people to do that.”


Anna-Maria Deloucas, a junior psychology major, said her parents encouraged her to wear a seat belt so often that she puts it on unconsciously every time she gets in a car.


“At this point, I feel uncomfortable not wearing it,” she said.


Additional statute changes include exemptions for vehicles not required to be equipped with seat belts and deletion of the exemption for pickup truck passengers.


According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, if every state with a secondary seat belt law upgraded to primary-level enforcement, states could save about 1,000 lives and more than $4 billion each year.

2009-07-01,USF,study,"Amazon is now in the process of testing a Kindle prototype that will be adequately equipped for textbooks.


For those who don’t know, a Kindle is a hand-held digital reading device created by Amazon. It is designed to be lightweight, portable and read like a book. The screen is intended to simulate paper, so it is not too hard on your eyes, and it has minor Wi-Fi capability so you can buy a book off of Amazon and have it delivered to your Kindle in seconds.


This nifty little contraption is getting a bit of a face-lift to be effective and useful with textbooks. The screen will be enlarged, and more advanced Wi-Fi technology will
be included. Users will be able to take notes on their books with the Kindle as well. Most importantly, books bought for a Kindle will be significantly cheaper than their physical counterparts.


The Kindle is not just going to be easy on our backs and pocketbooks but on the
environment as well. College students purchase about “a tree per year” in textbooks, according to the Green Press Initiative. Over the past three years, the nation’s book publishing industry consumed an average of 20 million trees per year – and that’s only accounting for books printed in the U.S.


If colleges make the transition to the Kindle, or any electronic form of textbook for that
matter, it would be a logical and essential step in maintaining the viability of our planet.


Admittedly, there is something to be said for holding a book in your hands. I am one of the first to feel a pang of regret with the realization we will, undoubtedly, stop printing books in the not-so-distant future. But when it comes to textbooks, that pang of regret is quieted when I realize buying several textbooks I will probably never read again is killing trees.


Those who are not quite ready for the eBook revolution shouldn’t stand up in arms yet, however. There are still some large kinks to be worked out before this device, or a similar one, can become mainstream and accepted on college campuses.


Some campuses looking to make the switch are hearing complaints about a high degree of usage difficulty. Students have reported that it’s harder to take notes, find your place while in class and generally make your way through the book.


Forty percent of students at Northwest Missouri State University, which has tested the device extensively in a pilot program, said they studied less because of the difficulty of using the devices, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.


And certain subjects are a more feasible fit for the device then others. An English or
history textbook can be adapted very easily to a hand-held device, but something like a calculus book or a colorful science book is a much different story.


Here’s to hoping the new Kindle will alleviate some of these problems.


The bigger screen will make the books easier to take notes on, and the Internet access will be a huge draw for overly interconnected college students.


Regardless of your feelings about saving books or the environment, you must admit the future of textbooks is inevitably upon us. Something that is sleek, portable and allows us to carry an entire library of books around with us daily will certainly catch on soon enough.


After all, it didn’t take much for us to be convinced that we needed our entire music library attached to our hips at every moment of the day. I hope that we will soon feel the same way about our book library.

2009-07-02,USF,study,"Despite the unemployment rate reaching nearly 10 percent, some students are certain their college degrees are still worth pursuing.


The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a 9.4 percent unemployment rate last month, and many recent graduates are taking lower-paying jobs in less desirable places instead of going unemployed.


Drema Howard, director of the Career Center, said many of those graduates will likely take higher paying jobs down the road.


According to the 2008 Current Population Survey (CPS), college graduates are earning more than those who drop out. Last year, 54 percent of college graduates earned more than those who attended college but did not graduate.


That’s one reason why Marc Vincent, who graduated last spring with a degree in
biomedical science, chose to attend college.


“The income level of people that don’t go to school is not the level I want to be at, and a degree is just a stepping stone to a higher level,” he said.


Last year, workers with a bachelor’s degree earned an average of $26,000 more than those without a degree, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.


The higher the degree earned, the higher they were paid – while bachelor’s degree
holders earned an average of about $978 per week, master’s degree holders earned an average of about $1,228 per week, according to the CPS. Professional degree holders and doctoral degree holders both earned averages of more than $1,500 per week.


Though statistics show college graduates earn more, Howard said students need to remember that college is about more than just receiving a diploma.


“Having a degree is just the first step,” she said. “It’s a different work world now, and it’s important that students gain career-related experience.”


While a degree is a helpful tool in one’s career search, conducting the search is just as important, Howard said.


“Students need to understand that getting out there and talking to people and getting a foot in the door is just as important as having a degree,” she said. “We try to teach students to be effective job seekers.”


Howard said traveling, gaining career-related experience and creating social associations are key complementary components to a degree.


“It’s a global world. People who travel have a wider perspective,” she said.


Julia Virgilio, a senior majoring in special education, said she thought about dropping out of school but didn’t want to jeopardize her career by doing so.


“In most fields, you need a degree,” she said. “It’s a deciding factor.”


Gracie Smith, a junior majoring in education, said she would get a degree even if she knew she would be in debtforever.


“Money is temporary, but my education is not,” she said.

2009-07-05,USF,study,"Last week, USF football coach Jim Leavitt’s salary pool for assistant coaches increased by $100,000 to a total of $1.35 million. The increase is a condition of his seven-year contract, signed in March 2008, and the pool will continue to increase by $100,000 every year for four seasons regardless of Leavitt’s performance.


All of USF’s assistant coaches received some level of pay raise.


In addition to annual pay raises, Leavitt’s contract also includes incentives, such as $75,000 for playing in a BCS bowl and $100,000 for winning the Big East. He’s hasn’t done either of those.


With huge state budget cuts to higher education this year, giving such raises is bad publicity. While USF offered Leavitt and his assistants raises to keep them from going to other schools, raises should have been solely incentive-based rather than having a mandatory component.


As the coaches’ salaries increase, they will take a bigger chunk of USF Athletics’ budget. USF Assistant Athletic Director Chris Freet said the raises came solely from revenue such as contracts with sponsors rather than from limited state-allocated funds.


However, all of the money arguably comes from the same pot. State funds will have to be used to make up for the $100,000 loss in annual revenue. Unless the football team does remarkably well this season, revenue is unlikely to increase and may decrease in response to the poor economy. These unnecessary raises will only hurt USF Athletics.


Because Leavitt received such a large contract, mandatory raises were not necessary. When Leavitt signed the $12.6 million contract, he became the highest-paid coach in the Big East, and his contract represented a 70-percent pay raise over five seasons.


Leavitt and his coaches have not earned these raises. They haven’t taken the Bulls to a major BCS game and have never won a Big East title. While the Bulls have been to four consecutive bowls, they only won two, including the inaugural MagicJack St. Petersburg Bowl last year, a very low-budget bowl.


While Leavitt received an automatic raise, UF football coach Urban Meyer may not receive a raise this year, Florida Today reported. UF officials feel that he’s earned a raise, but they’re worried it will hurt their budget. The fact that they are even considering not giving Meyer a raise when he has led the Gators to win their second BCS national championship game in three years last year demonstrates that Leavitt is definitely not worthy of his pay increase.


Incentive-based pay should have been the only means for Leavitt and his coaches to raise their salaries. He is not worth the high price USF is paying, and because of his generous contract, the price will only go up.

2009-07-08,USF,study,"When USF graduate Michael Voisard attempted to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the lengthy process dissuaded him from using it as a way to pay for school.


In an attempt to prevent that from happening to other students, the Department of Education (DOE) announced plans June 24 to simplify the FAFSA, the application used for all federal and state student loans.


Voisard said he tried to fill out the FAFSA, but the process was so “laborious” he never finished filing.


“I didn’t have access to the information they were asking for,” he said. “Taxes are the most confusing part for me. I hate filling out taxes.”


Voisard said being able to retrieve the needed tax information easily online would help push him to file the FAFSA.


In the simplified version, students will have the option to grant the DOE permission to retrieve tax information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), said Billie Jo Hamilton, USF director of Financial Aid.


Students will still have the option to fill out tax information on their own.


Ashlea Archer, a senior majoring in pre-med, said she has her mom fill out the FAFSA because it’s so “overwhelming.”


“I know people that are very intimidated by the FAFSA,” she said. “It takes them days to fill it out, because they don’t know what they’re doing.”


Hamilton said changes to the FAFSA still have to be approved by Congress. If approved, they could go into effect as early as 2010-11.


“The Secretary of Education (Arne Duncan) is proposing a ‘marriage’ between the DOE and the IRS,” Hamilton said. “As a result of that union, we’ll be able to simplify (FAFSA)
filing for families.”


The required tax information will also change. Hamilton said the FAFSA will be based on taxes from the government, and students will no longer be asked to provide asset
information.


“Right now, (FAFSA) is based on taxes, savings, checking and businesses,” she said. “Now, it will be based on income – period.”


This change could let people who have large amounts of assets qualify, Hamilton said.


“Some people who never would have qualified under the old FAFSA form may get aid,” she said.


A small percentage of students fall into the category of having very low income but significant assets, Hamilton said.


“So 1 to 2 percent of (students) will get money that shouldn’t,” she said.


If a family has a drop in income, then Financial Aid has the power to re-evaluate the student’s income information, Hamilton said.


Such students will need to file a “change of circumstance” form, and Financial Aid will make adjustments according to the new projected family income, she said.


Other plans for simplifying the FAFSA include a shorter and simpler online application, and the elimination of some questions.


The simplified version will have 22 fewer questions – a 28 percent reduction,
according to a DOE statement. Also, some questions that are irrelevant to particular students may be skipped.


Questions concerning a student’s dependency and demographics will remain,
Hamilton said.


During the 2007-08 school year, 76 percent of USF students were on some type of financial aid, Hamilton said in an e-mail to the Oracle. Those students received more than $289 million in financial aid.


Hamilton said the simplification of the FAFSA will save students, families and Financial Aid a lot of work.


“We don’t know how many (students) didn’t get here because they hit that stumbling block of filling out the FAFSA,” she said.

2009-07-09,USF,study,"July 1 marked the end of the College-Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) for Florida colleges and universities. The Legislature has effectively dropped the T from the abbreviation, USF Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies Glen Besterfield said, removing the test as an option for students to satisfy the College-Level Academic Skills (CLAS) requirements.


In order to earn an AA degree, students must meet CLAS requirements by either scoring a 500 on the verbal and math portions of the SAT or earning a 2.5 GPA in two required math and English courses.


Though the CLAST has been dropped as a third option, the Board of Governors has already replaced it with the College Entry-Level Placement Test (CPT). It’s a temporary solution, but Besterfield said he believes it will become a long-term one.


The Legislature has essentially done nothing but replace one test with another. Even if the CPT does not become a permanent CLAS requirement, some kind of test will be the likely successor to the CLAST. The state hasn’t given universities more freedom, it has given them more work by forcing them to find a test equivalent to the old.


The CPT is no better at determining whether a college student is worthy of an AA degree than the CLAST. Both tests have sections on reading, language skills and mathematics, but the CLAST has an essay portion, making the CPT an arguably easier test to pass.


While the CPT may be a challenge for students enrolled in community colleges, getting accepted to four-year state universities may be harder than passing the test.


According to state data, the CPT pass rate at universities like USF is usually 90 percent or better. Also, the CLAST was designed as an assessment of whether students had learned what was needed to earn an AA degree, while students must take the CPT before they can even start some courses.


Many USF students have the skills needed to pass the CPT before they even start their degree.


Because the CLAST was state-funded, eliminating it may be seen as an attempt to cut costs. But though the CPT was already in place, now that it can be used to meet CLAS
requirements, more students will be taking it. Rather than cutting costs, the Legislature will likely just be shifting funds from one test to the other.


The state’s decision has changed little, created more work for Florida’s colleges and universities, and possibly represents a reduction in educational standards.

2009-07-12,USF,study,"Fans of Wet Hot American Summer, Stella, The State and strange humor can turn their channels to Comedy Central on Wednesday for a new show starring Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter.


The two, who acted together in Wet Hot American Summer, star in Michael & Michael Have Issues, a sketch comedy show about a sketch comedy show. At times, the logistics of a show-within-a-show confuse even Showalter.


“It would be weird to be making a scene about making the scene that we were making,” he said in a press conference call.


Though the show has a narrative structure, Showalter said it’s like a sitcom: each episode has a story line, and the characters are the same from week-to-week – there’s no need to watch the first episode to understand later ones.


Showalter said he met Issues co-star Black back in “the 20th century” on The State, a mid-’90s sketch comedy show on MTV. Showalter said he didn’t set out to be a comedian – in fact, he studied semiotics at Brown University. He said the degree helps his writing.


“It’s a very analytical thing to major in, and it has a lot to do with analyzing the structure of things,” he said. “I’m very interested in structure and formulas and the way things work.”


Showalter, who lives in Brooklyn, said he finds the area stimulating for his writing.


“I love it. It’s where I live – it’s my home. It’s beautiful, it’s quiet, it’s a great place to have a small one-bedroom apartment,” he said. “It’s got the Brooklyn Bridge, it’s got the botanical gardens. The Dodgers – the Brooklyn Dodgers – I get to see the Brooklyn Dodgers play baseball every day.”


Yes, the Brooklyn Dodgers disbanded in the mid-’50s – this is simply Showalter’s style of humor.


But Showalter also has a simpler side. For one, he likes the comic strip Peanuts, specifically the character Snoopy.


“He’s funny. He’s cute. He’s a cartoon. His name is Snoopy. He’s a dog. Did I already say he’s a dog? He’s a dog,” Showalter said.


Though he doesn’t have plans to draw a comic strip, Showalter said he is serious about doodles. He likes to doodle – he said he’d try to compile his doodling in a book if only he didn’t have so many things going on in his life.


People who want to follow the many parts of Showalter’s life can track his Twitter account, “mshowalter.” Showalter uses it to talk about his day-to-day activities. He said he prefers to get in arguments online rather than in-person.


“It’s easier to fight with words than with fists. So I prefer Twitter-fighting to real fighting. But I’ll do it. I’ll throw down if I have to,” he said.


Showalter has advice for college students who want to be comedians, but he said it may involve living in New York City or Los Angeles.


“Just work hard and make friends, and don’t get discouraged too easily because it may take a while. I’ve always felt that if you work hard at something, you’ll succeed,” he said.

2009-07-13,USF,study,"A few weeks ago, the Oracle composed a list of the top 10 USF football players in a two-part series. However, football isn’t the only sport on campus.


This time, we have a top 10 that reaches out to every sport. Here is the first part of the countdown of USF’s 10 most prolific athletes of the 2008-2009 athletic season.


10.

George Selvie, football defensive end
Some might have George Selvie in their top five. And let’s face it, next to Matt Grothe, he’s probably the most popular athlete at USF (deservedly so). But after a ridiculous 2007 season in which he totaled 31.5 tackles for loss (just one shy of the all-time NCAA record) and 14.5 sacks (second in nation), Selvie’s totals dropped to 13.5 and 5.5, respectively. Granted, he was being double teamed and battled injury.


If this list was made after the 2007 season, he’d be No. 1 and it wouldn’t be close. Still, Selvie is the heart and soul of the USF defense and turned down millions of NFL dollars to return for his last college year of eligibility.


9.

Todd Brazeal, baseball first baseman
Redshirt freshman Todd Brazeal was arguably USF’s best hitter last year in an offense that ranked fourth in the Big East. After taking a medical redshirt in 2008, Brazeal burst on to the scene as the Bulls’ full-time first baseman in 2009, hitting .348 (third on team) while driving in 50 (second on team) and scoring 48 times (second on team). Brazeal also led the Bulls with a .467 on-base percentage and was named to the All-Big East third team. Brazeal got it done in the field, too, ranking third on the team in fielding percentage (.984).


8.

Jordan Seabrook, soccer forward
Jordan Seabrook’s impressive USF career (he led the Big East in goals as a freshman) couldn’t have ended on a better note as the USF soccer team won its first Big East championship ever.


The speedy wingman ranked fifth in the Big East in points scored (18), eighth in goals (6), and fourth in assists while leading his team in each category. Seabrook was drafted in the fourth round by the Colorado Rapids in January’s Major League Soccer draft.


7.

Lucas Jovita, men’s tennis No. 1
Like the men’s soccer team, the USF men’s tennis team won its first Big East title last year and Lucas Jovita was a main reason why. At the No. 1 position, Jovita went 22-9 last year, including an unbeaten run in the Big East tournament. Jovita entered the spring season ranked No. 27 in the nation, and he and teammate Thomas Estrada were ranked as high as 15 in doubles. Jovita was also an All-Big East selection for the second consecutive season.


6.

Matt Grothe, football quarterback
This pick was a struggle. If it were a popularity contest, Grothe would be No. 1 by a landslide. It isn’t, however, and Grothe just misses the top 5.


That being said, Grothe is still one of the most dynamic playmakers in the Big East. Last season, Grothe led the Big East in total offense (269.4 yds per game) and ranked 21 nationally. The dual-threat quarterback also ran for a team-best 591 yards, becoming the second player in Big East history to reach the 10,000 mark, trailing Pat White. Grothe also passed for a career-high 18 TDs last year.

2009-07-15,USF,study,"The movie My Sister’s Keeper has re-introduced the concept of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to the public’s attention. In the film, the parents of a child diagnosed with leukemia conceive another child through in vitro fertilization (IVF). The second child was born to provide healthy blood and bone marrow for the sick child.


While this procedure should be used in such cases, or to prevent a child from being born with a genetic disease, it should not be used to choose frivolous things like the sex of a baby.


In 1989, the first child conceived from this process was born. Since then, more than 15,000 PGD procedures have been reported, with different parents having reasons for going through with the procedure.


PGD works in conjunction with IVF. Embryos are created outside the womb, then tested for certain genetic diseases. PGD procedures can also determine the sex of a child. The results are usually available within 24 hours. Then, a decision is made about the embryo.


If the embryo is disease-free, it is implanted in the woman’s uterus and the pregnancy continues as normal. In cases where a disease is found in the embryo, it does not get implanted and is thrown out.


The purpose of this procedure was originally to eliminate the risk of bearing a child with certain diseases. Families with high risks of genetic diseases can choose this almost
$20,000 procedure to reduce chances of their child being born with an illness.


Couples are beginning to use this procedure for other purposes. PGD also allows couples to choose the sex of their baby.


Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, a fertility doctor specializing in PGD, said to 60 Minutes that when the procedure was introduced in the ’90s, it was performed simply to eliminate diseases in the baby. Now, parents with no history of genetic disease are undergoing the procedure. More than 70 percent of the procedures performed in the U.S. are done simply to choose the sex of the child, he said.


Parents should not be able to choose the sex of their baby because it goes against nature. There are 1.01 males for every female in the world, according to the CIA World Factbook, but this could change if people start using this procedure to choose the sex of their child. A woman can choose to have a baby when she is ready, but its sex should not be under her control.


The long-term risks of this procedure could be devastating. If more couples chose to have boys over girls, there would be too many males in the world, which would result in a gender imbalance.


In countries such as China, the preferred sex is male. According to the CIA World Factbook, there are 1.06 males for every female in China – some regions have a 1.3 male-to-female ratio.


If people using PGD chose to have more boys, the world would see a spike in the male population. A global shortage of women could lead to a rise in prostitution, sexual violence against women and forced marriages.


Choosing the sex of a baby is just the beginning of engineering the perfect child. Soon couples might decide to choose the hair color, eye color or other characteristics of
their child.


What happens if, later on, scientists discover a gene for homosexuality? Should people be allowed to extract that gene from the embryo and make their child straight?


The issue of abortion should also be considered when using PGD. The testing usually calls for more than dozen embryos, while only one or two are used. The rest are thrown out. Therefore, human lives are created and then destroyed because they are not of the preferred sex. The conception and abortion, in this case, are both deliberate.


Though I believe abortion is a woman’s choice, embryos should not be deliberately created and destroyed. An abortion is a process that should be used only for unplanned pregnancies, not because someone does not like the sex of their unborn baby.


Parents should love their children no matter what. Children are not consumer goods, so their sex, hair color or sexual orientation should not be left up to the preferences of the parents.

2009-07-16,USF,study,"In the midst of difficult economic times, USF’s season football ticket sales are 8 percent lower than they were July 2008, USF Executive Associate Athletic Director Bill McGillis said.


The athletics department has sold 19,483 nonstudent season ticket packages and reserved 3,214 tickets for trade, staff, spirit squad and operations – a combined total of 22,697.


“We’ve got a beautiful challenge in front of us,” McGillis said. “Last year was a record year for us. We’ve got to keep going on that front.”


USF is banking on a bulked-up home schedule and an ad campaign that’s being launched soon to help it surpass last year’s mark of more than 27,000, McGillis said. Season tickets will be sold until the Bulls’ second home game against Charleston Southern on Sept. 19.


“We’ve got to keep being aggressive and reach out to our people,” he said. “We’ve got to work hard to close the (8 percent) gap.”


The Bulls host two I-AA team this year in Charleston Southern and Wofford, as well as Cincinnati, West Virginia and Miami.


McGillis said 12,501 tickets are being reserved for student season ticket sales, which should make up the largest student section in the Big East again next year.


“As we get closer to the season and people start realizing that you’ve got Miami on the schedule at home – you’ve got West Virginia at home – I think sales will perk up even more,” he said.


USF women named to Canada national team


USF sophomore Gina Pacheco and redshirt freshman Bahar Sansar earned one of their sport’s highest honors Wednesday, when they were selected to their home country’s national soccer team.


Both Pacheco and Sansar were chosen for the 24-player squad, which will participate in Canada’s exhibition matches against USA on July 19 and July 22. Both have played on Canada’s U-20 team, but this is their first call to the full national team.

Selvie wins fraternity honor


USF senior defensive end George Selvie won the Emmitt Smith Athletic Achievement Award last week at the Phi Beta Sigma international bi-annual awards conference in New Orleans.


Named after one of the top NFL football players of all time, the award is given to a student-athlete who is a member of a fraternity and demonstrates athletic
achievement and academic success. It is only awarded to Phi Beta Sigma members.
